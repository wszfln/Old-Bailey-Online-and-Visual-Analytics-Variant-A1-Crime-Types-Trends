I was serving two customers: I saw her pop it under her left arm. I ran round the counter, and overtook her in Primrose-street, and took her by the shoulder; she took and threw the cloak on the ground, and begged to be let go. Mr. Fountain, an officer, was near, to whom I gave her in charge. (Produced in court and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Fountain. I am a constable, I was about 60 yards distance when the prosecutor laid hold of the prisoner. I saw the cloak fall to the ground. He called to me, and gave me charge of her. She said she found the cloak at his door: she said the same before the justice.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me on the 13th of last month, where I live, in Hungerford market, and desired me to carry some bottles for him: he sent me down, and said there were three prittle baskets, the farthest of them was his. He did not go quite to them, I went and took them up; Mr. Hounsworth helped me up with them. I went to the prisoner, he led me through Church court and Round court, and into Southampton-street, where I had a fall with them, and several were broke; he swore at me and helped me up with them. I carried them to a pitching-place at the corner of White Horse lane, there he gave me three-pence, and I left him and them together.</p>

            . I am one of Mr. Watts's porters. There was a prittle basket with six dozen bottles of our master's lost from Black-lion stairs; I came with them there in the boat, so did the prisoner: they were missing about 3 in the afternoon on the 13th of November; while I went with some to Albemarle-street, they were taken away from the landing place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any one in the care of them?</p>
               <p>Grant. No, I did not, it is not usual so to do. Mr. Hounsworth told me a porter that lives in Hungerford market, had carried them away; we went and found Wilkins, who went with us, and we found the prittle and these bottles at Mr. Hoy's (here produced) I know the basket to be the property of our master, and the bottles also, there being none like them made nay where else in London.</p>

We went to her and awaked her; I' desired her to unlock her box which was in the kitchen; she did. The first thing I found was the piece of wrapping callicoe, then two pieces of Irish linen, with my shop mark upon them; then we desired her to unlock her trunk; in that we found a remnant of long lawn, with our mark upon it.

On the 6th of November, in the morning, my servants told me there were five silver spoons missing, and they had a suspicion of the prisoner, who had been backwards and forwards in the house for some days to see the servants. She happened at that time to be in the kitchen. I ordered her and all the servants up, and made a very strict examination, and at last the prisoner told me she had taken and pawned them in Wych-street with one Mr. Fryer. I went to Sir John Fielding, and he sent for Mr. Fryer to bring the spoons there he had pledged with him in her name. He came and brought them (produced in court) These are my property, here are the initial letters of my name on them. The prisoner is a young girl, but I fear she is got among bad people.</p>

The door between the parlour and shop was open; the shop door to the street was shut; the window-shutters were not up; I heard nothing of the window break, the coaches making such a noise. I went into the shop to serve a customer, and there saw the outside sash was broke; this was just after the shop window-shutters were shut up, by a porter that shuts up several of the neighbours windows; he had not observed the broken glass. I looked and missed three paste shoe buckles and eleven breast buckles.</p>

             at the play-houses lighting of links, and Rich used to be there every night with him. On the 18th of October at night, I was with them. I met Shields at the top of Fleet-market, about two o'clock that afternoon, along with another lad. We went down upon the keys in Thames-street, and staid till four in the afternoon; then we came to the Fleet-market again: there one of the boys broke a window, and a man took him and put him in Bridewell. Then we went to the Strand, and there met Rich about six o'clock. Then we went to the prosecutor's window. Shields broke it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any intent upon that particular window before?</p>
               <p>Brown. Shields told me about four that afternoon, he knew of a very good place where we might get some silver breast-buckles, and we told Rich of it when we met him. Shields broke a little bit of the window with a knife: then he pushed the glass in with his hand. He had a wire, with which he hooked out five breast-buckles. We went a little way. He gave Rich one: then Shields and I went back again, and got six more, and a pair of silver shoe-buckles and an odd one. Then we went to St. Giles's. I do not know where Rich went. Shields gave the buckles to a girl to put by for him all night. He broke the stones out of the odd shoe-buckle against a post that had iron upon it, and sold the silver for old silver to a silversmith near Leicester-fields for 1 s. He went to bed with that girl, and I went and lay on a bulk by Whitehall: and the next morning I went, as we had appointed, to him. He was in bed with the girl, in the Coal-yard, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the girl's name?</p>
               <p>Brown. I do not know. She gave him the buckles again in the bag, which he had delivered them in to her: then we met an old cloaths woman in Drury-lane. We shewed her the buckles. She said she would give 6 s. for them. She went towards Justice Fielding's, and we did not chuse to follow her. Then we went into Eagle-court to

No, said Shields, never mind that; they are not stolen: you shall have them for 5 s. so she gave 5 s. for them. She was a little in liquor. When I went to take some of them out of the window, Shields said, Stand away with your clumsy hands, you can do nothing. Shields desired a young woman that was with her to go and pawn some breast-buckles, and she pawned three breast-buckles for 7 s. and he gave me 3 s. 6 d. of the money. We bought some ham and bread with the other shilling which we had of the silver-smith. I did not see him afterwards till before Sir

I had got about half way up the lane, when Wilkins came from the left-hand side with a cutlass in his hand, and laid hold of my mare. He was on foot. He held his cutlass up. There were two other men with him. With a good many oaths, they said, Stop, stop; your money, your watch. They were on each side of me: they laid hold of my knees. I saw two cutlasses, and a large horse pistol: he with the pistol is not taken. Scott asked me for any watch: I said I had never a one. I pulled out my money: it was loose, between 9 and 10 l. there were eight guineas and a half, and the rest in silver. I said, There are near ten guineas. Scott weighed it in his hand, and put it in his pocket: he almost pulled my shirt out of my breeches, to see for a watch. I said, for God's sake, gentlemen, do not destroy me; I have no watch: then he pulled my glove off, and took my ring, a gold ring, with a cornelian stone: then he took one buckle out of my shoe, and spoke to Wilkins, who was on the other side, and said they were silver; then Wilkins took the other. Scott had got at one of my spurs: I said, they are only plated; then he did not take it. They went to take my knee-buckles; they could not get them out. Scott said, see whether he has got ever a pocket-book. Wilkins felt in my pocket; it lay pretty low: he took it out with both hands from my breast-pocket, and tore all the lining, and almost pulled me from my mare. Then he said, D - n him, let him go. There were a note for 20 l. another 8 guineas, another 6 l. made payable to me or order. Neither pocketbook nor notes have been seen since. They took my whip from me, and ran down the road towards Fig-lane. There was a little cart coming caused them to go so soon, I imagine. I have seen the two prisoners since at New-Prison and the Gatehouse. I know them both: I had seen their persons before. I had seen Wilkins about Covent-Garden with the chairmen. That night I went to Sir

We went up to Hampstead, but could not meet with them: this was on a Monday night, and the prisoners were taken on the Friday following. I went to see Wilkins in New-Prison, and said, You used me very ill; you might have robbed me without using me so ill. I saw Scott in the Gatehouse the Sunday following. I knew them, and observed they knew me directly. When before Sir

            , Wilkins told me where he had pawned the ring. Scott would say but very little, without Sir John would give him his oath. Wilkins said he should be hanged, and owned to every thing, to the very pieces of money he had taken from me. He said in New-Prison, Master, I know I shall be cropt. He was bragging what money they had got, and how they spent it in Covent-Garden among the boys, as he called them. He said, Master, I was the first that ran up to you with the cutlass: I said, I know you was. He mentioned three or four people that were along with him, and told me he would help me to my pocket-book: he said there were 8 s. in silver, besides 8 guineas and a half. When I asked him for my pocket-book, he said, Master, if you'll serve me, I'll serve you: let me see you another time, and I will let you have your pocket-book; it is safe enough: he sent me to Mr. Monk's, in Russel-street, where I found my ring; this he did when I was at the Brown Bear. Sir John asked him what he had done with my whip; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110007"/> he had flung it over the hedge, near Marybone: he said the buckles were sold; and then he said they examined the book, and they said, D - n it, it should tell no tales, and then threw it and notes and all into the fire together. I mentioned the book to Scott in the Gatehouse, and he owned it was burnt, and notes with it; and he owned to the pieces of money, just as Wilkins had done, and that he took one buckle out of my shoe, and my ring off (the ring produced and deposed to).</p>

               <p>Timperall. I am a silver-smith, and live in Russel-court. I think I bought them on the Tuesday night after the robbery. I heard him own that he sold them to me, before Sir John, and mentioned the pieces of money I gave him for them, which were a five and-threepenny-piece, 1 s. and 3 d. in halfpence; that was at the rate of 5 s. an ounce (the buckles produced and deposed to).</p>

On the 25th or 26th of Novemb. between 7 and nine in the evening, I had occasion to come through Catherine-court; there I saw Wilkins dressed in a sailor's jacket and trousers, he asked several people to go into an alehouse, and said he would treat them; after that he came out, and went away; and in less than a quarter of an hour he came back again, dressed in a blue surtout coat, with a hanger by his side: he drew it out, and flourished it about in the court 3 or 4 times. He talked to several people, but what he said I do not know. After seeing some advertisements about this robbery, I gave information of this to Sir John, and went in quest of him with some of Sir John's people; and on the Friday morning we apprehended him in a court that turns out of Cross-lane up into Holbourn. He seemed at first as if he knew nothing of the matter: at last he was in tears and said he would own every thing, when we came to take him to New-Prison: then he desired us to send for Mr. Dennis. He said, going along, he knew he was a dying man; and when he came into this court, he would plead guilty. We had apprehended some suspicious people, and one of them said he knew something of Scott; so we went and took him (this was before we took Wilkins): we took him in Catherine-court, up two or three pair of stairs: he informed us where Wilkins lodged: Scott mentioned him,

I asked him where he was going, he said he would go and take his leave of his father; Wooley was with us, he saw a gentleman coming, he said we will cross out of the road, for this is dirty; he jumped up to the horse and clapt a pistol to the man's breast, and swore he would blow our brains out if we did not stand along with him.

I came and found the prisoner in the shop; my man told me the prisoner asked him if he wanted any saw-dust, as he was sweeping the shop, he told him he might fetch some if he would; and when he came up, he looked a little bulky; my man asked him if he had not got something: he said he had not; my man looked under his apron, and saw something bulge out in his pocket, and took out one of these pieces of soap; and while he was going to take the other piece out, he threw the rest down the stairs, which he took up: this was told me in the presence of the prisoner. I asked him how he came to take this soap, he said he never stole any before, and begged I would not hurt him, and he would never do so any more. I sent for a constable, and took him before the alderman, before whom he confest he took one piece to wash his hands with, but had not meddled with the other piece.</p>

I left that shop safe on the 4th of October at night, and on the 5th, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning I found it broke open in the back part of it; there were a great quantity of goods taken away; all that are mentioned in the indictment. On the Wednesday following Mr. Bruin, a pawn-broker on Snow-hill, sent for me; I went and found the prisoner and two pieces of gauze, but cannot take upon me to sware to them; but recollecting a woman had made some things for me of that gauze, we sent for her, she knew it to be my gauze. The prisoner said she bought the gauze in Rag-fair; we took her before the sitting Alderman, he gave me a warrant to search her house. We found a housewife upon the table, with some of my lace, and two pieces of ribbon, which were my property, also several lappets made of gauze, and several remnants of lace which I can swear to. In a box we found one cap, under the bed another; in the pocket of a blue coat we found some pieces of lace. Under the dresser one plain gauze flowered bordered handkerchief, one gauze laced mob, one queen's mob, one queen's round cap, and about 5 yards of blue ribbon, 5 yards of black edging was found in the room, and the trimmings of my red cardinal, which I can swear to. (The goods produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.) Mr. Kennet was at the finding the rest. I asked her whose coat that was, in which the piece of lace was, she said it was the man's she lived with. I asked her if it was her husband's, she said no, that she sometimes lived with him, and sometime swent away. There is the mark of a woman's foot on a piece of board, that lay just under the window, where she came into the shop. (Produced in court with a dirty print of a woman's foot upon it. Inspected by the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Kennet. On the 9th of October in the evening, I was sent for to Mr. Bruin's, he described the woman that had brought the gauze. I said I knew her, and mentioned where she lived; I sent for her, (it was the prisoner.) She said she bought the gauze in Rag-fair; I took her in custody on suspicion of being concerned in this robbery. The next day we took her before Sir

I went to the house where she lived, and found part of the things; a poor woman came down and said, O sir, I have found the rest of the things, there was a place broke in the garret, up into a cockloft, a hole was broke through, and it had a communication with the next house; then the woman handed the things through a hole out of a room even with the floor I was in. The things she handed through were a sack of butter, and 2 pieces of blue serge, a red cloak, a small piece of cheque, a great number of caps, a large quantity of other gauze, a little box with caps and ribbons. I took them home, and carried the woman at the bar next day to be examined; there was a man appeared in her behalf, and wanted it to be made up, his name was Wilks, he is a kind of a carpenter, and now he is turned quack-doctor, and was going to open a shop in Chick-lane. I have heard nothing of him since.</p>

I asked him to come to Richmond: he came: Sir Charles directed me to take him and another man that was with him, and tell the gardener I had got two friends to see the hot-house; we went into the garden. The prisoner came with the key of the hot-house, one of the men looked in his face, and said, Young man I have some knowledge of your face, I think I have seen you lately in London? The prisoner said no, you have not; the other said pray was not you in Monmouth-street such a day? first he said no, then the other said he was there on the Monday last, and he bought a thickset frock and waistcoat of him. Upon his being charged with the things, he said he did not take them out of the room, but found them withoutside the gate, on some dung against a tree.</p>

I asked him how he came by them, he said his master that he worked with before he did for Sir Charles, owed him 5 or 6 l. and could not pay him, and he let him have those cloaths in part of pay; and on the Thursday morning I hurt my shoulder, and was not able to work for a week: he said as I could not work, he should be obliged to me if I would go and get half a guinea on the scarlet waistcoat. I carried it, the man said that is not your waistcoat, I said no, but it was a friend's of mine; he lent me a crown on it. The Monday following he desired me to go and sell the frock and waistcoat; I went and offered them to several places at Fulham, then I went to Monmouth-street, and sold them for 24 s.</p>

On the 16th of October, about three in the morning, I happened to be awake; I thought I heard some rumbling noise: I lay still a while and heard it again, I came down gently, and saw a light in the cellar through the crevices. I called the watch, and took care to keep the window close to keep them in; the light was then put out: I found somebody striving to make their escape. The watchmen came and took the prisoner out of the cellar to the watch house. (He produced a dark lanthorn, and an iron wrenching tool;) these were found upon him, he begged to be let go.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods were in the cellar?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. There were candles and tallow, I cannot say any thing besides; the hatch was removed.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the window fastened?</p>
               <p>Whitehead. There was a bolt in the inside, and a wooden slipper on the other, and two nails to keep the bolt from going back; they were bent: there were the marks of the wrenching tool in several places. I am certain when I went to bed the window was fast.</p>

I am a watchman; I and my partner Larimer were called, we found the cellar window about half a yard open: we took the prisoner out of the cellar, and found part of this dark lanthorn in his pocket, and in the watch-house we found the other part of it in his great-coat pocket; we found the wrench upon him: we asked him what business he had in the cellar, he hummed and hawed: we could get nothing out of him.</p>

I had been drinking pretty freely with my acquaintance: I happened to meet with the two prisoners in Whitechapel, between the hours of 10 and 11 at night: they gave me an invitation to go home with them: I went with them to their house in <placeName id="t17651211-16-crimeloc99">Montague-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did she say you had given it her?</p>
               <p>Jefferys. No, she did not; she pretended to know nothing of the matter about her having it. She said she had no such thing in her pocket before it was found. (The constable deposed to the finding the watch on Eyles, and confirmed the account he gave.)</p>

I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of my waistcoat; he said he took it one night when he came from Richmond to my Lady's very wet, and he had put it into his box and had lost the key. On the 28th of November I missed one of my shirts out of the pantry, between the hours of 12 and 1 in the day: I went and enquired after him: he lodged near my Lady's house in the Meuse. I met him in the Strand: I said, Now pray Mr. Whittall, give me my waistcoat, I want it; he said it was in his box; I went with him: he took the key and opened the box, and said the waistcoat is not here, that he had taken it home for me: I asked him who saw him bring it home, he said they all saw him: the next morning I told my Lady what had happened: she said she expected me to pay for the spoons; then I went and got a warrant, and took him up: he was asked by the Justice in what manner he lived; he said his wife supported him: the Justice said, It was a scandal to the breeches to be supported by a wife for three years together: he was taken to the Round-house till the Monday: I went and got an hundred hand-bills printed: I had not been gone above an hour before I found two spoons at Mr. Fleming's, a pawn-broker at the corner of Crane-court (produced and deposed to). As we were carrying him to prison, he owned my waistcoat was at the same place, where I went and found it (produced and deposed to). He told me of the shirt, and I found it accordingly: he owned he took and pledged them.</p>

On the 26th of November, about 6 at night, the prisoner came into my shop, and said he came from 'Squire Allen in Wigmore-street; that the house keeper sent him for some stockings: there were two customers in the shop: I was serving them, and in the mean time he turned about and was going out: I said, I'll go with you directly: he said he was only going to make water at the door; I'll come in again: he did not come in again, and in about three or four minutes I sent my maid to see for him; he was gone: in two days after he came in again with two constables; one of the constables asked me if I had lost any thing; I said, Not as I knew of: I looked at the boy, and knowing him again, said, I believed I had. The boy said, Sir, you have lost three pair of stockings, and a pair of silk mitts, which I stole myself: I went by the constable's desire with them to Justice Welch: the boy would fain have been admitted evidence, but could not, having committed all himself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Christian. The prisoner brought these three pair of stockings and mitts to me, and wanted me to buy them: I stopped him, and carried him and them before Justice Welch (produced and deposed to.)</p>

I seeing the window open, sent the ostler down to look under it; he went down, and brought up the other shirt, and said he found it under the window: I sent for a constable, and he took the prisoner in charge, and has had the things in his possession ever since (produced in court).</p>

About the 5th of November last I had been out, and when I came home I missed two pair of pumps which I had put out at the door for sale. About a fortnight after came a man from Bridewell, and asked me if I had lost two pair of pumps. I went according to his direction to Justice Welch, there I saw the prisoner: he said I should have them again: he ordered two journey men bakers to go and get the pumps from pawn, that lay one pair in the name of

They came back to the Justice, and told the prisoner the pawn-broker would not deliver them to them, they not being the persons that brought them; but if the Justice would send an order, they would send them. An order was sent, and one of the pawn-brokers came with one pair; they were marked to be sold S S, my mark. I do believe them to be mine. The answer they brought from the other pawn-broker was, there were no shoes pawned in such a name: then I went to the pawn-broker, and asked if he had a pair pawned in the name of

On the 14th of November my wife missed a gown, a hat, and two coloured aprons; she asked the prisoner what she had done with them; she said she had pawned them; she was very sorry for what she had done, and believed she was bewitched. I said, if you will go with me, I'll go and take them out, and you shall hear no more of it. I went to the pawn-broker, and took as many things out as came to 7 s. 8 d. she said they were all. I sent her home with them. I staid a little with the pawnbroker. When I came home, she was absconded. After that I missed my prayer book. I met the woman that recommended her, and she together: she ran away, I ran and brought her to my house; then I went to the pawn broker, and said I insisted he should bring her to justice: then he said he had two pair of breeches, my prayer book, a gown, a napkin, and two coloured aprons. I took her before Justice Wright, there she said she was very sorry for what she had done.</p>

I was called up on the 17th a little before 7, and told my cellar window was broke open; I came down and found the bolt and staple were wrenched off; I found the tap-room door between that and the cellar broke open also; I found the tea chest removed from the dresser to the counter, where I serve my liquor, open, and the 5 spoons, strainer and tongs were taken out. My daughter looked round and missed several pair of stockings; I missed halfpence and farthings to the amount, I believe, of 3 or 4 l. but I can safely say there were 50 s. worth missing. I found two burners in the cellar which they had taken from some lamps. I advertised the things on the 18th, and the same evening Mr. Clark came to my house, and asked me what I had lost; I told him, and that the spoons were marked C, R, W. Said he I have got four of the spoons, and had not an opportunity of reading the paper in the morning as usual, so had not stopped the person that brought them, but should know the person if he saw her, and that he had been after her but could not find her, she not living at the place she had told him: he took her on the 20th, and brought her to me; it was the prisoner English. I asked her several questions; she answered me but few: I said tell me how I may come at these persons that have used me in this manner. At last she said he will come about noon to her house. Mr. Clark, Mr. Chapman the headborough, and I, waited the opportunity, and the prisoner, Pritchard, came much about that time; but I having English in my care, I was not at the taking him: he and Hughes were both brought together to me at the Black Horse in George-street, near my house. I asked them several questions; Pritchard told me he was in my house. I desired him to tell me where my tongs and strainer were; he said he could not tell, but

Hughes acknowledged he was in my house with Pritchard, but did not know where the things were sold; before the Justice, he asked them if they were in the house, Pritchard said yes.

The pewter tea pot and two pair of stockings were found at Pritchard's mother's lodgings, (where he also lodges) by my daughter.

I asked her how she came to know the C and W; she said she knew them two letters; then I took her to Mr. White, then she described Pritchard, and said that he was to come to her house about 12; we thought proper to watch till he came.

I came from Carshalton on the 16th of November; it was about 9 o'clock at night when I got to Westminster-bridge. I came all through the city to Tower-hill, to the Victualing-office coffee-house. I staid there, I believe, two hours or better: I was both tired and a dry. After I went away I found myself a little in liquor. I was quite sober when I came there, but I was not any thing incapable.

I believe I staid rather too long. One of them said to me, you seem to be a little in liquor, and I am so too; we had both better leave our watches with the landlord, which we both did. After I had got out of doors, I returned, and asked the landlord to give me my watch again. I thought I should not be that way for some time. Then I went out of the door to go home, as it was very late. The prisoner at the bar came and clasped me round the neck; I dare say I was not six yards from the door, and swore she would give me a kiss; she had got my head backwards. There were several people, men and women, pushing me about; she put her hand into my pocket, and took out the money; there were 15 guineas in my pocket, and I found only two guineas and a 5 s. 3 d. left. I cried out, hold her, I am robbed. I never let go of her; she took 13 guineas out of my pocket, and some silver. I never parted with her, though I was pinched to such a degree, that my arms were black and blue; and I had been several times on my knees, yet I kept hold of her, and delivered her into the hands of the officer.</p>

When I came up I found the prosecutor and prisoner struggling together. The prisoner was trying to get away; at first the man said he had been robb'd, but did not mention the sum; he charged the prisoner; and she charged him. I took them both to the watch-house, and there he charged her with having robb'd him of 13 guineas. She was searched, and only half a guinea found upon her; she said she had not the money herself, but she knew who had; and that if she thought she should have been taken, it should not have been he and another such that should have taken her.</p>

When he gave the constable charge of me, he said I had taken 100 l. and a gold watch; then he said 300 l. and then 2, till the gentlemen at the victualling-office came and advised with him; then he said he had lost 13 guineas. He was in company with a woman in the public house: after the woman was gone, he got tossing up. The landlady said she would appear in my behalf, but she would not come for fear of losing her licence.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you see the prisoner in the public house?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>

            . I went to the watch-house the next morning. I know the prisoner by sight. The prosecutor came there, and said he did not want to hurt her, if she would tell of the woman that had the money. I lent her half a guinea the very morning of the robbery, in order to get a gown and things out of pawn, to prevent her having the anger of her parents. It was a crooked half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get that half guinea?</p>
               <p>Sullivan. I worked for it, and had it of some customer.</p>

Armstrong, that is evidence, held a pistol to my breast, and struck me with it, and threatened to shoot me; I can't say I was the least affrighted; I would give them nothing. They seized and took my watch, and things mentioned, with about 25 shillings in money (mentioning the things by name). They took papers which they sent me again. There were two ladies with me; one of the men left me, and went and robbed them.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you set out?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I think we set out in the afternoon. Smith and I went together to Reynolds's house; from thence we proceeded to Brentford. We generally appointed what place to go to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. We always kept ourselves sober. I had a pistol, Smith bought it; I believe I carried it all the way. Reynolds and Smith had each a stick. The pistol was loaded. We turned up a lane, and crossed two fields and over some stiles. We overtook the gentleman and two ladies; and after we passed them we turned down a lane; we saw a house, we were at a stand whether we should attack the gentleman or not. We all turned back; and I believe I was the first person that laid hold of the gentleman, and Smith I believe was the next. The ladies flew back, and Smith left me and Reynolds, and went to them. The gentleman asked me if I was in a joke: I said I was in earnest, and took his watch from out of his right hand; then I searched his right hand pocket and took his money; Reynolds was taking money out of his other pocket, and he took and cut the pocket out. To the best of my knowledge Reynolds, took the buckles out of his shoes and knees. Smith took the ladies money, in two purses, and both their buckles. I took one sleeve button out of one of the ladies sleeves. I took this handkerchief from Mr. Eaton; and Reynolds took some papers from him, and the knives. After this we ran away. There are some posts. Reynolds staid behind some time; he said Mr. Eaton shook hands with him: he in coming after us did not observe the post; he ran against one and knocked himself down. We crossed the water by Kewgreen, and so came home, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. This is so lately you must remember these circumstances?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. We have had so many of these things, that I cannot remember them to distinguish one from the other. I gave my two associates a shilling for this handkerchief; the watch was sold to a gentleman at Charing-cross; I saw Smith sell it: I was about near the door. This knife here produced was found in Reynolds's pocket when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110020"/> taken; the other knife Smith has. The shoe buckles were sold, but I do not know by whom, nor where. The papers were returned by a letter which Smith wrote. I went and surrendered myself last Monday to Sir

Mr. Marsden, I, and another, went with him to Great George-street; the accomplice told us he was to meet Reynolds there, and that the best way would be to send for him to a public house, and not to go to his house, as he had fire arms loaded; so he sent the waiter at the King's-Head for Reynolds; he came, and we seized him, and took this knife out of his pocket, (producing one.)</p>

Sometimes I used to lie at my place, and sometimes at home with my wife, near Holborn-bridge.

Then she asked me what I would give her, I said, if that is all you have to say, I have done with you. There was a door to the court; she put to the door. While I was struggling to get out, I felt her hand at my breeches pocket. I had four guineas and a half in that pocket, which she took out; I struggled to get it from her. She held her hand up, and the other woman stood at the door, and as it was half open she gave the money to the other; I heard it chink. The other ran away. The prisoner beat and abused me, and swore she would stick me if I offered to say any thing. She held me till the other was out of sight; then she let me go out of the court. Then I called for help, and a gentleman came and we took her to the watchouse, and before Justice Welch the next day, and she was committed.</p>

As I was going to take the bar, up came a man and took my hat off and ran away with it. I and two men pursued and took him. He wanted to go through the George-inn-yard on Snow-hill, and the gate was shut, so he ran down to the Fox and Knot; there being no way through he came back, and we laid hold of him (it was the prisoner), and took him to the Compter. I observed he was a tall man in soldier's cloaths (such was the prisoner); he never was out of my sight, only at going under the gateway.</p>

               <p>Mr. Austin. I am a gangsman: on the 18th of November, between the hours of 2 and 3, I called who would work. The prisoner was standing on the quays; he ran towards me with other people; most of them wore tickets. I said, the tickets would work before the others. About 15 minutes after I saw him in our half story; he stooped and picked up something; he had his trowsers under his arm. I said, what have you got here? I felt and found sugar in them. I took him to the Cock and Anchor to the rest of our people, and examined his trowsers, and found about twenty pounds of sugar in them (produced in court). Then he said he took it from a hogshead: I found the head of it was broke in.</p>

               <p>Mr. Davidson. I am a pawn-broker, and live by London-wall; the lad at the bar was brought up in our ward school: I knew he could not come honestly by the buckle, which he brought to my house the 5th of November to be valued. I was not at home, but my young man stopped it, and gave me an account that the prisoner brought it. On the Wednesday morning the prisoner came again, and said to me, as he did not offer it to pledge or sell, I had no right to stop it. I said, tell me how you came by it; I know you must have stole it, as he had told my young man that a jeweller had offered him 15 s. for it. He said a young woman gave it him upon her death-bed in Holborn. I said that would not do for me: where do you live? He said he lived at 'Squire Grant's in Long-acre. I desired his mother would come to satisfy me it was his own: he said she could not come till Sunday. She not coming, I advertised it on the Thursday. I sent, and could find no such person as 'Squire Grant in Long-acre. On the Wednesday in the afternoon the prisoner came with a gentleman, which I suppose was sent by one Lewis an attorney, to make a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110022"/> legal demand of it. I did not deliver it; and on the Wednesday following a shabby sort of a fellow brought a writ, and served me with it, in the name of

I asked the man where this attorney lived; he said in New Ormand-street; that his name was Lewis: I went to him, he told me that Atkins was recommended to him by one Yates, clerk to a register-office, near Temple-bar. Lewis went there with me; Yates said it is the young gentleman's own buckle. Said Lewis, if you do not give him 7 or 8 guineas for the buckle, the writ is returnable on the Friday; said Yates, I can prove it to be the young man's own property: said I, do you know where he lives; he said he lived at the land fish-carriage-office in Long-acre, and that the young gentleman should not make it up; you have used him very ill. I went to Long-acre, and found Mr. Edwards; I asked if such a person lived with him; he said he went away on the Sunday, and he did not know where he was; then I shewed him that buckle; he said it was his buckle. We then went to Yates, who showed Mr. Edwards the diamond ring. Mr. Edwards said that was his property: Yates said he had lent the prisoner a guinea on it. We took the prisoner, and charged a constable with him, and brought him to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be so very officious in this affair?</p>
               <p>Yates. The boy came to me, and said he had been at London-wall to Mr. Davidson's, a pawnbroker, and said he had stopt a buckle that he had used to wear in his shirt; and that this he had done, because he owed the boy a spite when he was an apprentice. I said, did you offer to pawn it; he said no; but he had been there before to redeem a watch, and he only went then to ask the value of the buckle. The boy said the buckle was given him by a young woman (a cousin) that lived in Holborn, and that she was a milliner, and lived in credit; but he said, he could not prove by any body that she gave it him. I said, do you go to Mr. Davidson's, and I will tell him it is your property, and he will deliver it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Yates. I have known him eleven months, he always behaved with a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot be justified in giving yourself these airs with Mr. Davidson. (The buckle and ring produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Edwards. Look at these things, do you know them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Edwards. I am certain the buckle and ring are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you used to keep them?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Edwards. I used to keep them in a small cabinet, that stands in my dining-room; there was no lock broke: I cannot tell which way the prisoner got at them. I suppose I might inadvertently have left the key in the door.</p>

               <p>I was cleaning the plate on the slab, these things lay behind the knife-case, in a little shagreen-case; I took it up, and saw what was in it: I did not think it was of any consequence. I put the buckle in my bosom, and went flashing among people that were smartish drest; after that I went to Mr. Yates: a young fellow there laid a wager it was not worth 3 s. and to decide the wager I went to Mr. Davidson, to know the value of it. I asked what it was worth, and said I had laid a wager about it. He stopped it, and said it was a diamond buckle; I went to Mr. Yates, and told him it was stopped; Mr. Yates said, if you will take an action out against Mr. Davidson, I will help you to a lawyer, and I will sware I saw the buckle given to you. One day I was disguised in liquor; Mr. Yates said if I would stay, he would take me to a house where I should lay all night; and I was going to the play with a young man: I asked him to take care of the ring, I did not ask him to lend me any money upon it; he lent me 4 s. I told him at the same time, I would not part with the ring upon any account.</p>

Barnfield went down into the yard, where I had hung out a piece of blue baize. When they were gone, Mr. Simonds and Mr. Lyon came, and asked me if I had not lost my ironing cloth.

In the room where I lie, I had a little box covered with leather, which I used to put my money in; I had 17 guineas and some silver, and 2 gold ear-rings with stones in them in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe what pieces of money as near as you can?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. There was a moidore, a 6 s. and 9 d. 3 quarter guineas, and some silver, a few shillings, I cannot tell how much, and 14 guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the money last?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I had seen it, I believe, about an hour before I lost it, which was on the 29th of November: I missed it between 4 and 5 in the afternoon. I had put in two guineas about an hour before. I had a little cow-house in my yard, with a truss of hay in it; it was set on fire; we all in the house went out to it to put it out; my wife bolted the fore-door, she sent the prisoner in at the back door, and when we all went into the house we found the fore-door unbolted, and open; then we went all up stairs, and the box was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time between your going out to put out the fire, and your coming in again?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I believe it might be 6 or 8 minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the girl when you returned?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. She was in the house when the box was missing; we asked her if she saw any body; she said she was knocked down by a soldier and another man, who both stepped over her in the house; then we went all out to see who we could see, some one way, and some another.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether the girl at the bar ever saw you open the box?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I cannot say she ever did, I believe she knew we had money in it. It was kept on a little mahogany table, I never saw the box since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house all that evening?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. She was out some time, but not after she told us a soldier knocked her down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect her?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. No, I had no suspicion of her taking it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to be taken up?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. Because she owned it herself.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she own it?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. On Tuesday I believe in last week; she was in my service then, but I did not hear her. I was gone to London. But here is a witness here<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110024"/> that did, and after that I heard her own it before Justice Welch.</p>
               <p>Q. When was she taken up?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. She was taken up this day week. At first she said her mother was guilty of it, and we had the mother in St. Giles's Round-house. She said her mother came to her and asked her, If she knew where her master kept his money; she having no money, and she must help her to some: that the girl answered, How can I do it? And the mother said, You must set some part of your master's house on fire; and if you will not do it I will kill you, or set somebody else to do it; and upon that the stable was set on fire the first time; (my place was three times set on fire, on the 22d, the 27th, and 29th of November) the hay was set on fire in the rick the two first times; the last was a truss of hay on the ground. After this she said it was her sister; and all the reason she gave was, that her sister and mother were so much alike, she could not tell which it was: then after that she owned she had taken the box away and hid it, and broke it to pieces, and lighted the fire with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own to the taking the money?</p>
               <p>Gibbons. I do not remember she owned any thing of that; the money was found upon her last Friday, and then she was taken before Justice Welch. I did not see it found, but I saw it counted before Mr. Welch.</p>

            . I am a constable of Paddington. On the 29th of November the prosecutor came to my house, and said he had been robbed, and his stables had been set on fire; that he had lost a box with 16 or 17 pounds, or guineas, and desired I would assist him. I went with him; he desired me to go up stairs: the beds I found strangely tumbled about. He said the box was taken from off the table. The prisoner said, People came down stairs, and a man in soldiers cloaths had knocked her down with a candle and lanthorn in his hand, and a box under the other. I looked her in the face, and said, Are you hurt? She said, No. Mr. Gibbons said, he had some suspicion of a soldier that was quartered in his house about nine months. I said I knew the man very well, and know where he keeps company not far off, and perhaps we shall find him. I went and found the girl he keeps company with, and the people could prove the girl was never out of the way of the door; the people gave leave to search the house. I went home, not having found out any thing; the next morning the prosecutor desired I would come to his house: I went, and found he, and his wife, and the girl at breakfast. I observed the girl did not care to look me in my face. We went and got a warrant, in order to take the soldier up. When we came to the barracks, we enquired for the captain, named Smith. We were told we could not see him till 4 in the afternoon; we waited. When he came, we told him the affair. It being St. Andrew's day, and the soldier being a Scotchman, we thought he might be a merry-making. The captain said we might have him the next morning. We went the next morning and took the soldier, and put him in the watch-house; after that there were people that proved the fellow never was out of their company, so he was acquitted. Then I desired Mr. Gibbons to go home and try his maid: he said he had no suspicion of her. On the Wednesday the prosecutor's wife sent for me; I went. She said she had heard of the money. I found the girl crying in the room. I put the people out of the room, and asked the girl what was become of the money. Said she, I'll tell you the truth. A day or two before the first time the fire was (which was on the 22d of November), my mother came to me, and asked me where my master puts his money. I asked for what reason. She said, money she wanted, and money she would have; that her sister lay-in in St. Andrew's work-house. She said she could not help her to any; that the old woman said, you must set fire to something, and I'll go up stairs and fetch the money down. Then she said her mother came, and asked her who set fire to the stables on the 27th; she said she could not tell, she saw nobody. She said her mother came to the house with a candle and lanthorn, and set fire to it on the 22d. I asked who set fire to it on the 29th. She said her mother: that she saw her go through the passage and take the box away. I asked how she knew; her mother took the box away. She said she went up stairs, and shewed her mother the room where the box was, and after that she stood in the passage and saw her bring the box down stairs, and carry it into the stable and hide it, and set fire to the place, and then went away. I asked her what became of the box; she said her mother came the next morning, between 11 and 12 o'clock, and fetched it away; and she went down into the stable along with her, and saw her take it under her cloak: then I took her to Mr. Welch's, the clerk examined her, she seemed to say all this, and signed her examination there.</p>

               <p>Holdway. This was not an examination taken before the Justice; it was only before the clerk. Then we got a warrant, and went to the workhouse where the sister lay-in: we found she had been gone out three weeks. Then we heard where the mother lodged in Gray's inn-lane: we went there, and found she had been gone from thence two months. Then we went to the Black Horse in Gray's-inn-lane; there they recommended us to another place: then we heard the mother lodged at the Cock and Crown in Little Britain. While we were asking about this in Gray's-inn-lane, in came the mother: the people said that was she; we took her into custody. We had left the prosecutor and girl together hard by: when we brought them together, the girl upbraided the mother with all I have said: we searched the mother, but could find nothing upon her. I took them both to the round-house, and ordered them to be kept asunder, and nobody to come near them. The next morning I went again to enquire the mother's character about Little Britain; but before I set out, I ordered a woman to search the girl: she was searched, and nothing was found upon her. I searched the bed and under the bed: then I went to the Cock and Crown to ask about the mother: the woman of the house could recollect the mother was out about the 22d, but was sure she was not out on the 27th. I asked if she could recollect she was out on the 29th. The man of the house, and one

            , both said they were sure the mother was there, and not out that day. I asked if she was out on the Saturday in the afternoon: they said no. Then I desired them to come up and be examined, that the old woman might be cleared: they did. Then I went to the girl, and said you are a sad girl; I am afraid you are going to hurt your mother: here are her master and mistress coming, and they will prove you a story teller. Then I took her by herself; she began to cry, and said she would tell the truth. Then she said, indeed it was my sister that came in the room of my mother: she said my mother could not come, and I lighted my sister up stairs, and she took the box and carried it into the stable, and put it into a grain-hole, and covered it over with old rags. I asked her who came for the box: she said my sister. I said, are you sure of it: she said, I am. Now, said I, you'll send me on such another errand: then I went and got another warrant, and went after the sister to one Jenkins's in Gray's-inn-lane. I went there, and was informed that the girl had an aunt in Monmouth-street: I went for the aunt, and said you must go and assist me in this matter: if she will tell where the money and things are, perhaps the man will be favourable. We went to the girl: I told her she would have no favour, if she went before the Justice. She seemed to cry and held down her head: said I, I'll go and get me some victuals; I went, and about one o'clock the aunt sent for me. When I came, the aunt said the girl took her down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. The aunt must give an account of that.</p>
               <p>Holdway. Then the girl told me she did it herself; her mother and sister were not present. I took the money from the man of the round-house, and told it 17 l. 19 s. two ear-rings, and some silver. The girl said she had hid the box in the coal-hole under a sack, and had after that broke it to pieces and burnt it. The Justice then discharged the mother and sister.</p>

            . I keep the round-house, the prisoner was confined there: she came on the Wednesday; I had her three days. On the Friday there were her mother and sister; but they never were together, nor never spoke to each other. We prayed the girl to tell the truth; and told her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110027"/> what a sad thing it would be, at the great day, if she should wrong her mother and sister: she said they were guilty: at last she clapped her hand upon her aunt, and said, aunt save me. Then she said she had something to say to her aunt: they went by themselves; I followed and watched them, and saw her deliver a purse out of her bosom to her aunt: her aunt delivered it to me, and I never opened it till I delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q to Holdway. Produce it.</p>
               <p>Holdway. This is the purse which the last witness delivered to me, with the money in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Clark. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing when she delivered the money.</p>
               <p>Clark. I heard her say, after she went below; aunt I'll give it you, if you can save me. Then I sent for the constable from the public house, and delivered it to him. ( The money produced)</p>

Last Monday, between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, I was sitting in our house eating my dinner, a man came down stairs with a bundle in his left hand, and opened the door with his right, and let himself out. I went out, and called stop that man; the more I called out the faster he ran. He was stopped; it was the prisoner. When I came up to him he took two pair of stockings out of his waistcoat pockets, and one out of his coat pocket, and put them into my apron. He had laid down the bundle, and another man took that up: in the bundle were a frock, a waistcoat, a pair of leather breeches, and a pair of stockings.

            . On the 16th of October, about 8 in the evening, Reynolds came, as I was sitting selling fruit and oysters: there were four or five more-boys along with him. He took my candle out of my lanthorn; I asked him what he had got there: he said he had got three rings, and asked me if I would buy them. I asked him to let me see them; he had them on his finger; he took them off, and gave them into my hand. I asked him how he came by them: he said it is no matter; if I would buy them I should come to no harm: I said I did not believe they were gold. He produced a plain gold ring with a black enamel; and another, a gold twist with a brown stone; he said he was certain they were gold, by the place from whence they came; and said, he was sure there was nothing but gold where they came from; and if I thought they were too dear at 18 d. all three of them, I should have them for a shilling: upon which I desired him to stay a little. I took the rings, and went into Waterman's-lane to a pawn-broker's shop: I desired the gentleman to tell me if they were gold; he said they were. I told him which way I got them, and where the boy was. He desired me to go and get a constable and take him up. I said, I did not understand any thing of the affair; and as it was late, I would keep the rings till morning: as the boy was known about the place, I thought my husband could easily take him up in the morning. I went home and locked up the rings in a drawer, and told the boy he should have the rings if he came in the morning: he said it was very well. The next morning my husband got up between six and seven, and found the boy in the glass-house: he took him to the Blue-Anchor, and sent for Mr. Houghton, and delivered the boy and rings to him. As soon as my husband took him into the public house the boy fell a crying, and owned he took the rings from out of a clock-maker's shop, at the corner of George-alley in the Fleet-market; that Price stole them, and delivered those three to him, and kept two himself.</p>

My house was broke open between the 20th and 26th of October last, but what day I cannot justly tell: I left it late on the Sunday, and on the Saturday after I sent my daughter to the garden to get some parsley; she returned and told me it had been broke open. I let it out in lodgings, these people here are tenants to me; I have an apartment to myself in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this house?</p>
               <p>Wood. It is joining to Tottenham turnpike in Islington road: I lodge there in the summer time, but very seldom in the winter. Mr. Clain, Mr. Stockdale, and Mr. Snell, lodge there; the woman is a <rs id="t17651211-45-viclabel274" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I missed two linen curtains, a head-cloth, a tester-cloth, 6 valences, 2 looking-glasses, and a tea-chest: I lost more since, but these things I have found again; they were at one Crofts's, a broker, at the Bell in Drury-lane. (Produced and deposed to.) I have matched the tester-cloth with the piece they left behind where they cut it off, and it matched exactly. It is entirely new.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Wood. I am a <rs id="t17651211-45-viclabel275" type="occupation">broker</rs>

He was asked how he conveyed the things away from Tottenham-court: his answer was,</p>
               <p>"We carried them away on our backs."</p>
               <p>Q. Does the house stand alone?</p>
               <p>Wood. It does; and the furniture of the house belonged to us: the prisoner owned he was in the garden, and they carried them upon the rising ground, and put them over the pales.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who did break the house?</p>
               <p>Wood. I cannot say he did.</p>

I was in London at the time the house was broke, at my master's house in Green-street, by Leicester-fields. I was in the house about a fortnight before the house was broke; and I expected my box to come to town the very day the house was broke. I found a shift body, a cotton gown, some sleeves, 7 aprons, a pair of white stockings, and some green cloth, at the prisoner's house: he <rs id="t17651211-45-deflabel276" type="occupation">kept a chandler's shop</rs>

I had word the prisoner was taken, and I went to Parker's-lane to his house; there I found the feather-bed, mattrass, 2 blankets, and the copper tea-kettle. I went to him in Clerkenwell-prison. I asked him about the things; he told me Mr. Crofts had bought near 13 beds of him: he told me Parry went into the house, and he stood without to receive them, and there is a little mount in the garden, from which he put them over the pales.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he got into the house?</p>
               <p>Stockdale. I think he said he went in at a window, and over a lumber-room; I found the bar to the back window had been wrenched.</p>

I lived with one gentleman 7 years, and with another 2. My last master was a bankrupt, then I left him, and became acquainted with Mr. Parry.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. On the 14th of November, about one o'clock, I put three guineas and a shilling into a drawer on the ground floor, and left the key in the drawer; there were 20 s. in halfpence and a guinea in the drawer, besides what were taken out: the halfpence were in a bag by themselves, and four guineas and a shilling were in a tin cup: the three guineas and a shilling were missed about 3 o'clock. I was absent when it was taken: the other prisoner was in the yard waiting for the pots; he is a pot-boy at an ale house.</p>
               <p>Abbot's defence.</p>
               <p>I never had no more money than what I brought out of the country with me. My father gave me four guineas, and I gave it to this lad to keep for me, fearing I should have my pocket picked.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What three guineas did Abbot speak of, that he put into the prisoner's hand?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Abbot declared he was the person that took the three guineas and a shilling out of the drawer.</p>

               <p>Mills. I cannot tell how many, whether 3, 4, or 5, or what: the trunk remained there till the Sunday following, when Tull and Wheat came and took it away, and carried it into Lock-fields, as they told me; I left them in White-street: they came to me again at the Blue Bell. They said they had taken the things out, and hove the trunk into a ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Lock-fields from the Borough?</p>
               <p>Mills. It is about half a mile distant. What they did with the goods they took out, I do not know; they gave me no account, and they gave me no more than 15 s. and that they gave me that night. I had only one black coat, which I pawned at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110032"/> next door but one to the Black Raven in Tooley-street, for 5 s. and 3 d. and a piece of velvet of 5 yards, which I pawned for 8 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever concerned with the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Mills. I was once concerned with Tull before. (See No. 540, i n Mr. Alderman Bridgen's Mayoralty.) I never was concerned with Wheat before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been in the afternoon, on the 6th of November?</p>
               <p>Mills. I was with Tull in the day-time, and appointed to meet at the Blue Bell in the evening, which we did all three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they tell you before you set out, what they were going upon?</p>

            . I live in Unicorn-yard, Tooley-street, Mills lodged along with me; he and Wheat brought a trunk into my house, about 4 o'clock, the morning that the fire was in Cornhill, and it rested there till the Sunday afternoon following; when Tull came and fetched it away: I insisted on their taking it away. Mills lodged in a two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a trunk was it?</p>
               <p>C. Clegg. It was a black leather one, bound up, and carried into Mill's lodging room; it was bound up with a cord all the time it was there.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be up so early that morning?</p>
               <p>C. Clegg. My brother was sick, and I was up with him. I never saw no more of them after they brought it in, till the Saturday morning; Mills and another man came, and went away again; they came again at night to lodge: they were in liquor. I do not know what that other man was; they were very noisy: the next morning I discharged them from the lodging, not to come any more to lodge there. They took the trunk away on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took it away?</p>
               <p>C. Clegg. Mills and Tull brought it down stairs; Wheat was with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners lie in the house with Mills?</p>
               <p>C. Clegg. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the Sunday did they fetch it away?</p>
               <p>C. Clegg. They went away on the Sunday morning, and came again in the afternoon and fetched it away; they all three went away with it: I know nothing where they carried it; neither do I know what was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Tull. Whether there was not a gentleman came the next day, with his face bound up, and said they were his property?</p>
               <p>C. Clegg. Yes, there was a gentleman came, he went up stairs with me; but whether they opened it or not, I cannot say: he did not say the trunk was his; but said I must not let any body have the trunk. When Mills came to lodge with me, he told me there was a young fellow come to lodge with him, if I approved of it; so I suppose this man came with a view to lodge, for he wanted to pay a shilling a week for his lodging as well as he.</p>
               <p>Q. from Wheat. Was not that man's head bound up with a handkerchief?</p>
               <p>C. Clegg. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. from Wheat. Did not I ask you whether the lock was broke open?</p>
               <p>C. Clegg. No, I asked that question, Whether the lock came in whole? and he said he could not tell, whether it came tied or corded; I told Wheat a man came and claimed it, and I told him another man had said it must not be taken away, but by his order, and I would not let it go till Mills came.</p>
               <p>Tull. This man that had his face bound up, was named

Young man, he said, here it is; I said how came you by it; he said he bought it in Holland: I said I do not believe any such goods ever came from Holland, I believe they were stolen from the fire; no, said he, they are not: the man was all on a tremble; I said I insist upon your going before a justice, to know whether you came honestly by them or not.

               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>H. Macuse. I deal in old cloaths, they brought a green bag, and asked me whether I did not deal in old cloaths. I said yes; they said they came from on board a Holland trader, they had been to Holland, and had got some things, and they were afraid of the Custom-house officers, and if I would sell a piece of Holland for them, they would give me a piece for a table-cloth; they cut me off a piece for a table-cloth from a larger piece; they had other things in the bag, it appeared like fustian, I had just a sight of it: they delivered this piece of cloth to me to sell, (produced in court;) there is 15 yards of it. I took a piece and offered it to sell at a shop in Cable-street. I told the woman I had it from a person that came from Holland, and he was afraid of the Custom-house officers; the woman said I had better take it home and cut it for table linen; Tull and Mills were at my house at the time. A cabinet maker came in and seeing them cut the cloth, he had a suspicion of it being stolen; he called my husband out, and when they were whispering gave them a suspicion, and they went away, and said they would leave the linen till they came back at 4 o'clock in the afternoon: then I went over to Mr. Maniarty the constable, and told him of it; they never came that night. The next day I went to enquire about them, and met Tull on London-bridge. I stopt and collarded him; he got from me. I called stop came, and some were for stopping him, and some not; but I got assistance, and took him before my Lord-Mayor. I left word if Mills should come, to send for the constable: he came, and was taken, so all three were taken that day.</p>

When they cut the fustian, one of them said, the other man concerned would be mad if he had not his share; they asked the woman to go out and sell some huckaback. Said one, cut it in two: no, said the other, let it go whole: first they cut a table-cloth off, and then they sent the remainder out to sell. She came back with it, and said the people said she had better take it back, or she would be stopped with it: then said Mills, cut it up into table-cloths. I whispered her, and said, this stuff is certainly stolen. I would have you not to be concerned with it. We told them the table-cloths should be made, if they came in the evening; they went away, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110034"/> we went and told the officer of it, and intended if they had come, to stop them; we waited their coming, but they did not come that night.

               <p>Mr. Bell. I keep the Spread Eagle in Gracechurch street; I have known the prisoner upwards of 12 years; I never heard any thing against his character in my life. He kept coaches once, and used to come to my house. He was a man of substance; he was concerned in the Dover coach. He came to misfortunes, and was recommended to work in the India company's warehouses.</p>

I went up stairs to see an aunt of mine that was ill: Mr. Barrey is my uncle: I wrote a pennypost letter: on my returning from her room, I saw a light in the parlour where my goods were left; this was between 6 and 7 in the evening. I thinking there were some French ladies that lodged there, I went to ask them how they did: then I missed my portmanteau; the other things were all safe. One of Mr. Barrey's maids told me the waterman had brought it, and that it was in the parlour, about 6 o'clock that evening. I sent back to Isleworth to know the number of my post bill: Mr. Oflartey sent me word, I must be informed of that by applying to Mr. Cruse, a merchant, who gave it to him: I went, and was informed that the number was 3315. I went and stopt payment at the Bank, and had it advertised on Wednesday the 16th, with other things lost in the portmanteau; and the bill was stopped at the Bank the very morning it was advertised.</p>

             and another woman came to my shop. I never saw Fitzgerald before: the other woman had bought things of me several times before; her name is Smith: she took hold of her own gown, and said, have you any more of this fort of silk and stuff; that was a gown that she had bought of me; I took and shewed them a roll of the same: they both ordered eleven yards to be cut off. After that Smith said to the prisoner, I hear you are going into mourning; I hear you have got a very good windfall left you; you will want some crape. She was shewed some: she agreed for price, and ordered 14 yards to be cut off Then Smith said to the prisoner, my dear you will want change for a note: then she turned to me, and said, I suppose, Sir, you can change a bank note, I said yes, if it is not too heavy. The prisoner took this note from her breast, and gave it to one of my young people, and it was handed to me: I read it, and said, Madam, this is not a bank note, this is a bank post bill, and it is not accepted which makes it not negociable: they seemed a little surprized, and said they did not know there were any difference between a bank note, and a bank post bill. I read the body of it to them, and pointed out the difference; they said they did not know what to do: I said I shall be in the city in the morning, and I would get it accepted, (not having the least suspicion it was stolen.) They left it with me, and seemed greatly pleased, and took the goods away.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the goods come to?</p>
               <p>Willoughby. They came to 3 l. 13 s. all together. I told them they might come any time on the morrow, and they should have the things. I went into the city the next morning, having business at the Custom-house, and the Exchange: when I came to present the bill at the bank, I was asked where I got the bill: I told them, they said it was stole; said I, what shall I do with it: they desired me to go to the secretary, which I did: he said he would write to the person at whose house the portmanteau was stole, for him to come and consult with me, upon which Mr. Barrey came to me.</p>

               <p>Willoughby. No; they neither came nor sent. My young people recollecting, while they were standing by my counter, that one said to the other, my mantua-maker is a very good sort of a woman, she has lost her husband, who was a dresser at the playhouse, and she has a pretty daughter that delights in the playhouse; they mentioned her living in Vinegar-yard: upon this Mr. Barrey and I went to Vinegar yard, and found a mantuamaker that lived up stairs. I saw a good looking woman sit at work: I carried a piece of that stuff which Smith had had a gown of; I asked her if she had made a gown of such as that about three weeks before, she said, she had not. We were coming down stairs; I said I will turn back, and ask her one question more. I went up, and said, Madam, I see you are in mourning; are you in morning for a husband or a relation? she said it was for her husband. I said, was he not a dresser in the playhouse? she said, yes. Then I said, have you not a daughter that delights in the playhouse? she told me she had. I asked the favour to see her; she was called out of another room; she is a woman grown. I said to her, my dear, did not you and your mamma make a gown of this sort of stuff about three weeks ago? The daughter said, yes, Sir, we did. The mother contradicted it, and said they had not. The daughter said, Mamma, you forget yourself; we did for such a person, meaning Smith, but I think they called her Benton, or Benson: she told me, she lodged at a little rag-shop in Drury-lane, up two pair of stairs backwards.

The clerk said to me, do you go home, and if I can find the people I'll send for you. I had not been at home two hours, before he sent me word he believed he had found the person, meaning Fitzgerald. I took one of my young women that served them, and went to Justice Fielding's; then Mr. Marsden, a constable, and I, went to a little house in Drury-lane, at a shoe-maker's in Prince's-street. We did not all go one way, but met at the door; the constable and clerk went up stairs, and in a minute or two they desired me to come-up: there were the two prisoners in a little back chamber; the constable was ordered to search the man; they tied his hands, and took them both in a coach to Justice Fielding's: they both absolutely denied knowing any thing of the portmanteau, or any thing about the post bill. Fitzgerald said, she had never been in Holborn but once in her life, and denied being in my shop at all. When I saw her at first going into her room, I looked her in the face, and said, why did you not come for your change out of the note? I knew her directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Fitzgerald before they came on the 15th at night?</p>

            . I attend in the shop at Mr. Willoughby's: I remember the first time Smith came to our shop, there was a tall woman with her: we never knew what name she went by. She bought some silk and stuff for the tall woman, and paid for it: at the same time she admired some stuff that lay in the window, called missinet; it is silk and stuff. I think she bought 10 yards of it, for a gown for herself. After that she came to buy a yard more to make it up; and about a week after that, she came with the prisoner Fitzgerald: then she said she had brought another customer, because she admired her gown. I shewed her the missinet, she bought 11 yards of that, and afterwards 14 yards of crape: Smith sat down and shewed me her gown, and talked to me of her mantua-maker. Then she said to Fitzgerald, my dear, you have a bank note to change; Fitzgerald took it from her bosom, and as it was not accepted, she was to come for the rest of the money on the morrow. My uncle looked at it, and said it was not a bank note, but a bank post bill unaccepted; they both got up and looked at it; the prisoner said, she did not know there was any difference: he said he would go the next morning to the Bank, and get it accepted for her: and if she would call next day would give her the change. She went away very chearful; I did not see her again till she was taken up, when my uncle sent for me to the Hand and Slipper, a shoemaker's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110038"/> in Prince's-street; there were the prisoners, Bignal had his hands tied: I am very sure Fitzgerald is the prisoner that brought the note, my uncle bid me look at her face.

               <p>Willoughby. This gown is of the same sort of stuff that I sold; here is a piece of the same I have with me, which answers to it every way.

               <p>A. Smith. No, I do not; I first became acquainted with her in Dublin, by being acquainted with her friends; I was born within 16 miles of Dublin.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in England?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. I have been in England about 7 years.</p>

               <p>Q. How long ago since you saw her in London the first time?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. I believe it is about 12 months ago; then I accidentally happened to meet her in the street. I cannot tell where she lived at that time: I have met her several times, and asked her how she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever at her lodgings?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. No, nor she at mine. When I called upon her, I happened to have a gown on that she took a liking to.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. This may be better than 2 months ago; it was at a shoe-maker's shop in Prince's-street. I called upon a girl of my acquaintance in the same house; the gown I had on we call popplin; that is, silk and stuff: she asked me where I bought it; I said in Holborn. I had been two or three times at that house before; she said she should be obliged to me, if I would go and show her the shop, which I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she pay for it?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. No, she did not; she gave a bank note, or bank bill: I can neither write nor read.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she take it from?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. I cannot tell whether she took it out of her bosom or pocket: she told me she had a bill at the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention nothing of it before?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. She said a very good friend had made her a present of it, and other little things: one that she had sleeped with at a bagnio: she left it at that shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after you went out of that shop?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. We went and had a pint of beer, and parted at Turnstile, Holborn. I went home; she said to me, is this an honest man. I said, I hope he will take care, and not lose your note, for I know nothing of the gentleman, (this I said out of a joke.) I said you had better have a bill of the shop, so he gave her a bill.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it that you parted?</p>
               <p>A. Smith. It was about 6 o'clock.</p>

Nailor. I was coming home to my lodging Sunday the 1st of December, between 2 clock in the morning. I had been drinking, and</note> got a little in liquor. I light of the prisoner and another girl, and stood and talked with them, I believe, a quarter of an hour before I parted with them. I missed my shagreen case of instruments; I told them I suspected they had got it; they denied it. I said, if they would give it me, I would give them something that would be of more service to them: they asked me what I would give them; I gave them a shilling. When they had got that, they would not give me the case. I told them I would give them something more if they would give it me. I charged the watch with them, and took them to the watch-house. The constable examined them at the watch-house. The prisoner said, if I would forgive her, she would give it me again, and that the other girl knew nothing of the matter: she went and fetched the case out of the street, where she had hid it (produced in court and deposed to.) I can swear to the case, because there is a piece of the shagreen broke off.</p>

            . On Sunday morning the first of this month, the prosecutor brought the prisoner to the watch-house. She said, if I would go with her she would get the case. We went: she put her hand down by a wooden pipe, where there is a waste cock; she said, there it is, and gave it me. This was in the narrow part of Holborn, near St. Giles's.</p>

               <p>I was standing in the street talking with some women. The prosecutor came up and talked with me. He pulled out his handkerchief very often, and so I suppose dropt it. I found something against my foot. I stooped and picked it up; I did not know it was the gentleman's. As I had been a long time with him, he gave me a shilling for my trouble.</p>

My wife lost a pair of Dresden ruffles, and a piece of lace, which caused inquiry to be made among the servants: she that same day, the 20th of October, took her things away. I asked my wife if she had discharged her nurse, she said no. I sent my servant after her, but in the mean time she came back; I said to her, nurse, I do not think you have used me well, you have been informed these things are lost; you might, to clear your character, have desired your mistress to have looked over your things.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been gone?</p>
               <p>Stewart. I believe she was not gone above 20 minutes, or half an hour; she said she knew nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110041"/> of the ruffles; I said, I beg you will let me know where you have carried your things; she said she had been to the baker's; I knew that was a falsity, for I had sent there. Then she said she had been to her lodgings, I knew that to be false also; she would not tell me where she had carried her parcel. I went to a brother at the next door to have advice; in the interim she came down stairs, and went out. My wife followed her. I thought she was going to the place where the things were. She walked about the street. My wife met a person whom she knew; she desired him to come and tell me that the nurse was only dodging her to tire her out, and desired I would come to Virginia-street. I went, but could not find her. She at last carried my wife to where the things were left. My wife sent for me to the bottom of Nightingale-lane; there were the nurse and my wife; the things were opened; there were a cambrick handkerchief, a piece of lace, a napkin, an apron, four pair of stockings; the stockings I can swear to. We did not find the ruffles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stewart confirmed the account given by her husband, and deposed to the things to be her husband's property.</p>

            . On the 29th of November I was walking homewards towards Rosemary-lane, very much in liquor, I was stopped by several women: where they carried me to I do not know, nor how they used me; I was not sensible. I had 300 l. in Bank notes in my pocket book, and my watch besides. I went into a house; the people tell me since, it was the same place where Mr. Smith, clerk at the Bank, was robbed and murdered *. It was up a court near Church-lane. When I came out of the house, I found I had no money in my pocket; so I lost there two 36 shilling pieces, three guineas, a half crown, and some halfpence. I had my pocket book, with my papers in it, in my side-pocket. When I got out, I laid hold of a woman that had hold of the latch of the door: I told her she was the person, or one of the persons, that had robbed me. She said, no, she was not. I said she should go to the watch-house; I dragged her all along to the watch-house. While I was dragging her, she cried out Cobey, I believe fifty times: that was the person that was to attack me in case any thing should happen. I told her if I was to die I would not leave her. When I came to the watch-house, I believe it was between 7 and 8 o'clock; there was neither watch nor constable. I had a friend went up to the beadle of the parish and got assistance. I offered two guineas to have the people apprehended, so that I might but have my money and the people brought to justice. I went to a dozen public houses, and could find none that I could swear to. I can swear both the women at the bar were in company in the house, but can't swear they are the people that robbed me.</p>

             would come into my room with this gentleman, and were sitting on the side of the bed when I went for some beer, and when I came back they were gone. After that I met with Sullivan, he said he heard Elizabeth Wall had robbed a man; I told him I knew nothing of it: he said, I must go to the watch-house, but if I would give him part of what I had got he would let me go free. I told him I had no more money than what belonged to me. He took my money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110043"/> and gave me only 10 s. of it. He got Wall sworn to be an evidence, to swear our lives away, to get the money the gentleman proffered him. I hope the court will take it into consideration. I am as ignorant of the money as the child unborn. If the gentleman was robbed, she robbed him.</p>

            . The night after M'Kenzie and I stole these mugs, we went up to Duke's Place, and met Israel Cowen: we asked him if he would buy any silver, he said he had just left a man that would, and that he would go and look for him, and bid us stay; he brought a little man, and the little man went and fetch'd Morea Abrahams, the prisoner at the bar to us in the Minories. I stood about six or seven yards off, while M'Kenzie talked with him. I could hear what they said. I had one mug in my coat pocket, the other in my bosom. He said he would give him two guineas for them unsight, unseen. M'Kenzie said, before he would take two guineas for them he would throw them into the Thames. Morea Abrahams said, if you will go up into the fields, and let's look at them, may be I will give you more, it is according as I like them. We went into an alehouse in an alley, and had a pint of beer; there the little man came to us. Abrahams walked on the other side the way. When we came out of the house, we crossed an alley and came into Prescot-street, and Israel Cowen along with us. Abrahams went on a little before. When we got to the top of Prescot-street, I saw Murray the thief-taker. I said to M'Kenzie, here is Murray; he said, push it down the street; so we ran, and he took M'Kenzie. I went up to the Mulberry Gardens, thinking he would come to me. When I had staid about an hour,

I could not tell what they said. Then I went for Morea Abrahams, and they went up stairs in a chandler's shop that is in an alley, and bargained for the money.

I did not trouble myself about it that night, but went the next morning to the poultry compter, and asked after my son; instead of my son, Morea Abrahams came down. I asked him after my son; he said, he knew nothing of him. I said, I hear there is something between you and my son about the mugs; I said, what is become of them; he said, there is no brooms in England can sweep the mugs together again, and if you can keep a secret, I will trust you with one. Give me your hand, so I gave him my hand, with intention to speak the truth, if it should be of any consequence. He said he had the mugs, that he gave two guineas for them, and my son half a guinea for brokerage. As I had my foot on the threshold of the door going away, he said, come hither Cowen, you can do me a kindness, if you will go to New-Prison, there you will find your son, tell him not to speak against me, and I will maintain him all the while he is in prison. I said, I will not trouble my head with it at all. I went to New-Prison to my son.</p>

I went with him about one o'clock in the night, and took the prisoner, by his direction, in Northumberland-street. He was lying on a wad of hay, in a stable-yard, belonging to the waterworks, with the ribbons upon him (produced in court.) Here is a mark upon one of them of my own making.</p>
               <p>Q. How much does that piece contain?</p>
               <p>Woodward. There is about five yards and a quarter of it: there was a ribbon rough made for a lady, found also, which he had given to a girl, (that is not in the indictment.) When the prisoner was charged with breaking the prosecutor's shop window, he begg'd forgiveness, and said it was the first time he had done such a thing: he was searched, and in his pocket was found 2 pair of plated buckles; they did not belong to us. We took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Brown.

He afterwards took them from me, and kept them in his own pocket: then we came by Temple-bar, and a soldier followed us.

The prisoner ran away. The soldier carried me into Drury-lane; there he met one of Justice Fielding's men; he delivered me up to him, and left me.

After that I went down the Strand, as I did not know what to do with the things. I staid in Covent-garden, thinking I might see him, and give him his things again.

            . I am a shoemaker: when the fire was in Cornhill, my landlord and I went to assist Mr. Pyefinch: the prisoner and several other men were in the house at the time. A young man took hold of this gun, and said, I'll carry this over to the church, that was the place where Mr. Pyefinch's goods were deposited: said the prisoner give it to me; no, said the young man, I can carry it myself: but the young man soon delivered it to him. When he had got it of the young man, the prisoner wink'd to me: I thought he had some ill design, so I thought proper to watch him. Presently after he stooped down; I put my hand behind him, and felt something hard on each side, in each coat pocket. After that, I perceived something in his breeches; I felt: he said, hold your tongue, follow me. I was determined to follow him: I followed him down the street, and before I got down he was out of sight. I ran towards the 'Change, and overtook him by St. Michael's church. When I overtook him, he said, now we'll go and have some beer together. As he was going by the sign of the Mansion-house, facing the Mansion-house, I said, here is a public house. Said he, have you any money in your pocket: I said, no. Said he, I'll have some beer some way or other. He said to the woman, take care of my fire-lock (note, the prisoner was a <rs id="t17651211-59-deflabel353" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

We had some tobacco, and he wanted more. I said, I must go home to work: then he said, if you will not stay, we will go to Mr. Pyefinch's house, and take each a bundle, and carry them to the church, and make him pay us. He told me he had made upwards of 50 l. for himself that morning. He left the gun, and two bottles of liquor, in the bar at that house. We went both to Mr. Pyefinch's house, and into that room where he had the gun from. Soon after I perceived he was gone. I told two young men what he had been doing, and what he had told me, and desired their assistance to take him; and desired them both to follow me out of the house. We followed him to the church, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110046"/> told Mr. Holmes the affair, and desired to go to the house where the gun was, and ask for it: he did. Coming up again to see for the prisoner, we met the prisoner going up the entry into the house for the gun and liquor: we secured him there, and took him to the Compter. It quite slipped my memory to have his breeches examined for what I felt hard there.</p>

            . This evidence, Robinson, came to me, and said, you are a proper constable, I wish you would go along with me; a soldier has carried a gun and two bottles of liquor to the Mansion-house alehouse, and he believed he was there: we went, but he was not there; but the gun and liquor were. We called for a pint of purl, and when we were coming out of the alehouse door into the passage, there we met the prisoner. Robinson said, that is the man: I said, soldier, you have been robbing at the fire; he said he had not: I said, how came you to carry these things so far? he answered, he carried some to one place, and some to another.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>That morning I was coming from guard; I stopped at the fire. A man came and said, soldier, how can you stand there and not assist? He asked my colonel's name; I said Colonel Hays. He said, I'll take care you shall not be blamed for missing your duty. I assisted, and carried over things to the church. I brought this musket from a two pair of stairs room to the church: there was a constable standing, he said no fire-arms should be carried into the church. I said, where must I carry it? he said, he did not care, it should not come in there. I asked a fire-man to give me a little drop to drink out of a bottle; there were 3 or 4 bottles stood by him. He said, here, do not bother me, none of you; you soldiers have been pressing me for liquor all this morning. He gave me the two bottles, and I put them into my pockets. I knew no other place to carry them to, than to that house where I did carry them. It is a house where I have been before. I gave them to the landlady to take care of. I said to her, if you chuse to take them you may; she took them in charge into the bar. Said I, Somebody will have the musket, but as for the bottles, they were given me. This young man was along with me: if he saw any thing in my breeches, there were company enough in the house to have searched me. I went back to the fire again, and was helping down with things. Coming down the stairs, they were so slippery with the water, that I fell backwards over the bannisters, that I was not able to work any more. I have been so bad since, as not to be able to turn myself in my bed; one of the fire-men picked me up, and sat me down by the side of a house. When I came to myself, I was coming towards home; I met this man and constable; they asked me if I knew any thing of a musket and two bottles of liquor: I said I brought a musket there, because they would not let me carry it into the church. They took me to the Compter, and in a quarter of an hour to the Mansion-house. After that I was carried before the Alderman at Guildhall; that young man, the evidence, said, after I was committed, he should not have given himself so much trouble, but that he wanted to be paid for his labour.</p>


               <p>Q. to Robinson. Why did not you discover this when you got back to Mr. Pyefinch's house?</p>
               <p>Robinson. He was gone in an instant out of sight. I went as fast as possible after him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might he be out of the house before you?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I think not above a minute or two before me. I first saw him beyond the church, almost by the Royal Exchange, on the other side the way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holmes. Did the prisoner say any thing to you about being refused carrying the gun into the church?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the two bottles of liquor were given him by a fireman.</p>
               <p>Holmes. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be full?</p>
               <p>Holmes. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner sober?</p>
               <p>Holmes. I believe he was a little in liquor.</p>

             came to my house, and said he wanted to speak with me; I took him into the dining-room: he said I had a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110047"/> servant in my house that was a thief, and asked if that was my man that let him in. I said yes, (that was the prisoner,) he had lived with me 12 months, all but 2 days; Scoles said he could tell me where he had disposed of some goods, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fisher. He was my <rs id="t17651211-60-deflabel359" type="occupation">porter</rs>

We put her and her husband in the round-house: the next day they were examined before the Justice; we took the prisoner up the next day; he was examined before Justice Welch, and owned that he had taken a little tea out of my shop, and had brought it to Mrs. Cheaseman's lodgings, who washed for him. There was about half a pound of tea, and 5 pounds of soap, and about a pound of tobacco, found at her house; we brought them away, and lodged them in the constable's hands. On his second examination he said he bought a pound and a half of tea, at 4 s. a pound, of a smuggler.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not get the prisoner in goal, and make some proposals to him.</p>
               <p>Fisher. I went to know what he had robbed me of at times?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him a promise if he would confess?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I never desired him to confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not some money of his in your hands, did you never make a proposal to him about that money?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No, I never did, I could not swear to the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire the prisoner to confess this charge, and let you keep that money, that you found in his box?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell him the consequence if he did not confess?</p>
               <p>Fisher. The Justice did, before I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him, if he did not confess, and let you have the money, he should be hanged?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No, I did not mention hanging. I asked him how he could make it appear that money was his; I told him he might be transported: I told him I would not lay it capital.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention selling or giving Mrs. Cheaseman tea?</p>
               <p>Fisher. He said nothing of selling it, he gave it her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been in goal to him, terrifying and frighting him?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go there to desire him to give you a draft?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No, he sent it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it wrote?</p>
               <p>Fisher. It was wrote in goal.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote it?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I wrote the order, and he signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after he was committed?</p>
               <p>Fisher. A good while after that.</p>
               <p>Q Did you not threaten him, to extort that draft from him?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to give it you?</p>
               <p>Fisher. He gave it me for fear it should be lost, and he did not think proper to trust Mr. Sharp with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it?</p>
               <p>Fisher. It is a share in a lottery ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you promise him not to prosecute him for it?</p>
               <p>Fisher. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not pressing you to pay him his wages?</p>
               <p>Fisher. I paid him 2 guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business in your shop?</p>
               <p>Fisher. To weigh goods, and carry goods out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a letter to his character when he came to you?</p>

            . On the 13th of October last, I met with a friend, who invited me to breakfast; I complained of the tea being very bad, for when I drink tea, I neither drink milk nor sugar with it: said my friend, if I could get tea as my neighbour does, I might have better; for the man that sells it, robs his master, and brings 4 or 5 pounds as he can get it. She told me who was the master, so I went and informed Mr. Fisher of it; then he and I went to Mrs. Cheaseman's, and asked if Tom the merchant had been there; my friend told me he went by that name: they said he had taken his shirt away, and had left some hard soap, which we found; it was about 4 or 5 pounds, and some tobacco. We confined her in the round-house; then we went and carried the prisoner there. I said if he had carried on this correspondence, he must be worth money; the prisoner whispered me to ask his master to let him have something to live upon, or to drink. We went home, and found in his breeches pocket 10 guineas, and in a paper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110048"/> in his box 9 guineas, and an 18 shilling piece, and in another place 4 shares, and a whole lottery ticket; then we came on a third examination: he then complained he was greatly distressed for cash, and desired his master would give him something to support him, out of his own money. Mr. Welch ordered him the 18 s. piece. I said, this fellow has never been searched, he may have cash about him. The Justice said we might search him. I found in his breeches before, in a rag, very near 20 s. in silver, and in his fob I found a watch; we had found one before in his box. The Justice said you may as well pull off his shoes: we did, and found 5 guineas and a half in one shoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose money did he say it was?</p>
               <p>Scoles. He said it was not his master's, but the soap he owned was his master's, and that he stole it out of the cellar, and hoped his master would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he own this?</p>
               <p>Scoles. This was before Justice Welch; as to the tobacco, he said a soldier, or porter, gave it to him, upon the keys: he was contradicted in that, being told there was no cut tobacco there; he went on his knees, and asked the Justices, and his master's pardon.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray who is this lady that you drank tea with?</p>
               <p>Scoles. She was in prison with me in the Marshalsea prison.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her name?</p>
               <p>Scoles. They call her by the name of Optick.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her real name?</p>
               <p>Scoles. I believe her name is Mansfield, she was very intimate with Mrs. Cheaseman.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mrs. Cheaseman and she had a quarrel?</p>
               <p>Scoles. I really believe they had.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Scoles. I am an old discharged serjeant of the guards, and I now am employed at times to be put in possession for the Sheriffs of Middlesex.</p>

            . Mr. Fisher received information from this last evidence, of having a person in his house that robbed him. I being constable, was charged with him, on the 13th of October; he acknowledged before Justice Welch of having stole soap, and to the best of my remembrance he acknowledged taking tobacco and tea.</p>
               <p>Q. What words did he make use of?</p>
               <p>Smith. He first of all said he bought the tobacco of a man that stole it from off the keys. When he was told there was no cut tobacco there, he acknowledged he took it from his master, and he acknowledged he took tea by little at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Which examination was this?</p>
               <p>Smith. I believe this was the 2d examination, but cannot be sure whether it was not the 3d; the things were produced before the Justice, and he was charged with having stole them.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are you able to swear to either of these things here produced?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They answer to the samples which I have here, I cannot swear to them.</p>

               <p>Smith. I and Mr. Fisher married two sisters.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to the soap?</p>
               <p>Smith. I remember extremely well, the Justice said, now you are got over the soap, what do you say to the tobacco and ginger?</p>
               <p>Q. Then by that did you understand he confessed it?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did.</p>

            . I live at Paddington; I was sent for by the prisoner: when I came, he said it was not particularly me that he wanted, it was his master Fisher; that was to show Mr. Fisher he had received a letter from Bristol, from a person he there served, concerning money that he had. I desired him to tell his master how he got the tea out of the cannister: he told me when the shop was crowded with goods, he used to roll the cannisters into a passage leading to the cellar, and that gave him an opportunity to take it out of the cannister. I asked him how he managed to take that which was found in the hay-loft, where his master came from: he said he was sent to the India-House for a chest of tea, and some came out, and he took it.</p>

I had desired the rector of St. Michael's at Bristol to put some money out to use for me. I sent him word what had happened; he sent my character up, and likewise word that I had applied to him to put out money for me when I lived at Bristol: here is my brother that was with me when I bought one of the watches at Bristol, the other I bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176512110049"/> at an auction. I had no thoughts of buying it, but I said, Sixpence more; then it was knocked down, and I was obliged to have it.

               <p>The evidence the same as on the former trial for the prosecution; but this was found in a hay-loft belonging to the prosecutor, in the city of London, and therefore triable only by a London jury. The prisoner denied the charge, and called his attorney.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ridgeway. I was employed as attorney for the prisoner, who complained to me that Mr. Fisher had taken from him his watch, money, lottery-tickets, and his papers. He had obtained an order from him, during his imprisonment in the Gatehouse, for the receipt of 13 guineas from Mr. Sharp, an office-keeper in Holborn; that he owed him also 11 l. for wages; so being divested of all his property, I went to Mr. Fisher, and desired him to pay him his wages, in order to subpoena the Rev. Mr. Sayer, with whom he formerly lived servant, and to return a letter he had in his possession from the prisoner's brother, which contained a direction where to write to him. Mr. Fisher denied giving him the letter, or paying him his wages, or the 13 l. he had obtained from him, while in prison; or delivering up to him any other part of his property, by which he might be enabled to make his defence.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether Mr. Fisher did not tell you that the things were in the hands of the constable?</p>
               <p>Ridgeway. No, he first denied having it; then he had it; then he had it not: at last he said the constable had it; I then asked only for his wages.</p>

I led him to the Compter myself, and there had him searched; we found 2 handkerchiefs upon him, one was a large silk India handkerchief, and the other less, but my own was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be sure from the fact, that your handkerchief was drawn out that instant?</p>
               <p>Barnard. No, I cannot, I saw his hand busy afterwards shuffling something into his pocket, but did not see my handkerchief. I had made use of it but half a minute before.</p>

I being next the gentleman, he turned round, and said I had got his handkerchief. I desired him to search me; they took 2 handkerchiefs out of my pocket, one I was going to return to my sister, the other I had for my own use. I work for Mr. Kemp at Clerkenwell.</p>
