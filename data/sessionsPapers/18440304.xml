This declaration is the handwriting of James Christey—I know the defendant—he is a Custom-house agent—I believe James Christey is his brother—I cannot say whether he acts as his clerk—I believe they acted in conjunction, but I do not know—it is my duty to make out the blue books, which are for the purpose of en<lb/>abling the landing-waiter to examine the goods—I always copy outside the book the name of the ship, the master, and the place from whence the ship comes, and likewise copy inside the book the heading of the sight entry, with the marks of the cases—that is the practice—this heading is made in the usual course, in the writing of Mr. Mitchell, one of the clerks in the office—the book is then always sent back to the landing-waiter, for the examination of the goods—in April, 1842, the importer could take his goods to what quay he pleased, and not only then, but now also—the landing-waiters were stationed at the same quays for about a month—I was not present at the examination of these goods—the landing-waiter examines the goods with the entry in the blue</p>

               <p>book, and either the importer or his agent also attends to make an examina<lb/>tion and take an account of the goods—they keep an account against him—when the landing-waiter has made his entry in the blue book, it is returned to the Registrar's office in the evening—it is issued again to the landing-waiter, if he requires it—a perfect entry is the next document required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Ought the perfect entry to correspond with the value of the goods in the blue book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It depends on the assessment of the landing-waiter on the landing of the goods—the landing-waiter must agree with the merchant before the goods can be delivered out of the custody of the Crown—the per<lb/>fect entry ought to agree with assessment—this is the prisoner's sign<lb/>ature to the perfect entry—the body of it also appears in his handwriting—I believe it to be so—(<hi rend="italic">looking at three bills</hi>)—these are written so illegibly that I should not like to give my opinion as to the handwriting or the signature.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any practice with respect to the surveyor or any other officers of customs, on the valuation of good by the landing-waiter and importer, as to the payment of any larger sum of money, and taking the goods themselves for the Crown? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The landing-waiter and importer must agree before the delivery of the goods—If goods are valued at a less value than the Crown thinks riht, it has the pre<lb/>emption, by its officers, of saying, "I will pay so much, and take the goods—in the event of the value not being approved by the landing-surveyor and landing-waiter, they are taken possessions of for the benefit of the Crown, adding 10 percent—this blue book shows the name of H. Jones as the landing-waiter on this occasion—I believe this book is in Jones's handwriting—it was deli<lb/>vered to him for his examination—he makes his entry, returns it to the Registrar; and if he demands it again before the goods are delivered, he receives it; if not, it remains with the Registrar, on his certifying the true examination of the goods—it is very common thing for persons importing goods to employ an agent. Who represents himself as the importer for the purpose of working the goods through the Custom-house it is the duty of the landing-surveyor to attend the examination—Mr. M'Vicar was the surveyor on this occasion—the Custom-house agent is not a servant paid by the Cus<lb/>toms—the Customs-house has nothing to do with him except his licence—he places an arbitrary value on the goods to be cleared the sufficiency of which is determined upon by the officers of the Crown.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now that the landing-surveyor ought to inspect the goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is always presumed to do so—there are three landing-surveyors for the legal, quay department—they have to super<lb/>intend sometimes twenty landing-waiters, sometimes thirty, and sometimes forty—at times, when busy on the legal quay, there may be forty examining and landing goods by weight ten at a time be examining—I am not in that department myself, but I know the practice—in the assessment of goods for duty, the landing-surveyors are supposed to know the true value of the goods which they so assign for—I never was there myself—this is Jones's handwriting on the perfect entry, "Correct: H. Jones"—"Value approved: N. M.," are Mr. M'Vicar's initials.</p>

               <p>to the Registrar's office, or to the Queen's warehouse, if to addressed—upon application being made to the registrar, an order would be issued to the tide-waiter on board the vessel for the delivery of the packages—when landed, they would be put in charge of the officer at the quay or wharf, wherever it might be—the registrar's clerk makes out what is called a blue book, which has on the cover the name of the vessel, the captain, and the port; also, the date of the report, underneath the seal, where the landing surveyor signs his name, or close to it—the clerk in the registrar's office enters the particulars contained in the bill of sight in the blue book, and the name of the person who takes out the bill of sight, the marks and numbers of the packages, the date, and all the particulars—the blue book is then delivered to the landing-waiter for the examination of the goods—the examination is made by the landing-waiter and the importer, or his agent—they generally take an account at the same time as the landing-waiter, and thereupon proceed to the Long-room and perfect the entry, and either put a duty on the goods, or enter them to be warehoused—the goods are not always examined by the landing-surveyor—occasionally the landing-surveyor re-examines and ap<lb/>proves of the value of such goods as are subject to <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duties—the value is sometimes ascertained by samples produced; and if not satisfied, the landing-surveyor's duty would be to proceed further—it is the practice that a value should be ascertained for such goods as pay <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duties—clocks are goods of that description—the importer in the first instance, upon examining the goods, takes out a bill of sight, that he may ascertain what that real value is—he then enters the goods accordingly, and it would then be for the landing-surveyor, conjointly with the landing-waiter, to ascertain that that value is correct—there is sometimes a communication between the landing waiter and the importer at the time the goods are examined, and particularly with regard to clocks—there is generally a stated value of-4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for wooden clocks—it is not usual to enter any value in the blue book when a bill is taken out—the value is on the warrant, or perfect entry.</p>

                  </hi>. In April, 1842, I was a landing-surveyor, I am now re<lb/>tired—I see my initials on this perfect entry, sanctioning the value—clocks are admitted at a value as distinguished from a rated value—it is the duty of the landing-surveyor to examine those goods as far as his time renders prac<lb/>ticable—it is not his practice to empty all the cases and count all the articles—the value of clocks is a kind of compact value, generally 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a clock, and seeing they were Dutch clocks was quite sufficient—it is not the duty of the landing-surveyor to ascertain the number, but of the landing-waiter—he keeps a memorandum of the number, and I take it on his account—the value sometimes deviates, but it is generally 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for this description of goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney and solicitor, and reside in Bury-street, St. Mary-axe. I have a client named Michael, of Houndsditch—in the sum<lb/>mer of last year I was retained by him to prosecute an action on three bills of exchange against Moses Myers—these, are the bills—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—Myers is an indorser of this one for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and by procuration of the one for 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I sued Myers on all the three bills—I had proceeded against other parties long before—he had paid 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of the one for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and paid the rest into Court—a <hi rend="italic">noli pros.</hi> was entered as to that bill—there had been a demurrer on the two bills—in Feb. last the action on the two bills was at issue, and notice of trial given for the Assizes—the bills were in my office, and the briefs preparing by Mr. Jukes, my principal clerk—he had the bills before him on the 26th of Feb. and for some days before—John Isaac</p>

               <p>Sidney is a relative of mine by marriage—on the 20th of Feb. he made a disclosure to me, and in consequence of information from him I immediately proceeded to inspector Todhunter, and made arrangements with him—between three and four o'clock that afternoon I was in an office where Mr. Jukes and myself are at times—Todhunter was in an adjoining office, and Jukes in the same office—the bills were on the desk in an office in which nobody was—there are three offices—on a certain communication being made to me, I opened the door, went into the office where the bills were, and found Sidney and the prisoner there—I said nothing—Todhunter followed me immediately, and im<lb/>mediately laid hold of the prisoner as well as Sidney, and commenced searching Sidney—he did not know himself which had the bills—he then commenced searching the prisoner, and found in his left-hand coat pocket this piece of paper with the particulars on it of the bill for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., Myers on Cohen, which corresponded with the bill which had been settled, and these three bills were also taken from the prisoner's pocket—his hand was in his pocket—it was drawn out with the three bills clenched in his fist—they were pinned together on a piece of paper, as they had been all the time I held them—this paper had been given to me by Sidney on the Mon<lb/>day when he gave me the information.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Sidney been related to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From his infancy—I married his sister—he has been engaged during the last four or five years with his father, who is an attorney residing in the City—his father apprenticed him to a furrier, but he had not constant employ—he was continually at my office endeavouring to obtain employ—I employed him to serve writs and notices—Jukes has been with me upwards of ten years—the business was never carried on in Jukes's name, nor in Sidney's name—I was not in practice part of that time, but no business was done then, my office was closed—I was absent about three months—Jukes did not carry on my business, and share the profits during that time—I never saw the prisoner before the 26th of Nov—nobody was present when Sidney handed me this paper—he requested to see me privately, and gave it me in my private parlour—he spoke to me first in my office—he was about half an hour in my parlour—I afterwards took him into the office where Mr. Jukes and my son were sitting, and I stated the account he had given me in the presence of Jukes and my other clerks—he came to me I think between eleven and one o'clock—I had no conversation with him on the subject before—I swear that most positively—the bills were generally locked with others in my iron chest at night—the chest is open in business hours, and the bills which are required taken out—there were no other bills on the desk—Sidney has accepted two bills for me, never more—I think one was about nine months ago, and the other four or five months—they were for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I knew at that time he was pennyless—I was at that time employing him to serve writs—I saw the bills on the desk, and believe Jukes had placed them there—they were among other papers relating to the case—Jukes and I saw the officer search Sidney—I did not suggest that he was not the person who took the bills—Mr. Jukes said he saw the prisoner take them, and to the best of my belief he stated it was no use searching Sidney as the other man had the bills—I will swear he said so—the Lord Mayor considered it best that Sidney should go to gaol for his own protection, and to insure his coming forward—I never had any quarrel with Mr. Myers—I was once his attorney—we had no dispute—I suppose he was dissatisfied, but he never expressed dissatisfaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to the prosecutor—I have known the prisoners eighteen months or two years. On the 13th of Feb., about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, from that to half-past, I was returning home, and saw them coming down Lamb's-buildings together towards Leggatt's house—I had occasion to stop for a minute, and after that went towards my own house, and thought I saw one of their legs in the prosecutor's front parlour window, but was not certain—I stopped and watched for a short time, and then saw the window-shutters come open, and one of their heads put out—in a short time the prisoner Law came from down Lamb's-passage towards Leggatt's house—I had not seen him come from the house—he was coming up to the door—I made a shuffling noise with my feet, and he went away again—he was about ten yards from the house—I did not see that he had anything with him—I lost sight of him for about a minute—he went down to the bottom of Lamb's-passage—I heard <hi rend="italic">"Jack,</hi>" or something, called from Leggatt's house—Law then came back, and went towards the house—I made a shuffle with my feet—he was then two or three yards from the door, and he walked off in a direction from Mr. Leggatt's house towards me—he passed me—I am certain it was Law—(I had not seen him in the house—when I first saw them walking together they were five or six yards from the house, and in conversation with one another—I then went in doors, and sent my sister for a policeman)—I went to my own door, and, after being there four or five minutes, I saw</p>

I was coming down High-street, Poplar, and near the prosecutor's house I heard a noise of glass breaking, and a sort of rumbling noise—there were three wagons laden with meat drawn up there—I went under the body of the wagons, and saw two men standing against the door of the White Horse public-house, and the prisoner on the rails in front of the prosecutor's shop window, which are about two feet high—he jumped off the rails, and ran up North-street—the other two ran up the same street before him—I followed the pri<lb/>soner, and kept in step with him, and sprang my rattle—another constable, who had kept on the other side of the horses, was closer to him, and secured him—I knew him before by sight, and am confident he is the man—he was not out of my sight—I found the iron bar which goes along the shop shutters lifted up at the two iron rests—two shutters were down, and a square of glass broken—I knocked the prosecutor up—Hart brought the prisoner to the shop, and he said, "It was not me broke the glass, it was my two mates; but here, I will pay for the glass"—I said, "No, we don't do business in that way"—I took him to the station, and searched him—he had nothing but a knife—he had no money to pay with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at No. 8, Wentworth-place, Mile-end-road. On Friday, 1st March, I went out in my chaise with Mr. Oldmeadow—I returned home about half-past nine o'clock in the evening—I am sure it was past nine—I went in doors—I observed that the window was not broken at that time—about a quarter past ten I was called out—I went out, and crossed the road, through Assembly-place—I saw the prisoner there with Oldmeadow—I assisted him in picking up some cigars—this band was also found at the place, which I can swear to having put on the cigars in my shop—the cigars exactly correspond with those I lost—about a quarter of an hour after, I examined my shop window, and found a third of the square broken out, which was space sufficient for a hand to be put in, and the bundles taken out—I missed a bundle of cigars from the window, and a great number of bundles had rolled close to the opening, and would have rolled through had it not been blocked up with boxes.</p>

I went out with Mr. Jones in his <hi rend="italic">gig</hi> on the 1st of March—we returned about half-past nine o'clock—he went in doors, and I took the chaise to the stable—about ten minutes or a quarter past ten, as I was crossing the road, returning to the shop, I saw the prisoner at the window, going from one end of it to the other, in a stooping position—he did not see me—I went towards the window—one shutter was put up, and the man was coming down with another to put up—I saw the prisoner run away from the window—I followed him across the road, laid my hand on him, and said, "What did you do against that shop window just now?"—he said, "What?"—I said, "What did you do at that shop win<lb/>dow?"—he walked about three yards, till we got by Assembly-passage, when he struck me under the chin, and said, "What the h—is that to you?"—I staggered back a little, and he ran down a passage as hard as he could—I followed, crying, "Stop thief"—while following him, I saw him hurl some<lb/>thing from him up against a dark corner—it struck against the wall, and something rattled about—I did not know at the time what it was—I conti<lb/>nued chasing him, hallooing, "Stop thief"—a boy was also running, hal<lb/>looing too—when he got to the end of the passage he made a little bit of a shoot to the corner, and then came walking gently back—I never lost sight of him—I was close to him—a policeman ran from the other side of the way, and took him into custody—he was brought back, in my presence, to the spot where I had seen him hurl something against the wall—the policeman lent me his lantern—I looked on the ground, and saw some cigars lying all around—I picked some up—Mr. Jones came up, and also picked up some—after we returned from the station, I saw this band picked up, about a yard and a half from the corner, opposite where the things had struck against—the passage is not very wide—I have been by the place since, and find it is a dark corner, where there are two or three coach-houses.</p>

I went with the prosecutor to Joseph Stanborough's lodgings in Oldchurch-street, Great Stanmore, about half-past twelve o'clock on the 18th—I found Hannah there, and Joseph was outside with the prosecutor—I apprehended him, and told him it was on sus<lb/>picion of stealing Blakeby's fowls—he said he knew nothing about them—I went into the house, and saw Hannah—I asked her to show me her room—she took me to an upstairs room, and there was no fire-place—I asked her what she had got for dinner—she said, "Nothing"—I asked her where she cooked it when she had any—she asked me, why, did I think she had got the fowls?—I said, I did not know—we came down, and went into another room, where there was a large fire and kettle—I asked her what was in it—she said, beef, potatoes, dumplings, and carrots—she took out the beef—I said, was that all?—she said, "Yes"—I found the greater part of the fowls in it—I took Joseph inside, and found some feathers in his bosom, and in the room I found some more feathers, corresponding with them—I then went back to the house—Hannah said she knew nothing of the fowls, but she had found them on the table, and her son said, when she asked whose they were,"Never mind, they are mine"—I traced feathers from their house nearly a mile to<lb/>wards the prosecutor's—he said one fowl was a small one, and one an old hen—the necks I have here exactly correspond with that description.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was passing by; this boy asked me where I was going; he said he picked these handkerchiefs up.</p>

Mr. Hawkins was attending the jury here, and I was in his warehouse in Half-moon-passage, Whitechapel—the prisoner was there—I desired him to take a chest down, weigh it, and take it to the shop—it was about half or three parts full of tea—I fancied he was longer than usual about it—I went into the lower floor where I desired him to take it, and found him leaning over the chest with the lid open—it had been fastened down with a peg when it was up stairs—he had no business to open it—there was a hasp to it, and it shut with a kind of spring—it would not open very easily unless the hasp was lifted with the hand—I told him he was a long time about it, and he took it round to the shop—I looked about where I found him leaning over the chest, and found the soda scoop, which had no business in the room—I examined it and found some particles of tea adhering to it—the scoop was generally kept in the soda cask, in the stable—I had been in that floor a few minutes before, and the scoop was not there—I found this bag of tea between two small tubs, close by where the chest stood, when he was leaning over it—he afterwards returned from the shop with the empty chest, and took it into the stable, passing by the place where I had found the tea—I had the tea in my hand at the time in the counting-house—he afterwards walked out of the warehouse, and I saw nothing more of him that day—he did not come back to his business, nor say</p>

               <p>a word to me before he went—he came again next morning—I have examined the tea in the bag, and in my opinion it is the same that had been in the chest—I cannot find any appearance of dirt, as if it had been on the ground and required cleaning and sifting—the warehouse floor has been swept—it was damp with molasses and runnings of sugar, and dirty saw-dust carried with the feet—there were one or two particles of the tea adhering to the floor, as if they had fallen from the scoop—there was no appearance of a chest having been upset—the tea that was in the bag was worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

About six o'clock in the evening of the 10th of Feb., the prisoners came to our shop to look at some shawls—they were shown a good many, but did not like any—the young man who was showing them went to another part of the shop for another shawl, and Heffren concealed one shawl under another shawl on the counter—then the young man went to another part of the shop for another shawl, and I saw Adams take that shawl and put it under her own—they then bought one, and paid half-a-crown on it—a young man came up and said that was not the way we did business, they roust pay for it or give their address—they declined that, and Heffren said she would come with her aunt on Monday and pay the remainder—I then told him what had happened, and he sent for an officer, who came, and in the mean time the shawl was found lying on the floor two or three yards from where the prisoners sat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">W. Smith's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor said "Let me out"; I said "I can't; he said, "I will give you all the money I have to let me out;" he gave me the money, and I thought it was halfpence, and in the morning I saw it was a half-crown; I said to him "Here is a half-crown;" he said, "No, I have got that;" I said "No, you have not;" he then said, "Keep it and divide it between you."</p>

I went to Mrs. Price's shop, in Cripplegate—I there saw thirty-four pairs of our boots and two pairs of shoes—I went borne, and told the prisoner to come with me to Mrs. Price's, and in going she said, "What do you want?"—I said, "You will see when you get there"—I said to Mrs. Price, "Is this the person who sold you the things?"—she said it was—the prisoner said, "Do you mean to say I sold them all?"—Mrs. Price said, "Yes you did."</p>

On the 5th of March I was standing in my parlour, about a quarter past eleven o'clock—I saw the two prisoners and another boy pass—they turned back, and one of the three took a piece of mutton—I ran out, and caught Horton, with something—I took the mutton from under his jacket—I then caught Flynn, and took them both into my shop—I am sure they were together.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dry salter, and live in Spicer-street, Brick-lane. On the 20th of Feb. Smith came to my house about four o'clock in the afternoon—he asked if we were buyers of garblings, which are the sift<lb/>ings of cochineal—I looked at the sample which he produced—it was not grablings, it was granilla—I said I did not think it would suit as, but he had better leave the sample, and call again in half an hour—he left it, and came again—we asked what he wanted for it—he said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and he had got about 1cwt. of it—(the market price was about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pound)—we agreed to give him the price he asked, in order to get the goods—he went away, and came back in about half an hour with Maynard, who had the bag on his back containing the granills—he put it down, and I told them they had better place it in the scale, and we would see the weight of it—they did so—the month was open, and I saw it contained granilla the same as the sample—it weighed 1cwt. 2qrs. 9Ibs. gross—it was not in such a sack as granilla is ordinarily packed in, but like a corn or potato sock—I said I could not pay them till my father came in—I had received information of the robbery, and my father had given instructions to the police—Teakle the officer came in—I believe he asked one of the prisoners where he got the granilla from and he answered he did not know—they were then taken into custody—this is the sack in which it was brought.</p>

I found this property on the prisoner, at a quarter past five o'clock, on the 2nd of Feb.—he was coming out of Mr. Fox's yard—I asked what he had got in his basket—he said I might look—I asked him a second time, and he said potatoes, which he was going to take to Marshall, at the railroad police; that the were some his master had, and he was going to take them to change—I asked if his master knew it—he said, "Yes"—asked if his master was at home—he said, "No"—I took him back, and Mrs. Fox said he was not allowed to take any<lb/>thing off the premises—I took him out, and Mrs. Fox saw him throw some<lb/>thing away—I took him back, and found in his pocket three pints of oats, and two candles in his hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Spencer, of Blue Coat-street, Deptford New-town. At the time in question we lived at No. 5, Giffin-street, Deptford, at the house in which the prisoner and her husband lived—we were lodgers there—we moved into the house in March last—I knew them for more than three months, living in that house—I knew the little boy and the other child—they occupied two rooms in the lower part of the house, and we the top room front—I remember the Prisoner's husband going out on the 10th of Jan. last about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the morning—I did not see him again till be<lb/>tween half-past five and six—he then came up stairs into my room—he appeared in a state of very great alarm, and fell backwards on the bed in a fainting fit—in consequence of what he said I went down stairs into the room occupied by him and his wife, and saw the prisoner lying on the bed with her throat cut in a very, dreadful state, and the two children also lying on the bed with their throats cut—the parents were in very bad circumstances, very much distressed indeed—the husband was unable from ill health to do any hard work—I heard his wife say that he has never earned one penny since the birth of the youngest child, which was about a year and eight months old—he had nothing to live on as far as I know, except the small sums he collected from the lodgers in the house, out of which he had to pay his rent—he had the whole house, and let part of it—I know that they were in the habit of pawning the greatest part of their furniture and wearing apparel to obtain food for them<lb/>selves and children—they treated the children with the greatest kindness and affection—the children's clothing was very poor indeed—they had parted with some of it, there was very little, just enough left to keep them clean—I never saw anything on the part of the husband but the greatest kindness to the wife—they both appeared to me anxious to conceal their exceeding poverty—the woman more particularly was anxious to avoid exposure—I had spoken to her on the subject of her distress, and recommended her to go to Mr. Warman, the relieving officer, and ask his advice whether she could obtain anything for the family—she did not go—she did not assign any reason why not—at times I firmly believe the children to have had nothing but a bit of bread and butter and a few potatoes and a bit of salt for the whole day—I have known when the children have had a small portion of food, the parents have gone without—on one occasion the children went two days on two penny loaves, and both father and mother went without—at times the prisoner com<lb/>Plained heavily of her head, and has often said she was afraid she should loss her senses—she complained of pains in her head, and her mind wandering—at times she did not appear to know what she was about—she has lost herself in teaching the infants their prayers—she has forgotten what she was say<lb/>ing—I have been present—she borrowed a penny of me on the very day be<lb/>fore this happened to get half a pint of porter, as she felt so very faint.</p>

               <p>and butter—about twenty-five minutes to six in the evening I heard a terrible noise in the house—I opened my room door, which is on the first floor—they lived below—the noise came from up stairs, from Mrs. Spencer's—something was told me, and I found out what had happened—I went below into the pri<lb/>soner's room, and saw the children and Mr. Dickinson with their throats cut—I heard her speak several words—I never left her till half-past two o'clock in the morning—she inquired after her husband, to known where he was gone, several times—she did not say anything about this circumstance that I heard—she always appeared a very kind and affectionate mother—I never asked any questions as to whether they were in distress—I never made any acquaint<lb/>ance with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Deptford, and am chruchwarden of the parish. I went to the prisoner's house about six o'clock, and found the husband in the front-room—not where the murder was committed—he gave me some account of it—I saw a razor—when I first went down, seeing the bodies lying in that dreadful state, and supposing all the three murdered, I thought it probable the husband might have done it—the two rooms opened into one—the prisoner laid on the bed—she could see her husband quite as plainly as I could, and could also hear what I said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>had given her no promise to induce her to make my declaration—she appeared anxious to exculpate her husband from any guilt—while in the room the husband had told me he kept his razor on a shelf—he did not say where he first found it—he said in the evening, when he first came home, and saw his wife lying in that state, that the razor was lying by her side, and he removed it from the mattress, and put it on the dresser—the prisoner said, after she had cut the throats of her children she cut her own throat, that she then fell back exhausted on the bed, and thought it was not done effec<lb/>tually—in the evening she said in the presence of a reverend gentleman who was there, that she did attempt to do it the day before, but her heart failed her—she appeared in great agony of mind, upbraiding herself with her wickedness—the state of the room indicated very great poverty indeed—there was no bed or bed-clothes, only a mattress and a common rug—I found sixty-seven duplicates relating to wearing apparel, furniture, and almost every article you can imagine—there was a great many of the children's clothes carefully laid in boxes, and very clean and nice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About what time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five o'clock—I cannot form a judgment as to whether she was in a state to be answerable for anything she said at that time—when I arrived she was not in a state to give answers to questions, or to place any reliance on her remarks—I thought she was dying, and that was the opinion of another medical man in the room; but she became better afterwards—for many days I thought she would never recover—I do not think it would be right to attach any great weight to her answers—I have attended her from the 10th of Jan. to the 17th of Feb.—in the course of that time I have observed the state of her mind—I believe she was in a state of aberration—if she had done the act at half-past two o'clock in a state of aberration of mind, and afterwards cut her own throat, I think the discharge of blood would be very likely to relieve the brain—I first observed that her mind was wandering on the 11th, the day after the inquest—I have had experience enough to distinguish between real and simulated absence of mind—I have not the slightest reason to believe that she was affecting or pretending to be in that state—that aberration has occurred more than once in the time I have been attending her—what I observed was, ab<lb/>sence or prostration of mind, a sort of imbecility amounting, in my judgment, to unsoundness—I observed it for about a fortnight, daily, in company with other surgeons—they were precisely of the same opinion as myself—I should conclude that the state in which I found her did not result from what she had done to herself, but most likely from other causes—I think it could not have arisen from what she had done to herself—I attributed the state of mind I saw to something foreign from the wound.</p>

               <p>at that time—a few weeks after that she sat up three nights in the kitchen, without leaving it for anything whatever—she was dressed—she said she could not lie down for her head—she took no sustenance during that time in my presence—I do not know whether she did or not—I was a very few minutes absent from her—as far as I know she had no sustenance during those three days and nights—this occurred more than once—she would dress and leave her home for hours, would come back, not take any food, and go to bed in the middle of the day—she would sometimes get up the same day, not always—she would wander about without speaking to myself or the other members of the family—I had not offended her, or done anything unkind to her—I could not account for that conduct at all—on the first time that she went out she returned in the middle of the day, and went to bed—she complained of her head—this was before the accident she met with in tumbling down stairs, at my brother-in law's—after this she was very unwell, she shut herself in her room for three days again, and expressed a wish to be bled for the pain in her head—she would walk about of a night in her sleep frequently—she would get out of her bed, and go over the house, up and downstairs—often she would not associate with her friends, or the friends of her family—she would quite seclude herself from them—at times her disposition was very melancholy—when her mistress brought her home to me in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, she said she had been very unwell all day, and she feared it was the brain fever—she did not appear in a state of consciousness at that time—I bathed her head with ice water, she seemed to find relief for a time—she has been bled for this complaint of the head three times within two months—it appeared to afford her temporary relief—since she had been married, I have not had the oppor<lb/>tunity of associating so much with her as I did before—I know that she and her husband have been the prey of misfortune—she was particularly kind and quiet towards her family and children—she was an inoffensive person—never in the habit of committing acts of violence—her temper was very good indeed—when she has had these pains in her head she has become sullen and desponding—it was on these occasions that she secluded herself from her family and friends—it appeared to me at those times that her mind was affected—I thought so years before I knew anything of this—I had an aunt, named Maria March, who was deranged—she was single—she was my father's sister—she died in London I believe—I am not certain whether she died in a house of confinement, but she had been in Bethlem twelve months previous to her death—Mr. Samuel Fernoe married another of my father's sisters—he had the charge of my aunt, both before and after she was in this asylum.</p>

                  </hi>. M.D. I live at Lutterworth, in Leicestershire. In Feb. last I was making a visit to the house of Admiral Sir Robert Otway—in con<lb/>sequence of a request made to me by the ladies of Sir Robert's family, I went to the prisoner's residence, at Deptford, on the 17th of Feb.—I examined her, and found her recovering, or nearly recovered, form a disease of the brain, which in my opinion would render her incapable of judging between right and wrong—I have been present to-day, and heard the testimony that has been given on the part of the prosecution and defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Regard being had to the state in which you found her in Feb., and the facts deposed to by the wittnesses on both sides, do you or not believe that at the time she did this act, she was of sound or unsound mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most decidedly of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the disease of the brain that you found her re<lb/>covering from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Probably inflammation of the brain, a disease of the brain which produces insanity—the vessels of the brain were surcharged with blood—it was determination of blood to the head—I observed the same symptoms which I have frequently met with in case of insanity—it does not follow in all case of determination of blood to the head, that the person is of unsound mind—disease might exist for a considerable time, and an immense quantity of blood lost might relieve the brain, and prevent disorganization—my belief was that she had laboured under that disease, but that it was subsiding, that disease being a surcharge of the vessels—I had conversation with her—she certainly seemed better—she described herself as all persons do who recover from insanity, as having passed a dream—there had been great loss of blood—apart from the circumstances of the surcharge of the vessels, the anxiety</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184403040122"/>
               <p>and distress of mind might so affect the brain, that she might become insane in the course of a day or two, or in a few hours—the pains in the head, that I have heard described, are such that, with intense thinking, would produce insanity—that might produce the crime, and with loss of blood afterwards she might become sensible enough to answer the questions which I have heard of—I have heard of her complaining of pains in the head so lately as six months ago—it is form that, and form her committing this act, that I infer she did not know what she was about when she did this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had considerable experience, and paid at<lb/>tention to cases of persons affected with insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and have had insane persons under my charge in my house—insanity exhibits itself in a variety of forms; sometimes in the form of constitutional imbecility; Some<lb/>times form local causes; sometimes from disorganization of the brain, and very frequently from the pressure of blood on the brain—that would be the climax for the time being—a person labouring under insanity arising from pressure of blood on the brain, would be relieved extensively and speedily by liberal blood-letting—a person in that state cutting her own throat would be very much relieved—I have very frequently met with case of that sort—I have not the least reason to doubt that conclusion—the acts described are quite consistent with the state of mind I attribute to her at the time she was guilty of this act—anything that would lead to an increased pressure of blood on the vessels of the brain would produce the pain in the head, and the symptoms I have heard described—I do not believe that at the time the Pri<lb/>soner did this act she was an accountable being, decidedly not.</p>
