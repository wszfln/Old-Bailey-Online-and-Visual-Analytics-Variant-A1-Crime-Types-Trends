             only, lives there. On the evening of the 24th of January, about twenty minutes past five o'clock, I was shutting up the shutters - I saw the prisoner break the shop window, and take out a piece of Irish diaper; he ran about twenty yards, and threw it into the street - I was pursuing him at the time; I do not know whether he saw me - he threw it down, and ran away; I followed, and took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. BARRY. Q. Were there any other persons about? A. I did not notice - it is a crowded neighbourhood, and a great many people passing in general; I did not observe any one in particular - there is another person here who saw him throw the linen down - it is Irish diaper; I saw the window broken - I was within three yards of it; the prisoner could not fail of seeing me, as I was standing there: I think the prisoner ran one hundred and fifty yards before I took him - I was about ten yards from him when he threw the article down; it was nearly dark - I was not above twelve yards from him at any time while he was running; he only turned the corner of Houndsditch, but I did not lose sight of him, as he ran across the street - I could not have lost sight of him, I followed him so close; there were not a great many people in Houndsditch - the part of the house where the window is broken is in the parish of St. Botolph, Bishopsgate without; I do not know what the prisoner was committed for - it was for breaking the window and stealing the Irish: there is a communication from the shop to the house - Mr. Hargrave sleeps there sometimes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is there any communication with the house without coming into the street? A. Yes - the house is in three parishes; the part broken is in St. Botolph's Bishopsgate - the room in which Mr. Hargrave sleeps is in three parishes; the head of the bed is in two parishes - I sleep in the shop.</p>

            . I live at No. 21, Charter-house-street, Charter-house-square, and am a commission-salesman. On the 24th of January I was in Bishopsgate-street, near the shop of Hargrave and Theobald - I saw the prisoner skulking under their window, for what purpose I did not know; when I got within half a dozen yards of the shop I saw him drive his fist through the window, and steal a piece of diaper - he passed me within about a couple of yards; I pursued him for a distance, and raised a cry of Stop thief! Stop him! I followed him, and he threw the diaper in the street, in the carriage way - as soon as he threw it down I went and took it up; I took it into Hargrave and Theobald's shop - I gave it to a young man- the bell was rang, and Mr. Hargrave came down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The man was a stranger to you? A. Yes - I did not pursue him further when he threw it down and I took it up; he got out of my sight altogether, of course, when I turned my back on him - I called Stop of course, when I turned my back on him - I called Stop thief! Stop him! as loud as I could; I did not speak to the last witness.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live next door to Mr. Fairey. On Saturday, the 5th, I first saw the prisoners standing out side our window, together. and heard one say to the other, "Stop till he comes out;" I went to the street door, and saw the prisoner Henry take a watch out of Mr. Fairey's window; I could see that it was a watch - I saw his hand in the window, but do not know how he got it in; he directly gave it to the prisoner William, who went away down Artichoke-hill; I lost sight of him - I went into Fairey's shop; I came out, took the prisoner Henry, and took him into Mr. Fairey's shop - Fairey's son then came out with me, and I saw William come up from Artichoke-hill; I pointed him out, and the prosecutor's son took him - he brought him into the shop; I did not know either of them by sight before - I am sure Henry is the one I saw take the watch, and that he gave it to the other.</p>

            's Defence. We were returning home about a quarter to two o'clock, and passed the prosecutor's shop, and looked in - I was passing on; I thought my brother was gone - I missed him all at once, and was looking round for him; I walked on - that young man came, and told me he wanted me; I asked what for - he said I had stolen a watch, which I told him was wrong -I was taken into the shop; I deny saying we were not brothers - they said we were not brothers, but we said we were; the girl said at the shop she did not see us break the window, but only saw us looking in - then she said at the office she did not see the watch taken, but she thought it was something white, and the Policeman knows she said so the last time when we were committed; she said she saw the watch given to a third person who she never saw- she really did say so.</p>
               <p>JOHN FAIREY. I heard the girl examined at the office; she always asserted that she saw the identical watch taken, not that she saw something white: nor did she say she saw the elder prisoner give it to a third person.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You said the prisoner Henry's hand was bleeding; what do you suppose was the cause of that? A. Being cut by the glass; the blood came from his finger - the prisoners gave two false addresses; we sent and found no such persons were known there.</p>

On Sunday, the 30th of January, I went with a warrant to search their premises - it is a neat little cottage at Ponder's-end, Enfield, a four roomed house; I found the two prisoners and their wives sitting taking breakfast together - there was but one tea-pot, one loaf, and sugar-bason - I asked who the house belonged to; one of the women answered," It belongs to one as well as the other" - that they paid the rent between them; I went up stairs, leaving another person below, and in a tea-cup on the mantel-piece found a duplicate which I produce - Mrs. Glover went with me; she called herself Mrs. Glover - I brought the duplicate down and showed it to the prisoners; all four were present - Glover's wife said the property named in the duplicate belonged to her and her sister; that they bought a piece of nankeen between them, and part of it was made up - the duplicate is for a coat, breeches, petticoat, nankeen, and other things, pawned with Mr. King, of Edmonton, for 6s. 6d.; in the name of Ann Glover, Southgate; I took the prisoners into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The women told you they had bought it, and you took the men? A. Yes - I have been a coustable of Enfield some years, but know nothing of the prisoners; they did not live at Enfield.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. King, a pawnbroker, of Edmonton. On the 28th of January, a woman, who gave her name as Ann Glover, pawned some thing with me, for which I gave her the duplicate produced; there was a white petticoat among the articles pawned - I afterwards saw a woman at the office at Enfield, who I believe to be the woman who pawned them; she also came to my master's house after pawning the things - that was the night after I heard of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JOHN MEAD. When Ward was examined at the office, the two women and the prisoners were there - he pointed to Peters' wife as the woman who had pawned the things.</p>

            WARD. I have five napkins, a white petticoat, two towels, a pair of breeches, and a piece of nankeen, which I call a little coat; it is part of the property pawned by Mrs. Peters on the 28th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there any other article in this indictment which you produce, except the nankeen? A. No; the petticoat is white cotton, the nankeen is not a petticoat - it is a child's coat; and here is a piece of nankeen of three breadths.</p>
               <p>MRS. LLOYD. I know this nankeen; these three breadths formed half a petticoat - I know it to be the same; I know my cutting out, and the manner in which it is formed; this nankeen coat has the shade of the nankeen I bought, which is a shade lighter than the rest, and here is a tuck which has been taken out - it corresponds in colour, and the size of the tuck which has been taken out; it corresponds with the other part.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that coat has once been in some other shape? A. Yes - I only judge of its being mine from the mark of the tuck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Point out what you swear to the nankeen by? A. By the manner in which I cut it out - I know it by the length; I have not measured it: the three breadths are the length; they were not quite a yard and a quarter long when I cut them out - when I left it was in six separate breadths, not in its present state; the shade of the middle breadth of the coat is lighter than the other two.</p>

               <p>JOHN JONES. I live in Church-lane, Whitechapel, but on the 9th of January I lived in the parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal-green. I went out at eight o'clock that evening with my wife, leaving nobody in the house - I locked both the doors, and made the house safe; I returned at half-past' eight, and found the things all scattered about the room - when I put the key in, the door flew open; it was open - on going into the house I saw the prisoner running along the passage; I came out, shut the door, and held the knocker in my hand till I got assistance - I went in again, and heard the back door unbolted; he ran out, I after him, and caught him in the yard - he said it was all up with him; I had said nothing to him then - the people said they had caught him; he said Yes, it was all up with him - I examined, and found a drawer open in the front room; it had been shut when I left, but was not locked - there had been several articles of wearing-apparel in that drawer; the prisoner said he had taken the key out, but none of the things were taken out of that drawer, nor were they pulled about - in the back room a basket was drawn out from under the bed, the dirty linen taken out of it, and scattered about the floor - a box was turned out in the back room; it had been left unlocked, but with the lid down - I found it with the lid up and empty, and the things on the floor - the lease of my house, a policy of insurance, and a blue cloth pelisse were on a chair; they had been in the box - I cannot say whether the pelisse was on the chair or the floor; I saw the Policeman search the prisoner - he gave the Policeman eight keys, which they called skeleton - keys, in his presence.</p>

On the 30th of January I saw both the prisoners in company and conversing together - they passed me about half-past nine o'clock in the evening; I turned round, thinking I knew Kelly's face - I followed and stopped them near the Pontefract Castle, in Chapel-street; I felt Ringrose's coat-pocket, and said, "What have you got here?" - he said, "I will show you;" he immediately made a bob, and began running - I called to my brother-officer, and told him to follow him: (I had met my brother-officer, and told him I was watching them;) he caught hold of him - they struggled together; I took hold of Kelly - We brought them down to the station-house; as we went along Kelly said to Ringrose,"You have brought me into this - if I had known this, I would not have come out with you;" on arriving at the station-house, I searched Ringrose, and found three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170009"/>tea-spoons, and a caddy-spoon in his coat-pocket, a butter-knife, and thirteen keys in a silk bag; one is a street-door key, five are skeletons, the others are common ones - there is a bunch of small keys; the skeleton keys are to unlock doors - they have no wards; I found a phosphorus-box and matches on him - he said, "I suppose, Thompson, the less I say now, the better;" I told him I wanted him to say nothing to me - I searched Kelly, and found a skeleton-key in his pocket, also a pair of stockings, and a silk handkerchief I took from him - that was at Harcourt-street station-house, where I first took them to - when I took the key from Kelly, I said,"This is all wrong;" he said, "You had better take my head off" - I locked them up in the cells at that station, while some supper was brought for them, and while they were there I had forgot to search the arm of Kelly's great coat - I brought them out again, and took them to Marylebone station, and there I took off Kelly a brown great coat; he was wearing it, also a new black waistcoat, this duster, and a silk handkerchief, and a pair of new boots off his feet; the inspector found in the brown coat a blue cotton handkerchief - I did not see that found; I afterwards went back to Harcourt-street, recollecting I had not searched his arms - I looked down the privy where I had locked them up by themselves, and found a crow-bar there; I went and compared it with the impressions on the doors and places at the prosecutor's house - they had been done with this crow, or one exactly the same size; the street door had been splintered a great deal, but one mark I compared with it- I then compared it with the impressions on the parlour door; it fitted them - it is called a jemmy, but I never saw one like it; I never saw one wider, and I think not so wide without having a claw to it - all the marks in the house appeared to be made with that instrument; there was not only the impression of the sharp point, but of the round part in the door - I believe that to be the instrument that made the marks.</p>

               <p>Ringrose. At the office he said there had been a person in the lock-up place before us, and he did not search that man, and could not say which left the crow there. Witness. I did not; I had seen a drunken man carried there - he was quite a gentleman; he was taken into the cell - I went in directly after and found the crow-bar; the gentleman was searched before he was put in there, and all his property taken from him, because he was so drunk.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you make a practice to search the place after every prisoner? A. No; there was no soil on it - it was quite clean; the privy is made on a descent, so that it stuck, and if it had been there any time there must have been soil on it.</p>

This pair of new boots are mine, also this silk handkerchief, the caddy-spoon, three tea-spoons, butter-knife, black waistcoat, great coat, and blue pocket handkerchief - I know them all to be mine; I have marks on them - I have had the coat about three years; it is darned - my name is on one spoon, but not on the other two; they correspond in number with what I lost - I know the black silk waistcoat by a particular mark about the bottom; I lost a velvet waistcoat at the same time - the mark is a peek at the bottom; it is quite a new cut - there is no mark on it; it is only the form of it I speak to - I know the boots by their having the mark which my boot-maker generally puts; it is a number - I do not recollect what the number is; I have never worn them - I called at the maker's this morning, and he showed me the private-mark; an old pair was left in the room of these.</p>

               <p>Ringrose's Defence (written.) On the day mentioned, being on my return from Hampstead, where I had been to look after work at a master's that I was in the habit of working for, coming through James-street, on my road home, I found a bag, in a hollow part of the road, near Chapel-street; about five minutes afterwards, Mr. Thompson, a Policeman, came up, and asked what I had got - I instantly told him I would show him what I had got, and, without waiting for an explanation, he took me into custody to the Police-station; I instantly produced the bag, and the contents being produced was found to be the property mentioned in the indictment, of which I was entirely ignorant of: with respect to this most serious charge, as it affects mylife, I most solemnly declare I am innocent of it- I have always maintained an unimpeachable character for honesty, and never been before this or any other Court of Justice in my life, on any charge of this nature before; I have, besides, an aged mother, entirely dependant on me for support, likewise a wife and two children in the utmost state of destitution at present, therefore I humbly hope you will take my case into your consideration, and not consign an innocent man to an ignominious fate, for I am totally innocent of the crime imputed to me - I leave my case entirely in your hands, fortified in the innocence of my cause.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 11th of February, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in company with Myers and Gollocker, who are officers, and went with them to a house on <placeName id="t18310217-9-crimeloc57">Great Saffron-hill</placeName>

               <p>Q. Describe the situation the other two prisoners were in when you entered the room? A. They were all round the fire, Swift sat in the middle next to Devereux, senior, between her and her daughter, who was opposite - they all sat close together by the fire; I believe Swift was sitting down on a bag which had a few coals in it, and at the other corner sat Devereux, junior, on an old saucepan - there was a fire, an iron pot on it, and a tobacco - pipe in the pot; they had a brisk fire - there was some white metal in the pot in a liquid state; Gollocker went round and seized Devereux, senior - they had a struggle, and rolled down on the ground together; the candle was at this time either put out or knocked out - they had a candle in the room, and we had one, but it went out before we got to the door; before the candle was put out it was in the hands of the prisoner Swift, as they were sitting all round the fire - Myers secured the younger Devereux, and I caught hold of the hand of Swift; I then gave Swift into Myers' hand, and procured a light from the next house - I could get no candle in the house; when I came up stairs with the light I saw Gollocker and Devereux, senior still on the ground, and assisted him in getting her away from the moulds, which were then under her - she was laying on them, for I could feel them under her, and to prevent her from crumbling them all to pieces, I moved her away; when we had removed her, there were the broken moulds under her - they are here; there were several pieces of moulds which form a pair now they are put together, as well as they can - I picked up these six counterfeit shillings before they left the room - they had also laid under her on the ground; I first saw them on the floor just after she was removed, and exactly on the part of the floor where she had been - one was about half a yard away from her; Myers and I brought the other two prisoners to the opposite side of the room, where Devereux, senior, had been placed, and the younger Devereux said, "Spare my mother, I don't care what becomes of me;" Swift made answer and said, "it is of no use, it is all over with us, we shall be transported at any rate;" I searched Swift, but found nothing on her -I then searched the younger Devereux; she objected to my feeling in her bosom - Swift told her it was of no use, for she was sure I would search her; Devereux, junior, then put her hand into her bosom, and took out three of these counterfeit shillings - I told her I was not satisfied, and should search her further; I then untied her apron loosened her clothes, and nine others dropped from her - one had fallen from her before that, and Myers had picked it up; that was before she was searched, and before I found the three - I produce the three and the nine, the twelve are together; I then searched the place, and we then picked up the six shillings - Myers took the pot off the fire; we secured the prisoners and brought them away -Myers locked the room, and took the key with him; the next day, in consequence of what Gollocker told me, I went to the room and brought a pan away - I got the key of the room from a woman down stairs.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Any body else might have been in the room in the mean time? A. Yes - the woman hesitated at first to give it to me, but I told her who I was; the pan had the appearance of plaster of Paris having been mixed in it - I had seen it in the room when we were there the day before; it was full of dirty water.</p>

            . I am a constable of Lambeth. I and Myers applied to Hall to assist in apprehending the prisoners - we all went together; I followed Hall up stairs - when the door was open I rushed past Hall, and seized the elder Devereux; she cried out, "O Lord!" she had got her left arm up, just as if she was frightened - when I entered the room she was sitting down close to the left-hand side of the fire-place, on a basket; she had something in her right-hand - I could not say exactly what it was; her right-hand was in her lap - I seized her hand, and the candle, which Swift was holding, dropped, or went out, and we were left in the dark; Devereux, sen. threw herself down on the ground - I threw myself down also, to keep her quiet; I kept her in that position till the light came, which was in about three minutes - before the light was brought I heard something break; I thought it was the mould - it appeared something crumbling, like the breaking of chalk; the noise proceeded from under her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she perfectly still all the time? A. No, she was very restless all the time she was on the ground; both before and after I heard the crumbling I thought, from her manner of moving about, that she had something under her which she wished to break - I reached across her, and dragged her right hand from under her right hip, where the mould was.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you judge it was under her hip? A. She was so very restless - I ascertained that it was a mould as soon as the light came; I did not take it up before the light came, but kept her as quiet as I could - while she was in this position I heard something drop from her; it rang on the ground like money - when she was taken up there were six pieces of coin - Hall picked them up.</p>
               <p>Q. State what passed when the light came? A. Hall assisted me to remove her from where she was laying to the other side of the room, which I should think is about twelve feet square - there were also the pieces of mould laying on the floor where she had laid; Myers picked them up, and he has them - Myers and Hall moved the other two prisoners across the room; Hall searched them - I saw the pot on the fire, and white metal in it, which was melted, and there was a tobacco-pipe in the pot; it appeared to be to hand the metal out, and put it into the mould - here is the pot; there was a very good fire - I saw this knife laying on the floor in the room, and in the cupboard there was some plaster of Paris; I produce a file, which was on the mantel-piece in the room - it seemed as if there had been white metal in the teeth of it, and does so now; I produce about 3lbs. of plaster of Paris, which I found in a bag in the cupboard - it is in dust; I found a small piece of white metal among the ashes under the grate, similar to what was in the pot - it appears to have fallen from the top of the mould after the mould was full; I saw a pan that was full of water, but I did not take particular notice of it that night - Myers locked the door, and took the key away when we left; I went back next day with Myers, and saw the pan standing there - I did not go with Hall; I left the pan there - something struck me, as the elder prisoner was sitting by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170012"/>that she might have put something into it - here it is; there is plaster of Paris in it; there were a few hard lumps in it when I threw the water out - plaster of Paris will make a mould.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live in Newington-causeway. I went with Hall and Gollocker -Hall went up stairs first, Gollocker next, and I behind, with a small lantern; when we got to the top of the stairs Hall burst the door open, and the moment he got in he said, "There are the moulds;" he seized hold of Swift, who was in the middle - Gollocker went by him and seized Devereux, sen., who was on the left hand side; I caught hold of the younger Devereux, who was on the right hand side, and at that time a scuffle-ensued between her and myself - the candle was knocked down and went out, and at that moment my lantern went out; at that time I saw Gollocker and Devereux, sen., on the ground - I shifted my hands, and seized the youngest Devereux with my right hand; I put my left hand across the old woman, and took up this shilling, which had just fallen from her, as I suppose, for it was directly in front of her- it was so very hot when I picked it up, that I dropped it, and in dropping, it broke away from the get part, which is the substance it is poured in by; I have got both parts here - the get is the part that is not round; it fits exactly to the coin; there is a little notch over the get, where it fits; it broke in two on my dropping it - it fell on this piece of black rag, which was open, and appeared to be what the moulds had been held in; the rag had some small particles of metal about it - at that time I heard the younger Devereux shifting some money about; I told her it was of no use, she had better be quiet, for I should find it by and by, after we had got them quiet; Hall put Swift in my care while he went down and brought up a candle - after the candle came up I removed Devereux. jun. and Swift to the further corner of the room; I placed them in a chair there, and tied their hands together, one hand to the hand of the other - each had still one hand loose, and while I was so doing, this shilling dropped from Devereux, jun.; I picked it up, and produce it here - Devereux, jun. repeatedly said, "Let my mother go, and keep us;" Hall and Gollocker then removed the elder Devereux, and brought her up to where I was, and underneath where she had been this mould laid, broken in pieces, as it is now- I put them together as well as I could, with Mr. Field's assistance; they are the pieces of a mould which form both sides of a shilling - here are some small pieces, which I could not put together with it; the get fits this thick part of the mould exactly - a small file laid in the black rag; it all laid there till after we had secured the prisoners - we then picked it all up together, before we removed them from the room.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it you observed the pieces of metal in the black rag? A. At the same time as I saw the shilling, because the shilling laid on the rag - I saw it as soon as I went into the room, and I observed some small marks of metal on it, little splashes; it had fallen from Devereux, sen.'s lap, when I got in, as I was the third - it laid close to her, and I saw the shilling on it; I kept the key after the door was locked - I went back again that night, and saw the earthern pan there, with some water in it; I desired Gollocker the next morning, when we went, to pour the water off, which he did, and at the bottom of it were some hard pieces of plaster of Paris; I had observed the water in it the night before, but could not see the plaster of Paris - no one could have got in without picking the lock.</p>

               <p>Q. Hall says he got the key from a woman? A. Yes; after we had poured the water off, and had got every thing away, I left the key with the landlady of the house - we put the pan in a corner, and told Hall to go and fetch it- I should have said that I took the iron pot off the fire; it was in a very hot state, with a long tobacco-pipe in it - it is here, with its contents.</p>

            . I am a practical chemist, and am the assistant at the London University. I took a part from these moulds while they were in Myers' custody; I examined it - they are made of what is commonly called plaster of Paris: I examined some of the powder which Gollocker produced, and that is the same material - the moulds are made from the same material, and might have been made from this powder; the effect of water on plaster of Paris is to consolidate it - it becomes a perfect solid body, like this mould.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. I have seen several moulds of this description - I have had some experience in seeing implements for coining; (looking at the moulds) these now present parts of a broken plaster of Paris mould for casting shillings - parts of both the obverse and reverse sides of a shilling are visible on them now; this shilling picked up by Myers is counterfeit in all respects, and appears to have been made from this mould.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it the appearance or not of coin which is usually made by moulds of this nature? A. It has in all respects - I have seen a great many shillings which have been counterfeited by plaster of Paris moulds; they usually present this appearance when first cast - it is not finished; it has parts sticking to it, which are generally removed before it is circulated - it has the impression and perfect similitude of a shilling on both sides; nothing remains to be done but to file off the rough edge; these twelve are all of the same sort as the one - they are the same metal, and cast from the same mould, and alike in all respects; these six are the same as the twelve - they all require to have the particles round the edge removed before circulation; it is always necessary to remove the spray, as it is called - plaster of Paris moulds will not produce a shilling fit for circulation, but it will produce a perfect similitude of the figure of a shilling; this get appears to me to fit the shilling exactly; in my judgment, it is the get which was cast with that shilling - I have compared the get with the mould; it appears to fit exactly - the moulds are generally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170013"/>formed by putting a good shilling into the plaster of Paris; the channel to admit the metal to the impression is generally made with a piece of metal, or scraped out; the channels differ in size in different moulds - the get fitting the aperture of this mould leads me to suppose this shilling was cast in it; the get is the metal which fills the channel - the iron pot contains white metal similar to what the shillings are made of; I should think the metal now in the pot would make twelve or fourteen shillings, or hardly so many; these files are fit for filing the edge of the coin - one appears to have been used at white metal; the other also, in a slight degree - the impression in the mould exhibits the wrong side - the matrix; it is like the impression of a seal, the letters are reversed; the mould is hollow where the impression is to be raised.</p>
               <p>Devereux, Sen.'s Defence. I have nothing to say but that I had just come into the room, and a man came in there - I was only two days in the room; he took the room and brought these things there: I did not know any thing about it - he had hardly gone down stairs five or ten minutes when the gentlemen came to the room.</p>
               <p>Swift's Defence (written.) On the 11th of February I was on Saffron-hill, and met a woman, named Jones, who stopped me, and asked if I knew her husband - I asked his name; she said they called him Bob, and he wore a white coat; she suspected he was in Devereux's room - while talking he came up; she asked if he was coming home to tea - she asked me to tea, and said it was just by; she pressed me, and I went up - her husband went down, telling her to get tea, and he would be back directly; she asked me to go down, saying, "I think he has gone to Devereux's," she pointed to the door, asked me to go to the two pair, and ask for her husband - I knocked at the door, and somebody answered; I said was Bob there, and they opened the door - I said, "Your wife wants you, Bob," and he went down; Devereux asked where I had met his wife - I said in the street; I asked if she was not afraid to do such things as she was doing - she said,"It is nothing when you are used to it;" she asked me to sit down, which I refused - I took the candle off the chair; I heard somebody coming up whistling, and said, "Here is somebody coming;" Devereux said, "It is only Bob," she knew his whistle - I put the candle on the chair to open the door, and the officers came in; Devereux took the candle off the chair - they laid hold of the mother and daughter, and one took hold of me; I was searched, and nothing found on me- we were sent to Clerkenwell prison for another hearing -Mary Devereux went to her mother, and told her she had twelve bad shillings about her, and would sell them; she told her to do as she liked with them, she had brought her into trouble enough with them; she called Mrs. Foley, sold the shillings to her, and said, "You say it is the last you will buy of me, Mrs. Foley, but I am sorry for it;" Mary Devereux said, "You buy of my sister" - I hear they have carried on this trade a long while, and got many a young woman into trouble.</p>
               <p>Swift to MR. BARRETT. Q. Did you not see me at your house the same night that I was taken, on the 11th? A. I cannot speak exactly to the time; I recollect her being in the shop very well with another person, about dusk - I live in George-street, Hatton-garden, which is a very short way from Saffron-hill; it was either Thursday or Friday, but whether it was the day she was taken or not I cannot say - it must have been last Thursday or Friday week; she came with a stout woman, to buy some goods - I do not know her name, but I knew her by sight; it was in the evening - I do not know what they asked for.</p>

            . I keep a pawnbroker's shop, No. 104, Whitecross-street. On the 28th of January, about nine o'clock in the morning, this great coat was pawned with me for 16s.; I should consider it worth about 25s. in the trade - I suppose a tailor would charge about 3l. 10s. for it; I believe the prisoner to be the person who pawned it, but as I said at the office, I considered him rather taller at the time than he appears now - to the best of my belief he is the man.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live at No. 265, Oxford-street. On Monday, the 24th of January, about a quarter before twelve o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I bought old silver - I said we did, and he put into my hand two silver bowls of tablespoons - I saw they had been recently broken, and asked him whose they were; he said his own - I said I could not buy them, but must stop them, and he must give me his name and address - I asked his name, and he said Ford; I told him to wait a moment, but he ran out of the shop; on his going out I heard a quantity of silver rattling in his coat pocket - I therefore pursued him, calling "Stop thief!" he took the first turning out of Oxford-street, down two short streets, and was knocked down by a carpenter; I came up to him immediately - I found he had more plate in his pocket, and told the carpenter to hold one pocket; I held the other, and we took him to Mount-street watch-house - he was searched there, and I saw taken from him four more bowls of silver spoons, six handles, and six table-forks of the same pattern; I asked him whose they were: he said they were his father's; I asked if that was his father's crest on them; he said if I would go to his father it would be all right - he then gave me his right name and address, but I could not find his father, as he was from home; I saw his mother: I have kept the two which he offered to me, and the officer has the others - I consider the value of the whole, before the spoons were broken, would be 12l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have they not been used? A. Yes, a considerable time - the value depends on the weight: I am certain they would be worth more than 6l., if not 7l. for melting - I have not weighed them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What would they be worth to sell second-hand whole? A. Any body would give 9l. for them; old silver is worth 5s. an ounce - I weighed the two bowls; they were rather more or less than 2 1/2 ozs. - I think it was more.</p>

On Wednesday, the 2nd of February, I went to bed about a quarter-past eleven o'clock; the house was then fastened - two female servants and the boy were up when I went to bed; one female servant and the boy are here - it is my invariable practice to examine the doors myself every night; I did so that night - they were all fast; a little after six o'clock in the morning, the boy came up and alarmed me - I went down stairs, and perceived every thing in the front parlour in very great disorder, and a great deal of property gone; there was about 300l. worth gone - I looked over the house, and on going down to the back kitchen, I found an entry had been made at the back door, by cutting a piece out of the door and unbolting it; I had seen that door myself overnight - it was then safe; when it became day-light, we found a ladder from the adjoining house to mine - the two houses join within about four feet; there is an addition of a back room built out at the next house, and at the back part of my house is a yard covered in; the houses are not quite close together - on the back room, which is built out from the next house, I saw some pieces of cuttings of scarlet cloth, by which I suppose the property was taken out that way; I had scarlet cloth in my house - I saw footsteps on the snow, leading to the back of an empty house in George-street; there appeared a good many footsteps - I then went round to the empty house, and saw a female named Woodward, who had the care of it; in the back room coming from that yard, there were several pieces of scarlet cloth and a quantity of wadding, which some of the dress coats that had been taken from my house had been wrapped up in - I found them in the room of the empty house, leading from the yard to where I traced the footsteps, and in the kitchen of the empty house, I found three silver spoons belonging to me - I went into the front kitchen there, and saw there had been the same sort of work at the door of that house as well as mine; a piece was cut out of the centre of the door where the bolt was, exactly the same as mine - that is the door leading from the kitchen to the stairs; there was no mark of any force having been used to any of the outer doors of that house, no appearance of their having been broken open - I returned home, and sent to Marlborough-street Office for Ballard; I missed from my house a full dress coat for the West Somerset Yeomanry, worth about 30l., a full dress coat for the Grenadier Guards, worth upwards of 30l., and the front part of the embroidery of a coat for the Coldstream Guards; I missed altogether about thirteen coats, I think five epaulettes, between sixty and seventy yards of woollen cloth, more than that of kerseymere, and about twelve yards of velvet - that was all my property; some of the coats were made for gentlemen, and not sent home - also a pair of boots belonging to my servant, David Webster: I should know my property again - it was all safe there on the Wednesday evening; I questioned Mrs. Woodward, who was looking after the empty house - she is not here; I was present when Coy and Thompson were apprehended by Ballard - they had property belonging to me in their possession at that time; they were apprehended in Dean-street, Soho, about three o'clock in the afternoon of the Saturday following - Coy had a bundle, with two pieces of scarlet cloth in it; Thompson had a kind of a hand-basket with two coats in it - I do not think any thing was said at that time; I know the cloth belonged to me, and one of the coats - we got a warrant to search a muffinbaker's shop, in Hanway-yard, kept by the prisoner Gast; the officers Ballard, Goddard, Schofield, and myself went there on the Saturday - Gast was in the house, and while we were searching, Ellis came in with a bundle: Ballard took him into custody, and on opening the bundle there was a coat in it belonging to me - we only found in Gast's house about eight yards of cloth belonging to me, in three remnants; we then went to No. 11, Tottenham-court-road, kept by the witness Thompson, a hosier - Ballard, Goddard, and myself went in, and in the front attic of that house we discovered a great quantity of my property; there was all the embroidery of the regimental coats, the epaulettes, five or six other coats, a quantity of blue cloth, and two regimental coats - the whole of them were my property; there was a great variety of other property, which was not mine - I saw nothing of the prisoner Thompson there; they are two distinct persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any partner? A. No - my house was broken open on the Wednesday night or Thursday morning, and I went to Gast's house on the Saturday, about five o'clock in the afternoon; he was at home - I believe he is married; there was a family there - I have heard that Ellis is Gast's son-in-law, and lodged in the house; at least when we took the black cloth found there, it was asked whose room that was in, and it was said to be Ellis' - the eight yards were cut or torn into three pieces; I think it was on the second floor - there are no back rooms; I was down stairs at the time, but when I came up it was on a chest of drawers - I think it had been found before I got up; I was called down once or twice; Goddard and Schofield<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170017"/>were in the room - I did not find it; I have the head ends of it, and the list to compare with it, and have a private-mark on one piece - my name is not on it; he certainly could not tell it was mine by any mark - I did not know Ellis before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many persons sleep in the house? A. Myself, my wife, three female servants, five children, and a boy; the next house was not empty - it was a house in George-street; a door inside that house had been broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that towards the back part of the premises? A.No, the front - I cannot tell whether the door of that house had been closed the night before of course; I found the inner door broken the same as my own door - Ballard was present when we took Coy and Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say at that time nothing was said? A. I said I did not hear any thing pass.</p>

I went to bed on the Wednesday night, between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock - I do not know whether I was the last person up; the house was safe - I got up next morning about a quarter-past six, and was the first person up; I sleep down stairs - the first thing I saw was the parlour door open, which is on the ground floor; I sleep on that floor - that door was shut over night; I saw it shut - I saw the cases the regimental coats were kept in were standing open and empty; Mr. Chambers' great coat and another coat laid on the floor - I immediately went up and alarmed master, who came down; I went with him into the back kitchen on the area floor, and saw a piece was taken out of the door and a hole made to put their fingers through to undo the bolts; the door was open - I went to the front kitchen, and the two female servant's drawers were open, I missed a pair of boots of mine out of the cupboard - on the Friday Goddard and Ballard brought the prisoner Clifford to master's house: I saw him in the parlour - Ballard told him to take one of the boots off which he had on; he did so, and Ballard asked me if they were mine - I said they were; he had both my boots on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the same night into the back kitchen again after the examination? A. I was walking through the back kitchen in the dark - it was dusk; I kicked a boot before me - I got a light, and found the fellow to it; they did not belong to me - I inquired of all the men in the house, and they did not claim them; I delivered those boots to Ballard - they were very old ones, and I had only worn mine once.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did not Clifford say, in your presence, that he had bought the boots at the Three Compasses, New-cut, Lambeth? A. No, he did not: I did not see the other boots put on his feet - I do not know of their being an inch and a half too long for him; Mr. Chambers did not, by any promise or threat, attempt to get any confession from Clifford.</p>

I went to Mr. Chamber's house on the Thursday morning, and saw the front parlour in great disorder; the things were laying about - the epaulette boxes and things were about; I requested Mr. Chambers to show me which way he conceived they had got in; the entrance of the house was effected through the sky-light of his workshop - it is an upright sky-light; the window opens at the side - it was open; it could be opened very easily - there appeared to be no fastening to that; it opened and shut by pullies from the inside - it could be opened from the outside by a person putting their hands on the frame and pushing it down; there was a string hanging from the inside of the window, by which they could let themselves down, and then descend into the house by a flight of stairs - the strings belong to the window; they could let themselves down into the body of the shop, which is about ten feet, by taking hold of the cord - they then had to descend a flight of stairs, at the bottom of which is a door communicating with the back kitchen - a hole was cut through that door in the corner, just above the bottom stile, sufficient to admit two or three fingers to work back the bolt; it was some holes bored, and then broken through - it had been bored by a large gimblet of this description(producing one), which is broken, and part of it was found on Mr. Chambers' premises; it was given to me by Mr. Chambers' servant - here is the broken piece; this hammer was given me also by Webster, I think.</p>

            . Outside the sky-light, in the snow, was the print of a person's feet standing and moving about, and marks of their fingers where they had laid their hands in different parts on the top of the sky-light and different parts of the window; there were the marks of persons' feet going over the back premises of other houses to the empty house in George-street - they had to cross one person's premises entirely to get to it; there were the tracks of three or four persons, and in the yard of the empty house were a great number of foot-marks, and in the back room of the empty house I saw some wadding and cuttings of scarlet cloth laying about - I then proceeded down stairs in the empty house, and found a door which communicates from the front kitchen to the foot of the stairs, cut just above the middle stile, where there was a bolt to fasten it; a hole had been bored, and then broken through, so as to admit fingers to get to the bolt to unfasten it the same way as the other, and on the board of one of the windows, inside, was a great quantity of tools belonging to a bell-hanger who had been working at the house at bell-hanging - there were no marks on the door there, but on going into the front area there were marks on the wall of a person's toe, as if a person had scraped it by dropping down into the area, and a mark of one heel in the snow, close up against the wall, and at the window which was nearest to the cistern, there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170018"/>were marks of a person having got in at that window, the shutters of which were not fastened: I then inquired for the person who had charge of the house, and from information received from Mrs. Woodward, I went in search of the prisoner Woodward, at No. 9, Fullwood's-rents - he was not there; I searched the room, and left Goddard there - I saw Goddard there myself till eleven o'clock; on the following morning, Friday, I went with Goddard to No.53, Cirencester-place - Goddard proceeded up stairs, and brought Clifford down to me in the shop, and upon asking him a few questions I desired him to put his feet up, and said, "Where did you get these shoes?" he said,"I bought them;" I said when - he said yesterday; I said where - he said over in the New-cut; I said where there - he said in the skittle-ground of the Three Compasses, kept by a man of the name of Pople; I asked what he gave for them - he said 10s.; I asked if he knew the person he bought them of - he said No, he did not, he was a stranger; I asked if the landlord was present - he said No; I asked if the pot-boy was - he said the pot-boy came in and out, he did not know that he saw him; I asked what he had done with his old ones - he said he had thrown them over the bridge into the river as he came back; we then took him to Mr. Chambers', showed 
               <persName id="t18310217-13-person271">Webster</persName>
             the shoes, and he claimed them as his - we then took him to the office, where I desired him to take off the shoes he had then on, and to put on one of the old ones which I had received from Webster; the shoe itself was evidently too long for him, but the marks of his toes evidently came where the marks of the toes were in the shoes - here are marks of Jumps or bunions on the shoes at the same place in the old shoes, which were found, as in the new ones, which were taken off his feet - there is the same tread.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean on the upper leathers, or on the soles? A. On the upper leathers; in consequence of information received I went with Goddard to Rupert-street, on the Saturday, and after waiting a considerable time I saw Coy go into a house; he came out in about half an hour, went down into Princes-street, from there to Wardour-street, and then returned home again to Rupert-street, and after stopping in doors some time he came out, and proceeded at a fast pace, walking fast, and running up to Mr. Young's, Marshall-street, Golden-square, just by Carnaby-market; after some time he came out again, and proceeded faster than before - Goddard and I followed him through Soho-square, across Oxford-street, and into Hanway-street- I did not see him go into Gast's house myself, but after waiting about an hour and a half Goddard left me, and before he returned I saw Coy come out of Gast's house, with a bundle under his arm - he had no bundle when I followed him before; I ran out from where I was standing, and in Oxford-street saw Coy, and then, for the first time, I saw Thompson in his company - he had a basket in his hand; when I got out of Hanway-street they were about the middle of the street, talking together; I had not seen them join each other - Mr. Chambers was with me - I allowed them to go on down Dean-street, as far as Walker's hotel; I then took hold of Coy, and Mr. Chambers secured Thompson - we put them into the hotel immediately; I secured them, and requested Mr. Chambers to go for a coach, which I put them into, and took them to the office; I told Coy at the office there had been a robbery committed, and a great quantity of cloth stolen; this was not taken down in writing - I said did he choose to say any thing about it, he might do as he liked; I untied his bundle, and found it contained this scarlet cloth - he said he had got it of young Gust, and that Gust lived at a muffin-shop in Hanway-street - that he received it from him in the bakehouse, and he was going to sell it for him, for the purpose of getting a few shillings - I asked him if he knew any thing about any coats; he said he did not; I asked if he had been offering to sell any coats to any person - he said No, he had not - that Thompson had two coats to try to sell, but he knew nothing about them; I asked if he knew any thing about any cloth - he said he did not; I desired Goddard to see what Thompson had in the basket, which he did - I had no conversation with him about it; Coy, at the office the same evening, pointed out Ellis as the person he had received the scarlet cloth from; this was in Ellis' presence: I do not think the Magistrate was there, but at all events it was not when any deposition was taken; the Magistrate lives in the house; a message was sent up to say that they were ready, and I think it was before he came down; I am, however, sure that it was not taken in writing - it was said in Ellis' presence, and he made no answer to it; we proceeded to get a search-warrant, and went off to the house in Hanway-street - the prisoner Gast was making muffins at the back part of the shop; I told him we had a warrant to search his house - he asked for what; I told him for woollen cloth and other articles, and while I was searching the front parlour he said, "Well, but what are you searching for?" and shortly afterwards he said, "But I have not seen the warrant;" I showed it him - he wanted to copy it; I said I could not stop to give him a copy at that time; Mr. Chambers, Goddard, and Schofield were up stairs, searching; I was down stairs in charge of the door, and after standing there some time Ellis came in - he had this coat, tied in this handkerchief, under his arm; I said,"Here I am, waiting for you - what have you here?" he said a coat; I said, "Where did you get it?" he said, "I bought it;" I asked of whom - he said of a man named Jones, but he did not know where he lived, he had only seen him at a public-house; I said, "Where were you when you bought it?" he said at his own house - I said"What house do you mean - do you mean this house here?" he said Yes; in a short time time I sent Goddard down to the office with him, and in consequence of what had been found up stairs I told Gast it was necessary he should get ready to go before the Magistrate, to give an account of the things found in his house; he cleaned himself for that purpose - a female came in, and in consequence of information we went to No.11, Tottenham-court-road, and there saw Mr. Thompson, the witness - we asked if he knew Ellis; he took us up to the front attic, where we found a large quantity of woollen cloth; here is a blue cloth in one piece, and four coats, one of which is not finished, three epaulettes and the military dress coats, as stated in the indictment - they were tied in a bundle, and the epaulettes with them; they have been shown to Mr. Chambers. On the Monday following, in consequence of information I received, I went to the house of Mr. Smith, Hop-gardens, St. Martin's-lane, and there received from Mrs. Smith a quantity of cloth and kerseymere; on the 14th Mr. Thompson delivered to Goddard, in my presence, ten yards of velvet.</p>

Yes- I believe he has done so for some years; Ellis said he resided there, but the room which was pointed out as Ellis' had neither bed nor bedding in it; it was a second floor room, on the right-hand side going up - there are no back rooms; I searched the shop and parlour, but found nothing applying to this charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You found the tools of a bell-hanger at the house in George-street? A. Yes, a great variety of tools; I did not take the bellhanger up - I went to the Three Compasses, and found Pople kept the house - he is here; Coy said he had the cloth from Gust, at the muffin-shop where I had seen him come out - I did not apprehend Ellis in consequence of that; we were determined to search every place he came out of with property; he said Thompson had two coats, which was true - I do not know Thompson to be a dealer in muffins.</p>

             - I staid there till one o'clock in the morning of Friday, but he did not return; about nine o'clock on the Friday morning, I went with Ballard to No.53, Cirencester-place, and in the two pair back room I saw Clifford dressing himself; I desired him to come down - Ballard asked him several questions respecting the shoes; I heard what he said, and what Ballard has stated is true - the next day, Saturday, in consequence of information, I went with Ballard to No.27, Rupert-street, and after waiting some time saw Coy come out; we followed and watched him into the house of Mr. Young, in Marshall-street, but before that I had gained ground on him, and went and told Young I thought he was coming there; he went to Young's, and stopped there a short time, then came out, and I saw him go into the house of Gast, in Hanway-street, and some time after I received charge of the prisoner Thompson - I had been watching in Hanway-street some time.</p>
               <p>Q. When Coy went into the house in Hanway-street, did not you go in? A. No, I remained watching, and afterwards went to the Police-office, where I received charge of Thompson - he had a basket; I asked if it was his - he said Yes - I opened it, and found it contained two coats; here is one of them - I asked who he got them from, and after some little hesitation he said from a person named Gust - I afterwards asked what he was going to do with them - he said to sell them, and if he sold them he was to have 5s. for his trouble; I afterwards returned from the office with Ballard, Schofield, and Chambers, to Gast's house, in Hanway-street, and in searching the second floor room, on the right-hand as you go up stairs, I found three pieces of black cloth - I asked whose room it was, and was told it was Ellis'; it had no bed in it - the cloth was on the drawers, tied in this handkerchief; it is three remnants - I came down, searched Ellis, and took him to the office; I found upon him about 8l. in money, the key of a clock, and a variety of small keys; I returned to Gast's house, and from information, I went with Chambers and Ballard to Thompson's, in Tottenham-court-road, and found the property described by Ballard; after I took Ellis to the office I showed him to Coy - Andrews, the officer, who had him in custody, was present; the Magistrate was not present - it was in the clerk's office, and before the office hours; the clerk was not writing, nothing passed - I afterwards locked Ellis up. and then went and asked Coy if that was the person who he had the cloth from.</p>
               <p>COURT. We cannot receive his answer in evidence.</p>
               <p>Witness. After that, in Ellis' presence, about nine o'clock that night, while the Magistrate was sent for, but before he came down, we had the prisoners in the office, ready to be examined, both Thompson and Coy nodded their heads at Ellis, and said that was the person they got the things from - Ellis saw them nod, and heard it, but made no answer; on the Monday following I went with Ballard to Smith's, and received three pieces of kerseymere from Mrs. Smith; I got information from there that some blue cloth had been sent from there that morning to Mr. Eccles, in Spring-gardens, and I got from there two pieces of blue cloth; that is blue cloth which Ballard has not spoken to - it is here; I got it from Eccles the same day; on the 14th I received ten yards of velvet from Mr. Thompson, of No. 11, Tottenham-court-road.</p>

            . I am a woollen-draper, and live at No. 4, Hop-gardens, St. Martin's-lane. I have known Coy about two months - I am not acquainted with him, and had not dealt with him; he called on the 3rd of this month - I believe it was on a Thursday - he brought some cloth and kerseymere for sale; there was a good deal of it - it was in five pieces altogether, three of kerseymere, and two of cloth; he said he had them to sell, that they were not his own, they belonged to a master tailor - he asked me to buy them, which I agreed to, and measured them; I was to pay 10s. 2d. a yard for the cloth, 3s. 10d. for two of the pieces of kerseymere, and 3s. 11d. for the other - it was broad cloth; I think I paid him 24l. odd: after folding it up I put it on the shelf, with my own goods, and on the Monday morning I took two pieces of the cloth to Mr. Eccles, of Spring-gardens - I gave the other three up to Mr. Chambers and the officers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you carried on business as a woollen-draper? A. These fifteen years - I do not know that I am in the habit of buying of people who bring things in; I certainly have often bought of people in the shop - the broad cloth is not fine Saxony; Mr. Chambers is considered a respectable and fashionable tailor; I can buy very good cloth for 15s. a yard - I have given 28s. for some: this might be about 16s. a yard from the manufacturer, but things are bought and sold cheaper for want of money - this is very narrow cloth, and there would be an allowance for that; I could buy it for 16s., for cash, and should be allowed a yard in the score.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought that you were dealing honest by giving 10s. 2d. for it? A. I knew no more of its being dishonestly come by than a child unborn - I am pretty well acquainted with the quality of cloth; it may be three inches narrower than the common broad cloth, which is usually thirty or thirty-one inches, this is twenty-eight or twenty-nine - I was never in trouble; I am sure of that - I have invoices to show my respectability; I was never charged with any offence at any time or place, and was never in custody, or charged with having property improperly in my possession belonging to another person - I was accused of a something once, but I had nothing to do with it, and never was in custody; I forget who accused me - what you allude to I believe was about a Mr. Chambers or Chamberlain, a laceman - I had some lace in my possession, which he claimed - I do not know how much there was, on my life, nor the value; I do not deal in lace - I neither bought nor sold that; Mrs. Smith had taken it to ask the value at a customer's - it had been brought to our house; Mr. Chamberlain afterwards had it - I do not know what the value was; it was twelve or fourteen years back - I did not deal with it; I was astonished to find it in my house -I know how it came there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did the lace come into your possession? A. A man brought it to my house to know the value - I told him I did not know the value; Mrs. Smith took it to a customer of ours; he took it to Chambers or Chamberlain, where it was lost from, and he claimed it - I never bought it, nor agreed to buy it; I did not know the value.</p>

On Saturday, the 5th of February, he came to my shop, about eleven o'clock in the morning; he brought some black cloth, and asked if I would purchase it - I told him I did not want any, but asked to look at it; he untied the handkerchief - I examined it, and found it to be three remnants - I asked what he wanted a yard for it; he asked me 10s.; I said it would not suit me, and that was nearly as much as it was worth - he then asked if I wished to buy any new coats, and told me they belonged to a master tailor, who wanted money, and they were to be sold cheap - I asked what they were; he said one was a very handsome black frock coat, which had a velvet collar, and was faced with velvet in front - I asked what price the person wanted for it; he said 2l. 8s. - I told him it would not suit me, and he went away, taking the things with him; I had not heard of the robbery in Maddox-street at that time - he had not got the coats with him; about an hour after that Mr. Chambers called at my shop and described what he had lost - I gave him information, and about three o'clock Coy came again; he brought no coat - I had previously been to his father's to tell him I wished to see the coats; he came to my shop, and I agreed that he should fetch the coats for me to look at - he promised to be back in half an hour with them, but I saw no more of him till he was in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I suppose you cannot be mistaken in his identity? A. No; the cloth might be worth 12s. or 13s - there was a yard and a quarter of inferior, which I said I would give 10s. for.</p>

            . I am a writer and ornamental painter. I have been acquainted with the prisoner Woodward about two years; I do not know his mother, nor where she lived - I never heard from him; I had some conversation with him, about a month ago or rather more, in the street, at the corner of Charles-street and Oxford-street - I met him, and asked if he was going to stand something to drink; he said No, he had got no money - I said how was that, and told him he was gammoning me (he is a tailor, I believe) - I asked if he had any thing to do; he said No, he had done very little for a good while - he said he must get some money somewhere or other very soon, and that he had tried to do something at his mother's, but it was no go, or something to that effect - I said, "Take care you don't get transported;" that is all that passed - this was a week or eight days previous to this robbery - I cannot exactly state the time.</p>

On Wednesday night, about halfpast twelve o'clock, or rather Thursday morning, I saw a person standing with his back against the door of the empty house, talking to a Policeman - I will not take my oath who it was, but I certainly think it was the prisoner Woodward; I did not know him before - I did not know whether he had any thing to do with the empty house; I only saw him while I was knocking at my own door, and going in with a friend - on the following morning when I heard of the robbery I went to Mr. Chambers' house, and saw the condition of the premises, and the remnants of cloth on the top of the premises they had gone over.</p>

            . I slept in the empty house in George-street from Friday, the 28th of January, till last Thursday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170021"/>night - Mrs. Woodward had the care of the house; I saw the prisoner Woodward for the first time on Wednesday night, the night of the robbery - he was in the back kitchen between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, and his mother asked him to come back to supper; he said he did not think he could as he was going to see for work, but he would call as he came back - he came in that evening a little before ten o'clock, and did not stop many minutes; he went out before ten - I did not see him there then, but I heard his voice; his mother asked him to come in, and eat some supper, but he went away directly - I was in the back kitchen, and so was his mother; he was in the front kitchen, and on the stairs, going towards the door; I and Mrs. Woodward slept together in the front attic - I heard no alarm in the night; Mrs. Woodward went down in the morning a little before eight o'clock - she came running up stairs to me, and said the house was broken open; I went down, and saw the wadding and pieces of cloth strewed about the little room - her bonnet and my cap were laying in the corner; the door that leads to the stairs was cut through to admit a hand - the front area window was open.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. On Friday, after the robbery, I went to Woodward's lodging, No. 9, Fulwood's-rents, Holborn - he was at home, and told me they were his lodgings; it was a first floor front room: I asked if his name was Woodward - he said it was; I asked if he had a mother keeping a house in George-street - he said he had: I asked when he saw her last, when he was there - he said he saw her on the Wednesday night about ten o'clock - I asked if he had any objection to inform me where he had been since that time; he said that was his business, not mine, and he should say nothing till he got before the Magistrate; I then took him into custody, searched him, and found 5s. 6d. on him - I then took him to George-street, to the house his mother had been keeping, for Irwing to see him, and then to the office; I found no property - he gave the Magistrate an account where he had been, which was not taken in writing at that time; he said he had been along with a man named Rogers, at No. 28, Great St. Andrew's-street - I went, and ascertained that he had been part of the time with Rogers, who has since absconded; as we went along I told him I was taking him before a Justice - he asked if the house had been broken into in which his mother lived, and whether it had been robbed; I said No, it had not been robbed, but they had gone through that house, I believed, to a house at the back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long before had it been ascertained that this house had been broken? A. On the Thursday, and I took him on the Friday.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Ellis made no defence.</p>
               <p>Clifford's Defence. I assure you I was at home on the night of the robbery; I went home about eleven o'clock -I came out next morning, when I was brought out by Ballard - the shoes I was found in possession of I bought where I stated, paying 10s. for them, and if I had perpetrated the act I might have escaped; Mr. Chambers, on my being taken to his house, promised if I would inform him where to find his property, or to bring to justice those who committed the offence, I might take his word, as a gentleman, he would do what he could for me; and afterwards, in the Magistrate's private room, he told me if I would tell him where to find the property, he would not prosecute; in this he was checked by Mr. Conant and the officer, who used every means to draw from me where the property was, but I knew nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Coy's Defence. I called at Mr. Toft's, George-street, Hampstead-road, on the night of the robbery, respecting a parcel he wished me to take to the City, to go to his son on board the Duke of Sussex, off Gravesend. I went there with a young man named Cummings; we got to Toft's about ten o'clock, supped there, and did not leave the house till twenty minutes to twelve - I brought the parcel away with me, went home to bed, got up next morning twenty minutes before eight, took the parcel into the City, and called at Alexander's music-shop, which supplied the ship with music, to ask a young man if the vessel had left Gravesend; he said if I went to Phillips', the agent of the ship, he could inform me - I went to the East India-house; the porter said he had not come, and directed me to a man whom I could not find; I went to the Steam-packet office, paid 3d., and had the parcel booked - I asked the young man there if the ship had left Gravesend; he said he could not tell. but if it had, the parcel would be returned, as he had another one in the same way - I left, and was going to Toft's to tell him the parcel would be returned if the ship had left; I had to pass Ellis' door, and accidentally called to ask him how he was, and he asked me to sell the cloth and kerseymere, which I did - he went with me, and waited till I came out of Smith's, and I gave him the money, which I received of Smith - I have the young man at the music-shop to prove I was there.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. Goddard stated that he had found two coats in the hand-basket covered with crumpets, which is false; he took me to the office, opened the basket, and found the coats - be found eight crumpets in my pocket, which I was going to take home to tea; he took four from me, and gave me the rest - he put the crumpets into the basket himself.</p>

            . There were some crumpets in the basket, and some in his pocket; I think about eight in all - he said he had them from Gust, who had given them to him to eat.</p>
               <p>Thompson in continuation. On the fourth examination Ellis admitted that he gave me the two coats to sell for him - I have been in the habit of going to his house several times; they have bought upwards of 5l. worth of hardware and cutlery of me, and said they should want more - I called at the house for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Gast's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen. - I have very little to say in answer to this charge, in which it seems I am supposed to be implicated, because Ellis is my son-in-law, having an apartment in my house; that he had so, I do not deny, but I had no knowledge of any property being there that did not belong to himself, much less any that had been improperly come by, and when it is considered that three small pieces of black cloth, and those lying on the drawers, are all that were found in that apartment, or in any other part of my house, I rely that your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170022"/>Lordship and the Jury will readily conceive that I had no knowledge of the transaction that has been discovered. I have not had the slightest participation in any portion of it, or any of the property stolen, and I trust, a tradesman like myself, who has borne all his life a good character, will not be found guilty of any crime upon such evidence only, as applies to me in this case.</p>

               <p>Q. Why not? A.

               <p>COURT. Q. How many floors are there in the house? A.

               <p>Q. Tell us where he had been sleeping before that time? A. He was not with us before that; he was not at liberty, he was in trouble - he came home as soon as he got at liberty, and I will answer for every hour of his conduct since; I can give an account of wherever he has been during that fortnight, at night, and for the day also, because he never went out, except he went on business for me, or that we knew where he did go; when we sent him any where we knew where we had sent him, and when he returned he accounted for the time he had been gone.</p>

            ; she is a stay-maker - that is my business; she slept up stairs, in the back attic - there were a great number of other people in the house, but they knew nothing of our affairs; when my brother came in that night my mother and Emma Adams were in the room - I was at work, making stays, but put it down to let him in; my mother was not doing any thing - she is sixty-one years old; Adams was at work in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, you said, when first examined, that the prisoner must necessarily go through your room to another - now you tell us that he slept in the same room? A. So he must go through the room I sleep in.</p>
               <p>Q. Why, he slept in it? A. Yes, and of course he must come through it to go out; the beds were in the room we sleep in - we have only one room on that floor; my mother and I slept in one bed - the prisoner came in at eleven o'clock that night; he had gone out about four - I did not go with him; I only know where he went by what he told me; he told me he had been to the New-cut, and I had sent him to the New-cut to buy some steels - I gave him half a sovereign to buy them with, and he returned without them; I asked for the money - he told me he had given it for a pair of shoes, which I scolded him for; I had supped when he came back, and so had the rest of us- we seldom take supper, but I took a crust of bread and butter that night; my mother took no supper, nor Adams either - my brother most likely went to bed without supper, for he is in the habit of doing so; I cannot tell whether he had any, I was minding my work - if he had supper he did not lay a cloth for it; he breakfasted with us next morning, and was made a prisoner at ten o'clock, in the room - I was in the act of scolding him for buying the shoes when the officers came; I do not know what sort they were - I only saw them on his feet.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shoes or boots? A. They were up to his ancles. I believe.</p>

            . I am the mother of the last witness, and of the prisoner - we live in Cirencester-place. The prisoner had lived with us for about a fortnight before the officer took him - I live with my daughter; I recollect the circumstance of my son being taken; I heard of Mr. Chamber's robbery - my son came home on that night, (Wednesday,) as near as I can say, between the hours of ten and eleven o'clock, because after eleven there is no admittance to the house without making a greatnoise with the bells - every person answers their own bell; I recollect his coming home - he slept in the same room with us; we made a convenience to have him sleep in the same room with my daughter and me - he went to bed, and did not leave the house till after breakfast the next morning; I cannot say the hour, but it was after breakfast - I have not the least reason to suppose that he left the house from the time he went to bed till after breakfast.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had the prisoner been living in that house? A. It might be about a fortnight, over or under - we were not long there ourselves; we were there before he came - we moved in, I think, on the 17th of November; I and my daughter moved there - Emma Adams is in the habit of coming occasionally to assist my daughter - she does not live with us; my son slept in the same room with me and my daughter every night during the fortnight - I would not permit him to have a lodging till we all removed together: when my daughter had work to do in a hurry, Adams would stay perhaps all night to be ready in the morning - when she staid she continued at her work; she has not slept there since we have been in that house - she often did at the other house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then she staid and worked during the night? A. Yes, my daughter was pressed for work at this time, but Adams did not stay there the whole night; I went to bed and left her at work - she never slept in that house to my knowledge; there are three or four different families live in this house, but none of my family but myself and daughter have any apartment there - we rent but one room, and pay 3s. 6d. a week for that one room, and for a few old things being in the kitchen; my daughter went down to let my son in that night, and so did I - I heard the bell ring, and did not know she was gone before me; I saw him come in, and saw him go to bed - I never have any supper; I do not know whether the others had - I believe they had a cup of tea in the dead of the night, to keep their eyes open; my son had no supper, for he went to bed before me - I left the girls at work; he did not get up early next morning, just in time to have breakfast; we breakfast between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he came in between ten and eleven o'clock, how long had he been absent? A. I really cannot say, I believe it was after tea that he went out - he drank tea with us about five o'clock, went out after tea, and was absent during the rest of the time; he was at home all the morning, I believe, but I am out and in on my daughter's business - I was at home all Wednesday morning, and so was he; he was not out in the fore part of the day at all.</p>

            . I am a stay-maker. I know Mrs. Clifford, her daughter, and the prisoner - they live in Cirencester-place; I heard of a robbery at Mr. Chambers' the beginning of this month - I remember the prisoner Clifford being taken up on the Friday; I have come to speak of what occurred on the Wednesday night - I was at Mrs. Clifford's all day on Wednesday; I am acquainted with Miss Clifford - we worked in the same shop for two years; I recollect the prisoner coming home that night - I cannot say at what time exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time? A. Between eight and nine o'clock - he had been out once or twice during the day; he came home between eight and nine, or I think not so late- it was about eight; I do not recollect his going to bed that night - I staid there till it turned twelve o'clock, and left him in the room; I left him up, I am sure of that - it had turned twelve o'clock; I had to go home as far as Little Chesterfield-street, and it was near one when I got home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you been there much for some time before? A. Yes, working for Miss Clifford - I had been there for the last month, but not regularly every day, because I work for a shop; I always go home to my lodgings - sometimes I go about eleven o'clock, sometimes twelve; I frequently staid late, as when I went to her it was always in a great hurry, and I always staid till the work was finished - I always went home; I had seen the prisoner for a fortnight before, when I was there; there were two beds in the room, but only one bedstead - the other bed was piled upon chairs; the bedstead was a shut up one - he was out once or twice during the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think he had been out when he came back in the evening? A. He did not go out till after tea - we drank tea between five and six o'clock; he came home about eight - I did not hear him say where he had been.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know where he was going? A. I believe I heard his sister send him to her other sister, Mrs. Davies, in Chapel-street, Soho, to borrow some money, I think - I did not see any money given him by his mother or sister; Mrs. Clifford was up when I went away - that was about twenty minutes after twelve o'clock; the prisoner was up, and so was Miss Clifford.</p>
               <p>MR. CHAMBERS. I have looked at the whole of the property produced to-day, and have not the least doubt of its being all mine - one piece of the kerseymere I cannot swear to, but I believe it to be mine; every one of the others have something which I can swear to them by.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Have you any private-mark on the broad cloth? A. I have the headings, attached to which is the list, and that corresponds; neither of the blue cloths are of the best quality - one cost me 17s. 6d. a yard, and the other 21s. 6d.</p>

            . When Clifford stated that he gave 10s. for the shoes, I asked who gave him the money, and he said his mother gave it to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did you state this to the Magistrate? A. I stated it to the clerk - it was not read over in my deposition; I should not have thought of it if I had not heard the witness make her statement.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clifford. It was said at Marlborough-street that the articles stolen were hawked about for sale at different public-houses, and is it not as likely that I should have bought them at the Three Compasses, as at any other place? I did not say I bought them in the skittle-ground; it is false; the shoes it is said are too large for me, and have marks of being worn by a person with corns or bunions - I should wish the Jury to examine the shoes I have on now; I have worn them a fortnight. Mr. Chambers employs a great many men, and they, I believe, are in the habit of wearing slippers - might not the shoes have been left behind by some of them?</p>

            . On Sunday, the 19th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out to church - I left my landlord in the house, and left my room door open, but my box was locked; I went from church, and drank tea with my brother - I returned at ten o'clock at night, found my box broken open, and missed a 10l. note and seven sovereigns - I had received the 10l. note from my brother.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What parish is the house in? A. Harrow; the prisoner lodged in the house - he passes my room<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170026"/>to go to his own; there is a passage between my room and his - I left him at home when I went out; he is a sign painter. I saw the note safe on the 18th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many 10l. notes had you on the 18th? A. Only one; there were two lodgers besides him in the house - the prisoner's mother was at church.</p>

            . I am a timber-merchant, and live at Paddington. On Tuesday, the 11th of January, the prisoner came into my yard - he was a perfect stranger; I was in the counting-house with a customer; I went into the yard, and sold him two six-feet deals - he tendered me this 10l. note to pay for them; I asked him into the counting-house, and asked his name - he said Ewer, of Pinner, which I wrote on the note; I asked if he was a son of Mr. Ewer's, of Pinner - he said No; I said, "Are you any relation?" he said No; I said, "Do you know Mr. Ewer, of Pinner?" he said, "Perfectly well;" the goods came to 5s. 9d. - I gave him nine sovereigns and the rest in silver - Taft was present when I took the note from him; I have had it in my possession ever since, and am quite certain it is the note I had from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not expressed a doubt about his identity? A. I did some few days after - I did not before the Magistrate; it was to himself - his features were familiar to me, but he was dressed different; he had a flannel jacket on, and an apron down to his ancles, which changed his appearance - that was about four days after the transaction; I never parted with the note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say four days after, you intimated some doubt about him - are you now certain, and were you certain before the Magistrate that he was the man? A. I was, for he had the identical coat on which he wore then.</p>

            . I am a stone-mason. I was in Dalgleish's yard when he took a note of the prisoner; I am certain the prisoner is the person who gave him the note - I have not the least doubt of him; I saw the change given to him - Dalgleish put the 10l. note into my hand at the time, to look at it; he was quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he there? A. Perhaps ten minutes - it was on the 11th of January; I know the day by the different transactions I had that day, and referring to my books, I made no memorandum of this, but when I was called upon I looked back at my books, and the transactions of that day enabled me to name the date - I think it was on the 19th that I referred to my books.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he a stranger to you? A. Yes - nobody else was present; he had no whiskers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the Magistrate that he wore large whiskers? A. I did not take much notice of his whiskers - he is the man; he might have had large whiskers for what I know.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 15th of February, between two and three o'clock, I was disturbed by an unusual noise; I got out of bed, opened my bed-room door, and heard that which convinced me all was not right at the top of the house - I went down two pairs of stains, and called the assistance of my young men; I have four - I awoke them all, and armed myself with a sabre; I went up to my ware-rooms, which are the attics - there is a trap-door in the ceiling; I observed the inner trap-door was removed, and a quantity of mortar on the floor - I observed that the ceiling was broken through a little beyond the trap-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to prevent the person who had forced the trap-door from getting into the house? A. Yes, some iron bars which I had placed there myself - the aperture in the ceiling was about the size of a man's head; the two bolts of the trap-door had been forced, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170027"/>outer trap-door had been forced open by breaking the wood - I put the sabre up through the bars at the inner trap-door, and made a noise with it against the bars; I then heard a trampling over the roof of the house - I heard footsteps on the roof; I put up the windows, and gave an alarm - the Police came to my assistance, sprang a rattle, and in about twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour, I saw all the prisoners, except Allen, in custody; I saw Allen in custody at the station, about half an hour after the other prisoners were taken - the house, No. 51, North-place, was empty; it is four doors from mine - I directed the Police to watch that house; No. 16, Wilson-street was also empty - that is five doors from me; there is access along the roof of my house to those of No. 51, North-place, and No. 16, Wilson-street; a man might meet with some difficulty in climbing up the houses in Wilson-street - there is access from both houses, but it is more difficult from the house in Wilson-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This was at two o'clock in the morning - you had gone to bed on Monday, the 14th? A. Yes - the inner trap-door was opened, and the outer trap-door thrown down on the roof; the inner trap-door is about a foot from the bottom of the outer one, which lays flat on the roof.</p>
               <p>Q. When you open the outer trap-door, are you out of the house or in it? A. In the house, below the roof - the inner trap-door is over the ceiling.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any opening made in the roof or trap-door by which a person could get into the ware-room? A. They had broken the ceiling, but the hole was not large enough for them to get into the ware-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you taken the trouble to pass from the roof of your house to No. 16, Wilson-street? A. I have not, but I was with those who did - it was a bricklayer, and one of the inspectors; they went down with a ladder, which they brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Except from the assistance of the ladder would it not, from what you saw, be not only extremely difficult but extremely dangerous? A. Not at all, I could do it myself with ease - in raising from the top of the houses in Wilson-street to the roof of mine there would be a difficulty to a person not accustomed to it, but there was no difficulty in going from my house to Wilson-street, because I could drop from my roof to it; the height is about seven feet six inches - I have measured it; a person would only have to drop once - my house is the fifth from No. 16, Wilson-street; the four first houses are two stories high, and mine is three - he would not have to drop the height of a whole story, because the roof in Wilson-street comes above the story; it rises up - the gutter runs in the middle of my house, and reduces the depth very cousiderably - the four first houses are all one height, but No. 16 is a story higher - he would not have to ascend that story, as the back parapet is the same height.</p>
               <p>Q. Would he have to run along a parapet without any guard from the street? A. He could go across the top of the houses without being near the parapet; it would not be at all difficult or dangerous.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live opposite Mr. Brown - I have the care of No. 16, Wilson-street, and had so at the time; it was empty. On the 15th of February, on hearing an alarm, I went towards that house; when I got to the door, somebody opened it by drawing the lock inside; I instantly drew back, beckoned, and a Policeman came to me - I observed then that the door was about an inch and a half open; I saw it gradually drawn open about an inch and a half; it was instantly drawn open quite, and a person presented himself at the threshold of the door; I instantly sprang forward, and the door was slapped in my face by the person inside (there was no inmate to that house); there was a gas-light opposite the door of No. 17; that light enabled me to see the person - the prisoner Allen is that person; the gas-light is about seven yards from the door, on the same side of the way - Gough-street runs at the bottom of Wilson-street, and is from twenty-five to thirty yards from No. 16, Wilson-street - after he had shut the door in my face, I heard a cry of "There he goes, Stop thief!" and saw a man run past the bottom of Wilson-street, and a Policeman in pursuit of him; I joined in the pursuit, and had a view of his person, and kept him in sight - I got before the Policeman about three parts of the way down Gough-street, and passed Burge's yard to Mount-pleasant, turned the corner of Warner-street, and into Red Lion-yard - I did not lose sight of him as he turned the corner of Warner-street, but as he turned into Red Lion-yard I lost sight of him for a moment - he turned to the left-hand side of the yard at the bottom, and ran through a horse-pond; I followed him on the other side - he ran up three or four steps, and over a brick wall, which separated a private yard from the street; I was then seven or eight yards behind him - I made a catch at his foot as he get over; the gates of the yard were then broken; I entered the yard - one Policeman entered before me; we were together, and he (the prisoner Allen) was from eight to ten yards up the yard, laying on the ground, quite exhausted - we took him into custody - we found nobody else in the yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was all the opportunity you had of seeing the man in the house No. 16, the door being open about an inch and a half? A. I did not see him till the door was quite opened - a person could not look out when it was open an inch and a half; it was when he threw the door open, and presented himself at the thershold; I had never seen Allen before to my knowledge - I swear positively that he is the man I saw at the door, and that I saw the same man afterwards in the yard - I did not observe whether his clothes were wet; mine were - it was only a small pond, nearly half leg up - he ran through as I did; the whole of my stockings were wet, because they were down over my shoes -I had not tied them up; nothing else was wet except my skin - I was not wet up to my breeches; I never lost sight of the prisoner except for a moment, at the corner of Red Lion-yard.</p>

            . I am married, and live at No. 28, Gough-street, Gray's Inn-lane, which crosses the end of Wilson-street. On the morning of the 15th of February, between three and four o'clock. I was alarmed by the cry of thieves - I can see from my back window into some of the yards of the houses in Wilson-street, and of No. 16; after the alarm I saw a young man jump over two walls, in a direction of the walls of Nos. 16, 15 and 14. Wilson-street -I then went to the front of my house in Gough-street, and saw a man drop from the wall of the corner house in Wilson-street, into Gough-street - it was a young man in a fustain jacket; I gave an alarm, and cried out, "There he goes;" that was in the hearing of a Policeman, and I saw the Policeman pursue the man down Gough-street, towards Burge's yard, Mount-pleasant.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On hearing Mrs. Wood give an alarm I saw a person drop from the wall into Gough-street - I pursued him through Red Lion-yard, to the turning of the horse-pond in Warner-street, accompanied by Smout; when I got to the corner I turned back, and saw him brought to the gate of the yard - it was the prisoner Allen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. As soon as you got to the corner you turned back? A. Yes, because I thought he would come round - I did not run through the pond.</p>

I am in the employ of Mr. Brown. -On the night of the robbery I accompanied him up to the warehouse; I afterwards looked through the roof of the house, and saw the property there, in parcels, which the Policemen afterwards took possession of - I have since seen them; they had been placed on the top of the stairs, just under the grating where the trap-door was, on the day before the robbery; I know the articles by the duplicates being on them - I wrote some of the duplicates myself; I should think the articles worth from 15l. to 20l. - 13l. had been lent on them.</p>

               <p>Allen's Defence. I am innocent. I know nothing whatever of these three men - I never saw them in my life till I saw them at the station. I was returning from Camden-town between one and two o'clock; I turned round the first or second turning on the left-hand side of the way from Mr. Cubitt's. to come towards Mutton-hill, on my way home to Finsbury, and as I came under a wall a Policeman sprang out on me, and said, "Here is one of them;" I turned round, and said, "One, what?" he said,"One of the thieves;" I then knocked him down - he sprang his rattle, and three or four more came up towards where I was; I then ran away, with ever so many Policemen after me, first up one street and another; I ran across a sort of mews - I did not know whether there was a turning, and when I got to the bottom there was none; I had no place to get away, and jumped over a gate - I never ran through any horse-pond; I hurt myself in falling off the gate - I found I could not get up, and there I laid; I cannot say how long, for I was stunned with the blow - some Policemen knocked the gates open, and laid hold of me; I said, "Where is the man I have struck?" they said, "Oh, come along," and took me to the station; two of them lent me their shoulders to lean on very kindly, or I could not have walked - they sat me in a chair; I had been there a quarter of an hour, when these three men were brought in - the serjeant or inspector, I did not notice which, said, "So we have got four of you;" one of them, I believe it was Mallett, said, "Which of us is it you reckon as two then, as there are but three of us;" the Policeman stood in a file before me - they moved back, and said, "Why, here is the other sitting in a chair;" the man said, "That man has not been with us - we know nothing of him; it was us three by ourselves;" I told the inspector I knew nothing of the three men, but, without any ceremony, he put as all into the black-hole together; he brought me out first in the morning, and told me I was charged with burglary, with those three men; I told him I was a housekeeper in Shoreditch, and a respectable man, and they might send for my friends; they said Oh, no, I was along with these three men, and laughed at me - they put me into the hole, and I was taken to Hatton-garden; I told the Magistrate I knew nothing of the three men, and they declared they knew nothing of me; the Magistrate sent me back till Thursday, when I was committed - I have plenty of friends; it has been so sudden, but I have no doubt some of them are here - they have heard of it by means of the press; I am a painter, and live at No. 60, Leonard-street, Shoreditch, and keep a shop, which my wife looks after; I have no incumbrance whatever, only one child, and leave the Jury to say whether I should be guilty of such a thing - my reason for running away was because I had struck the Policeman; I do not know the men - they were all strangers to me.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you known him? A. His father and mine were boys together - I am not related to him: I swear that - we have known one another boys together; I have been voyages to sea - I was at sea twenty-two months at one time; I have been away from England within the last four years, but not all the time - I never knew him in custody: I heard he was taken up, but the prosecutor exonerated him - it was something about watches, but he was not charged with it; it was something about his brother - the prosecutor's name was Moore, I believe; I do not know where he lived - I never heard of the prisoner being in custody more than once; I have heard him called Jack, the Painter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he is the pugilist? A. I never heard that he had fought at all - I never knew him fight; I never heard that he belonged to the ring, and was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170030"/>a prize-fighter, that I swear; he keeps a chandler's shop, and is a painter - I live at No. 3, Rodney-place, Kent-road, and am a sailor; I returned from sea two years ago last May - I have been endeavouring to get a situation since that, but have had nothing particular to do; I have been assistant in a school part of the time, in King-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What King-street? A. You go up Princes-street, Gray's Inn-lane to it - I do not know the number; the gentleman's name is Banbury - I left there twelve months ago last Christmas; I was there for a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. That is in the neighbourhood of Mr. Brown's house, is not it? A. No, a very long way; it is King-street, Soho - that is it; I go into Gray's Inn-lane and Princes-street, to go to it - I never noticed the number of the house; I did not live there, but went daily - I do not know whether there is a number on the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you live then? A. In the same place as I do now - I walked there morning and evening: I have lived in the same place ever since I came from sea - I saw Allen last about three weeks before he was taken, at his own house: I swear I have not heard of his being taken up within the last two years - I perhaps saw him once a month or not so often; I used to go to his house - I never had the slightest notion of his being in the ring; I never knew he fought at all, nor never heard he belonged to the ring - I was not in the habit of visiting him oftener than I have said.</p>

               <p>Q. How could you tell it was the person you knew, who you were reading of? A.

I said, "Yes, I have had one stolen from me;" he said he did not think it belonged to me or he would have given it to me - he said it was in the name of Deane, not Dee - I had seen it safe on the Saturday evening, after the robbery, in a mustard-pot on the mantel-piece, and on the Sunday I suppose it was taken - on Sunday, the 7th of February, I went to the prisoner's house and I saw my bracelets were made into a necklace, and were round his child's neck - I had not missed them; I had not seen them for a week before, but he said he had taken them from the drawer on the Sunday - they had been in the front room; I told the Police-officer to come to my house on the Monday - the prisoner was not in my house then; he was taken in Finsbury-market - I pointed him out: he walked away, and I sent the officer after him -I went to his house with Inggall that Monday evening - I found there this child's watch, which was part of the property lost on the Saturday night, from the box, from which the dresses were taken - I cannot tell the exact value of all we lost; the dresses were worth 2l.; the officer took the bracelets off the child - we have found no more of the property.</p>

She went out on the 29th of January, and I went out about three o'clock - I shut the street door after me; it shut with a spring lock - we each have a key; I returned about half-past nine, and as soon as I came home Harriet called me up stairs and said the things were gone - they had all been safe when I went out, and I left no one in the house; I was present when these articles were found at the prisoner's.</p>

She has been there about five months, but I have not been there so long; she left me in the house that day - I have sometimes occasion to dispose of things for a short time, but I am quite sure I did not part with these that day; I staid about an hour after she went out - her things were hanging up, and mine were in my box; I am sure I shut the door - I pulled it by the knocker, and tried it afterwards.</p>

            , of Tavistock-street, woollen-draper. On the 12th of January I was in master's shop, which is just opposite Mr. Syer's; I heard the crash - I was cleaning our windows inside, when I heard something fall; I ran to the door immediately - I saw Carter leaning over the clock; I saw nobody else in the street - I crossed the road, and saw the clock laying on Mr. Robinson's steps - Mr. Syer came round the corner immediately after I got out of master's shop; I saw the young man belonging to the public-house, and about five minutes after I saw Britain; Mr. Syer came round from the court with him - I saw no other person in the street - I was there when the prisoners were secured; the young man from the public-house remained there till the officers came, and so did I.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you look out before the crash? A. No, I was standing on the ground, reaching to clean the windows; I should not think more than a quarter of an hour elapsed before Syer collared the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any attempt to take them before the officers came? A. Yes; Syer took hold of Carter - the prosecutor seemed agitated, and appeared to suspect Carter - I remained there to see where the prisoners went to, but said nothing to Syer; Britain went up Tavistock-court - I cannot say where he went to; I did not notice him further - he walked round the corner, and walked back, when he was called; I was not above four yards from the clock when I went up - I did not hear Syer ask Carter if he had seen any body pass; I did not notice what he said - I was taking notice of the clock; I got to the spot in two minutes; there was plenty of time for a man to get away.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does it take you two minutes to cross the street? A. I think so - I saw nobody but Carter in the street when I looked; I afterwards saw Syer and the man from the public-house, and afterwards Britain - I saw nobody in a brown coat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell the Magistrate Britain was the person who called, or that you could not swear to him? A. I said it was him; I never said I could not swear to him - I mentioned Carter just now because I forgot their names; I heard somebody say something when I named Carter, but did not hear what it was - I did not hear, "No" said.</p>
               <p>Britain's Defence.

On the 10th of January, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I was near the Exchange, and saw Mr. Pfeiler at the corner of Finch-lane; three or four persons were round him, and the prisoner was behind them; I was on the opposite side of the way at first, but went close to them - when I had been over about a minute I saw the prisoner's right-hand go in the direction of the prosecutor's right-hand pocket, and when he drew his hand back he had a purse in it; I immediately seized his hand, and he dropped the purse; I picked it up - Forrester and I took him to the Mansion-house: we had no opportunity of speaking to the prosecutor, for it was at the time Mr. Hunt was coming through the City, and there was a great mob; the prisoner did not claim the purse - Mr. Pfeiler saw it next day at the Mansion-house, and claimed it; there was a half-sovereign, wrapped in paper, and a button in it.</p>

            . I am one of the City Police. I and Roe were at the corner of Birchin-lane, which is nearly opposite Finch-lane; I saw an elderly gentleman crowded round - I believe it to be Mr. Pfeiler, but cannot be positive; I stepped over - I was a little behind Roe, and when he laid hold of the prisoner I observed something drop between the prisoner and the gentleman; Roe pushed the prisoner a little aside, and took up the purse which I had seen fall - the prisoner did not claim it, or say any thing about it; he was taken in charge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Cornhill, and near Finch-lane Roe collared me - he charged me with stealing the purse; I immediately told him it was not me that dropped it; he shoved me aside, and the purse certainly laid behind me - but, as for Roe swearing he saw me take it out of the pocket, it is false; there were many thousand people in Cornhill at the time.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. PFIELER. Q. Do you recollect whether your hands were held up at the moment you felt a hand in your pocket? A. My hands were forced up prior to my feeling a hand in my pocket: they were held up at that time, and considerably before; I carry my purse in my right-hand breeches pocket.</p>

On Sunday night I saw sixteen 5s. papers of pence and halfpence safe about eight or nine o'clock - I put them by themselves - I sleep at the market: the prisoner does not sleep there - I do not think he was there on Sunday evening; I went to the cupboard frequently on the Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon, about three o'clock, I missed four papers; the prisoner was not there then, but he had been there both on the Monday and Tuesday - he had lived about four years with me; I had seen it all safe about nine that morning - I applied to the officer, and told him who I suspected - the prisoner was on the premises most of the time from nine to three o'clock; I had sent him out at three, and when he returned I charged him with taking it - he said he had never done any such thing: the officer was waiting for him - he was not searched till he got to the watch-house; I went with the officer to his lodging, and found 10s. in copper in two papers, and some loose coppers - my son had marked the coppers; I saw the letter B. at one end of both the papers in his hand-writing, and have not a doubt of their being two of the papers taken from my shop - when they were found he cried, and said he was sorry for it; I had a good character with him, and always supposed him honest.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your son here? A. No - I was present when he wrote on the paper - I have trusted the prisoner several times to carry 100l. or 150l. for me to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him at his lodging? A. I called him a villain when I found it out, and said he had a good master and I thought I had a good servant - I said I should not spare him; he said he was sorry for what he done - he never confessed taking any thing; he was sorry for being found out - he said he was sorry, and pleaded for mercy; I have often taken coppers out of one paper and put them into another when it was broken; the old papers might be picked up in the shop, but are not fit to put coppers in; the papers found had 5s. in copper in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170035"/>each of them - he knew I knew where he lived; it has happened when I have sent him to the bankers' with change that he has returned me a few shillings which I have sent too much; I cannot say the sum - I should not have discovered it, but for his honesty.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the paper appear to have been removed from the coppers? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner - Bays charged him with stealing four 5s. papers of coppers - he denied it; I afterwards went to his lodging, and in a drawer I found two papers of halfpence with each a B written on them - Bays claimed them; the prisoner then acknowledged his guilt - he said he was sorry for what he had done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you mean by acknowledging his guilt? A. He said, "I am sorry for what I have done, and hope you will not be hard with me"- he certainly did acknowledge his guilt; he said he was guilty in Mr. Bays' presence - Bays was going out of the room very likely at the time.</p>

            . I am a house-broker, and live in Lambeth walk. On the 6th of January, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, I was crossing out of Ave Maria-lane into Stationer's-court, and saw the prisoner in company with four others - they were all together; I watched them, and saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from a gentleman's left-hand coat pocket - the gentleman was coming out of the passage into <placeName id="t18310217-26-crimeloc187">Ave Maria-lane</placeName>

               <p>JURY. Q. How did he get the handkerchief into his own pocket? A. He put it into his breeches pocket - it appeared the same sort of handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You say you are a broker? A. I have said so - I took a licence out to buy furniture and to sell it; I have been here before - I was here the very day the prisoner was taken; as I was accidentally passing in the Strand, I saw a boy cut a window with a pebble, and was here about that - I have not been here before that for twelve months; I suppose by your manner you are talking to the prisoner at the bar - I hope you will not hurt my feelings because I have come to tell the truth - I cannot say how often I have been here; I think I can swear I have not been here half a dozen times besides.</p>

               <p>Q. Has it always been to give evidence against some person guilty of felony? A. I believe not - I cannot recollect what it was; I was in company with a person when the boy cut the glass in the Strand - he was not an officer; to the best of my recollection I have not been here a dozen times - I never was in this Court a dozen times, and never was in the other as a witness; I have been hearing trials.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you have not been a witness in both Courts? A. I do not - I believe I have not been on this side of the water on such unpleasant business for the last six years; I will not swear I have not been here within twelve months - I do not recollect that I have; I do not think I have sworn the last time I was here was six years ago - to the best of my recollection, the circumstance in the Strand is the only one; my memory does not furnish me with any other.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what is the name of the person who was with you on that occasion? A. I really cannot tell, though it was a very respectable gentleman who lives in the Strand, a glover, but on my oath I cannot tell his name - he lives within a dozen doors of Charing-cross; he was not before the Justice - he left me to follow the prisoner; he did not know where I was gone - I do not recollect whether I told the Justice I had a friend with me when it happened - he left me when I was fool enough to follow the prisoner; I do not recollect that I have said I called on him to notice what was going on - I do not recollect that I did so; I only saw one handkerchief found on the prisoner - I do not know how much is allowed per day to witnesses here - I do not recollect what I got on the former occasion; the Policeman received it, and the expences were divided.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How much did you get? A. The gentleman gave me a sovereign for being at Hick's-hall, here, and before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is the name of the Policeman? A. I do not know - I have received nothing on this occasion; I do not expect any thing - if his Lordship is pleased to give me my expences, if not I must submit to lose my time; I do not come here for the expences - my name is on my door, and my business also.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he appear half-whitted? A. He looked curious - he might be a little deranged, but I do not think he was intoxicated; he had a wild stare about him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I took the prisoner from the last witness; I had him at a public-house near the office, before he was before the Magistrate - I made him no threat or promise; I asked what he was charged with - he asked if I could recollect a robbery in Whitechapel; I said No - he then asked if I recollected a gentleman named Cohen entrusting some property to a porter; I said I did - he said, "Then I am the man, and Sheen (using a horrid expression) assisted me in doing it, and had part of the property;" I cautioned him that his own words might convict him - he said he did not care a d-n, for that, for there were witnesses enough to transport him; but he was sure they could not make it a robbery, but a breach of trust.</p>

On Saturday, the 27th of January, he left the shop with a pair of boots in his hand - as he was leaving I saw something white in them: I followed and told him to come back, his mistress wanted to speak to him - he said, "I am not coming back any more;" he had said to me, in the middle of the day, that unless he was allowed an hour for his dinner he would leave - I asked if I should tell his master; he said No, if he wished to leave he would ask himself - he was walking, or rather running, and I took hold of his arm; he said, "You need not take hold of me, I have nothing in the boots;" I think I must have collared him - I had not had any quarrel with him; I did not detain him in the shop, as I was not certain what he had - he was at the door before I saw him, and when I came round the counter to go to the door he was walking away very quickly; when he said he had nothing in the boots he attempted to shake me off, and then I said, "You must come back, you are my prisoner:" when he came back I told my master I thought he had something in the boots, but I could not see what it was while I had hold of him, he struggled so violently it was with difficulty I held him; I saw my master take a pack of cards from his boots - he gave his address at No. 21, Westmoreland-place; this was about ten o'clock in the evening, the time he would be going home - I believe the officer has the pack of cards, but I did not examine them at that time; my master took them out of the boots, and put them on the counter by the side of the boots - the prisoner was taken to the station-house; he said, "They are a set of scoundrels, and the scoundrels put them into the boots."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe he was in a very great passion? A. No, he was not, nor was he quite cool; he appeared agitated; a person might have said what he did without being angry - I had not seen him cleaning his shoes in the course of the day, but I saw a pair of boots behind the counter, where we keep blacking-brushes, and other things; I judged they were the prisoner's - they were not mine, nor my master's, but my master's brother had died some time before; they were cleaned - I did not see any boots there after he was taken: I have no doubt that they were the same I took from the prisoner; the prisoner was before me at the door when I saw something in the boots; the counter was between us- I do not know why I did not call to him; he was near enough to hear me - I hesitated whether I should call my master or not; I did not call him back and say he had forgotten his shoes, but I had told him not to forget to take them - I had seen them in the middle of the day, and I asked him, "Are these your boots?" he said Yes - I said, "We are going to clean the place up to-morrow - if they are yours don't forget to take them home," and he said, "If I do you remind me of it;" I did not send him out to see what time it was - upon my oath I do not remember sending him out; I might have sent him, but I do not believe I did - I was in the habit of sending him to know the time, that I might know when to send him home- I did send him out that night, and he brought me word that it was half-past seven o'clock - we have no clock in the house; it was a custom to send him out to know the time - we do so always; my master's watch very seldom goes right - he sets it right but it will not do - the prisoner took up the boots in such a way that I could not fail to see the cards; I told all this story to the Magistrates - they let the prisoner go on bail; I have heard so since the prisoner was taken up - he and I had not had any altercation about my watching him, or pretending to watch him for two or three days; I did watch him, but he did not complain of it, and for what I know he did not know it; the prisoner signed a book before he went away, and he asked for his wages - I do not remember sending him out after he signed the book; Mrs. Carvalho was in the shop when he signed the book - I did not see him take the boots up at night; I was about two yards from him - he carried them openly in his hand; I think he could not have concealed this pack of cards. because my mistress was behind him, and I think she would have seen them - he could have put one boot on the other; my master was in the parlour with Dr. Ramsbottom - I did tell my mistress of it when I went out; he had crossed the street in a slanting direction when I took him - he was twenty or thirty yards off, near Mr. Caslon's letter-foundry; I swear he said he had nothing in the boots - he did not say "Nothing but my boots."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was he carrying the boots and cards? A. Openly in his hand - I did not see him take them up; he took them from under some paper, I judge, by the direction he took them in - his mistress was close behind him- the place he took them from then was at some distance from the ledge, where I had seen them in the middle of the day; he had taken his wages, and signed the book, as he did every Saturday night - there were no cards kept near the place where the boots were; I do not know who put the boots where I saw him take them from - I am sure I did not: when he was signing the book I said, "James, don't forget your boots," and he then took them - he could not have put them at that time in the place where I saw him take them from - I do not know who put them there; I did not know where they were when I said.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170041"/>"Don't forget them;" the back of the counter had been cleared in the middle of the day, and I believe he did it; I went out directly Sabbath was up, and did not return till half-past nine o'clock - Yes, I forgot, I returned at seven to get some things I had ordered before - I did not send the prisoner to any particular place to know the time.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner about nine o'clock in the evening on Saturday, the 22nd of January; our Sabbath ceased at dusk, about six o'clock or half-past six, when we open shop - I think Cohen went out about six; I think he had not returned before nine - I do not recollect his returning; we have no clock in our shop- I do not recollect seeing the prisoner's boots that day -I had seen them a few days before; I was not aware, but by chance, that he had any boots in the house, and I asked Cohen if they were his - he said No, and I told him to ask the prisoner if they were his; I really forget whether my wife went out that evening, but she was at home about nine, because I was in the parlour when Dr. Ramsbottom came - I saw the prisoner about nine o'clock that night, stooping behind the counter - when I spoke to him he raised himself up, and put a pack of cards on the counter; I thought they had fallen down, and he had taken them up to put on the shelf - I saw the prisoner brought back, I think, after ten o'clock that evening; I had not sent him out to know what time it was that evening - I have a watch, and it goes, but it might not go right; I have sent him out repeatedly to see what time it was in the evening, to know if it was time to shut up; I do not know whether my watch went that evening - I was without a key for some time, but I think I had one at that time; my watch not going was probably owing to its not being wound up - when the prisoner was brought back he had a pair of half-boots in his hand, and a pack of cards in one of them; I presume he has pockets to his coat - it was stated at the Police-office that the officers had the greatest difficulty to get their hands into his pocket; there was a pack of cards in one of the boots, but I have no idea how they got there- one boot was not over the other - I saw something white in the boot, put my hand in, and found this pack of cards; I looked at them, and found my private-mark on them - my wife is not here; the prisoner had only been with me a fortnight - I had a good character with him, but when I applied again, for them to put it to writing, they refused; I should judge his friends are not respectable.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you keep the whole of the house? A. I do, Sir - it wants now twenty-five minutes to two o'clock, by my watch, which is a quarter of an hour too slow.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the prisoner say? A. He said,"I did not put the cards into the boots," and he said he would tell me all about it, alluding to some other things.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Cohen present then? A. No, I had sent him for an officer - I told the Magistrate that, and, to the best of my belief, I told about the prisoner's placing a pack of cards on the counter; the Magistrate did say, when I was telling that to the clerk, "I did not understand your saying any thing about that," and I said,"Sir, you interrupted me;" I had not sent the prisoner out that night to see what time it was, nor did any one else to my knowledge - I did not see Cohen return; I had sent him out after my Sabbath, which ended about six o'clock, on business - he had not told me the business he had done, because I was engaged: I had asked Cohen about a pair of boots, and told him to ask the prisoner if they were his - there is no other man living in the house; the last one who lived there was a Mr. Emmings, which is about six months ago; no other man has lived there but a Mr. Evans for two years, and no other man but those two have lived there for three years - my brother might have lived there two years ago, but he is dead now; he did not die in my house - his wearing apparel was not in my house; I did not take his old boots and shoes into my house - Cohen did not tell me he thought these might be my brother's old boots; he said they were not his, and I desired him to ask the prisoner if they were his - I had sent Cohen out to take home an order; Cohen slept under the counter, near where I saw the boots - Cohen told me the prisoner's boots were left in front of the shop, and that he took them up in his presence; he pointed out the spot, about a yard and a half from the door, on the floor in the passage, through which the prisoner would go, rather on one side - any one going into the shop would of course have passed them; I do not recollect that he showed me the place at the moment, but he did afterwards - there were some reams of paper, and books on the floor near the place; I heard that the prisoner said the scoundrels themselves had put the cards there, but I was not there then -I cannot say that the prisoner ever threatened me with an action for a conspiracy, but he said, "Well, as this is the case, I will see if one swears different to the other, and if they do, I will have them taken;" the prisoner did not say to me he would have me indicted for a conspiracy, nor did he in my presence - I did not say that if it were not for his insolence I would not prosecute him; I said if any respectable person would come forward, and say he was respectable, I would not prosecute - I heard from Cohen, that he had sent the prisoner out that night after the shop was shut, to see what time it was.</p>

In consequence of information I waited for the prisoner's coming from his work at Mr. Mellish's, at Bush-hill park, on the 17th of January, between five and six o'clock in the evening; when he had got three hundred yards from the barn, I stopped him - I took off his hat, and found in it a bag of wheat undreased; Mead was with me- we took him to the watch-house, and then went to search his house, where we found about three pecks more of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170042"/>wheat, some wheat ground, and a small mill with some wheat in it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You gave her some child's clothes seven years ago? A. Yes, and some for herself, but this frock was not then made - I made this either two or four years ago, and I had given nothing to the prisoner in the interval.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. On the Tuesday, before she was taken, did she not come to your house? A.

            's Land; I have known her about seven months - her conduct has been every thing that was correct.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. In the first place, does the prisoner's brother live in your house? A. No, Sir, and never did - several of her brothers have visited there; I never swore to the colour of the muff and tippet the prisoner had on that Tuesday - I said I saw her with a muff and tippet; perhaps I did swear I saw her go into the house with this muff and tippet, when it was put to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

On the 5th of February I saw the prisoner at his shop, about half-past eleven o'clock; he asked for stout white cotton stockings - he stood about half a yard from the window; there were two or three silk handkerchiefs hanging before the window - he took off his hat two or three times, under the pretence of blowing his nose; he kept me in conversation some time, and then said he would have some black worsted stockings - I turned to get them; I showed them to him, and said they were 1s. 4d. a pair - he then said he would have ribbed ones; the boy then came in, and picked up a silk handkerchief from the other side of the counter, close behind where he stood - I then walked round and told him to take off his hat; he said "Oh yes," and took it off - there were some silk handkerchiefs in it; I showed them to him, and afterwards took them and the hat into a little back room till Mr. Simpson came home - he was given in charge; there were twelve handkerchiefs, which Mr. Simpson valued at 20s.; he asked the prisoner whose hat it was, and he said it was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were with the prisoner during the whole time? A. Yes; I had to ascend some steps, and to turn to get the stockings - the handkerchief that was found was not in front of him; it was behind him - I did not observe that he had a cold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was your back turned to him while you got the stockings down? A. Yes; and then I suspected him, and would not get him any more.</p>

On the 8th of February, about half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the shop with two children - I had not known her before; she took down a shirt hanging by the side of the shop, and gave it to her eldest daughter, who was outside the door, and gave it to the other girl - I ran after them, and took the youngest, and gave her to a boy; I then ran after the prisoner, who had gone in a different direction, and got about two hundred yards - I brought her back; she said she had never seen the shirt, and never took it down - I can swear she took it down, and it was inside the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I ever in the shop, (say it upon your conscience,) till I went to inquire what the child had done? A. Yes, you were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. No; I never was; there was a woman in the shop pawning something, and she said she would declare she saw the child pick something up outside the door, and you said you did not know how the child got it, but you supposed my eldest daughter gave it her. Witness. No, I did not - the little girl had got about twelve yards from the shop when I took her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you always said you saw her take it? A. Yes; I could see her through the glass door - she did not ask me the price, but took it down, and instantly gave it to her eldest daughter, who gave it to the other; I was attending to other customers - the prisoner just came in; the girls did not - when I came back with the little girl, the mother and the other girl had run off in different directions; I passed them at the door when I went after the little girl.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) On Tuesday, the 8th of this month, I was walking towards home, and met with my eldest daughter; she, pointing, said, "Mother, there goes the man that made my sister's shoes." I accosted him, and spoke to him about them; my daughter (the youngest) walked in; at this moment a mob was gathered round the child, as we stood looking towards the pawnbroker's; my eldest daughter said,"Mother, a man is taking my sister into the pawnbrokers;" when I attempted to go in, the prosecutor turned round, and asked me if the little girl belonged to me; I answered Yes, and enquired what she had done; he said, "You know what she has done;" I replied that I did not; the prosecutor said she had stolen a shirt, and had said that either her mother or sister had given it to her. Prisoner declares that she never saw the shirt until it was upon the pawnbroker's counter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you seen it in the passage? A. Yes, about ten minutes before; I had not heard any knocking - the door was open; a cart was at the door, and some persons were taking goods from the house - the prisoner did not ask me for a person named Bennett; the carter was standing by the cart, which was directly before the door - there were two chairs in the passage - there was no clothes on either of them; he did not take the coat up and place it on the chair - I saw him take it from the peg, and said, "What are you doing?"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170046"/>he said, "I beg your pardon;" he did not make any resistance; I cried Stop thief!</p>

On the 11th of February I returned from Bristol - a journeyman tailor had lodged with my mother, and she said she was directed to go to the White Horse, Carnaby-market, to find him; I went there and was informed that the likeliest place to find him was at the prosecutor's - I went there, and saw two chairs near the passage door, with a coat or a cloak on them; I did not touch them, but I saw something at the end of the passage; I took it up, thinking it fell from a chair, and replaced it - this lady came down, and screamed out; I was alarmed, and ran out.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was her wages when she first came to you? A. Twelve guineas; she once said the place was too hard for her, but at the same time agreed to stay, on her wages being advanced to fourteen guineas - one trunk was opened in her presence; the other was opened in her absence, but that was not locked, and had nothing of ours in it - all our things were found in her presence.</p>
               <p>Q. After the officer was with you and her trunk had been searched, was she not permitted to go away? A. Yes; she came afterwards, on Monday, to demand her wages, and was given into custody on the Tuesday morning - she had slept out on the Sunday night; we examined the house in the meantime, and found we had lost every description of property - I did not have her taken on Monday; she might have gone where she chose on Sunday night and Monday - she came back on Tuesday morning, of her own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not, after finding these things, give her back some of her clothes, and tender her 1l. as wages? A. We gave her her clothes, detaining our own property, and she would not go, trusting to our mercy, as she said; we called in the officer, and he took her - she confessed herself guilty over and over again; she demanded her wages both days; I offered her 1l. to send her down to her friends; we said we would pay her fare down, and I offered to see her off - she said her father and mother lived at Chester, and afterwards confessed that she had none, and said she was from Ireland immediately after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not refuse her fare to go to Chester? A. No, we never gave her the opportunity of refusing - she was taking back property which was ours, and putting it into her trunk; she claimed property which it will be proved was not hers - she claimed property which had our own name on it, and I showed it to her; she had property in her trunk belonging to a lady present, amounting to 13l., "Mercy! mercy!" was all she cried out all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. As you found property which you claimed, why did you not give her into custody on Sunday? A. The property consists of numerous articles, but is not valuable - we intended to extend mercy to her, but afterwards we found we had lost property from every part of the house; the articles in the indictment were found in her trunk and on her person - I suppose they are worth upwards of 5l.; we know none of her connexions, and have not found all the property - she claimed all the property at first, thought it was marked with our names; we did not take the trouble to state all the case fully to the officer when we gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said she confessed stealing the property? A. Yes; she begged for mercy - Williams was present; she claimed the property in the presence of the officer, those in the trunk; she could not claim those found on her person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which trunk were the two pairs of stockings found in? A.

Mercy! mercy!" Williams left the room at times - I am not aware that I said she was present when the prisoner asked for mercy.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. The prisoner King passed me on Sunday night, the 6th of February, near half-past six o'clock - I was standing at the corner of Earl-street and Salisbury-street, Lissongrove, about half a mile from Edgcomb's - he passed me two or three yards; I called him back knowing him, and asked what he had got about him (his appearance did not indicate that he had any thing) - he said it was all right; I put my hand into his trousers pocket, and felt a small crow-bar, called a jemmy, which I have here - I took him to the station; he unbuttoned his clothes as he went along- I suspected it was to slip out of his coat, and told him to button them up; he said, "I am not going to run away;" at the station-house I searched him further, and in the same pocket as the crow-bar I found six tea-spoons, two table-spoons, a silver watch, two salt-spoons, a pencilcase, two rows of beads, a sovereign-balance, two seals, and a watch-key: these were all in that pocket, and on his back I found this black coat, a black waistcoat, and the front of an under waistcoat - he had them on over his own clothes; he had two coats and two waistcoats, besides his own - I found a black and a yellow silk handkerchief in his hat; the black one had a pad in it - I also found a toothpick, and a shirt pin; I asked how he came in possession of the property; he said he had picked it up - I took a hat from him, which belonged to Edgcomb - on the following morning I took him some tea down to his cell; he asked if I had found an owner - I told him I had, and I was sorry to find it was so bad against him; when he got to Marylebone-office, a constable was there with two hats, which had been left behind in Edgcomb's house - he is not here; I received a hat from that constable, and knowing King wore such a hat I presented it to him, and said,"King, take your hat, and give me that you have on," which he did - he gave me Edgcomb's hat, and took the one I presented to him; I do not know whether he heard the conversation between me and the constable about the hat - after I took King I went to different stations to find out where the robbery had been committed; I was directed to the prosecutor's, and in consequence of information I went to the Sun, in Lisson-street, about half-past ten o'clock on the night of the robbery, and saw Frayne with two others sitting in one of the boxes; I did not then suspect him, and did not take him - he was afterwards taken by Webster.</p>

               <p>JURY to MR. EDGCOMB. Q. In what part of the passage did you first see Frayne? A. He had one foot on the stairs, and the other on the floor; King threw the candle down, but it did not go out.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know the time of night? A. I have a clock in the room; I said, "Don't go out to-night, for it rains very fast;" he was not out of my sight from three o'clock till after eight - I have no witnesses, for nobody came into the room while he was laying down; my husband does not live at home - he is a servant; he was at home that day - the bed is in the same room; I was reading, and did not go to sleep myself.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live at No. 103, Bishopsgate-street-without. On the 29th of January the prisoner called at my house, and offered me six China crape and imitation handkerchiefs, six Thibet shawls, and two silk shawls - I purchased four China crape handkerchiefs, all the shawls, but not the two imitation crape handkerchiefs; I first purchased the china crape handkerchiefs, for which he asked 3s. 6d. each, observing that he had never sold any of that description under 4s. before -I offered 3s. for them, which he took; he offered me the eight shawls for 4l. 16s. - I offered 4l. 10s., and he agreed to take 4l. 13s., which I gave him; after offering him 4l. 10s. for them, I said one description of the shawls were to be bought at Bradley and Greatorex's, the prosecutors, for 14s. - I named that to ascertain the price, as they were of various values; they were the lowest in value - when I made that observation, he put the shawls into a brown paper parcel, which he had taken them from, put them into a blue bag, and put them under his arm; I said I would take them, and called to my cash-keeper to hand over 4l. 13s. to him for them - he did so, and they were given up to me; I had observed a mark on one of the handkerchiefs, but said nothing to him about that - I went to the prosecutor's within half an hour of the transaction, and he saw the goods at my house that day (Saturday); on the Monday, I accompanied the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, in <placeName id="t18310217-60-crimeloc376">Fore-street, Cripplegate</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know him before that Saturday? A. Yes - I think since August or September last; he is a housekeeper, and was represented to me as a respectable man, by the person who introduced him - I am a haberdasher, and live about three quarters of a mile from him; I had made two purchases of haberdashery of him - he has several times offered me goods; I have been thirteen years in business - it is very common for manufacturers to go about to sell goods.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man had bought goods, and had to meet an acceptance, he would sell them for what he could get? A. Yes, and very frequently at a very low price, but from the condition these were in, they appeared to have come fresh from a parcel, not exposed at all - the only thing I suspected was seeing four shawls of one pattern, which few retail dealers would purchase, as they like a variety, and there were two of each of the other pattern; a man might dispose of any thing to raise money - I had purchased each of the patterns of the prosecutor, and two of them certainly within a month; they were in the daily practice of selling such things - I bought them at their warehouse; I knew where the prisoner came from - dur<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170052"/>ing our conversation about the shawls, he said he could do twine for me better than hawkers, and begged me to come and deal with him; job goods are goods under the regular price - it is not uncommon to find such goods; the prosecutor had a shawl and all the crape handkerchiefs in his pocket - one crape handkerchief was all he could swear to; the ticket with his private-mark was left on that - the prisoner could have had the goods in his hand if he chose, and I think he did; there is a glass-door between the parlour and shop, and a curtain to it - it was after Hawkins insisted on searching, that the prisoner took down the bag: the two handkerchiefs I had refused to buy were in it - I believe the other bag was empty; I do not know what was found up stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say the lowest value of the shawls was 14s.? A. The Thibet shawls were 14s. - there were two silk ones, which I value at the lowest at 12s. 6d. each.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You are now describing the warehouse price? A. Yes; people sometimes sell 12 1/2 per cent. lower, and sometimes more - part of them were summer stock.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were any of the Thibet shawls worth more than 12s. 6d.? A. Yes - the eight shawls were worth about 8l.; I paid 4l. 13s. for them - the handkerchiefs 29s., I paid 12s. - the warehouse price is 29s.</p>

On the Saturday Mr. Hall showed me some shawls and handkerchiefs, which are here; I went to the prisoner's house on Monday, showed him the property, and asked where he got it; he said he could not tell, he did not know - I told him it was very strange, (as he dealt in cord and twine,) these goods being so different to his general business, that he could not tell me where he bought them: he said he could not - I said, "Don't you know whether it was of man, woman, or child - have you no idea;" he said he knew nothing about it - he would not tell me; when the officer came in he asked if he had any more such property - he said he did not know, but when the officer was going to search, he produced two handkerchiefs from a blue bag, saying they were all he had of that description; I said, "Let me know where you have purchased these goods, and I shall be satisfied - I keep a large quantity of young men, among whom I must suspect some as thieves, till we find out the individual, and it is of great consequence for me to know who the persons are who have been robbing me:" he said he did not know, he could not tell who he bought them of, and I called in the officer; there is one crape handkerchief has my privatemark on it, and which I can identify - the others I have not the least doubt of, but will not swear to them, because my marks have been taken off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the patterns very uncommon? A. Some of them - I have them here; I do not mean to say these are the only patterns of this description in the trade - other houses may have them - I do not recollect who I bought the uncommon pattern of; I now recollect it was Buchanan - the clerk who manages that department has just reminded me of it, and I recollect it now perfectly, and can swear it from my own recollection; it is a particular style of shawl, not made by any other individual - here it is; I have no private-mark on it; we have not had many of that description - we have fifteen or sixteen shopmen, who sell, but only four in the shawl department; one of them is here, who manages that whole concern - his name is Martin; the others have liberty to sell, but he superintends - he marks the goods, and sees all that comes in and goes out; in times of difficulty persons go about to sell to dealers - we never buy in that way; there was twine, cord, and mats in the prisoner's shop.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Martin has the control of the shawl department? A. He has: we never send any goods about to be sold - no respectable house would; Buchanan lives at Glasgow.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know whether any of your people ever sold a shawl of that pattern exactly? A. Yes, many,</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Rumble. On the 7th of February, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, alone, and asked for a box of cotton, which came to 3d.; these handkerchiefs were on the counter, close to him - he tendered me a shilling; I had no halfpence in the till, and sent my brother out to get change; while he was gone a man came in to look at a cravat which was in the window - I turned my head to get it, and on turning again saw the prisoner running out of the shop door, without waiting for his change; I looked on the counter, and missed the twenty silk handkerchiefs - they were in four pieces; my brother came in immediately, and I sent him after him - he brought him back within five minutes; I took off his hat. and found thirteen of the handkerchiefs in it - the other man paid 1s. for the cravat, and went out; seven handkerchiefs are missing, and have not been found.</p>

            . I am the last witness' brother. I saw the prisoner in the shop, and the handkerchiefs on the counter; I was gone about two minutes for the change - on returning my brother was at the door, and told me to run after the prisoner, without saying what he had done - our shop is opposite Fetter-lane; he ran up Chancery-lane - I followed, and missed him for some time; I ran further than him, and as I turned back I saw him coming up on the other side of the way, with another person - he saw me, and started across the road; I ran, caught him, and brought him back - I found thirteen handkerchiefs in his hat; he called out to the person who was with him, but he ran away - he was a young man, about nineteen or twenty years of age.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When did you see the work last? A. On the 9th of July - I put it by; I believe it was after he left - it was tied up regularly for delivery, in sheets; not bound - not one copy had been sent home to Mr. Colburn, the publisher, for two years, when exactly two thousand were sent to him in sheets, in the same state as those stolen - I discovered the loss on the 23rd of December; Mr. Baylis discharged a boy that day - I took that boy into custody on the 6th - he is not in custody now; I have not taken means to apprehend any body but the prisoner for this property - I have attempted to find people for other losses.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and live in Fetter-lane, in the City - the prisoner came to my shop about September last, and offered paper for sale, which he described as misprinted; I asked if it came from a printer's; he said, Yes; I said, "Is it your property?" he said No, it belonged to the men, and was their perquisite for beer - I did not open it; I bought it as waste-paper, at 3d. a lb., which is a fair price - I bought the quantity now produced at twice; about half each time - he brought the other half about two or three days after - the first weighed about 10 lbs.; when he brought the second parcel, I asked if there was any more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170054"/>of it - he said, "No, not at present;" he had offered waste-paper for sale about a month before, but I did not buy it - I told him it was too good for my business; he showed meens sheet; it was a thick good paper, and printed on - I showed Moss the same paper as I bought of the prisoner; I had opened it, but used none of it - it weighed 19lbs., and I have not a doubt of its being the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Which end of Fetter - lane do you live in? A. The middle - it is in the City; I occasionally sell a little writing-paper; I buy waste-paper, and sell it if I have more than I want - I opened this for a person to look at after I had bought it; he looked at it as waste-paper - it did not suit him; I did not know it was books with the title; it was all clean perfect sheets, in quires - I have dealt in waste-paper about twelve months; I do not recollect buying of any other boys - Moss clamined it early in January.</p>

            . This is the paper I saw at Paget's - it was given to Hall the officer; the 19lbs. make twenty-one perfect volumes of the Highways and Byeways - it is perfect, and cannot be mistaken for waste; the prisoner must know it was perfect from his experience in the business; Mr. Colburn's name is Henry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear this is not part of the two thousand copies sent from the printing-office? A. I should think not, but cannot swear it positively.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Suppose they are part of the two thousand, would they be Mr. Colburn's property? A. There is no doubt of it - the two thousand copies were sent off above two years ago.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are misprinted copies the workmen's perquisites? A. Not a sheet; if a journeyman spils paper he has to pay for it, and has it for his own use.</p>

            . I live in Ireland-yard, near Canterbury-court, and work at my needle. On Thursday, the 3rd of February, about half-past eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to my mother's, and asked for a furnished lodging for a single man - we directed him to Mrs. Stoker's, as a place to get one.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 4th of February, at the Acron public-house, for robbing this lodging - I found none of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170055"/>property on him; he denied the charge - I do not know where he slept on the Thursday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I certainly laid down there - I was tired when I took the lodging, and was going to return there the next day; I was just by there - I had no more property about me than I have now; I sat by the kitchen fire with her before I went out - she gave me the bottle, and opened the door to me; it was impossible for me to have the things without her seeing them.</p>

It was shut all that day, as it was very cold - we have a bell to the door, which rings when it opens; there was not a creature came into the house besides him - I and my mother live in the room close to the door, and can see any body going up and down - the door was shut when the prisoner was with me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Now, do not you believe her name was Drew? A. No - I have a certificate which the second wife got; I did not know her name before she was married - I had seen her several times with the prisoner, who had worked for me several years - I did not recollect her name when I said Drew; I have heard her husband say her name was Rowe - I should be able to say, independent of this paper, that the name of the person I saw was Rowe, for she told me so herself, two or three weeks ago; I know it was mentioned in discourse when she brought work to my house - I cannot swear when I heard the prisoner state her name was Rowe, the time is so long ago; she said "It is my house."</p>

               <p>Q. I do not ask if you were married, but were you ever supposed to be married or represented as Lynch's wife? A. No - I did go by the name of Lynch, because I did not want the prisoner to find me out; he was continually annoying me day and night - that was since I married him; I did go by the name of Lynch before I was married, but I was by myself; I knew Lynch by working for the same shop - I did not go by his name as his wife; I went by that name in the lodging, and by his getting me into the same shop he worked for - I went by that name, because I did not wish to go by my own name; I never went by the name of Mrs. Lynch - I lived ten or twelve weeks in the same house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this question, and take care how you answer it; did you never go by the name of any man before you married the prisoner? A. By the name of Lynch I did for two or three years, but I was not reputed to be his wife - he was not long in London; I went by the name of

               <p>Q. Then, do you mean to say that the prisoner had no authority from you to describe you as a widow, and that you never were treated as a widow in any company? A. No, my Lord, he had not, neither did I know he did so when he put the banns up.</p>

On the 31st of December we took stock, and discovered some deficiences; we heard something of the prisoner, and I went with the officer to his lodging -I think it is in White Horse-court; I there found these silver ornaments in a drawer - they are worth 8s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. There was plenty of time for him to have got rid of them? A. Yes - we had no difficulty in finding the lodging; the ornaments are silver shells in an unfinished state; they are articles on which he might have been employed; the men are not allowed to take work home - these are struck from a private die; there is no die like it in the trade - we may have sold one hundred, but these are not finished; he never sold small articles for us - he arrived at his lodgings while I was there.</p>

            . I was looking for the prisoner, and found her on the 10th of February, under the Quadrant, in Regent-street; she said she had the gown and cloak on - I asked what she had done with the towels; she said she knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an unfortunate girl - the prosecutor's wife gets her living by taking in such as I am - the cloak and gown were lent to me, and I intended to return them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE MAYES re-examined. Q. Did your wife lend her these things? A. She had, but not at that time; the prisoner had to go to the dispensary twice a week, as they said there was something the matter with her - I did not know the prisoner was in the habit of going out; there is a young person who lives in my house and has one child; she is kept by a gentleman - her sister also lives there; a man and his wife, named Bunnings, live in the kitchen - he belongs to the parish; my wife keeps good hours.</p>

On the 24th of January I had, I believe, eight or nine persons in my shop; my usual time to shut up is ten o'clock- all the other persons had left at that time, but the prisoner, and a man named Stevens staid - they began to sing and make a noise; I said, "I will thank you to leave, or I shall be obliged to put you out;" I took hold of Stevens and put him out - he kept fighting me all the way, and ripped open my waistcoat; the prisoner then came, and put his arm round me, but I did not feel his hands in my pockets - I believe he and Stevens had come together; they had drank together, and appeared to be friends - I cannot say which of them paid: there were not above two pints of beer had, for which my servant took the money - at the time I put Stevens out I had about 12s. in my breeches pocket, as near as could be - I found my pocket turned out, and the money all gone - some person took up one shilling at the door, at the spot where the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170062"/>had hold of me - I had my money safe about a quarter of an hour before; I had then taken it out, looked at it, and put it into my pocket - all the others had gone out; my servant found 1s. 6d. behind the door, the next morning - the prisoner was taken into custody at the very moment, by the Policeman; I think 5s. 7 1/2d. was 
found on him.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had the prisoner his hand in your pockets? A. I did not feel his hand in either of my pockets - there was no disturbance in the house, but with Stevens and the prisoner; Stevens' wife had been there drinking - we had not had a row together, but when they were at the door she put her hand on my shoulder - there had been a row between Stevens and one Taylor half an hour before, and I went to interfere, but I had not put my money into my pocket then; I took it out of the till - I took hold of Stevens in the first row to part them; they had him down, and I took the man off him - there were eight or nine persons in my house at the time of the last squabble, there were from ten to twenty persons about - I knew both Stevens and the prisoner well- they were neighbours; the prisoner was not searched on the spot.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. These parties were in your house, and you found it your duty to turn them out? A. Yes, and after they were gone I felt my money - I held Stevens at a distance; he could not reach me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you knocked down? A. No, I never was knocked down - Stevens' wife, or a woman, put her hand on my shoulder; my waistcoat was torn, and my breeches pocket torn down and turned out.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner and Stevens being there, after the others had gone - my master went to them and said, "Now, gentlemen, I will thank you to go, for my time is up;" they both began to sing - Stevens said, "No, d-n my eyes if I will go;" the prisoner made the same answer - my master said, "Then I will put you out," and he took Stevens and pushed him out, holding him at arms length - the prisoner then came behind him, put his arms round him, and said,"Pray don't, Mr. Flack;" he had his arm round him when the Policeman came up, and my master gave him in charge for the noise first; then he put his hands down, felt his left-hand pocket inside out, and said, "He has picked my pocket, take him in charge;" a person then said,"There is a shilling down," - he picked it up inside the door; and the next morning I found, behind the door 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the principal waiter? A. Yes; it is the sign of William the Fourth - I suppose there might be fifteen persons outside the house; I never saw the prisoner's hand in master's pocket - I suppose master's waistcoat was torn by Stevens' other hand.</p>

I said, "Mr, Johnson, come and relieve me," but he went on - he said he had money in his pocket; I then went on to Mr. Townes, a saddler, but he was not at home - I then went on, and was still surrounded by a mob; and, being faint, I slipped off the pavement under a cart, in Newgate-street - when I got up my watch was gone; I should not have known it, but a boy picked up the case of it - the prisoner was then gone; I did not see any one I knew there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. So, then, this woman ran away? A. Yes, Sir; but she was taken in a moment afterwards - I do not rightly know where; I was so pushed about that I cannot tell whether she was taken on the very spot, or was demanding the money, which she said I had defranding her of - she had never ceased to accuse me of defrauding her of the 1s. 6d.; I believe the officer who took hold of me, in the church-yard, is not here - I do not know where she put the first shilling; the sponges were forced upon me - I had no wish to buy them; it was more like charity - the second shilling she put into her mouth; I do not know whether she might have swallowed it - I did not see her searched; there were two men supporting me; I believe it was the street-keeper who took her at last - I cannot say whether any money was found on her; she kept hold of my collar all the way, and a mob of people were about, who seemed to be taking my part, but they might be some of her friends; my watch-ribbon was what she saw - there is not the least doubt of it; I was very poorly, and was tossed about by the crowd - I have had people to inquire about her, who say she is a notorious character; I have not heard that her father is in the employ of Mr. Myers - she had hold of my collar when the officer came up, in the church-yard, and said I had not paid her; but there were persons who had seen me pay her - a man said so, but I have no business to call him - the prisoner had hold of my collar when I slipped down, and that was the time my watch was taken; she nearly fell down.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Have you ever got your watch again? A. No; I paid eight guineas for it a good many years ago - it was capped and jewelled.</p>

            . I live in Great Alie-street - I saw a mob in Newgate-street; I ran up, and saw the prisoner holding the prosecutor's collar, and her other hand had hold of his watch-ribbon - almost directly I got up they both fell; I saw a boy bring the watch-case to the prosecutor, and then he said his watch was gone - the prisoner was then gone too; I ran in the direction she went to see if she was stopped - I came up to her in St. Martin's-le-grand, opposite the Post-office; she was there given to the officer by some men who had stopped her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not in St. Paul's-churchyard? A. No; I had lost sight of her when the prosecutor said his watch was gone - he was not far up Newgate-street, going to the Old Bailey, on the right-hand side; upon my oath, the prisoner had got more than three yards from him before she was taken; I looked to see where she was, and I ran into St. Martin's-le-grand - I did not hear what was said between her and the prosecutor; they fell down nearly together - I did not see whether they got up together, as there was a mob got round them; a very few second selapsed from the time I lost sight of her till she was brought back; I was at the Compter when she was searched; I believe the prosecutor did not come in till afterwards - I did not see any silver, or watch, found on her, or any ribbon.</p>
               <p>JOHN LAYCOCK. I live at No. 3, Hanover-court, Milton-street, Cripplegate. I saw the prosecutor and prisoner together - I saw him pay her a shilling for some sponge, and as he was turning round to walk about his business, she caught hold of him, and said he had not paid her - as they were going along Newgate-street I parted them, and he went on; she then turned round behind me, and caught hold of him again - they both fell down in the kennel, and I pulled them both up; as soon as I had pulled them up a little boy picked up the watch-case, and gave it to the prosecutor - be directly said his watch was gone; the prisoner was then gone - I believe she ran away; I did not see any more of her till the officer was bringing her back - it was between Butcherhall-lane and Bagnio-court that they fell down, and about the second lamp down St. Martin's-legrand I saw the officer bringing her back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. A labouring man, but I am out of employ, and have been for a fortnight- I was at that time going to inquire about a situation; I last lived with Mrs. Bailey, in Chapel-street, Grub-street - she is a town carwoman; I have not seen the little boy here who picked up the watch-case - he was at Guildhall the first day; the officer did not ask his name there - I believe he gave his name at the Compter, I do not know to whom - I have had no money, nor any thing else for coming here - I swear I have not talked to the officer about it; I was present at the beginning of the transaction - I did not see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170065"/>any constable before this one; I believe it was the same man who removed them from the church-yard - I did not see the woman in the saddler's shop; I had only seen one shilling paid to her - I saw one sponge, and I saw him pay her a shilling for it; I do not know whether he had any more than one sponge; upon my oath, I have not been promised money for my evidence to-night; I was by them all the time, but when I pulled them out of the kennel she was gone - I cannot say how long she was gone; I went into the Compter, but I believe I was not there when she was searched.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. She did not repeat her charge of not being paid for the sponge, after she got up out of the kennel? A. No - I lost sight of her.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner together in Cheapside; I saw a great crowd cross from St. Paul's-church-yard to Cheapside - they went a little way down, and I followed them; I took the prisoner about ten yards down St. Martin's-le-grand, hearing that she had run away with the prosecutor's watch - I did not see them when they fell down; there was a general cry of the watch being lost, and people were running after the prisoner, which induced me to follow her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the officer who interfered in St. Paul's-church-yard? A. No, that is a mistake of the witness' - I saw them in Cheapside; I saw them going from the saddler's-shop to Newgate-street - the prisoner said the man had not paid her; she had hold of him, and refused to quit him - I separated them, and desired her to go about her business - the prosecutor said he had paid her; I did not take charge of him, because I have such trifling things every day, and I do all I can to get them out of my district - when I took them out of Cheapside and down Newgate-street, I got a good many of the crowd away, and I left them - I saw no part of the first transaction; I took her in about three minutes after he said he had lost his watch - she was running down St. Martin's-le-grand, and was stopped; plenty of people saw her run - I took her from some other person's custody, about ten yards down St. Martin's-le-grand; I searched her in the Compter - I found some halfpence and some sponge on her, but no watch, nor a shilling; I took down the name and address of the boy who found the case - he lives in Ironmonger-row, St. Luke's; I have his name on a piece of paper at home, but I do not recollect it - Sir

               <p>JURY to C. W. BREWER. Q. Why did you not call out when you saw her lay hold of the watch-ribbon? A.

            . In the course of last autumn I came to London from Cheltenham, where I reside; Mrs. Loyd and my children accompanied me - I came to town in September; the first time I saw the prisoner was when I paid an evening visit to a gentleman in Ulster-place, in the early part of the year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember attending an inquest held upon Miss Cashin, in the Hampstead-road, at any time when the prisoner was there? A. Yes, I saw the prisoner there four or five days - it was as long as the inquest lasted; Mrs. Loyd was not with me the two first days - she was not acquainted with him previously; we became well acquainted with him in consequence of seeing him at that inquest; Mrs. Loyd afterwards consulted him professionally on account of her child, but occasionally mentioned to him a complaint she herself was subject to, which was an occasional choking in her throat when she caught cold, or any thing excited her - I have accompanied her to Mr. Long's house to consult him about it; the first time I went there was about a fortnight before she put herself under his care - she became his patient on the 5th of October, but did not inhale till the 6th; she was then in very good health, otherwise than this occasional choking - she had caught a slight cold a few months before that, and a little before the 6th of October she applied a small blister to her throat, about the size of half a dollar; this was on the Sunday night or Monday morning before the 6th - I have a memorandum here in her own hand writing.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY (the prisoner's Counsel.) I make no objection to that being used with respect to the dates.</p>
               <p>Q. Then tell us the date that a blister was applied? A. Sunday, the 3rd, she found herself unwell, and put the blister on during the night; it was nearly well on the 6th - she had frequently applied that blister when this affection was coming on; she became Mr. Long's patient on the 6th, and went again on the 7th, 8th, and 9th; I was not with her on the 9th - she was rubbed that day across the chest; I did not see it done - I did not see her breast till Sunday evening, the 10th; she had been to Mr. Long's on the 10th, and in the evening complained of a violent burning across her chest, and I examined her chest and breast - there was a great redness across the breast or bosom, and it was darker in the middle than in other parts; she complained that evening of great chilliness, shivering with cold, but a burning heat across the breast - she passed a very restless uncomfortable night; she was very unwell all the next day, and complained of great thirst - she was up for some time, and then laid on the bed again; she did not go down stairs - she complained of sickness at the stomach, and being very thirsty continually; she was feverish all day - I saw her breast and chest on Monday; the redness got more vivid - it got stronger, and the spot in the centre darker; it was white round the edges, and much puffed up - it discharged from the centre a dirty whitish thick kind of substance, and the cabbage-leaves which were taken off appeared slimy; I understood the cabbage-leaves were applied by Mr. Long - they were kept on by his direction; I believe they were first applied on the Saturday, but not seeing the breast I cannot say; I first knew of a cabbage-leaf being there on Sunday, the 10th - on Monday Mrs. Loyd felt an odd sensation, as she had felt the evening before, a sickness, and was very uncomfortable every way; Mr. Long did not call to see her on Monday - I am not aware that he knew where we lived; she passed a very uncomfortable night, indeed, on Monday - I saw her breast and chest again on Tuesday morning; the redness was, if any thing, greater - the spot in the centre of the breast more puffed up, and darker; the redness spread considerably more, and round the edges where it stopped there were blisters, the same as when a common blister is applied - they were in the skin, from the discharge which had gone over the bosom, and appeared to me only to have stopped where the bed-clothes might have touched and absorbed it; the inner part of the arms were very red, from the discharge which had gone down on each side; wherever the discharge had gone, the skin was very much irritated, and red; and in the end, wherever that discharge had gone, the flesh mortified, and was taken off afterwards - I mean many days after during her illness; but the smell began to be very bad in about a week or ten days; she felt very unwell on Tuesday the 12th, very hot, feverish, restless, and had no appetite, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Long about the middle of that day - I saw him; he expressed his surprise - he asked me why Mrs. Loyd had not come to inhale, and go on with her rubbing; I told him it was impossible, she was so very ill - that she had been constantly unwell from the Sunday night, and was suffering a great deal of pain - he said he dare say<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170068"/>that would soon go off; that it was generally the case - I told him of the chilliness and shivering she had on the Sunday night, and that we had given her some hot wine and water to relieve her when she was going to bed - he said hot brandy and water would have been a better thing, and to have put her head under the bed-clothes -I said her breast and chest looked very red and very bad, but did not describe it perhaps so minutely as I have to-day; he said that generally was the case in the first instance, but it would go off in a very short time; there was no fear or danger, and I need not be uneasy about it - I requested him to come in the evening, and described where we lived - he came that evening; I do not know at what time; I was in the room - (while I had been with him in the day, Mrs. Loyd, from excessive pain, had thrown aside the cabbage-leaves, and put on a little blister-dressing to allay the heat; and when he came into the room,) he said he was sorry to see her so unwell; she was in bed - he said she ought rather to have got up, and endeavoured to have come to him, and he would have endeavoured to relieve her; she said it was impossible, she was in such pain and suffering, and with her breast open in that way it might be dangerous - he then asked to look at it, and did; he said those greasy plaisters had no business there (they were what she had put on herself), and that she ought to have continued the cabbage-leaf - she said she could not bear the pain of keeping it on; he then took off his great coat, and said he would rub it out, which would give her relief - he turned up the cuff of his coat, apparently preparing to rub it; she exclaimed very much at the idea of such a thing, and said she wondered at his thinking of rubbing, in the state her breast was in, and asked if there was no way he could give her relief without touching her breast, for she could not bear to be touched - he asked what she wished; she said, "To be healed;" he said it would never heal with those greasy plaisters; that was not the way he healed sores or wounds; (I do not know which he called it) - he called for a towel, which I gave him; he began dabbing it on the breast and across the bosom, but particularly in the centre where the discharge was oozing from; the discharge proceeded only from the centre; whenever that discharge came, it took off the skin ultimately; the skin was all discoloured and red wherever it reached, and ultimately brought it off.</p>

               <p>Q. Having dabbed it with a towel, what did he do? A. He said old linen was the best thing to heal a thing of that kind with; but she said she had always been in the habit of healing any thing of that kind with the simple dressing she had used - that her skin and flesh were very healthy, and healed immediately; she had been in the habit of using that simple dressing when she put a small blister on her throat - he said old linen was preferable, but she might use that if she liked, he saw no objection to it, and when it skinned over he would rub it again - she said No, she thought she never could submit to rubbing again, from what she was then suffering; I assisted him on with his coat, and he took his leave.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any observation he made when you first stated the appearance of the breast and chest? A. He spoke in his usual manner, "Oh, that is nothing; it is the case generally in the first instance" - he called again next evening, Wednesday, the 13th; Mrs. Loyd was then suffering a deal from pain, and was in a very low state from low spirits, pain, agitation, and fever, and dreaded any thing touching her breast - we made a little kind of cradle to keep the clothes from touching her- the prisoner did not see her that evening; she was alarmed on hearing of his arrival, and begged I would not allow him to come up, and he never saw her again - Mr.

            Campbell had seen her on the Tuesday evening, the 12th, and saw her several times a day after that - I do not recollect whether he saw her more than once on the Tuesday, but after that he saw her several times a day; he lives close by, and was very attentive - Mr. Vance was called in some days after, and Mr. Brodie came as a friend of Mr. Vance's; she died on the 8th of November; I believe it was exactly a mouth and a day after she had been to Mr. Long's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Mrs. Loyd was on a visit at Kensington, at Mr. Campbell's mother's house? A. Yes; we intended to take her apartments, but wished to remove her nearer to Mr. Long's - Mr. Campbell is a medical man; we were at Mrs. Campbell's when Mrs. Loyd began to attend Mr. Long, and continued there till her death - Mr. Campbell saw her on the Tuesday evening before the prisoner saw her; he is a young man, but has been several years in practice, I believe - I believe she had applied the plaister herself, which Mr. Long complained of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Long say it was the most likely thing in the world to counteract the proper application of his treatment? A. Not that I recollect - he said it was not what he was in the habit of using; it was a common blister-dressing, a common healing plaister after a blister - he said it would not heal it; it was not the grease he talked of rubbing out; none of that had come off the plaister; it had been merely put on lint, and put on the breast - I considered he meant to rub out the application which had been formerly rubbed in; he had not found fault with the effect of the greasy plaister, but with the application of it; he said the cabbage-leaves ought to have been kept on - I think Mr. Vance was called in on the Thursday after Mr. Campbell began to attend her; he at that time was her only medical attendant.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner was refused permission to attend her, did not he send a medical gentleman, named Rawlings, requesting he might be allowed to see her? A. There was some extraordinary character called to see her; I do not know when it was - he said he came from the prisoner; I referred him to Mr. Vance and Mr. Campbell, and did not allow him to see her - Mrs. Loyd had been occasionally afflicted with this complaint in her throat for some years; Mr. Vance attended her for it two years ago - my son had attended the prisoner for some time before Mrs. Loyd; he had been about a fortnight inhaling before she went - her going with him led to the conversation about her throat - he attended some days after his mother's illness; I had told Mr. Long if he allowed my boy to attend him (it did not then suit my convenience, but) after Christmas I would pay him - this was before my boy went to him; this was in consequence of an unexpected curtailment of my income - he said I could send him, and he would attend to him; my son was desired to tell the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170069"/>prisoner he need not come any longer to see his mamma, as she was better.</p>
               <p>MR. WHATELEY. Q. Was it after Mrs. Loyd had declined to see the prisoner that this message was sent? A. Yes; Mrs. Loyd paid the prisoner's fees - I have it here in her own hand-writing, and I gave her the money to pay it - she states here, "6th, Began inhaling at Mr. Long's, paid him 1l.," and on the 9th here is 1l. paid him - she was with him on the 10th; I do not know whether he fixed for her to come on the 11th; the plaister she had on when he came on the 12th, was a preparation of lard, spread on lint - it might have been on two hours, but I was not there when it was put on.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in St. George's-place, Knightsbridge. I was well acquainted with the late Mrs. Loyd from her marriage, about fourteen years, and have known Captain Loyd from a boy - they generally lived at Cheltenham; I always considered Mrs. Loyd a very healthy woman - she and Captain Loyd came to visit me on the 28th of September; Mrs. Loyd appeared in very good health, but her throat was sometimes troublesome, a sort of stoppage in it when swallowing - I never accompanied her to Mr. Long. On Sunday evening, the 10th of October, she was sitting with me on the sofa, and was taken with a shivering fit; that was the first symptom of her illness that I perceived, except the irritation in her throat - her bed was immediately warmed; she was carried up to bed, and warm water bottles applied, but the shivering continued, and was very violent - I left her about two o'clock in the morning, to go to bed, and saw her next morning about nine or half-past nine; she complained very much of a soreness in her bosom, and I saw it then for the first time - it was very much inflamed all over the chest, from shoulder to shoulder, very red, and extended from the throat down about six inches - the skin did not appear to be broken then; she did not leave her bed that day, to my knowledge - I saw her frequently, but did not stay with her all day; she changed her bed room once, but never came down stairs again, and never left her bed, except to go from one room to the other; I remember Mr. Long coming one Tuesday evening - I went into the room and he was using a cloth, wiping the discharge from her chest; I saw her breast - it was very much inflamed, and the wound in the centre more marked than when I first saw it; the inflammation was more extensive - the wound in the centre was about the size of the top of a large tea-cup; not quite so large as a breakfast-cup - it was larger than a dollar; she was in very great pain in the forenoon, before Mr. Long came - Mr. Campbell, my son, had applied a simple dressing of spermaceti-ointment, and removed the cabbage-leaf; it was the same plaister as Mrs. Loyd had used before to a blister on her throat - my son is a surgeon, and has been in practice about seven years; I was not in the room when Mr. Long first came - I heard Mrs. Loyd complain of the pain in her chest; Mr. Long asked if she wished him to rub it out - I think that was the expression; she said she would not have it rubbed any more; she would not endure it again - he then asked what she wished to have done; she said she wished it to be dried up and healed - he objected to the ointment which had been applied, and said she should apply nothing but dry linen; she said she had often had blisters, and healed them with that ointment without any trouble: he said, if that was the case, he saw no objection to her using it again - he, after that, went away; he gave her no direction as to diet, nor prescribed any medicine that I heard - he called next day. and was not admitted; I saw Mrs. Loyd frequently - she remained at my house till she died; she at one time appeared a little better - we had once a hope of her recovery; she was in a dreadful state - in a perfect torture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that she was in perfect torture during the whole time after Mr. Long left her? A. She was, till the mortification took place - her sufferings were most acute; my son attended her till her death, and Mr. Vance and Mr. Brodie saw her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you ever in company with the deceased when she went to the inquest held on Miss Cashin? A. No; they were not at our house then - I know it was after that inquest that she went to Mr. Long.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday she had the shivering fit, had she been out any where? A. She had been to Mr. Long's, and been rubbed a second time, as she told me - he lives in Harley-street, which may be two miles from my house; I cannot say whether she walked there and back - she was a good walker; I have no reason to suppose she did not walk - she went no where else to my knowledge: she went out about twelve o'clock, and returned some time before dinner, which was about five o'clock; she had complained of her throat several times - it could scarcely be called an illness; I never knew her under any body's care for it but Mr. Vance's - when I saw Mr. Long in her room Captain Loyd had fetched him; the wound had then broken, and water was oozing from it - Mr. Long disapproved of the greasy plaister; my son has had seven years' practice - I have not another son a chemist; he died, but the shop is kept on under the same name - my son first attended Mrs. Loyd on Tuesday, the 12th; nobody attended her on Monday, but the cabbage-leaf was applied according to Mr. Long's order - she was not out of bed at all.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You did not know till she was taken with the shivering fit that she had been to Mr. Long? A. She told me that day at dinner time that she had been; I knew she had been and inhaled, but did not know she had been that day - I saw her breast on the Monday.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Wilton-place, which is a little more than one hundred yards from my mother's. I knew Mrs. Loyd shortly after she was married - she appeared quite a healthy person; I saw her first about her breast on Tuesday, the 12th of October, about four o'clock in the afternoon, at my mother's request; she was suffering very great pain, and told me she was in perfect agony - the appearances of her breast were such as to make it probable she was suffering great pain; I found a very extensive wound, covering the whole interior part of the chest - I think any strong acid would produce such a wound; the skin was destroyed and laying in folds on the chest, completely suppurated and the cellular membrane, which is under the skin, was partly destroyed - there was a considerable discharge from the whole of the wound, which extended nearly from one arm-pit to the other, and from the throat down to the stomach; the skin was off both breasts - the centre of the wound was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170070"/>a higher state of inflammation, darker in colour; I think I removed the cabbage-leaves - it would take several cabbage-leaves to cover the wound; I applied a simple dressing of spermaceti-ointment - I only saw her once that day; I saw her on the Wednesday. and daily, till her death, generally two or three times a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider the wound dangerous to life when you first saw it? A. Very much so; I continued to apply that ointment - it was the only dressing I applied till I saw Mr. Vance; he continued to apply the same dressing, with some addition of calamine powder, and the second or third day he applied a bread and water poultice; nothing that we applied could possibly increase the danger - Mr. Vance was called in on the 21st; I described accurately to him the treatment I had adopted - there was once some slight hopes of her recovery; I was always very fearful it would terminate fatally - I gave her at first some saline aperient medicine, and after that she had bark, mineral acids, and quinine, to prevent mortification as much as we could, to support nature - as soon as mortification took place, she took the bark and mineral acids; the spot became gangrenous about a week after I attended her - she died of that wound decidedly.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, would it be necessary or proper to produce such a wound for the purpose of correcting any difficulty in swallowing? A. No; I know of no disease whatever in which it would be necessary or proper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been a surgeon? A. I have been in practice six or seven years; it has been a fair practice - a common blister will often produce effects which the person who prescribed it never contemplated; it has assumed an unhealthy appearance sometimes, and had an injurious effect; it was after Mr. Vance was called in that there were slight hopes of her recovery, and before I thought there might be hope -Mr. Long had no opportunity of applying any thing after I was called in.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said that for a pain in the throat such a wound ought not to be produced - must not the remedy applied depend not on the external appearance alone, but very often on the symptoms the patient relates? A. Upon that he must guide his treatment, of course - I was not present when Mrs. Loyd stated her symptoms to Mr. Long -I thought the wound dangerous from the first, but it was not desired by Mrs. Loyd that any body else should be called in; I do not recollect that I proposed it to her, and I did not think it necessary - I thought as long as her friends were satisfied it was enough; the general practice is to state our opinion, and leave to the friends to act - immediately after mortification took place another medical practitioner was called in; I had no wish for additional assistance before - I think gangrene came on seven or eight days after she was under my care; I cannot tell the day of the week - I thought it not unlikely from the beginning that she might sink under the effects of the wounds; I feared gangrene from the beginning - I stated the danger I apprehended to Mrs. Higgins, Mrs. Loyd's sister - I also stated it in the house; this was previous to Mr. Vance attending - I should think it was three or four days after my attending her, that I stated I was afraid it would be dangerous - I attended her nearly a month; Mr. Long had no opportunity of prescribing for her during that time.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Though you apprehended danger from the first, did you consider it a case of difficulty in the treatment? A. No, I did not - I considered that I understood it perfectly; I saw the body after death, and have no reason to think I was mistaken - I never saw a blister of that size applied; in cases where unexpected results have followed the application of a blister there has generally been afterwards appearances to account for those results.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You did not use any application to reduce the inflammation? A. I think the simple dressing would reduce it - I never tried a poppy poultice, and do not think that would reduce it; in the state it was in on Tuesday, I should have thought that rubbing would have increased the inflammation - it could not have been in the least beneficial; I think I told Captain Loyd immediately on my seeing the wound, that I thought it was dangerous - I do not recollect the expression I used; I have not a doubt that I told him it was dangerous; and I told my mother the first day I saw her, that I was afraid Mrs. Loyd would never recover.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Sackville-street. I first saw Mrs. Loyd on the 21st of October - she was in bed; Mr. Campbell was present - she complained of extreme soreness at her mouth and throat, and ascribed the complaint to having inhaled through a tube at Mr. Long's, in Harley-street; on examining her chest, I found a sloughing ulcer of great extent, where, by her own account, she had been rubbed by a liniment, which might produce mortification - if she had been rubbed by a corrosive liniment, or a violent application, it might have that effect; it extended from one arm to the other, and from the upper part of the breast-bone, to, I suppose, a little below the nipples - it was stated to me, by a person who measured it, to be seventeen inches long, and ten or eleven broad, and in my judgment that was about the size; the centre of the wound was dark and in a state of mortification, and towards the circumference there was a little appearance of health - the dead parts were separating from the living; in a day or two a more unfavourable change took place, the parts assumed a flabby condition, mortification became extensive, and I imparted to her friends the certainty of her death - nothing that I applied materially arrested the progress of the disease; she gradually grew weaker, and died on the 8th of November; a few days after I first visited her Mr. Campbell and I, and both distinctly, at different times removed dead flesh from the breast, and found the breast-bone bare; Mr. Campbell stated to me, when I was first called in, the treatment he had adopted, and he conformed to my suggestions subsequently - I certainly approved of the mode of treatment he had adopted; I had attended Mrs. Loyd about three years before for an affection of the throat - I was at first under an impression that she might have a narrow orifice into the stomach, but having passed a pretty long sponge several times, I was satisfied that was not the disease; and that it was a complaint called globus hystericus, which is a nervous affection, an inverted motion of the cesophagus; it is a very common complaint, particularly with women in early life - I never knew a woman die of it; I have seen some thousands in it - in my opinion, a wound on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170071"/>the chest would not relieve such a disease; I afterwards attended the opening of the body, by desire of the Coroner - the whole body, both internal and external, was in a very healthy state; it was externally very fat, but all in a healthy state, with two exceptions - one was the disease of the gland, and the inflammatory effect of the lining of the windpipe, occasioned by their contiguity to the upper part of the ulcer; I am certain of that- it is my opinion, that before the ulcer was occasioned those two parts were free from disease; there was a little narrowness at the entrance of the oesophagus, which I believe to be congenital, as there was no thickening of the part; I believe the mortification to be the cause of her death, and that to be caused by high inflammation, which was produced by some powerful application.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was there any period at which you gave the deceased's friend's hopes of her recovery? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose a liniment, or liquid, to have been applied on Sunday, the 10th, to have been rubbed in then, and spread so as to produce the appearance of inflammation on Tuesday evening from arm to arm, was that such a case as might have produced the effect you observed? A. Certainly; I should suppose the body was pre-disposed to inflammation, as it was a very fat and healthy body, indeed, it would be evident to any man of common judgment.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a man of common prodence, or skill, have applied what would have produced such an inflammation as has been described to have taken place two days after the application? A. I think not - all irritating external applications sometimes exceed our expectations; I would add, that they are generally kept within control - it certainly would be an act of great rashness to use an application that could have produced such an inflammation, and would certainly be ignorance.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If you had been called in, say on the 12th, could you have prevented her death? A. That is a very difficult question to reply to - I should like to be excused giving an opinion beyond my own knowledge of facts; I should think it was not likely that I could - I think it was a case of great peril from the commencement; I have admitted, from Mr. Campbell's account, the propriety of his treatment, and therefore I do not conceive I could have improved it.</p>
               <p>Q. You approved of Mr. Campbell's treatment? A. The account he gave me satisfied me of the propriety of his management - his account to day corresponds with the account he gave me; "simple" applied to ointment, means it is not of an irritating quality.</p>

            , ESQ. I was requested by Mr. Vance to see the deceased, on Friday, the 29th of October - I found her in a very dangerous state; a large sloughing ulcer in her breast and chest, the appearance of which led me to believe that in all probability it would be the cause of her death - I believe that ulcer might be produced by rubbing a corrosive liniment on the part on the 10th.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any state of disease which would render it necessary to apply a liniment capable of producing such an ulcer? A. No, I do not know of any disease which could induce a person to use a liniment with the intention of producing such an effect; I have heard Mr. Campbell examined - I was present at the examination after death, and from the evidence given, I should not think that other medical assistance would have been likely to produce any other result - it does not appear to me that any different treatment would produce a different effect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. I believe it is quite a common practice now to use counter-irritation? A. Yes, it always has been.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not the same application that on one subject will produce beneficial effect, often produced an injurious one, going beyond what was intended? A. Certainly; it of course depends on the habit and constitution; the effects of application of external liniments certainly sometime go beyond what was intended.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the most scientific practitioner may be deceived in his application? A. Certainly; he cannot always calculate to a nicety - I do not recollect an instance of death having been produced by a blister, but I suppose such a thing may have been - I should suppose a patient, walking five or six miles with a blister on her breast, would add to the irritation - I should not treat all wounds alike; I should inquire the cause of the wound, and the state of the patient.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose an ulcer from a blister to be caused by an application unknown to the medical adviser, would not the application of any substance, not congenial, tend to increase the wound? A. I think it would be desirable to know the nature of the application, but do not think it would lead to a different treatment - we do not always apply the same antidore in cases of poison, especially in poisons taken into the stomach.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not an incompatible substance, applied to a wound in the breast, be likely to produce mischief instead of good? A. I suppose that some substances might be better than others; with respect to the external treatment, I do not know that the surgeon would judge much from the nature of the application that produced it - he would not certainly judge so much from that as from the appearances.</p>
               <p>Q. A medical man, I presume, when he sets about a cure, pretty well arranges, in his own mind, the course he intends to adopt; now if a stranger, without consulting with the person who originally made the application, applies something which the person who originally made the application did not, do not you think it would be attended with destructive effects? A. I should like to know the application, certainly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your answer? A. That certainly it would be so sometimes.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. When a particular line is intended to be pursued, a stranger coming in, not knowing the course intended, and adopting a different one, would not that be likely to produce mischief? A. Of course such a circumstance might occur.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Supposing you had seen a wound in the state Mr. Campbell has described it to be on the 12th of October, should you have thought it necessary to resort to the person whose treatment had produced the wound? A. I should not have thought it necessary absolutely; and indeed, in the case I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170072"/>heard described, I doubt whether it could have led to any useful consequence; still I should have got the information if I could, in case it might throw light on the patient's condition - when I say it might be dangerous to deviate from the original plan, I mean the plan of a man of science - I should certainly not think spermacetiointment could have increased the danger; I never saw such an effect produced by any ordinary medical application.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you impute such an effect to the constitution of the patient, unless a dangerous remedy had been used? A. There are some constitutions in which very slight remedies will produce very serious consequences; I have known one person die from the bite of a leach - another from the sting of a bee - that must refer to the state of the constitution; I had no means of knowing any thing of the state of this lady's constitution; from the evidence I have heard in Court I should believe, from the way the inflammation made progress, that it depended more on the nature of the application, than the patient's constitution - it may have depended partly on each.</p>
               <p>Q. When a thing in some instances may be beneficial, and in others injurious, is it not usual to judge of the constitution before you make the application? A. It is; we cannot always form an accurate judgment; but in using a violent potent remedy, we proceed with great caution - I can form no positive opinion whether from the effect produced, the person acted with undue caution, rashness, or ignorance - a liniment of this nature ought to have been used with great caution; the impression on my mind is, that it was not used with sufficient caution, though I do not form a positive opinion; it was used with rashness I should think.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever, in the course of your whole practice,(which I believe is very extensive) know an instance of such inflammation being produced by an external application? A. No, I cannot say I ever did - I have known blisters and other liniments produce mischief greater than was intended, but have not seen such extensive mischief as was produced in this instance; I should think the effect of such an irritating application would be rapid.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased once, about a week before her death, and was present at the examination after death; I observed nothing to lead me to suppose there was any peculiarity of constitution to to account for the violent effect produced - she was apparently very healthy indeed, except where the injury was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I think I can prove if there was any thing poisonous at the time I saw Mrs. Loyd, that effect must have produced death in two or three days - eight days elapsed according to the evidence of Mr. Campbell, before any injury took place; he says there was a discharge of matter, and that the part appeared red - that proved the parts were healthy; if it was not so bright and red, it must be inflamed, and poison must have been applied, but the parts were red and healthy, and that lasted eight days, which goes to prove no injury was done on Tuesday - when I called on Mrs. Loyd, I inquired who did the injury which produced the blisters; I produced no blisters - I know nothing of it; when Captain Loyd called on me; I inquired why she had not come to inhale - he said she was ill; I went to see her, and said, "This is bad practice, who has produced these blisters?" Mrs. Loyd said herself, and Mrs. Campbell confirmed it, and afterwards acknowledged that her son did it, and that she desired her son to attend Mrs. Loyd - it is in evidence before the Coroner, that Mrs. Loyd - consulted Mr. Campbell without consulting me; Mr. Campbell said she should not do so, and Captain Loyd and Mrs. Campbell say nothing about the blisters on Monday, but on Tuesday, after Mr. Campbell commenced his practice, I saw it, and condemned it; these are the words of Mrs. Campbell at the inquest, as to what I said, "You are using a wrong dressing, it should be only old linen to absorb it;" I offered to wipe it, but was prevented - Mrs. Campbell seemed exceedingly angry because I condemned the practice of her son; I called next day, and Miss Loyd told me her mother was so much better and asleep - her son called next day, and said his mamma was so much better, I need not trouble to go to Kensington; we kept up that sort of conversation for a week, and I concluded she was well - when on my trial here before I expected her as a witness; I knew nothing of her illness till Mr. Wontner told me I should soon be in Newgate again - I did not know what for, but it seems it was mentioned among medical gentlemen here, and an inquest was held; about a week after I left here, I sent Mr. Rawlings to see Mrs. Loyd - Captain Loyd would not admit him to the post mortem examination; when the lady was opened, the head was not examined, nor the spine, yet it is in evidence that Mrs. Loyd had head-aches - it will also be proved she had copious expectorations - Mr. Vance says the mouth was corroded by inhaling, if so the whole body must be affected, and the lungs appeared perfectly sound, this is inconsistent - I had nothing to do with it; I knew nothing of the circumstances till Captain Loyd told me; and Mr. Campbell admitted here to-day, that eight days had elapsed before mortification took place; he made no change in the application, which was wrong - a greasy plaister, if discharge was produced, must produce mischief; he should have applied exciting plasters - no medical man will say they ever cured mortification yet with a spermaceti-plaister; there is nothing in it to excite - the evidence will prove as far as my practice goes, that inhaling never produced any injury; it will be proved, by my extensive practice, that a blister was never known to be produced by my applications, or that my means ever produced any injury - some of my patients had my application home with them, and used it. Gentlemen, on these grounds you cannot find fault with me; if you had commenced business yourselves, or any kind of work, and it was taken from you, and got into other hands, and it was afterwards injured or spoiled, do you think you would be answerable? is there any man alive who can say if she had continued under my care, I should not have cured her? my conviction is she would have been alive to-day; and if Mr. Vance could have encouraging hopes of her doing well after mortification, and if he had been called in four days before, when no mortification took place, he must have saved her; it was given in evidence that the skin was not broken, and no evidence can show it was broken for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170073"/>eight days after - if there was any corrosive substance applied on the Tuesday, or at any other time, it must not only have destroyed the skin, but the parts under it, and if a corrosive substance was applied, no discharge could have taken place. It is evident the vitality was not injured - if it was, it must have become as if dead, and mortified at once; if there was corrosive substance applied on the Tuesday, that must have destroyed the parts immediately - the application I make use, of my patients even gargle with, and wash their face and teeth, and no injury occurs; at the last trial Dr. Brodie said there was mortification - Dr. Thompson said, in direct contradiction to him, there was no mortification, "For by mortification," said he, "we mean the coming away of the parts" - now the charge against me is for doing what no man alive can do; if my patient was under my care I would have saved her - she died under the hands of others. Why was I singled out to be prosecuted? why was not I put into the witness-box as well as Mr. Campbell? why is not Mr. Campbell put here instead of me, for allowing mortification to come on? - and Mr. Vance approved of his practice when he did not know what he did; yet he approved of what brought on mortification - I took medical gentlemen to see the case; they were not admitted; why should I be responsible for what was done by Mr. Campbell, who is young and inexperienced? his mother desired him to attend Mrs. Loyd, and if there was any thing wrong in me, why did Mrs. Loyd send for me? Mrs. Campbell forced her son to attend - he says, in evidence, "My mother desired me to attend her;" and he desired I should not attend her; and was it not very natural for him to try to get a patient entirely under his care? When I sent to the house Mrs. Campbell told Mr. Sayer that Mrs. Loyd would be well enough in four days to undertake a journey to Cheltenham - Mrs. McDougal, when she went to enquire, heard Dr. Frankum say that I was making 12,000l. a year, and he could scarcely make any thing; they then told her Mrs. Loyd was likely to die from suffocation, yet the lungs were perfectly sound. Where did it come from? I wish to know these points? I merely point out to you that I had nothing to do with Mrs. Loyd - she came to me and inhaled - she left me, and went under other persons' care; if she died under my hands I should be accountable, but I condemned the practice the moment I saw it - is there a medical man will say mortification can be cured by spermaceti-plaisters? - they have not accounted satisfactorily for what they have done. Now, gentlemen, the argument against me is that I am ignorant and unacquainted with medicine - I am willing to stand any examination; one gentleman is here who conversed with me last night on the nervous system and the human frame - he says, "Well, I am willing to state on oath that you are acquainted with the human frame;" Dr. E - will prove I have dissected; before I began on serious cases, I practised on small cases - the witnesses coming here are the incurables of these very gentlemen; Mr. Vance had a patient who will be here - I have placed into the hip-bone a socket, which Mr. Vance and Mr. Brodie said could not be done; again, I have evidence that I cured mortification, since this prosecution against me - if this verdict is against me there is not a medical gentleman who is not liable; I am not aware that I am doing wrong; but, Mr. Brodie attended Mr. Buller, of Gloucester-place, four or five weeks ago, for a cancer on the lip - the gentleman had had it ten or twelve years; he was in no kind of danger - he consulted, I believe, Mr. Brodie and Mr. Vance; they cut it off, and he died in three days - there was no prosecution there; medical men are not going to be thier own witnesses, though they condemn me to-day - if Captain Loyd was the only witness against me who would condemn me? you might as well condemn Mr. Campbell - he brought on the mortification; but my patients are here, the incurables of the faculty; I have cured consumption, which they acknowledge they never cured - I must understand anatomy; it may be said I only cure particular diseases, which quacks do - I have cured every disease, even derangement - cancers - diseases of the lungs, and the patients consulting me are those who do not get relief from the faculty; you will hear that medicine could do them no good, but they are cured - I say Mr. Campbell's treatment was unskilful, and if Mr. Vance had had the case at the begining, he would have restored her; there was a discharge, which proves health - why should he have checked it? - he should have put a poultice on - in a case like the small-pox, humours are driven to the surface; well then, a bile comes on the wound, that should be drawn off - would any medical man try to heal up an abcess, and drive it in? the spermaceti-plaister checked the discharge, filled the vessels, and the parts mortified, because the matter was not drawn off, and death followed - but here I do not know whether death should have followed, as they say Mrs. Loyd was a healthy subject; but I say she had disease when she consulted me - why did she trouble to come all the way to Harley-street if she was not ill? she knew some of my patients - they were connexions of hers; she had ample opportunities of knowing my practice - I never lost one patient that was not first a failure of the faculty; I challenge the world to produce a single patient, who died under my hands, who was not decided to be incurable by medical men before - I have cured many who I gave no hopes to; I have spent more money in my education than any ten physicians - look at the expences I have been at in Harley-street - and see the machinery there; I have cured by it, and that is all I want - I am charged with not curing a patient who was not under my care; they took her away from me - they prosecute me; and my sentence, as far as I have heard, is, that I should be here again, because I got off the last time - I leave my case in the hands of a British Judge and Jury; how many medical men might be brought here if answerable in this way? who would attend you, gentlemen, if ill to-morrow? I am told I stand here on the same footing as a member of the College of Physicians - I have as much liberty to practice as they have, provided I have done no harm; this is nothing but a persecution against me, because I have discovered a remedy for the cure of consumptions - the prevention of the small pox - the removal of the gout - and of insanity - the prosecution is by the medical gentlemen; and the last prosecution against me was paid by the medical gentlemen - I have practised among you, and do all the good I can; I had no interested motives with Mrs. Loyd - I only received 1l. 10s. from her, and I took her son for nothing; I have many patients that never pay me a farthing - that will do away with my being influenced by mercenary motives; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170074"/>spent a fortune in the search of medicine - I dissected fourteen years ago, and made a discovery, or I did not intead to follow medicine.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to MRS. CAMPBELL? Q. Did you ever say to any body, while your son had the care of Mrs. Loyd, that you had the best means of knowing how she was, as your son attended her, and she would be well enough to be removed to Cheltenham in four days? A. I said to Captain 
               <persName id="t18310217-104-person1086">Sayer</persName>
            , who was in our house, that Mrs. Loyd was better, and we were in hopes she would be able to be removed in four days - I did not say where to; I had no idea of her going; I will not swear I did not say I had the best means of knowing, as my son attended her - I cannot tell when I said this; Captain 
               <persName id="t18310217-104-person1087">Sayer</persName>
             was in our house, and asked me the question - it very likely might be on Wednesday, the 13th, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GRNERAL. Q. Had Captain and Mrs. Loyd come on a visit to you? A. Yes, on the 28th of September - they had only come on a visit for a week.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did your son tell you at any time that he thought Mrs. Loyd would not get over it? A. He told me so very early, perhaps the second day - it was before I spoke to Captain 
               <persName id="t18310217-104-person1088">Sayer</persName>
            ; I did not feel myself justified in giving my son's opinion for any thing - he did not desire me to keep it a secret; I mentioned it to Captain Loyd as soon as my son stated it - that was on the Thursday; I told him my son was fearful she would not get over it.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN LOYD re-examined. When Mr. Campbell first saw the wound he said it was an extraordinary wound, and a very dangerous one, and that he had rarely seen so large a wound - Mrs. Campbell said she thought it looked very dangerous on the Sunday night, after Mrs. Loyd complained of chilliness, and that it was very alarming, because it was generally the forerunner of mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that you did not call in additional assistance earlier? A. Mrs. Loyd's general good health led me to hope she would get over it without additional assistance; and I judged, from the very large practice Mr. Campbell had, he must be clever, and I continued satisfied till the wound remained open so much longer than I expected - what confirmed me in that was the spot, where she originally applied the blister, was getting much smaller.</p>

I was introduced to the prisoner by Barness, on the 13th of December, to purchase counterfeit coin of him - I met him on the 8th of January, at the time I met Wilcox; I had received three shillings from the officer before I met the prisoner, and I had no other money, good or bad; the prisoner sold me three half-crowns for the three shillings which I had received of the officer - I took the half-crowns back to the officer; I marked them, and gave them to Gollocker - I kept the three half-crowns I bought of this prisoner in my left hand, and the three I bought of Wilcox in my right hand; I had no conversation with the prisoner on that occasion, only he said those I had of him were quite as good as those I had of Wilcox.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He never went back with three half-crowns - he had six altogether.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you purchase three half-crowns from one, and three from the other? A. Yes - I had received six shillings, and bought six half-crowns.</p>

I went to the Green Man, on the 8th of January - we there furnished Birt with two three shillings; he was to put three in his left-hand pocket, and three in his right - shortly afterwards the prisoner and Wilcox came up opposite the Sessions'-house, and Birt went out, he dealt with Wilcox first, and then with this prisoner; we saw the money pass, and then Birt returned and told us which he had received from each of them - he marked them, and delivered them to us; he then went out -I went another way, and passed this prisoner and Birt together - the prisoner chinked up a shilling, and said, "They are quite as good as the others;" on the 15th of January, when we went to take Wilcox, this prisoner was standing on the right-hand side of the fire - Gollocker seized him, and took him to the other end of the room; I said, "There is some money gone, be particular in looking," but we could not find any - there was a square of glass broken, and we afterwards found the money had gone out of the window; there were eight half-crowns found in the fire.</p>

             - I was introduced to them then; I had never seen them before - I went out with Cartwright to purchase some counterfeit coin of him; when I went in, Barnes spoke to Perkins, and he nodded to me to stop there - Perkins then came up to me, and said he did not serve himself, but as he had a knowledge of the person who had introduced me, his partner Cartwright should serve me; Perkins, who called himself Green, then produced a bag, which he gave to Cartwright when I was in the passage - Cartwright and I then went on to the corner of the street, under the bar-window; he there asked me what coin I wanted - I said six half-crowns, and he gave them to me out of the bag which had been given him by Perkins, and I gave him 6s. for them, which I had received from Gollocker; the bag contained more money - I saw more half-crowns in it; when I had given Cartwright the 6s., Perkins came up, and said he ran quite risk enough by making them, without selling them to a person he had no knowledge of; Cartwright gave him the 6s. - after this transaction was finished, I went to Gollocker at the Red Lion, in Fleet-street; Myers went with me - he had been standing in Laystall-street, and I believe saw me deal; I could see him at the time - I marked the counterfeit half-crowns at the Red Lion, and gave them to Myers; Cartwright said that if neither he nor Perkins were at the Golden Cans, I might ask the waiter, who would find them - I did not know where they lived.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170078"/>go to the waiter at the Golden Cans? A. No - I am very seldom without business; I have two or three notes in my pocket now - I did not bring them for any purpose; I have known Myers two years or better - he was an officer when I first knew him; he first employed me in jobs of this kind last summer, in the case of McCarthy - I was then in business as a carpenter, and had not much time to spare, but I considered it my public duty to undertake such a job; it was from principle and duty, but I expected to be paid for my loss of time - I do not consider I was paid enough; I believe I got between 4l. and 5l. in McCarthy's case - I was very well satisfied; these cases are the next I have had - I have not looked for any other; I do not know whether I expect as much for each of these cases as I had in McCarthy's - I do not know that it depends on their conviction, or acquittal; I value my time at 4s. 6d. a day - I have got 5s. 6d.; I think the Mint paid me 4s. 6d. a day in McCarthy's case, but I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did Myers see you in the passage? A. Yes, he was standing in the street.</p>

            . I am a tobacconist, and was for ten years a constable. I know Birt, and employed him to assist me in this business - he receives no remuneration but for his loss of time; no bargain is made with him that I know of - on the 17th of November, an appointment was made to meet him and Barnes at the Red Lion, in Poppin's-court, Fleet-street; we met soon after eight o'clock in the evening - I searched Birt, and found nothing on him; he was then furnished with six good shillings - I then went with him and Barnes to the Three Golden Cans, in Laystall-street; we got there a little before nine o'clock - Barnes went into the house first, then Birt, and I took my station at a house opposite; in a short time I saw Birt come out, and stand with his back against the bar-window - he had not been there more than two or three minutes, I should think, when Cartwright came out, and stood immediately opposite him, with one foot on the curb and one off; Perkins then came out, and stood on the right of Cartwright - directly upon that Cartwright took something from his pocket, and put it into Birt's hands; Birt opened his hand and counted it, to give me, I suppose, an opportunity of seeing what it was, and I saw some large pieces of money, as there was a strong gas-lamp over them - the clock was striking nine at the time; the street is narrow, and I was opposite them, at a private house, elevated on a step - Birt then gave Cartwright something, and Perkins held his hand out and took it; he held his hand open, and turned it over, as if looking at it - he then turned round, went into the Golden Cans, and Cartwright followed him; Birt then came across to me, and gave me six half-crowns - that was directly after Cartwright had left him, and gone round the corner into the public-house; Birt gave them to me from the same hand that I saw him receive them in - I never lost sight of him; he had no money about him before, except what I gave him - these are the six half-crowns; I did not take the prisoners then, because we had others to take - the prisoner Cartwright was taken on the 15th of January, and then we went back again; Perkins came in, and was taken - I did not take either of them; I was waiting in Tothill-street, in case they should get away backwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you marked the six shillings? A. No, Sir; Birt was a respectable man; but I searched him, to satisfy the Jury that he had nothing; I can now swear more correctly that he had nothing - I do not know whether it is a licensed public-house or not; I am not in the habit of going to that end of the town- I have known Birt between two and three years; I have been employed by the Mint eight or nine years - I am not paid by the year or the month; I am paid for my loss of time - I sometimes get a crown a day, and sometimes less; I am paid according to the number of days I am employed -I employed Birt on McCarthy's case, but I did not pay him - he is paid by the Mint; I was an officer of Surrey for ten years- I did not belong to Union-hall; I was a parish constable, from year to year - I never was accused of letting a prisoner escape for the sum of 5l.; I am a tobacconist, and live on Newington-causeway - the house is my own, and six or seven others; I work for the Mint because I think it is my duty - I would not lose my time for government without being paid for it; I do not know how much I have received of the Mint in the last twelve months - perhaps 20l. or 30l., and I have been out for weeks and weeks about it; I will swear I have not received 200l. or 300l.; if I had my books here I could tell - I always make a minute of what takes place.</p>

            . I am a constable of Lambeth. Myers asked me to go with them on the 15th of January - I went, and saw Cartwright drop a parcel of base coin into one of the officer's hands, one of them dropped down; one of the party said Perkins (calling him by the name of Green) was in the tap-room - I went in, and asked him if his name was Green; he said I was mistaken, he was not the party- I ran into the passage to get one of the officers, and when I returned he had fled away; I returned, and we took Cartwright - soon afterwards Perkins came in, and was taken; I think he had changed his waistcoat - I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170079"/>nothing of that public-house; it was the first time I had been there - there were a parcel of bad women and bad characters there.</p>

These half-crowns are all bad, and of the same description as the others; this appears like metal, which, in a state of fusion, had fallen through the grate - it is the same metal as the coin is made of - these appear parts of a mould, in which such coin is cast - I can discover on them, with a glass, the faint remains of one or two letters which the coins bear.</p>

             was given into my custody on Friday, the 28th of January - they told me she had offered to pawn a shirt; she said a woman had given it to her; I asked where the woman lived - she said she did not know, she was a stranger in London; that she herself lived in Chiswell-street, Barbican, and then she said in Malcolm-street - she wanted to get away, but I took her to the station; they there asked her how she came by this shirt, and she said she had it from her mother - she took me to the prosecutor's on the following day, and her mother came out; they talked together - I took them both to the office.</p>

               <p>MRS. MONKS re-examined. This shirt was safe on the Tuesday; Margaret had been there between the Tuesday and the Friday, but I did not see her - the room in which this shirt was, joins the room in which Elizabeth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170083"/>Flanagan was at work, but they must go out of doors to go from one to the other; this shirt was dried in the drying-room - it belongs to Mr. Woodward; it has no mark of mine on it - it has D.

            . I am a Police-constable. On the Saturday before the 17th of January, I was on duty in Bunhill-row, at nine o'clock - I saw the prisoner about a quarter-past nine, carrying a quantity of lead in a bag, on his shoulder; I stopped him, and asked what he had there - he said backs of stoves, he was going to Mr. Hunt, at Blackfriars, with them, and he had them from George-street, Spitalfields; I said it was out of his way to be in Bunhill-row - he then said he had been to his mother, who lived in Whitecross-street; I took him to the station - I found the bag contained this sheet lead; on the Monday following I spoke to him again about it, and he said he got it from Mr. Smith's, his landlord, in Whitecross-street - I went there and fitted the lead to the roof of the garret window; it fitted in every part - the edges were quite bright; it appeared to have been recently cut with a sharp knife - I compared the nail marks and the crevices of the lead; it corresponded in every part - there was about half an inch of lead left on, and it seemed to agree with it; altogether there were about 70lbs. of lead.</p>

On the 27th of January the prisoner came in the evening, and asked for a lodging - I refused him; he went away, and in half an hour returned, and begged very hard to have a lodging, saying he had been travelling, and just coming off a journey and it was a hard case a man could not get a lodging - I turned to my wife, and asked if she could make a bed in the club-room; she said she could - I then said, "We will make you as comfortable as we can;" he said, "I shall take up my residence here," and he walked into our little bar-parlour, called for a glass of rum-and-water, smoked his pipe, and made very free - he said he had just come from Staffordshire, that he travelled for government, and had 4l. 10s. a week - he then made use of an oath; I said we did not allow that, we expected he would act as a gentleman - he then threw down some half-and-half, and called for another pint; he dashed that down, and called for another - he then said he would go to bed; I took a candle, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170085"/>showed him into the club-room - I told him I would come and fetch his candle; I went again after a while, he was then in bed, and the sheets were on the bed; I believe it was then between eight and nine o'clock - he said he wanted to lay till nine in the morning, and then to be called - on my daughter's going up stairs to bed she saw a great wet in the passage - she came down; I went up, and saw the water under the door, and I fastened his door by tying it to the balustrades, so that he could not get out - about nine o'clock in the morning, while I was in bed, my door was opened; it closed again, and I heard some one say, "D-n it, I have made a mistake;" in a few minutes the door opened again -I opened one side of the curtain; I saw the prisoner again - he begged pardon, said he had been down stairs, and had made a mistake; he then went down stairs, and said, "Good morning, Mr. Golding, I shall be here again to-night;" he went down, and presently I heard some one come up again; I thought it was the servant coming to see that all was right - I got up, put my trousers and stockings on, went out of my room, which faces the room he slept in, and to my surprise there was the prisoner brushing his coat - I thought he seemed buttoned up very tight; he said he had been down stairs, and had a glass of gin, which had made him all right - I said, "How came you to make such a mess here last night?" he said, "Oh, I have been down, seen the servant, and made all right;" he then bolted out of the house as hard as he could run - my mistress went to the door, and could not see him; she then called up to know if all was right - I looked on his bed, and missed one sheet; they ran out, but he was gone - I got on my things and went out, but I could not find him; I returned, and to my surprise I found the girl had lost her shawl, and a table-cloth was also missing - I got an advertisement put it into the paper, as a cantion to publicans; and in consequence of that I was sent for on the following Friday by Mr. Smith, at the Acorn, the corner of Addle-hill, and found the prisoner had come there - I said, "That is the fellow;" the prisoner said, "Fellow! I will make you prove your words; I am no fellow, and no thief;" I sent for the officer, and he was given in charge - I have never found any of my things.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. I remember the prisoner being at my master's house; he went out just after nine o'clock in the morning - he had no breakfast; he took a glass of gin at the bar - I made the bed over night; it then had a pair of sheets on it - I missed one sheet just after he left the house, and my shawl, which I had left over night in a drawer in the kitchen, which is up stairs - he would have to pass that to get down to the tap-room; he stood at the bar to have his gin - he did not pay for his bed; it was a large size sheet, but he might conceal it about his dress - when he went away his dress seemed very tight indeed; I did not observe his dress over night - I gave 5s. for my shawl; it was a cotton one and a smallsize - the sheet was worth about 6s.; the table-cloth, which was missed, had been in the same drawer with my shawl; that was worth 7s. - I had seen them both safe over night, just before I went to bed; no one had been in the kitchen, to my knowledge, that morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said this witness saw me come out of the kitchen.</p>

I said Yes - he said,"Very likely the publican can lend me a pot:" he then went down stairs, and I thought he was rather long before he went out at the street door - I got up, looked out at the window, and saw him going down the court; the young man who worked with me looked out likewise, and remarked how he waddled - I sat down, worked for about five minutes, and I thought he was gone a long while; he never returned - I went into the room he had been in, and missed my quilt, sheet, and a pair of shoes of

            . I am a broker, and live at No. 1, New Tothill-street.

            . I am an officer. I went with Shaw- his evidence is correct; I found in all three bullets, besides those in the pistols - he asked for my warrant; I said I had no occasion for one - he said, "Well, if you must take me, you must; the fact is, the people have troubled me very much next door, and I did not know what I was doing;" I did not know him before - I have made enquiry, and cannot find that he has been doing any thing lately; but, by a letter found on him, I understand he belongs to a respectable family.</p>
               <p>MRS. GULLIVER re-examined. Nobody was in my house to give him any annoyance; there was nobody in my house but my daughter, (who is thirty years old,) myself, and an old lady; my house was kept very quiet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. I do not know whether he talked to you about witches in your kitchen? -A. No; but I heard him say, before the Magistrate, that he had been troubled very much for four years by witches, noises, and sorcery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have had great noises in my head for the last four years, and my brains used to go round, and heat like streams of fire; and as I passed by the houses in the street, flashes used to come by my head; and, moreover, I think I am allied to the Royal Family - I have received great homage, when I was young, from people in carriages, and I suppose they took me to be an illegitimate son of the Duke of York; but my mother was not the celebrated Mrs. Clarke - when I went to Paris I was under the necessity of changing my name; I received similar homage at Paris, and military homage from the soldiers - I have been given to understand I was a descendant of George Rex, who lived at Combe and Delafield's brewing manufactory; I consider myself entitled to the dukedom of Lancaster - when I was at Hicklow, a lady came, very much like my grandfather; I think she was a child of Queen Caroline, the wife of George the Third - she came into the court-yard, and questioned the ostler about letting me have a horse, which he promised, and when I went into the yard, spurred, &amp;c. he said I must not have it; whether it was in consequence of the saddle I do not know, for my grandfather was a saddler - she went up the stairs of the next house, and from that night I heard the noise; but, the night after that, I saw a great flame, which scorched my body; and ever since that lady talked to me I have had a heat over my head; she was talking to me with others through the wall some time - she said my equipage would be ready soon, and I should go to town, and these Royal personages should be looked after; after that I went to shave myself, and as most people make faces when they save - I had the door open - a gentleman and lady came in, and hurt me tremendously; when I went down to dine there was a chair vacant - I understand it was for Prince Leopold; I dined, but no lady came, nor any equipage - I returned to my chamber, after stopping some time, and they left; I concluded that lady was the cause of the heat in my head, and I have had it ever since.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister. This letter (looking at it) is his hand-writing - I received it from him from Paris; my father and mother are dead -I have received other letters of the same description from him; he has laboured under a delusion about witches and wizards ever since I have corresponded with him.</p>
               <p>The letter being read gave a long and incoherent account of the prisoner's connexion with wizards, and the influence they had over him, and a long history of gipseys, &amp;c.; it bore the Paris post-mark of May, 1829.</p>
               <p>MR. McMURDO. I am surgeon of Newgate. I have endeavoured to ascertain the state of the prisoner's mind since he has been in Newgate, and consider him insane during the whole period he has been here - I have conversed with him on a great many subjects, and on every subject he left that impression on my mind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He knows nothing about it.</p>

            . I was the prisoner's landlord at this time - I have heard him speak about witches; he repeatedly said he was tormented with witches - he told me he fired this shot; that he did it, intending to be taken, that the public might know his troubles concerning these witches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I think it is a complete imposition - the injury I have received is unimaginable; for example, how would a man like to have his head opened.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What means had you of seeing into the room? A.

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner's brother on a charge of housebreaking, and found these articles in possession of another person, who appeared as the prisoner's brother, on Sunday morning, the 30th of January, at No. 20, Great Chart-street, Hoxton, about ten o'clock - the prisoner was not present; I found in the brother's possession nearly three yards of silk, and this cotton cloth - I took the articles to Mr. Rumble's private house in the New-road, and he claimed them; the prisoner was at the house in Fleet-street, and I sent him with a note to Mr. Rumble's private house -I afterwards went to Mr. Rumble myself, returned to Fleet-street, and the prisoner had absconded; I saw him on the Monday morning at Guildhall.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 20, Chart-street, Hoxton, and am the prisoner's brother. Collier took this silk and cotton from my house on Sunday - the silk was brought to me by the prisoner on the Saturday night before; I am a tailor - my brother used to sleep at his master's - I received the cotton cloth from him on the Friday night; I was to use part of the silk for a coat I was making for the prosecutor - the prisoner told me he wished the other to line a coat for himself; I had told him the week before I wanted some shirts, and he told me he had some cotton which would do for them, and gave me the cotton for that purpose - I told Collier what they were brought for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. Twenty-one; I work for the prosecutor, and was in the constant habit of going to his shop - I said in the first instance that my brother gave them to me; the officer said he should take me into custody for having things found on me - I told him immediately he came that my brother gave them to me - I was going to use part of the silk on Mr. Rumble's coat, which he had given me to make - the prosecutor does not swear to the cotton.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mr. Rumble furnish the cloth to make the coat? A. Mr. Rumble did; he sent no silk - I was to find the lining, and charge him with it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was present when Collier searched the prisoner's premises, and found the silk and cotton; it was claimed by Mr. Rumble - I produce the cotton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not several articles found at this man's house, claimed as the prosecutor's, and not included in this indictment? A. I think there were several- they are not included, because they could not swear to them - here is some cotton which was afterwards found in the prisoner's box. at Mr. Rumble's.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did you find the cotton now produced? A. Collier found it - when he gave it to me it was on the brother's shop-board; the cotton I have was found in the prisoner's box, at Mr. Rumble's.</p>
               <p>MR. RUMBLE. I can speak to this silk most positively - it is not silk for coat-linings; it is gros de Naples for ladies' bonnets - I never intended it to line a coat; while the prisoner was in my service it was put into a box, after taking stock some time back, and was not for sale - I am certain it never has been sold; I have the remaining part here, which matches it; the prisoner slept in my house, but unknown to me - I did not know he had a box there; I can almost say to a certainty that the cotton produced by Collier is mine - the selvidge corresponds exactly with other cotton which I have; I have not the least hesitation in speaking to that produced by Jacobs - it corresponds with the rest in my shop; it strongly resembles what I have in my stock - it corresponds exactly in width and quality; I am positive of the silk - it is worth 10s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the box kept in the shop, tumbled about on the shop-board, and open to every body? A. Certainly not; I never knew the prisoner's box was there, and whether that was open to every body I cannot say - my answer applied to the box I had put the property into; the box said to be his was in the kitchen - my foreman lives at the house; I have no servants there - his box was brought up stairs when the officer came, and broken open; the silk is not used for coats - it is an uncommon good one, and what I can swear to; I only had this piece - there were fifty-two yards of it; the rest was all made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170089"/>into bonnets, on my account - I have not sold a yard of it: when I took stock there were eighteen yards left; I have no mark on it, but know it by the quality, and comparing it; there is no mark on the cotton - I do not swear to that, because it is a common article; I have looked over my books - the prisoner is certainly not debited to me in them for three yards and a half of silk; there is no cotton claimed by me and omitted in the indictment - it is all included together; it makes twelve yards together - I have no doubt of its being mine - I took stock about a month ago; other persons could have gone to the box.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You suppose the silk was cut off that piece? A. I think it corresponds in the cutting.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's foreman. On the Saturday preceding the Sunday on which the prisoner was taken, we had an order to execute rather rapidly; we had a black coat to make, among other articles - it was not to be lined with silk; the prisoner cut the coat out, and it is usual for the person cutting it out to fit it up - I ordered no silk to be used; the servants of the house have been allowed articles at cost price, to complete a garment, but then it must be booked; this order was given out on the Saturday night, to be ready on the Monday following- the prisoner was taken on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing he had taken the article on Saturday night, could he, without unusual care and diligence, have placed it to account before Monday morning? A. He had no permission to take any thing without entering it; his brother had the coat away about the afternoon - the box the silk was in was placed on the counter, at the back part of the stop; the prisoner's box was in the kitchen - every body in the concern might go there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there not time on Saturday afternoon before the brother had the coat away, to enter any thing which he took honestly? A. Of course - this silk was not fit to line a coat; it is a very different kind of article; master allows servants articles at cost price, for their own use, but not to dispose of.</p>

            , JUN. I recollect this garment having been given to the prisoner to make up; I remember the prisoner saying he wanted silk to line it - I do not know what silk was taken; he did not tell me he had taken this silk for Mr. Rumble, and to charge it to the account - he inquired for the silk which is generally used for the handfacings; there being none in the house, I told the brother to get some and charge it to Mr. Rumble's account, which I suppose he was going to do - the coat might be given to the prisoner about ten or eleven o'clock on Saturday night - he was sent on Sunday with a note to master, and returned to the shop; I told him I had a charge against him, and was ordered to detain him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a memorandum found on the prisoner of two yards and a half of silk to be charged to Mr. Rumble? A. One was given to me when the prisoner was going to the office; it had been found on the prisoner when he was taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would it require more time to write that in his master's book than on the paper? A. It might not take more time - the prisoner told me on the Saturday before that he was going to have a frock coat for himself, and it would require silk for the facing - that would take the quantity stated here; he had access to the book to make the entry - no cloth was delivered to the prisoner's brother to make a coat for him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was Mr. Rumble's a frock coat or a dress one? A. A dress coat - one-eighth of a yard of silk would be sufficient for it; silk for coat-linings is about 4s. a yard.</p>
               <p>MR. RUMBLE. The coat was only to be faced with silk, not lined; this gros de Naples is worth about 10s. - the prisoner's brother had no access to the premises; Slack, Jun. slept in my house - the order for the coat was given to the prisoner's brother, who came to us in the name of Parker.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Dean, a cheesemonger, of Fore-street. On Saturday morning, the 8th of January, about eight o'clock, I saw five men, with two firkins of butter, in Milton-street - the prisoner Potts was one of them; I thought it was not all right, and gave information to the officer, at the watch-house, which is within one hundred yards of where I saw them - I went with him to point them out, and when I returned I saw the five men in Milton-street, without the butter; I am quite certain Potts is one of those I saw on both occasions - they were still in the street, but the butter was gone; I left the officer, and saw nothing more - I saw Potts at Guildhall, on the Monday following, and am quite sure of his person; he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you on the look-out that morning? A. No; I was merely coming along with two pails of water, for my master - I took great notice of the five men, and am certain Potts was one of them; I left it to the officer to take them - I might know the other four, if I saw them; I cannot say I could swear to them - I am positive of Potts; I never said the wrong person was taken, nor any thing like it, or that any body was a d-d fool - I might have said they might have taken the man who was carrying the firkin, and who I could swear to; Potts was not carrying it - they were all going on together; I was on the other side of the way - I knew the officer by seeing him in the ward; I went away of my own accord - he did not send me.</p>

            . I am constable of Cripplegate-without. I was at my own house; I did not receive information from Hoare - Howard called me down, as the clock was striking eight - I went down and saw Potts in custody, in Honeysuckle-court, Milton-street; Howard said, in his presence, that he was charged with being with four other men, who were carrying two firkins of butter - he said nothing to it; I went, from Howard's information, into Milton-street, and saw four men standing at a distance from the court, by a public-house - I went towards them, and they all four ran off as hard as they could; I ran, and it being a very foggy morning, they turned down different alleys, and I lost them - I immediately came back, and from information, I went to Skinner's lodging, No. 3, Honeysuckle-court; it is a house let out in lodgings - I went up to Skinner's room, on the second floor, knocked at the door, and after some time got admission -I found him there, and told him I wanted some butter, which I understood he had got there; I immediately walked into the room - he said some men had been there who he knew, and had asked him to take care of some butter for them; he did not mention their names - I found the butter, without any tubs, concealed under a great coat, which Skinner himself took off; it was against the wall, within a yard or two of the window - I searched the room, and all I could find of the tubs was two heads, and a few hoops; I could tell they had formed part of a butter tub- the heads were quite wet, as if recently taken off the butter; I took Skinner into custody - the butter was sent to Howard's house, and in the course of the morning, by the ink marks on the heads, I traced the butter to have come from Mr. Titterton's, and gave information there; the butter was in the shape of tubs; as if it had come out of two separate tubs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. They could have been carried by two men? A. Yes - I could walk from the prosecutor's house, which is in Newgate-street, to Honeysuckle-court, in five minutes; nothing was said about the wrong man being taken in my hearing, nor that Potts was not the person who was intended to be taken -Howard accompanied me to Skinner's; he had called me down to assist in securing some of the others - my house is near Skinner's; Howard had got Potts when he called me - the others knew me unfortunately.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Skinner is only a lodger? A. No, the house is let out in furnished tenements - the landlord does not live in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q. Skinner directly took off the coat, and said there was the butter? A. Yes.</p>

On Saturday, the 8th of February, just at eight o'clock, I received information from Heare, and went into Milton-street - I got to the end of Honeysuckle-court, which is in the City, and saw five men; Potts was one of them - having the five men pointed out to me, I passed in right between them; Potts was counting some silver, and said, "D-n it, he has made a mistake, I will go back again." and when I found he meant to go back, I went through Honeysuckle-court, about half-way - he followed after me; I saw him go to a door, and he made a jump up two steps - I retreated back, and called for Noyes' assistance; Potts went into the door of the house where Skinner was afterwards found- I let him go in, and when he came out he made a jump out at the door, and as he came out I collared him (he had had time to go up stairs); the other four men made their escape up Milton-street - I sent Potts to the watchhouse, by another person, (I searched him at the Compter, and found 1l. 5s. on him, which he at first refused to give up); directly after I gave him in charge I went up stairs with Noyes, and found these two firkins of butter at Skinner's - they were not in tubs then; I saw the two heads, and some of the hoops - when we mentioned the butter Skinner uncovered it, and said it was left by four men, whom he knew; they had asked him to let them leave it a few minutes, and they would call again - I borrowed two tubs of Dean's man, and took it to my own place; Skinner said he knew the men, and he was to tell us their names, but he did not - the butter was afterwards claimed by Mr. Titterton, of Newgate-street; the heads of the casks were shown to Salmon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CALRKSON. Q. You have no knowledge of who took the butter to Skinner's? A. No<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170091"/>- Hoare went away, saying he could not stop, after pointing them out; I found 25s. on Potts - I left 3s. with him; the rest was given up to him before the Alderman, as he asked for it for his wife and family - I did not pay attention to Hoare's evidence here; I never heard any thing said about the wrong man being taken, or about a d-d fool - I did not hear him; I might have taken the whole of them - I said I should have liked to take the whole five, if I could.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you know the parish the house is in? A. Because I asked one of the officers this evening - my master brought the butter of a broker; they would cost at that time about 6l.; I swear they cost more than 5l.; I saw the butter safe when the servants were in the shop, and also when they were not; that was between seven and eight o'clock also - there is generally one man in the shop, but I know he was below; I cannot say whether the butter was taken at one time or twice.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the weight of the butter found? A. 136 lbs.</p>
               <p>Pott's Defence. I had not been out of my house above half an hour; I was going to buy spirtis of wine; when the officer took me they were all four standing at the door talking, and I was walking through the court; that man said in the watch-house, "An old fool, he has taken the wrong man;" I did not know what it was for till I was committed - I have a wife and children.</p>
               <p>Skinner's Defence. On Saturday morning, about eight o'clock, two men brought into my room two firkins of butter, and asked me to let them remain there - they took the tubs away, and left the heads; I was dressing when Noyes came and asked if there were not two tubs of butter there; I said Yes, and asked if he had the men in custody - I gave him the names and description, and said he was likely to find them in Golden-lane; he said he would go after them, and on Monday he said he had been, but supposed they had heard of it, and were out of the way.</p>

Shortly before Christmas, 1828, he called on me, and said he would seize our goods - I offered, a little before Christmas, to give up the house on condition that I should have a quarter's rent, in consequence of having new roofed the house - he would not listen to any proposal, but said he would follow me up close when the rent became due; I had my father-in-law and two other lodgers in my house; I carried on business in the general line, but Tubbs opened against me, because I turned my hand to other things; he lived next door but one - I did not propose to give up my house till he abused me, and broke the locks; after he refused to enter into any terms about the house, my father-in-law's goods, and what I could spare, were removed to Greek-street, to his master's, for the purpose of raising money to pay the rent - previous to Christmas-day I took a lodging on the opposite side of the street, because my life was in danger; I shut up the shop occasionally after I took my lodging, and put up two bills to let it for nineteen years - on the 25th of December the quarter's rent was paid on my father's goods; I did not pay any myself - I had not time; he took care to seize the goods; on Monday morning, the 26th of December, the rent was paid, and I came out with the receipt in my pocket, which was written by Mr. Scates' young man - this is it; I received it from Mr. Flint, who paid the money to save our goods - the name of Mr. Scates' young man is down on the receipt, but I did not see him; I got the receipt about eleven o'clock - Tubbs and his wife came to my house, and broke the door open while I was in town; we had left to go to town between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - we had left plenty of goods to pay the rent; we returned in the evening, and our goods had then been all taken away, to the amount of 8l. or 9l. - I am now speaking of the lodging opposite the shop; I missed a blanket from there, but that was not at that time; there were more robberies after that; on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170092"/>23rd of December I employed Scate to get a lodger out of the house, and he entered another room with a false-key and stole these things; he stole the large blanket, bed-furniture and sofa-cover; it was near a fortnight after that, that Tubbs and his wife broke in and got over the wall - I cannot say whether Scate was in every respect connected with them on the 26th of December; no article in this indictment was taken from me on the day after Christmas-day; Tubbs and his wife were on the premises on the day I employed Scate to get my lodger out - Tubbs' wife was at the door on the 23rd, abusing me and raising a mob about the house, and Tubbs was up and down stairs; Scates took the blanket, bed-furniture, and sofa-cover - a man was brought to seize my goods for the water-rate, and they brought a cart to the private door and took them; I did not see Scate take my goods.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often, since this transaction, have you been drinking and carousing with Tubbs, and his wife? A. Never, to my knowledge - they did, unfortunately, coax my husband out of his house; the only day I drank with him was on the day we took him, and then he offered me some money not to come against him - I have never drank with his wife, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have Tubbs and his wife been living in the same street ever since? A. I cannot tell whether Mrs. Tubbs has, but he was found there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Tubbs summon you to the Court, and make you pay 9s.? A. Yes; there were some little items, and my husband paid 9s. into Court, I believe; that was a very short time after we left Portland-town - it did not suit us to take them into custody then; we had not got all our witnesses - we got an assault warrant; it was not dismissed, but we got leave to quit the Court, in order for him to offer us a sum of money - I had them before Mr. Rawlinson, and I have the officer here; I did make a charge of robbery against them then, but, while I was talking to the Magistrate, Scate and my father both tried to get me down; the Magistrate said,"What is the reason she is not allowed to speak;" he said he liked to hear female complaints, but they took me away, and said it was finished; no money was ever given to my father - when I went again his Worship said he would not listen to the complaint; I should have staid before - at that time Tubbs lived in Portland new-town - he is a Policeman of Westminster; I do not know where Mrs. Tubbs lived - they say he lodges down in Westminster.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they continue, for a year and more, in the same house after this transaction? A. I cannot account for that - I took steps to have them apprehended, shortly after they broke in and took the things, which was shortly after quarter-day; I took them before Mr. Rawlinson.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to tell my Lord, that, when these persons were before the Magistrate, you charged them with the robbery? A. I certainly did.</p>

            . I am nephew to the prisoner Scate. On the 23rd of December, 1828, I was on Mr. Fiddes' premises, in Portland new-town - Scate gave me orders to remove three chairs, a deal table, and sundry old furniture - I cannot exactly remember the goods; I do not remember that there was any bedding, sofa-cover, or shovel.</p>
               <p>MRS. FIDDES. Those things were taken about a fortnight after, when Tubbs and his wife broke into the house over the wall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On what day did you lose your blanket? A. On the 23rd, and the bed-furniture and sofa-cover on the same day; and the washing-tub, broom, and other things, about a fortnight afterwards.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is this your hand-writing (handing a paper to the witness)? A. I think it is - I shall not say any thing more than that.</p>

In consequence of something that occured, about two months before January last, I went to Simmonds' house with Hillmore; I cautioned Simmonds, in Hillmore's presence, against buying any thing of Hillmore, as I told him he had no property of his own, and he was in my master's employ; there is an apothecary's shop in Whitecross-street, and I went there on Friday, the 14th of January, about nine o'clock in the evening - I saw Hillmore go by there with this sash; he went on to Simmonds', in <placeName id="t18310217-136-crimeloc815">Playhouse-yard</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Hillmore present when you cautioned Simmonds? A. Yes; I took him with me from our own premises - we were both sober- I had suspicion of a sash that I cautioned him about before, but I could not swear to that; I have sent Hillmore to Mr. Gough on several occasions - Simmonds buys and sells sashes; the sash Hillmore then had he said he bought of Simmonds - that was three weeks before this; nothing more passed at that time; my master is not here - I prosecute for him, and know this property; it came from Mr. Panton's, in Smithfield; I never remember purchasing a pine plank from Mr. Gough, in the Curtain-road - I have bought some hundreds of other things there; I did not accompany Hillmore there about six months ago, and purchase a pine plank to make a frieze of - I do not remember unloading it; I never gave Hillmore money to fetch away goods which I had purchased there - I have often sent him to fetch away goods from there, but never to fetch a pine plank; he never brought me any money back; I never sent him with a farthing - he never brought me any money from Mr. Gough; I remember a great many truck loads of fire-wood coming from a yard in Goswell-street - I sent some of them to my house - undoubtedly Mr. Holgate knew it; I had the selling of it myself - I am only a lodger there; Mr. Holgate knew that I received a truck load -I told him of it, that I swear; I did tell Hillmore at the time not to tell his master, but it was not because I was taking it in an unfair way, but that he was other ways employed - the lady where I lodge may have wood at any time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was that your reason? A. Yes; I was always authorized to send her any quantity, but he was very busy at that time, and I said, "You have no occasion to mention to Mr. Holgate that you took this truck."</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is Mr. Holgate so good as to let your landlady have any wood? A. Yes - she holds the lease, I believe, of his premises; the wood was for her - I never made a fire in the house; the only reason I told Hillmore not to tell his master was because we were very busy, and he wanted the man - the man wished to go with it, as she generally gave him a pint of beer; it was merely that Mr. Holgate should not know that the time of his servant was wasted, that I told him not to mention it - I remember sending Hillmore to Holloway with a load of timber; I did not see what he brought back - I did not tell him to tell his master he had brought nothing back; I did not see him on that day, that I know of; I did not, on any occasion, tell him not to tell his master what he had brought back - it is the first I have heard of it. I know nothing of five paving-stones being left in Rahere-street, Goswell-street-road - I never heard of it. I live in President-street - I know half a dozen people who live in Rahere-street, but I know nothing of that transaction; I was not doing any private job there for myself - I was doing a job for Mr. Holgate at Mr. Anderson's, in Rahere-street - that is two or three months ago; of course Mr. Holgate knew of it - I never told Hillmore, when he went to Mr. Gough's, to tell Gough to charge an extra shilling; he never brought me back a shilling in his life.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Upon what occasion did Mr. Holgate tell you to take wood to your landlady? A. He has given me orders many times to take wood there.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did your employer purchase the business of your landlady? A. Yes, and I believe she holds the lease of the premises.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you been acquainted with Simmonds before this? A. Never before I went to caution him - he was not under my control; he said he was in the habit of buying and selling, and he was not in the habit of noticing every person who came into his shop - he gave me such a dissatisfactory answer, that I went and fetched Hillmore, and said, "Is this the man you sold a sash to?" he said, "I believe it is;" he gave me the right direction of the man he bought this sash of, I believe - he keeps a general shop; I have seen his name up at the shop about nine months; I am not acquainted with him, and he is not in any way acquainted with the prosecutor - there is nothing on the sash by which a stranger could know it was Mr. Holgate's, but I knew it, having had it in my hand two hours before it was stolen.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He never denied the sash all through? A. No, he told me at once what he paid for it - Mr. Stothard was with me; I know Simmonds has lived there some time, and he has a wife and some children - I am sure he said he bought it.</p>

Yes - if I had marked them the marks would remain on them; I have not a large stock - I cannot say when I had seen these seals; I had had the tray of seals out, and cleaned them a few days before, but I cannot say whether they were among them then - I do not think they were missing at that time.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. Between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw the prosecutor and prisoner standing together opposite each other, near the Cumberland's Head, public-house - I saw them separate; the prisoner crossed the road, and joined a party consisting of three women and a man; I waited, saw the prosecutor come by some rails, cross, and take the prisoner - he came about six or seven yards before he crossed; I had seen her join the party, and separate from them - I heard him ask her for his money, and she said, "What money?" I crossed the road, and asked what was the matter; the prosecutor said, "She has robbed me of eight half-crowns," and I took her to the station-house - there was only a pocket-piece found on her; she had not staid with the party more than two or three minutes, when she left them and crossed to meet the prosecutor - she had stood close to the party, and had opportunity of passing the money to those persons if she had been so minded; both she and the prosecutor were sober.</p>

               <p>Jones' Defence. I had the shoes in my hand, which I had picked up in the crowd; I made no resistance - I know the prosecutrix's son was not touched by me, nor any of the mob, that I know of; the officer heard the people say that I picked them up - the word had been mentioned in the Asylum that we would all go to the Admiralty to try to get a ship, and as we came back there was a great loud hallooing; I saw the shoes, and picked them up.</p>
               <p>Ferguson's Defence. I picked up the shoes in the middle of the highway; I was out carrying the flag at the time they were taken - I had not had it five minutes when I was taken; I had a very bad pair of shoes on, and when I took these up I put them on my feet and my old pair in my breast.</p>
               <p>Bond's Defence. On the day before, while I was at the Asylum, a person asked me if I could write; I said Yes - I put down the names of about a dozen who were going to the Admiralty, in the morning, to see if we could get a ship - we went in the morning; they said they could do nothing for us, but told us to go down to Portsmouth or Plymouth; we then came back, and I was taken at Ratcliff-cross.</p>
               <p>Berry's Defence. I was in a public-house close by the docks - a man came, and asked me if I would go to the Admiralty; as they came back there were several persons pulling down things in Ratcliff-highway - when I got to the cross a person said, "Were you not in the mob?" I said, Yes - he said, "If you go to Denmark-street, the Magistrate will do something for you;" I went there, and then Asher said, "I think I can swear to you;" I had not followed them to the Admiralty - my name is not down.</p>
               <p>JOHN ASHER. I followed him from the highway to Ratcliff-cross - I should have taken him in the highway, but I was driven back by the mob; I am quite clear he is the man I saw take the shoes - I followed him till I got assistance, and took him.</p>

In the forenoon of the 19th of January I was in Oxford-street - I saw the two prisoners in company with a third person, and watched them on to the Haymarket, and then back again to Oxford-street - they went up to Mr. Webb's, a cheesemonger's-shop, and staid there ten minutes - I then saw the two prisoners come away; Cant had something under his smock-frock, under his arm; I went up to them with Kennerley - I took Yeowell, and Kennerley took Cant; I took this cheese from under Cant's arm, and took it to Mr. Webb's shop, where it was claimed.</p>

The prisoner had been in our service a week and three days - I had given her warning, and she was about to leave us. On the 4th of February she came to the counter, out of doors, for me to pay her her wages - I thought she appeared much stouter than usual; I told her to go into the kitchen - I went, and asked her what she had in her pocket; she said a couple of dirty caps - I desired to look at them, but instead of dirty caps it turned out to be a bundle of coffee tied up in a piece of rag which she had found about the house - I then made her pull off her pockets, and found in them some more coffee, fancy biscuits, sugar and bread - I told her I would search her, and she ran up stairs into the back bed-room - I called my husband to mind the place, and in a few minutes I followed her up stairs - she was then in the act of throwing some dirty clothes from her, but I cannot say what they were, as there were a great many dirty things about; I found upon her a pillow-case, two napkins, and a flannel - I sent for an officer, and gave her in charge; these are the articles I found on her - this pair of stockings was pulled off her in the room when she was committed: they are all my husband's property - there were other articles on the floor in the room where she was undressing, but I cannot say that she pulled them all off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was not the room quite covered with dirty things? A. No, not quite- it was not our washing-day; we had washed three days before; there were a great many rough dry things about, which had been dried the day before - she had the flannel waistcoat on, with her arms through the sleeves, and the stockings were on her feet; she had a small bundle, but none of my property was there - I found some of her things in the house afterwards, which I gave to her cousin; there was a pair of stockings, and a bundle of things - I saw the officer with her bundle in his hand, but I did not exactly look at it - I was too much confused; I cannot say it was not as large as this bundle.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was my own stockings she brought against me; her stockings were not worth 3d.; I had been out, and got mine wet in the snow - I put that old pair on, left mine there, and when she came against me, she said she could not bring any thing against me but my own stockings - I was not going to leave her; I got up at three o'clock in the morning to wash, and I put that old jacket on to keep me warm - the napkin I had no business with; the pillow-case and napkin were in the room, and she said I had them on me, which I had not - the coffee and other things were under the bed.</p>
               <p>PHOEBE MANDLESON. I carried the coffee and sugar up in my hand which I had taken from her in the kitchen -I spilt some on the bed; she had got biscuits and fancy bread; I had had no quarrel with her; I was going to send her to another place - she did not suit me; it had not snowed that morning; she had been out some days before- she had not been washing that day; I am positive I took the pillow-case from her - I unpinned it from round her person.</p>

            . I met the prisoner in the Strand, at one o'clock in the morning of the 31st of January - he had this coal-sack under his frock; knowing him, I followed him, and took him to the station-house - the sack had nothing in it; I suppose he was half a mile from the Adelphi-wharf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Where was this? A. Near the corner of Adam-street; he appeared as if he had been drinking, but on the way to the station-house he tried to run away, and I was forced to knock him down to take him again.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When you send out a sack you send it with coals in it? A. Yes, and they go in two sacks in general.</p>

            . I am a carman to the prosecutors. I know this is one of their sacks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has it any mark on it? A. No, but I have used it, and know it was one of the set of sacks which was brought out on the Monday, and this was on the Saturday night - this has W. H. on it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was employed to trounce the waggon - the sack was used to carry some other sacks in, and I supposed it was left at the Cock and Bottle; I took it to take it home the next morning - I could not get any money of Hambly, and Mr. Bottomley would not pay me.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. BOTTOMLEY. Q. In whose employ was the prisoner? A. In mine - I pay Hambly, and he pays him; I direct the carmen in the trouncers they employ -- they take them from the wharf, but they are approved of by me; there had been no coals sent to the Cock and Bottle - one or two persons on the wharf give their men the sweepings, but I do not; I give them 1l. 2s. 6d. a week instead of the sweepings.</p>
               <p>COURT to HENRY TRAWARTHEN. Q. Where did you meet the prisoner? A. Near the bottom of the Shades, walking from the Adelphi towards Temple-bar.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about five weeks; he has been in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to me - we had lived together; he gave me eight dollars to get changed, and two he had given me before; I changed them at Mr. Cushway's, at the Royal Sovereign, and took two and 2s. to the Angel, to get half a sovereign for them, and two I took to a pawnbroker's in Ratcliff-highway, but I do not know the name - the prisoner told me he wanted the half-sovereign; I got it, and gave it him on last Friday fortnight.</p>

            . I produce these gloves and handkerchief, and the key of the box, which were found in the prisoner's trunks.</p>
               <p>MR. HOPKINS. These gloves and handkerchief were taken from the prisoner's trunk, up stairs, in the dressing-room; the prisoner said they were mine, but I have no mark on them - these half-crowns have my mark on them, and the half-sovereign had a little mark at the end of the A, which I saw - I did not put any mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the prisoner say, "This handkerchief is mine?" A. No. he said, "It is yours, Sir;" I had not left any sovereign in the desk - the cashier, generally, takes out all the money at eight o'clock; he did so that night, but I was not there - I put the money into the desk, between eleven and twelve; the prisoner might have access to the desk, but he had no business there - he did not say, in my presence, that he had put a sovereign in, and taken the change out - I had a very good character with him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it possible for him to have put a sovereign into the desk? A. I counted all that the desk contained when I marked the money; the sum total was about 2l. 15s., and from that 17s. was abstracted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character.</p>

On the 9th of February I was sitting in our parlour, and was alarmed by my dog, who heard the prisoner in the passage - I got up, opened the door, and the mat was gone; I looked out, and saw the prisoner about four doors off with the mat on his back - I pursued him, brought him back, and sent for a Police-constable - I have seen the prisoner before, but did not know him; our front door is always open, and this mat was between that and the inner door.</p>

On the 21st of January, about five o'clock, I received a half-crown from Griffith - I had received no other that evening; I remarked in a minute or two that it was very had, and put it into a corner of the desk on a book - there was no other half-crown near it; I was particular in keepit by itself - in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Masters came to change a half-crown; I thought it looked like the one I had from Griffith - I called my husband, who went away with her, and in five or ten minutes Collier brought the prisoner in; I gave him the same half-crown as I had from Griffith - I took it off the book where I had put it; I can swear it is the same.</p>

On the 21st of January, at a quarter-past five o'clock, the prisoner was outside my window - I was in my room; he said, "Halloo, mistress;" I went out to him, but in the mean time two other men passed, and he said to them, "Two or three?" they said, "Get three;" they went on, and he stopped, put his hand on a savoy, and asked the price - I said 1 1/2d. - he only asked for one; I served him - he had 3 lbs. of potatoes for 2d., which made 3 1/2d.; he gave me half a crown, which I could not change, and went two doors below, to Mrs. Buckle's - she weighed the half-crown, and it was light - it never went out of my sight; I then went to Drake's, and in consequence of what passed there, she called her husband, and the prisoner was apprehended by Collier, to whom I gave the half-crown, but cut a piece out of it before I parted with it; Griffith said, in his hearing, that he had given him a half-crown - the prisoner said he had not been near his shop.</p>

I said, "The old man's watch;" he said, "I know nothing about it;" I said, "Then I shall take you all into custody;" the prisoner said, "Then, so help me - , if you do you will take the wrong;" a great many angry words passed, saying they would not go - the prisoner then turned to the other man, named Collins; she put her hand on his knee, and said, "Never mind Jem, I will cut this bl-y throat of mine before I will split," and he answered, "Never mind Poll, they shall, or I will, put a rope round this bl-y neck of mine before I will split;" we were obliged to get the assistance of four more constables, before we could get them away - I took them all to the station, and as we were going, I heard the prisoner say to a Mr. Hainsworth, "Never mind, you may say what you like, I know I shall get lagged."</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Pancras. I know a woman who applied for relief, in the name of Mrs. Gornall, two or three months ago - I saw the prisoner with her; she got a warrant against him, and he was taken into custody - she claimed in his presence to be his wife; he said he was very sorry for what had happened - he acknowledged she was his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deny that she was his wife in any way? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Did he never state to you, that there was another William Gornall, a cousin of his, who was a mariner? A. Never, I am quite sure; I saw the prisoner and the woman I called his wife together, in Britannia-street, when I apprehended them - this conversation took place in the street, in going to Hatton-garden Office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did both the wives claim relief from the parish? A. No, the first only.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the priprisoner on the 22nd of January, in St. Giles'; I had information that she had stolen these things about a week before - I took her to where she had lodged, and the occupier of the house said it was the prosecutor's bonnet; the prisoner said she was going to return it - I asked what she had done with the cloak, and she gave me no answer.</p>
               <p>ANN BRADLEY. This is my bonnet - it was a dark brown cloth cloak, for which I gave a guinea; I never permitted her to take and wear my things - she was a stranger; I paid her lodging - I do not know what her trade is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes you know very well I am an unfortunate girl, and have supported you and your child; have you not lent me that shawl you now have on? Witness. Yes, I did one night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She lent me that shawl about six o'clock in the evening, and said she was distressed for clothes - I brought her in some money; she said, "As it is cold take my cloak and bonnet;" I was taken up that night, and had fourteen days in the House of Correction -I was taken by this officer the day I came out.</p>

The prisoner first came to work at our place in September, and she has worked there almost continually ever since - she received her wages between six and seven o'clock on the 15th of January, but she was not discharged; I expected her to return on Monday: this is our carpet - there are four yards of it; it is worth 14s. - I did not permit her to take it away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was not regularly employed by you? A. She was almost - I paid her her wages in the parlour on the Saturday night - I did not see her leave the house; I had seen this carpet in the course of that week -I cannot say what day; we had more of this pattern in the house, and some of it had been sold - I will not say positively when I had seen this piece; I did not miss it till the Tuesday, when I received information.</p>

            . I am a foot-patrol. I apprehended the prisoner on the Windsor road, about seven miles from Uxbridge, about half-past four o'clock, on the 3rd of February - he went into a harness-maker's shop, at Slough, and offered this saddle for sale; he said he would give me the saddle if I would let him go - as we were going back he threw down the saddle, and again said he would give it me to let him go - I took him to the Red Lion, and sent for the officer to take him.</p>
               <p>JAMES BACON. I was sent for by Mr. Church, about half-past five o'clock, to take the prisoner - this is the saddle.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe the prisoner is a very skilful workman? A. Yes - my mother had recently before this received an order from Lord Onslow to execute some figures, to the amount of 110l.; the prisoner had left my mother before that order was executed - the order was given at my house, and in my name; his Lordship did not direct that the prisoner should execute his order - it was not to be executed till the spring; I had a quarrel with my mother some time ago - I went away, but not far off; I did not go to live with the prisoner - I swear that; I have a house of my own in Elms-lane, Bayswater, where I reside - I am not married; I went before the Magistrate when the prisoner was committed - I did not then give charge of him for stealing some legs; I found the cast of a leg in Brujiarty's window, in Russel-street, and stated that to my mother - it was not from me that he received that model; he borrowed some models of me - I did not state to the Magistrate that I was the person who took the cast from the lady's leg, nor did I deny it; the question was not put to me - I did not state to the Magistrate that I and my uncle together took that cast; I did not deliver the leg to Mr. Brujiarty, or, if I did, it was unknown to me; I was not at Madame Vestris' when the model was taken - I have been to May-fair, but not to that lady's house; I sent the prisoner and his father - I was not turned out of the room on account of my youth; the gentleman who came to our shop said, "Don't let that man come, he is too young, send two elderly men;" I do not know that we had been directed not to part with that leg - I cannot swear that I did not lend the model of it to Brujiarty; he borrowed some moulds of legs of me - if this one was lent, it was with other moulds, and I did not know it; my mother took out the warrant for some other property - she reduced the prisoner's wages on account of had behaviour; Lord Onslow gave his order to the prisoner to bring to my house - I cannot tell how often in last year I had been at the prisoner's house; I might have gone several times to fetch him to work - I saw some casts there, but I never saw any of those now in Court; these casts are all mutilated - the prisoner has three or four children, who are in the habit of coming backwards and forwards for money; it is the custom in our business to throw aside mutilated casts in the shop - these are the casts; this one, in its present state, is worth nothing, but we can put a head to it, and then it would be worth 2s. 6d. - my man's time in making it would be worth 6d.; we did not know of these at the time the prisoner got Lord Onslow's order; we have so many about that I cannot tell when I had seen these - I never saw any of these models at the prisoner's house before we took them; I never slept in his house - I had a quarrel with my mother about several affairs, but not about money.</p>
               <p>Q. Now your mother is here, upon your oath was it not about money? A. No, I never was charged with taking any money - I charged the prisoner with stealing casts, not models.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you not been on the prisoner's pre<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170111"/>mises, and seen them there before? A. No, never, my Lord - this charge did not originate in a suspicion that he would get Lord Onslow's order.</p>

I was returning to his premises, and met the prisoner carrying this paper; I followed him about fifty yards, and asked what he had there - he said some paper, and that he was going home; he requested me to take it, but I refused- he came very quietly back with me, and acknowledged that he had taken it from the middle of the warehouse.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On Wednesday, the 2nd of February, I was in Tottenham-place, about ten minutes past eleven o'clock at night; I saw a coach coming to the end of Tottenham-place, and saw the prisoner coming out of Southampton-court, and another man about ten yards in front of him - they were going towards the coach; the prisoner had the articles here produced - I asked what he had there; he made me no answer - I caught him, and pulled him round - the other man, and the coach then disappeared; I again asked the prisoner what he had there - he said pictures, and that the man in front of him had given him 6d. and a glass of gin to carry them to the coach; I took him to the station-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the other man nearer to the coach? A. He was about ten yards in front of the prisoner; neither of them were within sixty yards of the coach - the prisoner was going towards the coach; here is one picture of His Majesty, the rest are frames and this crown and cushion - I found nothing on him suspicious.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe you had considerable difficulty in saying that it was the one you had lost? A. Yes, as it had been so short a time in my possession, I could not conscientiously swear to it; I stated so to the Magistrate in the first place - the officer had been examined then; he then added that he saw the man take it from my pocket, having before said he found it - I said I could not swear to it, and the Magistrate was about to discharge the prisoner; the officer then said there was no occasion to discharge him, for he saw him take it from my pocket - the officer had not been examined first; I know Dowding was sworn - I do not know whether Groom was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were not aware your handkerchief was lost till your attention was called to it; you then missed it, and before the Magistrate you expressed considerable doubt about it? A. No; I said I could tell it by a stain which I recognized, and I pointed out that stain, but I said I would not swear to it.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, Rose-street, Long-acre, and am a constable. A little after seven o'clock in the evening, on the 5th of February, I was in Drury-lane, near Long-acre; I saw the prosecutor walking with a lady, and I saw the prisoner, whom I had not known before, in company with another person - i saw the prisoner touch the gentleman's pocket several times, and at last he put his hand into his right-hand coat pocket, and took out a silk hankderchief; he ran across towards Groom, and I called to him to stop him - the prisoner threw the handkerchief into the road; I took it up, and told the prosecutor he had lost his handkerchief - he identified it as his property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He knew it at once? A. Yes, he had no doubt of its being his property; he identified it both to me, and at the office - he pointed out a stain, and swore he had no doubt of it, but the fact is, the gentleman did not wish to prosecute, as there was so much trouble attending it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, which is the truth - did he swear to it or did he not? A. He did swear to it to the best of my knowledge, and I believe that was taken down; I think I was examined after the prosecutor - I saw the prisoner make two or three attempts at the prosecutor's pocket; I was across the road - I saw him for five minutes; I am an officer - I am serving in my own right this year; I served for five years as a substitute - I am a tailor; it all helps to bring in a crust to support my family - I am both a master and a journeyman tailor; I work as journeyman for Mr. Stringer, in Long-acre; I generally get about 10l. for acting as a subsitute - I had a good many cases here last year, but I only had my expences in one case at one Session.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the evening of the 5th of February I was in Drury-lane; I saw the prisoner, and another person with him, following a lady and this gentleman - Dowding called out "Groom;" and I saw the prisoner running from the lady and gentleman with a handkerchief in his hand - he dropped the handkerchief, and I told Dowding to take it up, and to run after the lady and gentleman; I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you show the gentleman the handkerchief, and did he say it was his? A. Yes, he had no doubt of it; and at the office he said it was one he had borrowed of a friend - I am in no business; I did not see any more persons about the place but the prisoner and his companion; I had known the prisoner before - his clothes had no pockets - I am sure the prosecutor said he had no doubt it wasthe same handkerchief.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM ELSON. I live at Bramshot, near Liphook, in Hampshire. On the 14th of January I had three pony horses and a mare - one of the horses was brown, another a dark brown, and the third a black stallion; the mare was brown - on that day they had been employed in carrying stones on the road, and I put them up about four o'clock at night; I saw them safe in the stable between seven and eight - I got up in the morning between five and six, found the stable door broken, thrown open, and the mare, the black horse, and one of the brown ones were gone; as soon as it got day-light I looked about, and tracked two men on a dung-hill, and off again; I also tracked the feet of three borses behind a cart, up the hill, where they had turned off towards the common, and a cart appeared to have been tied to a hedge - the horses appeared to have been tied behind the cart, and to have hung back when they first started - I followed the track on for ten miles in the London road, towards Godalming; I afterwards came to London, where I saw Pople and Curtis - I missed the horses on a Saturday morning, and came to London on the Thursday following; I went to Union-ball, and saw the officers - they produced the two horses and the mare which I had lost, all three together; I am quite sure they are my horses, and were what I had seen safe in my stable.</p>

            - he is a publican, and keeps the Bee Hive public-house, at Hayes, or Yeading - I know the prisoner; he had slept in our house. On the morning of Saturday, the 15th of January, I went to the door about eleven, or between eleven and twelve o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing at our stable door - he had a black pony, with a long tail, with him; at the same time I saw a person go by in a cart - it was in consequence of what I saw that person do that I looked to the stable door, and saw the prisoner - when the prisoner had put the pony into the stable, he came into my house, with the saddle on his arm - he had something to drink; I believe a small glass of brandy; he then went away, but came again in the course of the day, slept there that night, and came down stairs the next morning while we were at breakfast; I had noticed the man with the cart had another horse tied at the side - my son came home late on that Saturday night; I saw the same pony which I had seen at the stable door, in the possession of the officer in London - I have not the least doubt of its being the same; I know a cottage near the Bee Hive, in which Moffatt, who I had seen in the cart, and a man named Holding, live - they were acquainted with the prisoner; I had seen them altogether often - the prisoner, Moffat, Holding, and two other friends had supped together at our house on that Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you say at the last trial that you had seen these men often together? A. I will not swear that I did - it was in the middle of the day that I saw him with the pony by our stable door; our house stands a little way back from the public road, but it joins it - he could not have got to the stable without going along the public road; I think I had known him three months before: I do not know whether he is in the habit of buying and selling horses - I think I had seen him with a horse once before, but he generally came to Moffat's, and walked from there to our house - we do not keep an ostler; the prisoner gave me no charge to keep it secret - the pony was put into the stable, to which travellers or strangers might have access.</p>

            . JUN. I am the son of Mrs. Kitching. I came home on Saturday night, the 15th of January, between six and seven o'clock - I remember seeing the prisoner next morning up against our door; he had a black pony, with a long tail; he called out to me, "Who is the boy for a ride;" I said, "Yes, if you like" - he helped me on the pony, and told me to take him down to my father's orchard, which I did, and the prisoner followed me; I took the halter off the pony, turned him loose, and the prisoner told me to drive him up amongst my father's horses, which I did - I saw that pony afterwards in the stable by Union-hall; I am sure it was the same pony - I think it was the week afterwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there any white spots about this black pony? A. I did not take notice of that in particular - I did not observe whether there was a large white spot on one of his sides, nor whether the left ear was cropped, or whether he had two white fore-legs; but I know the horse I saw afterwards was the one I rode I did not notice whether he had a white spot on his forehead, but I am sure the horse I saw was the same I rode- it was about fifteen miles from our house to where I saw him again in town; I should have known him any where, but not by any particular mark; he was not a very remarkable horse - I did not say at Union-hall I would not swear to the horse, not to my recollection; I cannot swear I did not - I had seen the prisoner about twice before that day; I knew his name was Charles; he had been at my father's on the Saturday night and the Sunday night.</p>

            , SEN. I keep the Bee Hive, at Hayes. On Saturday morning, the 15th of January, I went to my stable, between seven and eight o'clock; there were no horses in the stable then - they were all at work; I went out on a journey, and returned about four in the afternoon - I went to my stable, and saw a black stallion pony, with a long tail; I afterwards saw the same pony in possession of Pople and Curtis, the officers - I know it was the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took notice of it? A. Yes, I had seen it in my journey - I met the prisoner and Moffatt with a cart; one horse was in the shafts of the cart, one tied to the shafts, and this black pony following behind, either tied or very close to the cart - there was no man in the cart; Moffatt was behind the cart, and the prisoner about twenty yards behind him - I do not know where Liphook is, but I met them on the road between the Uxbridge and the Bath roads, about ten o'clock on the Saturday morning; I did not see them talk together, but they were going in a direction towards Moffatt's house - I am sure there were only two men; I had known the prisoner about two months - he had slept at my house about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170116"/>a week before; I had never seen him buy or sell horses - he had put one up; I did not take particular notice of the left ear of the pony - the whole ear was not off, there might be a bit of it off; it was a white-faced pony - the greater part of his face was white; I did not see that he had white legs - I did not notice the two fore-legs, but it was a stallion - it had a long tail, a white face, and the pony I saw at Union-hall was the same pony; the legs might have been all white for what I know - the tall was not white; the prisoner slept at my house on the Saturday night, and had a cup of tea there on Sunday morning - I saw no secrecy about him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. This was about ten o'clock? A. Yes - I saw the pony in possession of the officer the next day, and knew it to be the same.</p>
               <p>RICHARD POPLE. I am an officer of Union-hall. I heard of the loss of Elson's horses, and in consequence of information, I went down to Hayes, with Curtis, on the 16th of January - we went to a cottage, about one hundred yards from the Bee Hive; I understand that is about forty miles from Lipbook, but I do not know it - when we got to the cottage, Curtis went in first; the door opens into the kitchen, and I saw a bay mare standing before the fireplace - I heard a noise backwards, and ran to the back door; I saw a woman holding her hand out - I saw the prisoner running across the orchard, and Curtis after him; Curtis had a pair of pistols. and I heard him threaten to shoot the prisoner if he did not stop - the prisoner had got over a gate and a ditch into the road; I returned to the kitchen - the mare was still there; I looked and saw some hair about, and I saw the mare had been cropped in the fetlocks - I then went to the stable belonging to the house, and found the two stallions; the prisoner, the two stallions, and the mare, were all brought to London - they all had long tails; Mr. Elson saw them, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see nobody else at the cottage, but the woman and the prisoner? A. I saw no other person in the cottage - I saw a man outside the door; I did not speak to him - I will swear I did not say to him."Did not I see you somewhere before?" I do not recollect that Curtis spoke to him - he might, and I not hear it; I was not asked on the last trial any thing about seeing the mare outside - he was about twenty yards from the road; he was perhaps ten or twenty yards from the cottage - I think he was coming from it; I did not see him come out of it - I really do not recollect seeing Curtis at the moment I saw that man; he might be engaged in the stable - he did not speak to the man in my presence; I saw a chaise on the premises - I did not ask that man whose it was, but I think I asked the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall. I went with Pople to Hayes on the 16th of January - we went to a cottage in the neighbourhood of the Bee Hive; I went in first - I saw a mare in the room; I saw a woman in a passage leading to another room, wave her hand, as if to some person in the back part of the house - I ran to the back door, and saw the prisoner crossing an orchard; he went through a hedge, and then over a gate, into the road- I called to him. presented a pistol, and said I would shoot him if he did not stop; I took him back to the kitchen, and saw a trifle of hair had been clipped off from the fetlock joint of the mare - we then went to the stable, where I saw two ponies; one was brown, and the other black, with a streak of white down the face - we took them and the mare to London, showed them to Elson on the Thursday following, and he identified them as his property; Mrs. Kitching saw the black pony, and said she believed it was the one she had seen at the stable. and Mr. Kitching said it was the same; when we got to the Adam and Eve, about a quarter of a mile from the Bee Hive, where my horse and chaise was, the prisoner said he did not live at the cottage; I asked where he did live - he said he lodged at the Bee Hive; I asked him when - he said,"The whole of last week"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any man at the cottage, or near the cottage, where you saw the woman? A. yes, there were persons in the road - I saw a man, and spoke to him, but did not ask him any question; I saw a chaise in the yard belonging to the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you believed this man stole the pony? A. No, I believe he was in league with others -I never did say I believed he stole the pony individually.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever swear it? now be careful, for your own sake, A. No, I never was asked the question; I never said that at the time the pony was stolen he was passing through the turnpike-gate, in a direction from the place where it was stolen from; I said three men were seen, I did not say he was one of them - it was before the prisoner was tried for stealing them, that I said I could prove three men passed through the turnpike-gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say this, or any thing like it, that you could bring evidence to prove that the prisoner was seen coming from the road leading from Liphook towards the Bee Hive? A. I have said that witnesses could prove that three men were seen - I do not know the prisoner was one; I never said I could have witnesses to prove that the prisoner was seen on the road - I said three men were seen at a village below.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not upon your swearing at Union-ball that you believed the prisoner stole the horses, that he was remanded? A. No, he was remanded on the charge of having committed divers felonies and horse-stealing, in the County of Hants.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you afterwards show the prosecutor the horses? A. Yes, and he identified them.</p>

               <p>JOHN SHANNON. I came from Limerick, in lreland, and work for the Corporation of the Trinity-house. - I have known the prisoner almost ever since he was born.

            , that is making a row, and using my wife so?" he made no answer; he stooped down, as I thought, for a stone, and cut me either with a knife or razor between the calf of my leg and my ancle, at the back of my leg; I might have touched him, but never struck him, nor did I go towards him in a menacing manner, nor had I touched him roughly - I had not touched him before I was cut; we never had any words since we were born - I know of no ill-will on his part towards me; when I found I was cut I went home, and was carried from there to the doctor's - I was afterwards carried to the London-hospital, and have been brought from there this morning; I am still lame - I cannot stand on my leg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to say you went home immediately you were cut? A. I do - I never struck the prisoner at all; he did not call Murder! I saw nobody come to his assistance - I saw him laying down on the ground, about ten minutes after he struck me; I had come out, and gone along the wall to give him in charge - he might have called for assistance before I came up; I was not on the top of him - I was tried at Hick's-hall about nine years ago for a common assault; I saw Maloney in the street - he and Flannigan took me to the doctor's; they did not rescue the prisoner from me - I was not on him, nor beating him; Flannigan was three or four perches off when this occurred.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE SHANNON. I am the prosecutor's wife. He came home on this Saturday night - he was not in liquor; he sent me out for some supper, and when I got down I and a young Irish woman, named Mrs. Angledon, an acquaintance of the prisoner's, had some words within three or four doors of my house; she made an offer to hit me, and when she made that offer she fell - I did not strike at her; the prisoner then came up to me, hit me in the breast, and while I was down that woman's husband came and gave me a kick - I hallooed out Murder! I had not seen that woman for some weeks before; when they heat me and I fell, my cloak went over my face, and I did not see what happened to my husband, nor hear him say any thing - when I got up I went up stairs to my children, who were crying; whether my husband was hurt then I cannot tell - I heard no noise in the street; my boy came up in about five minutes, and said his father had been hurt - when I came down stairs the second time my husband was taken to Dr. Benson's; I went there, and he was taken to the London-hospital the same night by Maloney and John Flannigan, in a truck.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you up stairs before you came down? A. About ten minutes - I did not see the prisoner then, I saw my husband; I had had part of two pints of beer between me, my husband, and another man and his wife, at the Dolphin, about nine o'clock - I was not at the Rose and Crown; my children were in bed, except the infant which I had in my arms - my husband had no row that night, to my knowledge; he came straight from the pay-table - I swear I heard of no row between him and a man named Russel, outside the Rose and Crown; I went to the Dolphin with him about eight o'clock - we staid there an hour or an hour and a half; no spirits were drank - I never struck Mrs. Angledon, nor touched her; I never saw my husband outside the Rose and Crown that night - I know he had been there, for he is paid there.</p>

            , that has struck my wife?" and with that the prisoner stooped down and cut Shannon Shannon had been in the street three or four minutes before the prisoner came up; I did not see Mrs. Shannon - Shannon was only going on home; we were walking down the street - we had walked four or five perches; he had told me if he met the prisoner he would give him in charge - I was examined at the office; what I said was read over to me before I signed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say there "I found the prisoner and a man named Shannon struggling together, and I went to Shannon's assistance?" A. Yes, they were struggling; when they met he went and took him, and they had a struggle - I had been walking with Shannon for three or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170118"/>four minutes before; they did not meet together for two or three minutes; I saw a clasp-knife in the prisoner's hands when he came up - it was open; he was coming up against Shannon - whether they had been together before I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Shannon struggling with any body when you first saw him? A. Not when I met him, but when Barrett met him they were struggling together for about a minute, holding one another; Shannon had hold of the prisoner somewhere about his breast, and the prisoner held him somewhere about his waistband, but where I cannot say - Shannon thought to lay hold of him to keep him for the Police - the prisoner struggled away and cut him; they struggled about a minute before he cut him - I took the prosecutor home; Maloney took him to the doctor's, and I went back to give charge of Barrett - he ran away after cutting the prosecutor; I ran after him, tried to take him, and he cut me - I upset him; I told the Magistrate Maloney helped to take him home and to the doctor's; I do not know whether that was taken down - I had had no words with the prisoner; I had not been to his father's that night to challenge him to fight a boy named Russell - I know Russell; he had not quarrelled with the prisoner at the Rose and Crown that night in my presence; I had been at his father's that night, but did not say the prisoner should fight Russell for a sovereign, and if Russell did not beat him I would beat him well - I went there with the Police to give him in charge; I did not go before - I never said any thing of the kind; I had been drinking at the Rose and Crown that night - it is our house of call; I was there three of four hours - Barrett was there part of the time; I do not know whether Russell was there, but it is our house of call - he left about half-past nine; I cannot tell whether Shannon went with me - I was sober; he was not in my company, but might be in the room - we work in a different craft; he might leave sooner or later - I was not there when the Police were called in; I never heard of it; I was not at the Dolphin.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean to say you saw the knife in his hand when first you saw him coming towards Shannon? A. Yes, and it was open; he had a small bit of bread in his hand, as I understand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not what you said to the Magistrate "I wanted to part them both asunder, Shannon called out that his leg was cut, I turned over to the prisoner to lay hold of him, and with that I saw a knife in his hand?" A. Yes; directly he came up I saw it in his hand - I only saw one knife in his hand that night; he came back with the very knife I saw in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say with another knife? A. Yes, the Police have got that; I saw but one knife - I know where the prisoner's father lives, but do not know the name of the court; he was coming from his own home when he met Shannon; I did not see Mrs. Shannon in the street - it was about half-past ten o'clock, as far as I understand.</p>

            . It was nearly twelve o'clock when my husband was cut - I think it was before twelve, because the shops were open; he had been up stairs for above an hour or more before this happened - the shops are shut at near twelve o'clock; my husband went home a little after ten - he sent me out in about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHANNON. This happened between eleven and twelve o'clock, as near as I can say, but I cannot say exactly, for we have no clock - I cannot say whether it was before twelve.</p>
               <p>JOHN FLANNIGAN. The prisoner was apprehended about twelve or one o'clock - I went to his father's house with the Police; it was about an hour after this happened, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>SARAH LOW re-examined. I saw the prisoner sharpen a knife between twelve and one o'clock - I was three quarters of an hour at my window, and it struck one soon after I shut it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Your deposition states that soon after you opened your window the clock struck one? A. That is a mistake - I gave my evidence that it was between twelve and one o'clock; I saw him sharpen a knife on the step of a door; my deposition was not read over to me - I said that between twelve and one o'clock I heard a disturbance, and opened my window; I cannot tell who made the disturbance - the prisoner was one of them; I saw him with his father and mother - two Policemen were trying to take him home; he went home with them to his father's, and came out again five minutes after the Policemen left - he came up the alley, and I saw him sharpen the knife on a step three doors off; it was a moon-light - I was up two pairs of stairs, and cannot say whether he was in liquor - he went up the alley, on the green bank, and I heard a cry of Murder! three times; I believe the green bank is where Shannon was struck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What office did you give your deposition at? A. The Thames Police; the Magistrate was present, but I signed it in a little room - the clerk was there; he did not read it over to me - I was sworn.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you heard the clock strike twelve? A. Yes - I was then folding up some work, and was about five minutes before I went to my bed-room, and in ten or fifteen minutes after I went up, I heard the noise, and opened the window; I was making my bed.</p>

            . I am a Police-serjeant. Our watch-house is on the green bank - Shannon was brought there between twelve and one o'clock, (nearer one,) by Flannigan, his wife, and two or three more; he was wounded then - I had seen the prisoner about twelve, and endeavoured with his father and mother to prevail on him to go home; Robson, another Policeman, was with me - I took him part of the way down the court, and sent the other Policeman home with him; whether he went out afterwards I do not know - he was not drunk, but rather the worse for liquor; Robson had taken a clasp-knife from him; when Shannon was brought in he was cut just below the calf of the left leg; Shannon's house looks on to the green bank - I went and took the prisoner in charge about one o'clock, or near one, and took a table-knife out of his hand - I did not perceive any marks of blood on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you take him? A. On the first floor of his father's house - he had some bread<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170119"/>in one hand, and the knife in the other; the knife might be in his hand for the purpose of eating his supper.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. About a quarter-past twelve o'clock in the morning of the 30th of January, I saw the prisoner, and persuaded him to go home - his mother was there, and his father might be there, but I did not see him; he had no knife in his hand then - he was a little in liquor, but not drunk; I saw him home, and about a quarter of an hour afterwards I saw him going along about half double, into a green-grocer's shop; I could not conceive what made him go in that way - I had no reason to suppose any mischief had been done to Shannon before I saw him home the first time; when I saw him going into the green-grocer's, the landlord shoved him out of the shop - as he came up he held the knife up to me, and said, "This is the knife," holding it out to me - it was a pocket-knife; I took it out of his hand - I did not see any blood on it; I put it into my pocket, and said, "Come away home;" he used a vulgar expression, and said, "The b - r was going to murder me, but I have murdered him;" I took him about half-way home again, and in about ten minutes three of my brother officers came up with Flannigan- I took them to the prisoner's house, and took him; I cannot tell at what time Shannon received his injury - the prisoner was apprehended about five minutes past one o'clock.</p>
               <p>JOHN FLANNIGAN. I went to apprehend the prisoner about an hour after the transaction, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

            . I am a student at the London-hospital. I saw Shannon on the Sunday, and found a wound on the back part of his leg; there is every reason to expect he will have the use of his leg again, and that he will not be disabled, except by lameness, for a short time; it is not a serious wound, nor in a dangerous part at all, even if it had extended farther than it did - it was about half an inch deep, and near an inch and a half long.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I should think that it must be a quarter or twenty minutes before one o'clock when Shannon met with this accident - I sent a party of men to disperse a party who were kicking up a row, soon after twelve; I was not present when Shannon was wounded - I saw Barrett come out of Anchor and Hope-alley, swearing murder, but what he meant I do not know; Shannon was brought to the station rather before one - I sent him to the doctor's instantly; I cannot say how long before he had been wounded; I had seen the prisoner twenty minutes or half an hour before that; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before Shannon was brought in, I saw the prisoner coming out of the passage where he lives, with a knife in his hand - he appeared in a passion, and used the word Murder! with an oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the row you saw at the Rose and Crown? A. Very near to it; there were ten or fifteen persons there the first time I saw them - that was twenty minutes or half an hour before Shannon was brought in.</p>

             re-examined. As soon as Shannon met with the injury, he was taken home, and in about ten minutes I took him to the station - he was not taken to the doctor's first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My father sent me out for half a gallon of beer for supper; a gentleman gave me a shilling to get it - I had a piece of bread and meat in my hand; I met Shannon, Flannigan, and a man named Wilkes at the top of the alley - they said, "Here comes the b - r," and ran after me; I ran along - I came back, and caught hold of a post; they caught hold of me; I got away - they caught me, put me against a door, and threw me down; Flannigan jumped on me, also Shannon and Wilkes - I called Murder! they tried to choke me; I still called Murder! Cotter came - my belly was burst I thought; Maloney came, and after Cotter opened his door, I crept into his house on my hands and face - I got just by the door; Flannigan and Shannon pulled me out by the legs, with my face and hands on the ground, into the middle of the road.</p>

On the night in question I heard a row in the street; I heard the prisoner call out to me for protection before I saw him - I went as far as the door, and saw him; Flannigan came up, caught hold of him by the throat, and threw him down right facing my door; he made an attempt to get up, and Flannigan kicked him on the hip - I went and caught hold of Flannigan; another man came up named Quirk (I think) and made an attempt to kick him, but whether he hit or missed I do not know, and the third man who came up was Shannon; he laid over him, and I having hold of Flannigan, my hat fell off; a man named Maloney, who had been in my shop, came over to me, and lifted Shannon off the prisoner - what the prisoner might have done to Shannon I cannot tell - I said, "Barrett, come into my house;" he said, "My belly is broken, I cannot go" - this was between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

            . On the night this happened I was just outside Cutter's door - Barrett ran up the footpath along the street as hard as he could, and asked Cotter to let him search his place; a man named Flannigan came up, and caught him by the collar; he jostled him down, made a hit at him when he was down, and I believe a kick too - Quirk came up, and made a kick at him while he was down; Shannon came up in a little time; I saved the prisoner as well as I could - I turned back on Shannon, and stopped him from meddling with him; I afterwards found Shannon had received a hurt on his leg - there was no appearance of his being wounded when I first saw him - I assisted in taking him to the doctor's about half an hour after.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you help to take Shannon home? A. I took him on my back from the watch-house to the doctor's - I have no reason to suppose he was hurt till after he followed the prisoner to Cotter's; he was about three perches behind the others - I did not notice that he was lame.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have noticed if he was lame at that time? A. I dare say I might - he could hardly walk when at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many times were you before the Justice on this business? A. Three times - Ellis was present on the first occasion; I did not state then that I did not know Ellis - I was asked three times, once by a person near, whether I could identify both the prisoners; I said only the tall one - the person said, "I think you can, look at them again;" I said; "No, only the tall one;" it was my master's clerk who said this - I did not hesitate at identifying Ellis.</p>

I had been to Gast's house, and went into his bedroom with him, to clean himself, and saw a clock standing on the drawers, on Saturday, the 5th of February - Ellis was at that time in custody on other charges; I said nothing to Gast at this time about the clock - I went with Goddard to Tottenham-court-road, leaving Schofield in care of Gast: when we returned he was in the parlour - he <rs id="t18310217-210-deflabel1241" type="occupation">keeps a muffin shop</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any body present when you had the conversation with Ellis about the clock? A. No - Schofield was down stairs; I saw Gast's wife - he keeps the muffin-shop; it is a small shop, but does a very great business.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Gast's house, after Ellis was taken, with Ballard and Goddard - I went into the first floor room on the left-hand; it is a bed-room - I saw the clock; I did not see Gast in that room - when Gast was in custody (after Ballard had left the house) he came to me in a side room, where I was waiting to prevent his going out; I then said it was a bad job, he having so respectable a business - I named several things which had been removed from his bed-room by Goddard; I named the clock slightly, but we had not removed that - he merely stated that he knew nothing that was brought into the house, it was all his wife's friends, and his wife's sister had brought the property in; I had not particularly noticed the clock to him then, as I then believed it was his own - after the examination I saw him in the passage of the office, and asked how he accounted for the clock being in his bed-room; I made no threat or promise to him at any time - there was only one clock there; he said that was his wife's, and that she had it before he married her.</p>

            . I am a hatter, and live in Tottenham-court-road. I was at the office when Moore was examined at Marlborough-street - I attended all the three examinations; I heard her at the first examination asked if she could identify Ellis - she could not; she said so - she was asked by the Magistrate if she could identify any of the prisoners; Ellis was in front of the bar - she looked at them, and had full time to do so; she said she could not identify any of the prisoners - all she know was, that one of the men who came to the house was a dark man, a very dark man; Ellis did not try to screen himself from view, far from it - I was at the second examination; she identified him then - the first examination was on Tuesday; I rather think about the 8th - the second was on Thursday or Friday; she identified him then - he was dressed precisely the same as before; I am a house-keeper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been acquainted with Ellis? A. I was not acquainted with him further than his living at his father-in-law's; I have seen him pass and repass my house, that is all - I went there on Gast's account: a friend of Gast's called on me on Tuesday morning, and I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear Gast was under examination on the 8th? A. Gast was among the prisoners at the bar then; I heard this brought forward about the clock, and attended the next examination; the examination on the 8th was about the clock - on Tuesday Mr. Lane came forward, he said he had lost a clock, and the servant identified it: she swore particularly to Ellis at the second examination, which she did not do on the first - I thought it something peculiar; the second examination was in the Magistrate's private room; I was sitting behind Mr. Harmer, the solicitor, and he was astonished to hear her turn round and say, "That is the man that came to the door, and asked me if Mr. Lane was at home;" Hr. Harmer immediately stood up, and said to Mr. Conant, "That woman before denied knowing any of the prisoners," and she said she did not - I said to Mr. Harmer, "Why, I was present, the Court was cleared for her to look at the prisoners, and she went forward to them and said, 'I cannot identify any of the prisoners, all I know is one was a very dark man.'"</p>

               <p>Q. Then she never mentioned a tall man? A. She did not - I am quite sure she never described the man as a tall man at the first examination; she did at the second, and swore positively to Ellis - she said positively at the first examination that she could not identify either of the men; there were fourteen persons at the bar then, and there were two short men who appeared to creep behind the rest, that they might not be observed; but Ellis and Gast remained in front - I have not heard what she has said here; I was not subpoenaed here - I am a hatter: I came at the request of Gast's and Ellis' friends - I told Mr. Harmer I had heard her say that she could not identify either of the prisoners, and he said he hoped I would attend at the Old Bailey; he was by at the time she said this.</p>

             re-examined. I was at the office three times; Ellis was there the first time - that was on Monday, the 7th: I saw him again on Tuesday - on the first examination I was asked to stand on the steps to see them closely; I said I could only see the tall man, and could identify no other but the tall man (the prisoner Ellis) -I was not asked by the Magistrate the first day (Monday), if I could identify them; I saw them again on the second examination (Tuesday) - I said I knew Ellis was the man I let in; I did not express a doubt about him - what I said was not taken down the first day, it was on the second; I am quite sure I spoke positively to him, and at the second examination again I said, "That is the man" - Ellis was present, and saw me.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the bar cleared that you might attend to the prisoners? A. It was not cleared, to my knowledge; I went to look at the prisoners - I was asked by one of the officers; the Magistrate did not ask me - Mr. Harmer said I had not identified him at the first examination, but it was very wrong.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Harmer say something to this effect,"That woman could not, on the first examination, identify the man, and now she has done it?" A. To my knowledge he did not say those words - he said something of the kind, and I contradicted him at the time; I swear that I did identify him on the first occasion - the reason I was asked about him at the second examination was, because I was not asked by any Magistrate on the first day - the Magistrate was sitting, but, I believe, at the time there was something else going on - they were talking about other things; I do no not think the Magistrate could hear it - it was not loud enough for him to hear; the prisoners were before him at the time, but they were talking about other things which were stolen, such as medicine-chests - it was Ballard who asked if I could identify the prisoners - I do not remember Plank asking me; I believe master's clerk asked me first - he asked me three different times over; he said, "There is a short man getting behind, was it not him?" I could identify no one but the tall one - he did not ask me three times to identify the tall one; I identified him at once - I remember where Mr. Harmer stood at the first examination, and my cold was so bad he could not hear me; I am sure I contradicted Mr. Harmer when he said I could not identify him at the first examination - I did it openly - I had seen none of them before, to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170122"/>knowledge; the man had a coloured handkerchief on - a dark looking one; it was not white - he had a common coat on; I might have seen him for about ten minutes - he took his hat off in the office.</p>

            . I was formerly in business as a shoe-maker, in Tottenham-court-road - I now live in St. John-street, Clerkenwell, and am out of business. I was examined yesterday to Gast's character - I was not at Marlborough-street on the Monday, but on the Tuesday, and heard Moore asked if she could identify any of the prisoners - the prosecutor's clerk brought the clock up to my righthand, and he was requested to take Moore into the passage that she might see the prisoners brought in, to identify them - they stood at my right-hand, and the answer made was, "No, they warnt them," at the time she went out to see the prisoners walk, I believe Ellis was one - I saw him at the bar; the girl returned and said, "They arn't them that I have seen;" it was then said, "We will have the place cleared; they shall be put to the front, and then you shall go and look;" it was cleared, and the prisoners put to the bar - Ellis and Gast were quite in front, and several women behind; the men were all in front; I think there were five, if not six men - there was nothing to screen Ellis: the officer cleared all the front; she walked up, then walked back, and said, "No, they are not the men;" this was on Tuesday; I was there again on the Friday, at the second examination, when she was asked if she could identify either of them, and she identified the tall one (Ellis) - Mr. Harmer told her she had before said they were not the party; he said so openly - the Magistrate then wanted to mend the evidence, and Mr. Harmer said he had no right so to do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did the girl say to the observation of Mr. Harmer? A. She said she might be mistaken; she did not say she had not mistaken the man, and had said he was the man - she said she might be mistaken; she said three times at the first examination they were not the men, and the clerk stood at her side.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How did you happen to go to the examination? A. Having heard of the circumstance, and Gast being a friend who I highly respected, I went to the examination, as I was going to dine that day in Westbourn-place - I dropped in to render him assistance if he wanted it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. On your oath, did not the girl, when Mr. Harmer suggested she had not spoken to the man, say that was not true for she had identified him? A. She said, "I might be mistaken" - I positively swear she did not say she had spoken to him - she did not contradict Mr. Harmer- Mr. Harmer rose up, and spoke to her, but I did not hear what she said, more than that she might be mistaken; I will not swear she did not say she had spoken to him, I am sure what I describe took place on Tuesday - I was only there Tuesday and Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Magistrate put the question to her "Did you speak to the man positively the first time?" A. I do not know that I heard a word of that - I was on a chair; the officer said I should break it, and at that moment I got down.</p>

            . I am solicitor for Gast. I attended at Marlborough-street on two occasions - I do not know when it was; I have only come into Court this moment- I was there at what I understood to be the first examination; Moore was taken by the officer in front of the bar, near to where the prisoner stood - she gave a description as to one being a tall young man; she was asked if she could identify either of the prisoners at the bar - she then came close to the Magistrate's table, and gave a short description of the way the clock was stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she able, on being shewn the prisoners, personally, to identify any of them? A. Certainly not - Ellis was at the bar and brought prominently forward; I have heard part of the last witness's examination - I was at the second examination; Moore was examined, but I saw her deposition had been previously reduced to writing - it was put into my hands to read, and seeing it stated her to have identified the prisoner (she had not been sworn to the depositions, and I was surprised to find it reduced to writing - Ballard was giving his testimony as to something Gast had said;) on finding this statement in the deposition, I cannot exactly recollect what I said, but I expressed my astonishment that she should have sworn to the prisoner after she had been shewn him at the bar previously, and could not; Ballard gave an explanation how it occurred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she contradict you flatly at the time, and say she had identified him on the former occasion? A. She said she had spoken to him on a former occasion, but did not say it was in the office; it was after the prisoners had been removed from the office by the officers on their way to the lock-up room, she again had an opportunity of seeing them, and spoke to him - I only heard this from the officers themselves.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the girl in your presence ever say she could not identify the prisoner at the bar? A. Certainly - she said she could not speak to any of the prisoners at the bar, at her first examination.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At that time Ellis was standing in a prominent situation? A. Yes, and I believe the place was cleared for her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you told the Magistrate she could not identify him on a former occasion, did she contradict you and say she had? A. What passed was from the officer, and not from her - I think the Magistrate was not present when I made the remark; she admitted that she had not spoken to him in the Justice room, but the officer in her presence said, "When we were going out of the office she had a better opportunity, and pointed him out;" this passed at the second examination - the examination was not going on before the Magistrate when I observed to her that she had not spoken to him; I had seen her deposition reduced to writing.</p>
               <p>MR. LANE re-examined. When Mr. Harmer observed that Moore had not identified Ellis, Moore, in the most vicious manner, denied the assertion of Mr. Harmer - it is no doubt a mistake of Mr. Harmer's, that he made the observation certainly is true, and she in a quick, galarious way, denied it; I was obliged to say, "Matilda, don't speak so quick."</p>

            . On Thursday, the 27th of January, at six o'clock in the evening, I saw this cloth safe in our front shop window, which does not open - I missed it about half-past seven; I am certain it was not sold - it was for garments; we seldom sell cloth - it was Shepherd's plaid for making trousers; there were twenty-three yards in one piece, and nine and three-quarters in another - I saw, at Marlborough-street last Friday, thirteen or fourteen yards of one piece, and the other of nine and three-quarters - one piece has a mark where I had cut out a pattern; I found that mark on it precisely the same, and was confident of it being the same cloth - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You have only one partner? A. Only one; I employ nobody in the front shop, but have three apprentices in the workshop - the apprentices and workmen pass through the shop; they leave at eight o'clock - I had gone out about half-past six, and left my people in care of the place; when I came home I found a pane of glass broken or cut, and quite out - it had been cracked the day before by accident; the cloth could be got out there - I discovered it the moment I went into the shop; I was the first to discover it - I found my servants still at work; the shop door cannot be opened outside without a key - I had cut the pattern out myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the space in this cloth appear the same size as the pattern cut out? A. Precisely so - I have not got the pattern to compare.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Thursday, the 3rd of February, about noon, I went with Goddard to No. 9, Fullwood's-rents, and found these two pieces of cloth in a room on the first floor; nobody was in the room - a person who lives in the first floor gave me the key; I left Goddard there. On the following morning, between nine and ten o'clock, I went again with Goddard - the prisoner was not there, and we brought the cloth away; I saw the prisoner that afternoon, at Marlborough-street, in custody - Mr. Benfield did not see the cloth till Friday, the 18th; he brought two patterns, and claimed it - it was two pieces of a different pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who gave you the key at the house? A. Mrs. Davidson - she went up with us, and I think unlocked the door.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 3rd of February I went to Fullwood's-rents, with Ballard; Mrs. Davidson opened the room on the first floor - we found the cloth; I waited there till one o'clock in the morning; the prisoner did not come in - I saw him at the office the afternoon of the next day: Mr. Benfield claimed the cloth - on the Tuesday after the Friday, when the prisoner was brought for re-examination, he was sitting in the clerk's-office, but the examination had not commenced; he stated to me that he had bought the cloth of one or two persons who called at his door in Fullwood's-rents, for 1s. a yard, and he could bring a person forward to prove it; he called it stuff for trousers - there was no other stuff for trousers in his room; no owner had been found then - this cloth was not examined about that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he? A. Sitting on a form in the clerk's-office; I mentioned what I had brought from his lodging when he stated this - Schofield was there, but I do not know whether he heard it.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner at his lodging, in the first floor front room, in Fullwood's-rents - he was making inquiry about this cloth at the time I went in - I heard him told that two officers had taken it away; he said he could account for it, as he bought it at the door for 1s. a yard: I took him to the office, and heard him make the statement to Goddard - there were a few waste pieces of cloth and remnants about his room; he did not mention the name of who he bought it of.</p>
               <p>MR. BENFIELD. I am confident this is my cloth; the piece is cut out here - 2s. 2d. a yard is the wholesale price; I never bought any lower - I have not got the pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I think you said one piece had a pattern cut out? A. Yes; that is between thirteen and fourteen yards - I cannot swear to the other.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you a similar cloth to the other in your possession? A. Yes, but have no particular mark on it - it was precisely the same sort and length, nine yards and three-quarters - the other was longer when stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the stuff found in my room of a man who hawks linen about; I was called down by a person who lives in the house, to look at it - as to the gentleman swearing to it by the piece being cut out, I have cut patterns out myself.</p>
               <p>MR. BENFIELD. The pattern hole is precisely the same at this end as I left it - I do not find that any other pattern has been cut; I cannot say to whom I gave the pattern.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. You have sold many of the same kind, have not you? A. Yes - I should like to see them; I lost twenty or twenty-four that evening, and have seen about eight - part were fitted up ready for sale, and part were not; I never sold them not fitted up.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Nicholls, a pawnbroker, of No. 43, Gray's Inn-lane. I produce a manifold-writer and writing-case which were pledged on the 11th of January - I did not take it in, but was present, and saw the person who pawned it, and am quite certain the prisoner is the man; he has pawned at our shop for a year and a half at least - I cannot be mistaken in him; he pawned it in the name of Thomas Cooper, Gray's Inn-lane, for 12s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen many of these manifold-writers? A. I have not; it appears to be fitted up complete - I did not hear the prisoner give the name; I knew him by the name of Cooper for eighteen months - he always went by that name at our shop; I know his wife, and always took her to be Mrs. Cooper - I do not know her name before marriage.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He pawned it in the name of Cooper? A. Yes, we always knew him by that name: he was in Mr. Griffith's employ about three years ago I understand - there was no concealment.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Little Drummond-street; he and his wife both stood a few paces from the door - we went into the house; it appeared a chandler's shop - we inquired if Gast lived there; a person pointed him out walking down the street - we went after him, and asked him to come back with us and go into his room; he went readily with us, and said he knew what we were come about, that he expected us; we asked what? he said respecting the business of his brother Gast, who has been tried - we asked if he had been pawning any thing? he said he had pawned a writing-case at Griffith's (we had been there before and saw one) - he was asked if he had pawned any other; he said No; we searched him, but found no duplicate - he said he had pawned things for Ellis, and always gave him the money and duplicate, but denied pawning any other writing-case - I do not know that a manifold-writer was mentloned, except as a writing-case; I found a ticket of a manifold-writer in a room in Tottenham-court-road, said to belong to Ellis, and went to Nicholls' - it is called a writing-case on the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not know positively that the room belonged to Ellis? A. No, only it has been sworn so here; it was the attic of Mr. Thompson's house - this conversation was a considerable time after the pawning; he might have forgotten it - he was within five yards of his own door; I did not know him, and do not know that he did me - he did not attempt to escape; his brother and Ellis had been taken up - I found nothing at his lodging.</p>
               <p>MR. WEDGWOOD. This is a patent manifold-writer, and I am certain was never sold - this case is mine; it was the cover of a manifold-writer, not fitted up for sale -I would not have sold it in this state; it originally had printed directions on it on both sides, but they appear to have marble paper pasted over them, to disguise it.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was cross-examined at very great length as to his means of identifying the property, and finally pointed out several marks in them, and that the case was stamped "Warranted genuine, R. Wedgwood," with a punch, which never went out of his possession.</p>

I asked if they lived there, and she said No- they then said they had taken it of the landlady the day before; I gave an alarm, and

I have known the prisoner these five years; he was in the habit of bringing soot to my master, about six months before he was taken - when he was engaged in shooting the soot, I used to hold his cap, and I used to see a handkerchief in it; I observed it particularly - I noticed a tear in the corner, and three letters on it; I have had it twenty times in my hand - there was a cook-shop at the corner of Moore's-alley, which he used to frequent, and I have seen him use the handkerchief there; I remember on one occasion, we were standing at the corner of Cock-alley, and he had it in his hand - we used to call him by the nickname of Buss, and I said, "Buss, let me look at your handkerchief;" I looked at it, and said, "It is torn at the corner;" he said, "I know it is;" there were three letters on it in a straight line - this is the handkerchief, here is the tear; here are three letters in a straight line, and one below; I had not noticed the one below at that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When did I show you the handkerchief? A. I cannot rightly tell; it was about three days before this happened.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170127"/>JURY. Q. How long before he was apprehended had you seen him shoot any soot? A. About six months - he was not in my master's employ, but he used to buy soot of the prisoner.</p>

On the 6th of December, I called in the prisoner to sweep the kitchen chimney, about ten o'clock in the morning - my husband's watch was hanging over the chimney; when the prisoner had got the machine about half-way up, he told me to take down the watch, which I did - I put it into a basin on the dresser, and covered it over with a little silk bag; I went up stairs to get some money, and left my little girl in the room, but she went out to see if the machine was up the chimney - I was away about a minute and a half, and when I came down she was out in the yard; the prisoner soon finished the chimney - he made some difficulty about putting the soot into the bag, and I asked if I should hold it; he said No - I paid him 4d., and he went away; I missed the watch in about ten minutes - no one had been in the house but him, from the time I had put it into the basin; I received information, and went to White's-yard, Rosemary-lane, saw the prisoner, caught him by the jacket, and said,"Where is the watch you took from Walter-place, Schoolhouse-yard, where you swept a chimney this morning?" he said, "You had better come and see;" he struggled, got from me, and ran as hard as he could - I value the watch at two guineas; it cost me four - it was as good for me as when I bought it; my daughter is twelve years old, but she is very ill - I am certain no one was in the house but her and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before she saw me she wanted to swear to another man of the name of Fossett. Witness. No - a Policeman took another person, but I said that was not the man.

            . I am in the employ of a pawnbroker, in Ratcliff-highway. I have a sheet, pawned on the 30th of November, by the prisoner, in the name of Smith - she was in the habit of pawning at our shop by the name of Smith, New Gravel-lane, which is fifty or sixty yards from Tent-street.</p>

            . I was called into the house in Tent-street, on the 25th of January; I took the prisoner there - her husband was there, and gave Kemmiah a duplicate; he said that was his property, and the prisoner ought to be punished - Kemmish gave me the duplicate, and I took the prisoner to the watch-house; she there said that Kemmish's wife gave the sheet to her to pawn.</p>

            . I know this sheet is my husband's; it was kept in a box under the bed - I missed it on the night I came home from Tottenham; I do not know the day - it was in November or December, I think in December; I had never given the prisoner, or any one else, permission to pawn it; she and her husband live on very bad terms.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now, take care what you are saying, it affects the prisoner very much - are you quite sure you had not given her the sheet to pawn? A. Yes; we did owe some rent at that time - her husband has not excused it; we still owe about 12s. 6d.; we have two rooms there - we have never found the blanket; 1s. 6d. was lent on the sheet - when I went into the room to get it out of the box it was gone; I looked well about, and then I went into one of their rooms - I said, "Mrs. Manley, I have lost a sheet;" and she hooted out of another room,"Oh, you will find it again" - but I think she was in liquor; her husband then said, "That is all you get for going into their room when she was ill."</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you in the habit of drinking with her? A. No.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183102170128"/>COURT. Q. Now, are you quite certain about the sheet? A. I am quite certain, if it were the last word I had to speak, that I never gave her the sheet to pawn - I frequently heard her husband say he could have her transported.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to her one morning, and said I had an article in pawn, and I did not know how to get it out; she said, "I have nothing but a sheet;" she brought it to me wrapped up in her shawl, that the children might not see it. Witness. She never pawned any thing of mine, with my knowledge, but a footman, and then I sent my boy with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean, upon the solemn oath you have taken, to say that you did not deliver that sheet to her to pawn? A. No, my Lord, I did not, if it were the last word I had to speak; that is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth - her husband came to the window while they were quarrelling, and said, "Mr. Kemmish, if you will fetch an officer I will tell you where your property is."</p>
               <p>JURY to DANIEL KEMMISH, SEN. Q. Where did the prisoner's husband produce the duplicate from? A. I was at work at the window and he said to me, "Mr. Kemmish fetch an officer, and I will discover to you your stolen property" I fetched an officer, and when I took him in the yard her husband gave me the duplicate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mean that when you fetched the officer you did not know who was the thief? A. No, my Lord; I made all the haste I could, for fear he should alter his mind - he was in a passion with his wife, and I was afraid he would not give me up the duplicate - I did not know he had a duplicate, but he said he would make a discovery to me, and I judged he had one - I knew my wife had sent the footman to pawn; it was pawned to get something for my family to eat - the prisoner offered her service to take it; I never heard from my wife that she gave her the sheet to pawn; I do not believe she did, for she was at Tottenham when it was stolen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to ask her for rent - she said she had no money; I said I wanted to fetch an article out, and she lent me this sheet - my husband used me ill, and he persuaded her to prosecute me; she had lent me 2s., and we quarrelled about it.</p>
               <p>LOUISA KEMMISH. If I was dying at this moment I know nothing of the sheet being pawned, nor did I lend it to her.</p>

               <p>THOMAS EVANS.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is that all that Flanner said? A. Yes, all he said to me - the officer had been in some time before me; I went to the office with the officer and Flanner - I am quite certain these are my trousers; here is a mark where they are broken out behind, when I went larking at a public-house the first night I had them, and here is a hole at the bottom of the legs.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I apprehended Nelson, in consequence of some information, in his mother's house - his mother let me in; when I saw him he said, "I did not take the trousers, it was Phelps, and they were sold at Flanner's, in George-yard, for 4s. 6d.;" he said the money had been divided between three of them, and he had been to the theatre in the evening; I took Phelps and Clarke to the station, and on the following morning I went with the prosecutor to Flanner's, in George-street; I rapped several times at the door - Flanner put his head out, and said, "Who is there?" I said, "A friend;" he let me in, and the prosecutor staid in the street for a minute or two; I asked Flanner where the trousers were which he had bought of the three boys; he hesitated, and said they were not in the house - I said, "Have you pawned them?" he said Yes; I said, "Give me the duplicate, and I will get them" - the prosecutor came in while he had the duplicate in his hand; we went to the pawnbroker's - Flanner said when he gave me the duplicate, "There is no occasion for me to come - I have not the money to get them out;" I said, "I can get them without money;" he did not state where he got them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he at any time tell you where he got them? A. No, not till he got to Worship-street - he was at first admitted as a witness; I was at his door three or four minutes before I got in - I was in plain clothes; he could not tell who I was - there was time for him to have destroyed the duplicate; the prosecutor was at the door two or three minutes after I got in - I have seen Flanner before; he is married, but I do not know his family.</p>
               <p>Nelson. I did not tell the Policeman what he has stated - two women at No. 9, Rose-lane, told him that a pair of trousers were brought in there, and Flanner had bought the duplicate. Witness. No, I did not hear that till Flanner stated it at Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Phelps. I was not there when they were bargaining for these trousers - I was going along, and a woman called me over, as my father was there intoxicated; I took him home, and did not see Nelson or Clarke till half an hour afterwards, in Rose-lane.</p>
               <p>Nelson. The Policeman called me aside, and said, "I will give you 10s. if you will tell me where Flanner lives;" I said, "I don't know, only a woman said he lives in George-street."</p>
               <p>ZACHARIAH BAKER. I said nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Flanner's Defence. I was called on between five and six o'clock in the evening, and a woman asked me to buy a pair of blue trousers; I saw the trousers on the bed - I said, "I don't want them - I have no money;" she then said I might go and pawn them - I said, "I don't like such a thing - I don't know whose they are," but I took and pawned them - I gave her the money: one of the boys went with me - she kept the 4s. 6d., and said the boy might have the halfpence himself - the trousers were not in my house; I have a family of ten motherless children to support.</p>
               <p>Flanner received a good character.</p>

At the corner of Finsbury-square - we went to a public-house - I had a glass of gin at two houses, and gave her the same; we then went on towards Spitalfield's church, and she proffered to show me the way - I do not remember what time it was; I do not remember telling her it was too late for me to go home - I do not know who proposed my going with her; she seduced me - I do not remember seeing the landlady; I did not pay for the room, nor give the prisoner any thing, nor send out for more liquor, nor lay down on the bed - I had requested her to let me go home before I went in, but I was rather in liquor and went with her; I kept all my clothes on all the time - I do not remember a sovereign being on the floor, and our having a dispute about it - I had not seen any one else in the house, nor made any bargain; I was standing in the room when the Policeman came in - I had put the candle out with snuffing it, about three minutes before the officer came in - I do not know whether she had laid down; I am married.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the prisoner was tipsy? A. Yes - they were both so tipsy they hardly knew what they were about; the prisoner was the worst - the landlady brought me a light, but she did not come into the room; the prisoner was so tipsy I had to carry her to the station-house nearly - she behaved very riotous, and bit and struck me; the bed appeared to me as if some one had been lying on it - the prisoner's gown was nearly off, but the prosecutor had his clothes and his hat on - it was between twelve and one o'clock.</p>

            . On the 2nd of February I told my wife to pay the prisoner 5s. 3d. for three hours and a half, at 1s. 6d. an hour - it was for moving some goods in Mr. Daffurn's van: the prisoner had the management of it -I saw the money paid to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you a person in your employ named Charles Franklin? A. No-I had sent a person to the yard for the van, but he is not here; I do not know who he delivered the message to.</p>
               <p>MR. DAFFURN re-examined. Q. Had the prisoner any permission to attend with the cart? A. Certainly, if a job came in; I had not that day given him authority to go with it - I was not at home; he had a general authority to go with it, and receive money - he had been a regular servant at one time, and has worked there two or three years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you a person in your employ named Charles Franklin? A. Yes, but he is not here; it would not have required any authority for the prisoner to go with the van.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Hancock came to me with a message from Mr. Dairy to remove some goods; I went to do the job on my own account - I met Mr. Franklin, and asked him for a van, which he said I could have; I went, received 5s. of Mr. Dairy, and there was a man with the van who had 3d. - I went home, and paid my master 3s. 6d. for two hours and three-quarters, at 1s. 3d. an hour - I kept the other 1s. 6d. for my trouble.</p>
               <p>MR. DAFFURN. If he had asked me to let him do it, I, perhaps, should not have refused him, but he ought to have asked me - he would have received 6d. an hour for the job.</p>

On the 24th of January, I was in his shop - the prisoner came, and said he had brought some bags which my brother had ordered, and he had left some paper with my brother, which he wanted; I said, "I don't know any thing about the paper, you must wait till my brother returns;" he said he must have the paper, and pointed to a bundle of whitey-brown paper, which was in view at the time - he did not say whether my brother had paid for that paper or not; he remained about half an hour, and said he must have the paper - I still said he must wait for my brother, but he said he must have it, and I at last said,"You must take it, if it is yours," and he took it away; I had seen him frequently before, and know he is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I had brought some bags your brother had ordered, and you gave me a quire of paper to make up into pound bags size? A. He took a quire of paper, and cut some out, which he left in the shop.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ELBOROUGH. I left my sister in care of the shop - on my return she stated this circumstance; I have bought bags of the prisoner, but he had never left any bundle of paper there, and I had not ordered any bags then.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you order me to bring some bags, and tell me to cut out some bags for you? A. No, not at that time - I have ordered bags.</p>

The prisoners came there with a waggon, and said they had brought fourteen quarters of malt - I attended to the delivery; after Porter had brought in six quarters I saw that he had an empty sack doubled up on his shoulder, and a full one on it - when he had shot that I took the empty one, and asked if he had brought two sacks at once - he said his mate had thrown it on his shoulder; after delivering four or five more sacks he took the empty sack, and said he would throw it into the waggon - master came up, and I told him what had occurred; he counted the empty sacks - there were twenty-eight, which was right; I should think an empty sack on his shoulder would be an hindrance to him.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at the Horse and Sack, kept by Mr. Moss. The prisoner came in on this Saturday night, before the prosecutor - he sat in the taproom for a minute, and then stood up by the fire; I saw the prisoner speak to him; he called for a quartern of gin, and gave me half a crown - I gave him the change; the prisoner then put her hand into his pocket, and pulled out the money; the men who had been drinking with her were laughing and talking together, and she dropped all but two half-crowns and one shilling, which she kept in her hand - the prosecutor accused her of the robbery; my master was serving in the bar, and knew nothing of it till morning - the house was cleared because it was twelve o'clock - I believe the prisoner went away with the men; I found no money on the floor - I believe the men picked it up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him by the Red Lion; he took me to this house, and paid for some fish for me there - I heard some money drop, but do not know where it came from; I got intoxicated, and do not know what became of him.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 5th of February at Gast's house; I saw her in the shop - I told her I wished to go into her room; she took me up to a second floor room - this medicine-chest stood on the drawers; I put my hand on it, and said, "Is this yours?" she said, "It is mine," and that she had had it a long time; I said, "Where did you get it?" she made some humming and hesitation, which was not an answer, and I took her in charge.</p>

            . On the 5th of February I was standing between two doors in Gast's house, when the prisoner came in; she put her shoulder against the partition, and called Harry! Harry! to a boy who was in the shop - he saw her, but would not speak to her; she turned round, and saw me standing at a short distance behind; I said, "What is it you want?" she said she only wanted to speak to Harry - I said, "What do you want with him?" she said she had come to fetch a shirt to wash for him, and that she washed for him generally - I took her into the next room, and asked where she lived; she said in Grosvenor-street - I asked which, and after a little hesitation, she said Lower Grosvenor-street; I said "It is impossible that a washerwoman can live in Lower Grosvenor-street, what is the number?" Ellis was in custody in the shop, and desired her to answer no impertinent questions, upon which Ellis was taken away to the office - I said I should not let her go till she satisfied me where she lived - she afterwards said she lived in Colvell-court, which leads out of Charlotte-street; I sent Goddard there with her - in the trunk, at Mr. Thompson's, No. 11, Tottenham-court-road, I found these three duplicates; I went to the pawnbroker's - they relate to these articles.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did she know you? A. I am satisfied that she did; but the darkness of the place, and the dirty state she was then in, I did not then know her: Ellis was in custody; I cannot say that he lived in that house; for the room pointed out as his, had neither bed nor bedding in it, nor did he live at Thompson's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. These are part of a number of articles stolen one night in November? A.

               <p>THOMAS RILEN. I have the care of the cottage. I went out at nine o'clock, leaving every thing secure - the back door was fastened with two bolts; I left a chopper in the fire-place - I went out at the front door, and locked it - I came home at twelve, found my back door open, the things strewed about, and the bed and one sheet gone; there was a square of glass out of the kitchen window, and there was the appearance of blood - he had let himself in at the window, and out at the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man came up to me, and said he would give me 2s. 6d. to carry the bed to Well-street, Oxford-street - I went into the cottage the front way, as far as the back door; the man said, "You may go this way, and I will come after you."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Have you always told the same story about this? A. Yes - I never let the prisoner go; I seized his hand - he drew his hand back, but I still held his arm; I am quite sure I caught his hand in my pocket - I had taken out a halfpenny for the balck man, and before I had time to give it, the prisoner put his hand into my pocket; I was not at all in liquor - it was not the prisoner who proposed to send for an officer; it was not more than twenty minutes before the officer came - he tried to get away, and said if I were not a woman he would strike me, but the mob said, "You shall not strike her."</p>

            . On the 21st of February I saw the four prisoners together in Crane-place, Kentish-town, about three o'clock in the afternoon - I am sure I saw them all; they threw a till over a wall, which attracted my notice - I then saw them passing copper and silver among them, which I saw Harris take out of his hat - he gave them all some; I thought it was not right, and told the Policeman - I took the till up myself; I did not know them before, but I can swear to them all.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MORRIS. I am a Police-constable. This witness gave me the till, and gave me notice of this - I saw all the boys playing with halfpence, opposite her house; I took them - I found 8 1/2d. on Watts, and the rest of the money on the others - here is 1s. 6d. in silver, and this copper - I took two first, and the other two after.</p>
