                  </hi> I am a clerk at Bishops Stortford station. The prisoner was in the Company's service two years—he was very honest, and conducted himself well—both these bags were in the booking-office—the prisoner came to take his ticket some time after the prosecutor had left his bag—the prisoner put his bag on a form—he borrowed a newspaper; he read it till the bell rang—he then seized a bag and went off, leaving his own bag behind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am a carrier in Wheatsheaf-yard, Far<lb/>ringdon-street, about a mile from Mr. Eyke's. I have known Mr. Eyke some years—I had directed Haycraft to look after a horse for me, and some time after Haycraft and the two prisoners came to my premises with a horse—Mr. Greig was with me—they wanted 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; I would not give that, and they took it away again—Haycraft went after them, and brought them back, and at last I agreed to give 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the horse—7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day week—I paid them 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down—Mr. Greig wrote a receipt, and West put his mark to it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were asked where they came from, and West said from the country, and I supposed the horse came also—I asked where they came from, and they did not make any answer—I asked where the horse came from, and they said, "From the country"—I wanted the horse tried, to see if it would draw well, and they said, "Come up to Smithfield and try it in a market cart;" I did not do so—it was tried in a van near my premises—it satisfied me, and the bargain was completed—they were to come for the other 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Friday following—next day I had occa-sion to send to Mr. Eyke's premises for some corn, and I sent the horse, and Mr. Eyke claimed it—I saw the prisoners again on the Tuesday—they came to my house—West came up into my room, and asked me how the horse got on—I said I did not know, the horse was taken away quick enough from me—he seemed surprised—I told him that Mr. Eyke had owned it—I was called down stairs, and left him with Mr. Greig—I found Blake sitting in</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fishmonger, at Cow-cross, Smithfield. Mrs. Cox asked me if I heard of a horse to let her know. On 6th July, I met the prisoners with this horse in St. John-street, about three o'clock, just before the market opened, coming towards it—I asked if they would sell it—they said, "Yes"—I knew them by sight in the market—I never knew any harm of them—they said they had been round the country, and had more horses on the road, that they bought it of a man who had an execution in his house—they asked me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "I don't think the person has got above 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—West said, "Who is the person?"—I said, "An honest woman who keeps a caravan, and a cart"—he said, "If she has got the money I don't mind trusting her a little"—we went in, and called her down; she looked at the horse, and said it would suit her—he asked her 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said it was too much—an ostler in the yard said, "Mrs. Cox, if you can buy this horse for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Meyrick, who was the London agent of the firm of James and Smythies, attornies, at Aylesbury. I attended to the conduct of a suit of Miles <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Miles in the Court of Chancery—Mr. Smythies, the defendant, was the attorney for the plaintiffs in that suit—Mr. James, his partner, did not interfere in the management of that suit in the slightest—in Oct. last year the plaintiff's solicitor was changed—this is the order of the Court for the change, it is dated 10th Oct. 1848 (<hi rend="italic">this was produced by James Fluker, managing clerk to Mr. Kirk, who was the attorney substituted for Mr. Smythies</hi>)—<hi rend="italic">after</hi> the change of attornies took place, a bill of costs was prepared by Mr. Smythies and carried into the Master's office—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is made out to Mr. Richard Soden, as debtor to Henry Smythies—the amount is 355<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and is signed Henry Smythies—it is the handwriting of Mr. Smythies—an action was brought against Mr. Soden for the recovery of that bill of costs—this is the <hi rend="italic">nisi prius</hi> record in that action (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a bill of particulars is annexed—the writ was issued on Friday, 16th Feb. 1849—the plea was, "Never indebted"—an order was afterwards made for taxing the bill—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in pursuance of that order an appointment was made before Mr. Baines, the taxing Master on 3d April: the bill of costs was then laid before the Master—Mr. Fluker, (Mr. Kirk's managing clerk), Frederick Miles, myself, and Mr. Smythies attended, and another assistant clerk of Mr. Kirk's, at the Master's chambers in Staple-inn—there is a charge in the bill of costs for taking the retainer of Mr. Soden in writing—there are no dates to the items—this date of 29th May, 1847, in the margin, is Mr. Smythies's writing—the item is, "attending you when you consented to become next friend, and taking your consent in writing, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—when the Master's attention was drawn to that item, the retainer was handed to the Master, that was in consequence of the Master's asking when that consent was given, because on that consent Mr. Soden would only become liable from the date of that consent—Mr. Smythies pro<lb/>duced the retainer to the Master—the date was fixed as 29th May, 1847, by Mr. Smythies, and in consequence of that the item of journey to town to consult with Counsel, three guineas, and rail and expenses one guinea, was taken off by the Master, as being antecedent to the retainer—the Master, in my presence, marked the retainer as a document produced before him—these are his initials on it, and the date," 3d April, 1849"—Mr. Smythies did not give any account of it when he produced it, that I recollect, he merely handed it in—some observation was made by the Master as to the proof of the retainer being a question in the cause, and not to be decided by him there at chambers—Mr. Fluker had an opportunity of seeing the retainer; either I or the Master handed it immediately to him—Mr. Fluker handed it to Frederick</p>

Miles—I tendered them every assistance I could—I did not attend the consultation—I never spoke to Mr. James until I attended at Bow-street—I had never seen him till a day or two before—I went to him, in consequence of his sending for me—I was applied to, to be prosecutor against Mr. Smythies at Bow-street—Mr. James had never been my solicitor before that—Mr. James did not apply to me himself—he did not speak to me at Aylesbury—I had a letter on the Monday night about coming to London—I came, and saw Mr. James—he said it would be necessary for me to be in London—I was examined as a witness at Bow-street—I represented myself as the prosecutor when the summons was taken out—I did not hear myself mentioned as being the prosecutor—I do not think I should have prose<lb/>cuted—I was glad to get out of it—I have written to Mr. Smythies in the progress of the cause—the letters are here—I pledge my oath I never signed any paper at the office at Aylesbury—I all along felt satisfied I had never signed any paper—I was asked if I had signed the retainer, and I said I had not the slightest recollection of signing anything—I was so far positive as that—I do not recollect saying, "I do not recollect having done so; I may have said so"—it is so long ago I cannot charge my memory—I never told Mr. Kirk that—I did not tell Mr. Kirk's clerk that I was not certain whether I had signed <hi rend="italic">it</hi> or not, it was so long ago—I said I never recollected signing anything, and it was an extraordinary thing that I should have signed it and not know anything of it—I said I never had signed anything to make myself liable for costs—I never recollect having any doubt about it—I never signed any paper to that effect—I have not had the slightest doubt—I did not at first feel that my memory was doubtful in consequence of the time that had elapsed—the suit is not over yet—Mr. Kirk still carries it on for the family—the action that was brought by Mr. Smythies has been arranged on the part of the family by Mr. Kirk, and he has given me a release—the family employed Mr. Kirk to defend the action—that was on the ground that I had never consented to act as next friend—I never intended to dispute that I meant to act as next friend—I was willing to render assistance and advice, and the family were willing to give such costs as he was entitled to out of the state.</p>

I am an attorney of the Court of Queen's Bench—I am not an attorney of the Court of Chancery—I have practised at Aylesbury three years, where my father and grandfather carried on business before me—I was previously in the office of Crowder and Maynard—Mr. Smythies became my partner in the September following my father's death; Sept. 1846—there was a Chancery suit in our office, Miles <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Miles, the management of which Mr. Smythies had entirely—I was aware that there was an action pending, after the change of attorneys, by Mr. Smythies against Mr. Soden—I heard the record in that action was withdrawn, or intended to be withdrawn on 26th April: Mr. Smythies came to me in Palace-yard, and explained to me the reason of his withdrawing it—I asked him how it was, after having given me such decided opinions as to Mr. Soden's liability to pay the costs, he should withdraw the record at the last moment—he had breakfasted with me that morning, and left me to go <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the consultation—he came back, and told me that the record was withdrawn; that he told Mr. Hill that Fluker was to be called as a witness, and that Mr. Hill knew Fluker to be so great a blackguard that it would not be safe to allow him to go into the box—I said, "Well, but Mr. Hill could cross-examine him"—he said, "Oh, they will be asked it all before"—I then said, "You had better settle"—not a word was then said about the retainer—on Saturday, 5th May, at Aylesbury, I asked him how he came <hi rend="italic">to</hi> withdraw the record, and he then said he had lost the retainer—I said, "But there was a retainer produced before the Master"—he said that was a copy—I asked him who made it—he said he did, he rewrote it from memory—I asked him if he signed Mr. Soden's name to it, he said he did—I asked him if he imitated the signature, he said he did—I made use of an oath, and said, "It is forgery, Smythies; it is forgery!"—he said, "You may call it so if you please"—I said, "It is the first time such a thing has ever been done in this office, and I will take good care it is the last;" and I left him, without speaking another word—that evening I went into Oxfordshire, and next morning I wrote him this letter (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Sunday morning,—Dear Smythies, I regret beyond expression that, after having passed the most uneasy night I ever had, in reflecting upon the facts which our conversation of yesterday disclosed, that I feel myself imperatively called upon to tell you, without disguise, that the feelings of regard and esteem which I bore towards you have undergone a total change. From our first acquaintance, I placed myself entirely in your hands with the greatest confi<lb/>dence; there was nothing I concealed from you; even any private letters were opened by you at my request. The business and its connections, which I avoided representing even at 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, turned out to be double that amount; and as the returns came in slowly, I allowed you to take your share whilst I spent the money which I had earned elsewhere, and which I ought, in justice to myself, to have invested. Everything in the shape of money was under your control, almost exclusively; in fact, I treated you more like a brother than a stranger; and how have you repaid this confidence? After</p>

               <p>involving me and two of the oldest friends the office has, in the meshes of that infernal Chancery suit, you, in order to secure the costs, substituted a retainer in your handwriting for the original, which you had lost. Now, was this honest between you and the client, or proper conduct towards me? I will not, Smythies, in memory of what has passed between us during the last two years, characterise such conduct in the terms it deserves. Your own character you may value as you please, and part with it how you please: but whilst you were connected with me you, had no right to compromise it; and thus reflect upon mine. For myself, I value honour more than life. In God's name what have I done, that I and my sisters should be recklessly rained, without my having an opportunity of averting the disaster? For even when you found that the plot had miscarried, and that you had fallen into your own snare, you deceived me, and the true state of the case was carefully concealed from me. But although I could write pages on the sub<lb/>ject, it is more than I can bear. But I cannot conclude without saying that the trust and confidence which I placed in you, relying upon you as a man of prudence and honour, is lost, irretrievably lost. The course I shall pursue will depend upon the advice my friends may give me; but I do not see that there can be two opinions on the subject. The only difficulty I feel is, in having to make so humiliating a statement to any man. I shall leave for town by the ten o'clock train from Aylesbury to-morrow; and remain yours, &amp;c., J. <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES</hi>.—"The two oldest friends alluded to there were Mr. Henry Hay ward, who was to be receiver, and Mr. Neale, steward to Lord Carrington, who was one of the sureties—Lord Carrington is a client of mine, he is the lord-lieutenant of the county—at the time I wrote this letter I did not know that Mr. Soden had denied giving any retainer at all—by the expression," the true state of the case was carefully concealed from me, "I meant, that when he found it was necessary to withdraw the record, to prevent the expo<lb/>sure of the document being a false one, that he had told me an untruth about Mr. Hill and Mr. Fluker, I meant to express that—I received from him a lettter which crossed mine of the same date—this is it, it is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Aylesbury, 5th May, 1849—My dear James, I think it due to you and myself to say that I agree in your remarks respecting the retainer, and have felt ashamed of the act ever since it occurred. I might, by stating the circumstances out of which it occurred, extenuate the act; but it was cer<lb/>tainly wrong, and ought not to have been done. It is very difficult not to do wrong sometimes, particularly under great provocation. I feel the more upon the subject, because, as partner, you are somewhat compromised by what I do. I will however be more careful for the future, and trust you will never again have occasion to be dissatisfied with me. Very truly yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY SMY<lb/>THIES</hi>.—"I received this other letter from him, and I suppose it was in answer to mine of 5th May—(read)—"Aylesbury, Sunday evening, 6th May—Dear James, I have just received your letter of this morning, which I must say was not wholly unexpected. I have long perceived that you were discontented, and I anticipated your taking this opportunity of expressing your feelings. It is not my wish to deny that, in some respects, your beha<lb/>viour towards me has been kind and gratifying, particularly with regard to pecuniary affairs. You remind me that you left me the entire control of the business, but you omit to state that you avoided every occasion of advising with me, and that when I have fallen into unforeseen error, you reproached me without mercy and without consideration. When you state that you valued the business at not more than 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, that was the average of the business during your father's time; and if during my time the business</p>

I have always considered and so consider, that your charges against me relative to the suit of Miles <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Miles, are most unjust and ungenerous. Neither you nor your two friends have been injured in the slightest degree, nor are you likely to be so. You imagine evil, and then upbraid me as the author. You speak of the revela<lb/>tions made during an interview yesterday, but you were informed of every<lb/>thing by my brother three days since. You came into the office, knowing the whole facts, and you talked upon indifferent subjects. You left the office, returned, and again talked upon indifferent subjects, and this whilst you were meditating your attack. At length you entered upon the subject, proving by your questions that you were fully informed upon every point, and then gave vent to your indignation in terms of unsparing severity. How am I to understand this? I wrote a letter yesterday, addressed to you in town, so totally at variance with the spirit of yours, that I am under the necessity of recalling it, and shall expect it to be returned to me unopened. I shall also go to London to-morrow to have this matter fully investigated. I shall expect you at Furnival's Inn, at half-past twelve.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had there been, that you are aware of, any discontent exhibited by you towards Mr. Smythies previous to this letter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, there had—I com<lb/>plained of his commencing the suit and altogether, and his conduct with reference to the articled clerk—I had not received any premium from him when we entered into partnership—I had been led to suppose that this was a copy—in May last I received a communication on the subject from Mr. Soden, through Ezra Miles—it was on the afternoon of the day upon which I gave Mr. Smythies notice of dissolution, on 15th May—before that I had no knowledge or suspicion that there had not existed an original retainer—in consequence of what I learnt from Ezra Miles, I went down to Aylesbury to seize the papers—I took a Mr. Aubertin with me—I broke open Mr. Smythies' desk, and removed every paper of every description almost in the office—I found this retainer in his desk, and also these seven letters—five of them were tied up together with a piece of green tape, and the other two were in the corner of the drawer—in the retainer the signature "Richard" has the small "d" after "Rich," and also in the five letters, but not in the two—in con<lb/>sequence of my breaking open the desk, I appeared before a Magistrate—I was not taken into custody, a warrant was issued—I came down to Aylesbury, and the officer came, and Mr. Huddleston insisted on his taking me into custody, and thereupon I walked to the Magistrate—the Magistrate at once dismissed the charge—I received this letter, dated 12th May, from Mr. Smythies on 13th—it was sent to me—a draft of it was found in the drawer—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>—"Aylesbury, 12th May, 1849. Dear James,—I confess myself at a loss to understand the principle upon which you are acting towards me." <hi rend="italic">The following passage here occurred in the draft, but was omitted in the letter: "</hi> I know it is not in your nature to act unjustly to anybody, and I cannot think you would mark me out for a different course of treatment.") "I sus<lb/>pect you are not acquainted with the facts, I will therefore state them. Doubtless you recollect telling me to sue all the Miles' party for our costs, and that if we got only sufficient to pay agents' costs, it would be better to get clear of the matter. I proceeded to do so, and, upon looking up the evidence, I discovered that I had mislaid the retainer. Fully expecting to find it, and the wording of it being fresh in my memory, I re-wrote <hi rend="italic">it, and</hi>

               <p>laid the duplicate, together with the other papers, before my brother, to advise upon evidence—upon the taxation Kirk's clerk asked to see the retainer. I might have refused to show it him, for he had no right to see it; but as I had no cause for concealment, having the duplicate among the papers, I gave it to him, making no remark; he copied it, and returned it to me. Having failed to find the original, the document was left out of the brief, upon which my brother told me of the omission, and I said it was omitted purposely, I having lost the original. The circumstance was mentioned at the consulta<lb/>tion, but Mr. Hill being called into Court, the consultation was adjourned. Afterwards, and after I saw you, my brother advised me to withdraw the Record. I thought we could do without the retainer, as we had other evidence, but nevertheless took his advice, and after making terms with the defendant, and getting a positive assurance from him that the suit should be continued, and the costs paid out of the first moneys realized, I withdrew the Record. You charge me with having concealed from you the fact of my having lost the retainer. Call to mind the remarks. you had made to me when you only suspected me of trifling, and ask yourself what I had to expect if I informed you of so careless an act as losing a retainer; and can you be surprised at my not telling you? Having no papers in the suit in the office when I took the retainer, I no doubt put it somewhere by itself, and so it was mislaid. You wish me to dissolve the partnership; be it so, I consent to sell out, and leave Aylesbury altogether. You may say that having come in for nothing, I ought not to expect to sell. I reply, when you took me into partnership, you could not get any desirable person not only to purchase, but to take it at a gift. I have heard I was the last of sixty applicants; perhaps there is nothing to sell now; if so, I leave the business as I found it; but if there is anything to sell, it must be through me that it is so; and as you will not be prejudiced, you ought not to object to my reaping the full benefit of my own exertions; nor would you, I think, wish to send me into the world without giving me the chance of providing a fund to establish myself elsewhere. Of course I shall not sell to any one objectionable to yourself. I have not yet received my recalled letter.</p>

Then she went out by herself and returned about six o'clock; her son brought her home, beastly drunk. I undressed her and put her into the bed. I never said one word to her. I went out then, and on my return she was up and dressed. I said, 'What induced you to get out of bed?' She said, 'You'll soon know that.' Then she said she had pawned the clock. I said, 'It's no matter,' and then went to look for a light, and while I was feeling for a lucifer, she got her arm round my forehead, and said, 'Let me have a kiss,' or 'I'll kiss you,' or words like them, and with that she cut my throat: and those are the last words I spoke except I screamed out that my throat was cut, that I did; they came immediately.

On Saturday night, 30th June, I was going home from the theatre, between eleven and twelve o'clock—at the corner of Oxford-street and Langham-place a woman accosted me, and walked towards Langham Church with me—I stopped there for a moment, and two men rushed round the corner, and said, "Have you seen a little dog? I would not have lost him for five" something, I believe pounds or guineas—they did not come near me—I retired, and the woman went imme<lb/>diately with the men—I missed my watch, it had been suspended to a</p>

On 25th July I was with the prisoner in the tap-room of Mr. Newton, of the Phœnix Tavern, Ratcliff-cross—two men wanted a lodging, the prisoner went out with them to show them where they were to sleep—he came back and went out again—I do not know where he went to—there is a small window between the bar and tap-room—Edward Pope, the waiter, and James Whitehead were there—I went to bed at a little before one o'clock, and got up as the clock was striking six, and came down about five minutes past—I saw the tap-room window open, and a stone bottle with "aniseed" on it on the window—I put it on the form, shut the window, and went into the kitchen to wash myself—Whitehead was there, and said something to me—I went and found the pri<lb/>soner in the water-closet, and tried to awake him, but could not—I went out.</p>

On 28th July I saw the prisoner there about half-past twelve o'clock at night, drinking in the tap-room, talking with Frost, Whitehead, and me—he went out, and I saw no more of him—I went to bed about one—the tap-room window was fastened, and everything appeared safe—the door from the bagatelle-room into the back-yard was shut, but it has no fastening—the window could not be opened from outside without breaking the glass—I rose at a quarter to eight, and found in the bar a jug with a quart of brandy in it, a short pipe, such as I have seen the prisoner use, and a lump of bread—I saw the prisoner in the passage—he appeared quite tipsy—he told me some one let him in at a quarter to seven—my master's brother was down before me—I saw two large jars in the next yard—some one must have taken them from the bar, and got outside and lifted them from the window-sill—there were nine bottles of brandy in the yard, seven in a basket and two behind a partition—there are buildings all round the yard—no one could get in—there are a pair of large gates, which were fastened inside.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Pleasant-row, Camden-town, and am a labouring man; I am not acquainted with the prisoner. On Monday, the 10th July, I was in High-street, Camden-town, about a quarter to one o'clock in the morning, with M'Grail and Hayes—we were coming from Marylebone—we went to the Black-cap to have half-a-pint of beer to take home—we directly went away with it up to our own place, and the prisoner and M'Grail were standing at the bottom of the court—I asked M'Grail if he was coming to have some of the beer—he said, "Yes, presently"—the prisoner says, "Are you not coming along with me?"—"Well, I don't mind," says he—"But, "says the prisoner," suppose I give you what I promised you"—I took no further notice, but walked on, and just as I turned round, to see if he was coming, M'Grail and the prisoner were fighting—I turned back, laid hold of M'Grail by the collar, and said, "Come on home"—the prisoner ran off, and M'Grail rushed out of my hands, because I <hi rend="italic">made rather stiffer</hi> on him, that he should come along—he got a stumble on the kerb-stone of the road—he got up, and gave the prisoner in charge—he was below where M'Grail fell—I picked up the prisoner's hat where M'Grail fell, and brought it over to the bottom of the court, and stood there—I thought the prisoner was gone away—in about two minutes he returned to where I was—I said he had better go, for M'Grail was gone to give him in charge—he then made towards me in a frightful manner—I thought he was going to hit me with his fist, so I got up and put my hand to guard my face, and he struck me with a knife—he then drew back from me, and the blood spouted out through my shirt and jacket on my sleeve—I said, "Oh, I am cut!"—the knife was in his hand pointed at me again—I then gave him in charge.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 18, Cambridge-terrace, Hyde-park—the officer brought Mrs. Butler to my house between two and three o'clock that morning—my house is about 100 or 150 yards from where she lives—I put her on the floor of my consulting-room, and made a careful examination of her person—I discovered a bruise on the side of her face, and some extra<lb/>vasated blood—I examined her leg, and found the stocking had been cut through by blows in three or four places—the skin of the leg was broken, and it had the appearance of fine nails, or it might be gravel in it—that could have been done by kicks—I then made an examination of her private parts—I found there a most frightful contusion of the parts—they were enor<lb/>mously swollen, with extravasated blood—there was a swelling of the extent of eight inches, running from the pelvis, beginning in front, and forming an arch underneath, between her legs—I ordered her to be carried home by the constables—she was put to bed—I staid with her some hours, gave her what was necessary, and attended her—the next morning I found the parts were still more inflamed, and I was obliged to puncture it as I was afraid it would burst and mortify—her life was in the greatest danger for several days—the parts about the <hi rend="italic">labia</hi> were enormously swollen, larger than my arm—I should have hardly thought that it would have borne so large an extension as there was—she was a healthy and a strong woman, but I considered her life was in danger for five or six days—the effect of the puncture was an oozing of fluid from the part, and she suffered from collapse of the womb—she appeared to have an involuntary effusion of urine, which I attributed to an injury of the bladder, but it was not material—her head was considerably discoloured, and one eye was swollen—her thighs were slightly discoloured—I should think she had had one or two distinct blows both before and behind—the shoe must have passed between the thighs, and had it not been for the clothes she must inevitably have been killed—I heard she bad been sick on the stairs, but I did not see that.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Castle public-house, in Chapel-street, West<lb/>minster.

He has a house on Finsbury-pavement, and also a house at 9, Little Moorfields—they join at the back—they are in the parish of St. Stephen, Coleman-street—persons live in them in the daytime, and I sleep there at night—there are no lodgers—on Tuesday night, 14th Aug., I went to the house to sleep, at a quarter before eleven at night, with Mr. Reid's son—he sleeps there also—he put the key into the door, and found it was bolted inside—I had a bag in my hand; I gave that to him to hold while I; tried to open the door—before I had time to try the door, it was opened from the inside, and the prisoner and another man rushed out—I had not an opportunity of seeing him at that time, but I followed, and never lost sight of him till I gave him in charge to the police—one of the men knocked young Reid down, and they then ran in different directions—I overtook the prisoner in South-street, which is nearly a quarter of a mile from Little Moorfields—after giving him into custody, I went back to the house in Little Moorfields, where I found three sacks of boots, which had been removed from the place where they were ordinarily kept—I had never seen them in the place where I found them—they were Mr. Reid's—they had been kept hanging on hooks round the shop—the desk in the shop was broken.</p>

Two months have elapsed since you pro<lb/>mised it to me, and your silence will compel me to call upon you at Twick<lb/>enham, where I shall be on a visit to some of my old friends. I need not, perhaps, do more than remind you that your visits to Hanover-gate, Regent's-park, are as well known to me as the one you paid at Westbourne-park, and both to married women. Your kind compliance with the repeated request of an old neighbour, who gave you references of the highest respectability would have prevented all further correspondence, added to which, I have done all you asked by letting you know I hare been for years a resident of respectability in Twickenham, and, I have the honour to be, yours, S. <hi rend="smallCaps">MILLS."</hi>—"Nov. 15, 1848.—Sir,—My communication to you being treated with the silent contempt I could not have expected from an old neighbour who commenced a correspondence, I beg to acquaint you how far you are likely to stand affected with your family and the world through your silence, and my knowledge of your immoralities. I know not how far it may suit your views to figure in a <hi rend="italic">crim. con.</hi>, but it has come to my know<lb/>ledge the last week, that the husband of the lady whom you visited at West<lb/>bourne-park Villas, (when I was under the roof) not intending to live again with his wife, would by my evidence get rid of her, through what I am pre-pared to swear, and which will, if done, not be agreeable to yourself; the lady, as you doubtless know, being the mother of two children; however, I write to tell you of my first intention, which is to insert a paragraph in a Sunday journal, a satirical paper, in which your name shall conspicuously and unmistakeably figure, and unless I hear from you by the Saturday in this week, or the Saturday in next, your name will appear, and copies be sent to Mrs. Bevan, and many of your friends. Such is unhesitatingly my determi<lb/>nation—truth only shall be stated, but that fully, if stated at all by an old neighbour; and, I am, Sir, yours, S. <hi rend="smallCaps">MILLS."</hi>—"81, West-street, Brighton. Sir,—I told you your conduct and correspondence with me should appear in a Sunday journal, and I now beg to state I hope to be in town next week in time to have some conversation with an Editor to whom your letters will be given, and, as I intend, for publication, I shall send a copy of</p>

               <p>your last letter to me to Mrs. Bevan, and tell her the gentleman who accom<lb/>panied a lady to Westbourne-park Villas was no other than yourself, nor will I hurt your sensitive feelings further than by telling you I know you received a lady separated from her husband at your residence in Hamilton-place, and when; this may be intelligence you may not object to go to your wife and daughters, but it will most certainly be sent. You have no right to treat an old neighbour who gave you the best references as you have done me, and unless you send what you promised, if I gave you an account of my circum<lb/>stances, and that at once, you shall see yourself in print, and your family and partners shall see it too.

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Clarke, Fynmore, and Fladgate, the solicitors acting for Mr. Bevan. In consequence of a communication I had with Mr. Bevan, I went on 13th April to the office of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper, and in consequence of information which I received there, I went to 7, Bennett-street, Blackfriars—I there saw the prisoner—I asked him if he was the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper—he said he was—I then told him that I waited on him, in consequence of certain paragraphs which had appeared in the "Notices to Correspondents"—I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184908200087"/>
               <p>at that time seen the articles which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper on 31st March and 7th April—I cautioned him against continuing a correspon<lb/>dence of that description, otherwise proceedings would be taken against him—he said that nothing libellous had appeared; he would take care that nothing libellous should appear—I asked him if he had any letters in his possession, the letters alluded to—he stated that he had, and that they were sufficient to fill twenty columns in print, the publication of which would commence in the following Saturday's paper, that would be on 14th April, the next day—he showed me a number of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, and pointed out to me "The Life and Adventures of Captain Aaron Smith"—I do not recollect the date of that paper—he said that was the mode in which the publication would appear—I asked him if he had received the letters from a female—he said, "No, from a male"—he then stated that a female had called on him on 2d April, wishing to see him on the subject of the letters alluded to in the paper of 31st March, but that as she refused to give any name, he declined seeing her—I asked him whether the publication of the letters could be stopped—he said he should not recommend me to make any attempt of that sort—I told him that I was not authorised by Mr. Bevan to make any attempt to get the letters back, but that probably he might be prevailed upon to submit to a little extortion to prevent the publication—he recommended that I should not attempt anything of the kind—he said the publication would commence on the following day, upon which I requested it might stand over for a week to give me an opportunity of seeing Mr. Bevan on the subject—he said he would consent to that—I then left him. (<hi rend="italic">The following paragraphs from the</hi> Satirist <hi rend="italic">of 14th April were here read:</hi>—"<hi rend="largeCaps">INQUIRY</hi>—we shall in a very short time commence the matter you mention by a series of letters entitled" The Banker and his Doings.' The matter will run on for seven or eight weeks, as we have some four or five important letters which we shall publish, bearing out the facts we shall give. We need not add that the matter will create immense sensation, both in town and country; as to this, R, all the facts communicated were within our knowledge, and a great deal you appear not to know."—"<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> must have patience. The correspon<lb/>dence of the amorous old banker with his fair friends, and their extraordinary epistles, are preparing for publication, and we shall shortly commence the series. The figure the liquorish old Lombard cuts is highly amusing, and the teasing yarns, such as damsels of a certain class can alone spin, will be found instructive to aged gallants, whose passions are apt to o'erstep their prudence; if the exposure will make only one old sinner pause in his career, our object will be gained." On the Monday following the 16th, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 12) from Hansill—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>:—"The Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, according to promise, informs Messrs. Clarke and Co. that the first of the articles referred to in last Friday's conversation, will appear next week; he also begs to state that Miss Mills' address is 18, Upper Montague-street, Montague-square. The Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> will to-morrow (Tuesday) leave town for a week or ten days, and cannot be seen by Messrs. Clarke and Co. on this matter except between the hours of one and three o'clock this after<lb/>noon.—Monday morning, nine o'clock, 7, Bennett-street.") Before I received that letter, I had an appointment to see Miss Mills, and 1 went to 18, Upper Montague-street, according to the appointment—I saw Miss Mills there—I had asked Hansill for Miss Mills' address, and he said he did not know it—I did not see Hansill after my interview with Miss Mills—on 18th April, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 13) from Hansill—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"7, Bennett-street, April</p>

Yours, obediently, <hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN HANSILL</hi>.") I wrote, and sent the following answer;—"18th April. Sir, I shall be prevented by other engagements from calling upon you this afternoon, but will let you know when I can call." I subsequently saw this letter of 18th April which had been sent to Mr. Bevan (<hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 15)—(<hi rend="italic">read:</hi>—"7, Bennett-street, April 18th, 1849. Sir, I have made two attempts to see your solicitor respecting the 'Notices to Correspondents' that have appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper; and to-day Mr. Fynmore writes me that he can't see me to-day. I therefore beg most distinctly to inform you that I shall for the future decline seeing your solicitors respecting this matter. I am open to see you from seven to ten on this evening, and from eight <hi rend="italic">to</hi> nine to-morrow morning, after which time I shall decline seeing either you or other persons respecting this matter, which must take its course; my object in wishing to see you was to render you a service no other person could render, which I even could not render after the first of the series of letters appears; as in this letter one of your letters will be given, in which you refer to Mrs. H., also to Mrs. Laurie, of Hyde-park-square, and the doings at Westbourne-park Villas, by seeing me yourself this evening. These letters may be handed over to you, and the matter arranged; but I need not add, if the first letter appears I shall then not be in a position to keep back the others; you are at perfect liberty to show this letter to any one, but if you act wisely you will see me this evening. I will see no person but yourself, and advise other parties to do the same. I am, Sir, yours obediently, <hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN HANSILL</hi>.") On that same day I received a letter from Miss Mills.</p>

               <p>not say he received the letters from a female—he did not say Mr. Befan had written a letter to a lady calling her a "bore," nothing of the kind—I said if he had the letters he represented they must be forgeries—the subject of my interview was the letters written, or alleged to be written, by Mr. Bevan—my interview was to prevent the publication of any letters in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, and to obtain them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury, there being no proof of the publication of the letters by Mills; and further, that to sustain the charge against Hansill as an accessory, a personal aiding of the principal to escape from justice must be shown.—See The Queen</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Chapple</hi>, 9 <hi rend="italic">Car, &amp; Payne, p.</hi> 355, <hi rend="italic">and Central Criminal Court Sessions Papers, vol</hi>, 27, <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> 169. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">urged that the word "assisting" did not necessarily mean an assisting to escape from justice, but any aid offered to a felon after the commission of the crime, such as destroying the inditia of guilt, interfering with the evidence, or making the acts of the principal available for the purpose intended; but even if an assisting to escape from justice was necessary, it was a question for the Jury whether that was not made out by the act of endeavouring to compromise the felony, and so preventing criminal proceedings being taken against Mills.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE ERLE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that some act should be shown tending to the escape of the principal; and the question was whether, upon the ground taken by Mr. Huddleston, the acts of Hansill did or not tend to impede the prosecu-tion of Mills for the offence she had committed</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">considered it would only amount to a composition of a felony.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am Superintendent of police at St. Katha<lb/>rine's Docks. About ten o'clock in the morning, on 25th July, I saw Cook in the Docks, drawing samples from-casks—I saw a tray resting on the cask to his left—Williams was standing between two cases to his right—Cook drew a sample from a cask, the last, or last but one, and be handed it to Williams, who put it into his pocket, which attracted my notice—he turned to the right, and walked off—I followed him—he went into the locker's box—I asked him if he had a pass for that—he said, "No," and he said, "Don't take any notice, it will ruin me"—I took him back to where Cook was—I said, "I saw it done; call him"—Cook came, and said, "It is all right, he is one of our people, going to take it to the Dock-house"—I took them both to the Dock-house, and, while there, Williams said he would tell me the truth, that Spry told him to get it—this is it—it is a Customs' bottle; there is no label to it—I believe Spry is connected with the Customs, he is a locker—on the other bottles there was a label, showing what cask the brandy was drawn from—Williams did not say a word to me about any broken bottle—I had not noticed any other sample taken from this particular cask—Williams seemed to be hiding between the two cases.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of gaugers at the Lon<lb/>don Docks. I was on duty on 25th July—Cook was employed as a sample-drawer that day—it was his duty to get the number of bottles that were given out to him by the gauger—he takes them into his own room and labels them according to the sample he has to draw—he then goes out to draw them, and it is his duty to mark on the cask the number he draws—he then puts the bottles in the tray and takes them to the office—he generally carries them all in his tray—he is not authorised to put any in his pocket to carry away—if he had more than his tray would hold, he might put one in his pocket to carry it to the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known Cook? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven or eight years; I am informed he has been employed in the Docks thirty-five years—Williams has been there but a short time—the bottles are given out by the officer at the proof-room; they have then no label on them—he would then take them to the sample-room and put on the labels, and then take them to the casks and draw the spirits—if one bottle breaks, he would draw another—it would be his duty to take the broken pieces and the fresh bottle to the proof-room, and explain the circumstance—I do not know what Williams's employment was that day—I fancy he was assistant sample-drawer to Cook—there is no separate quay for the rum—the trays are of different sizes; they hold one dozen, two dozen, or three dozen bottles-Spry keeps the locker's place—men leave things there for security—suppos<lb/>ing such an accident to happen on the 24th, as to break a bottle, and on the 25th Williams had required an extra bottle, there would have been nothing wrong in his leaving that bottle at Spry's while he got another label.</p>

I want your bank book"—I said, "I have no bank book"—he made no reply—he put the money into his pocket—it was about eight o'clock in the even<lb/>ing—he did not go anywhere that evening, we went to bed—he went out the next morning, and brought home a gold watch, a gold eye-glass, and a ring—he said he had pawned them because he had lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the races—I did not give him these sovereigns, nor authorize him to take them in any respect—he asked me to give him five, and he took the purse and all from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live in Wells'-row, Islington.

On Saturday, 21st July, John Wright came to our shop—he paid for the oilcloth that Mary Wright bought, and he looked at two loo-tables, and inquired the price—one was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other six guineas—he said he thought his lady would give the preference to the six guinea one—he then looked at two chairs—I could not tell him the price—he said the smaller one would suit his lady, and I was to send it along with the table to Laburnam-cottage, and to tell Mr. Comfort to name the lowest price that could be taken for them—I gave them to my husband to take—I did not intend to sell them, not knowing the price of the chair.</p>

Pye"—this is the receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—supposing him to be the real depositor, that would be the real form, but we might have asked him to sign at full length—it appeared that the original signature was written at full length, and I asked him to sign at full length—I then remarked that his signature was not like that one—he declared he was the party who paid in the money, and said he was tipsy at the time he came to deposit the money, that he was not the best of writers at any time, and that would account for the difference in the writing—the female then came forward—I cannot tell whether she was the one who came forward afterwards—I have no recollection of her features—she stated that the man was the rightful owner of the money—I was inclined to dispute it, seeing the difference in the signature, and feeling almost sure it was an attempt to defraud the bank, I desired them to sit down—I afterwards desired them to come forward, and then both the prisoners came, I am sure—I asked Ward if he was the owner ôf the money—he said he was—I put before him the receipt to sign, and then Myers came up to the counter, and persuaded him not, saying," Do not commit yourself, the money is my money, and not your's, "or words to that effect—I had provided a policeman, and gave them both into custody—they were taken before a Magistrate and remanded, and afterwards Joseph Pye came forward—the woman who came forward first, said she was the woman who had given the notice—Charles William Hallett is one of the trustees of the bank—there are five.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner, in the firm of the solicitors for the prosecution. In consequence of some communication with Mr. Bevan, I called at the office of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper, in Catherine-street, Strand, on 13th April; and in consequence of information which I received there, I went to No. 7. Bennett-street, Blackfriars, on that same day—I there saw the defendant—I asked him if he was Mr. Hansill, the proprietor and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper—he said he was—before I went my attention had been called to the paragraphs which have been read—I told him that I called on him, in consequence of the notices to correspondents which bad appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi> newspaper relative to Mr. Bevan, and that I was instructed to state, if the publication was continued, proceedings would be taken against him—he replied that nothing libellous had occurred, and he would take care that nothing libellous should appear—he then said he had a great many letters in his possession which would be inserted; that there were as many as would fill about twenty columns in print, and would run over a space of several weeks in the insertion of them—he then produced one of the numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, and pointed out to me an article called, "The Life and Adventures of Captain Aaron Smith," and stated that that was the form in which the publication relating to my client would appear—I asked him if the letters to which he alluded had been given to him by a female—he said, no, they were given to him by a male, or a gentleman; but that on 2d April a female had called upon him, wishing to see him on the subject of the notices to corre<lb/>spondents which had appeared in the paper on 31st March; but he declined seeing her, as she would not give her name—I then had some conversation with him as to whether it was probable that a compromise might be effected for the delivery up of these letters, and he advised me not to have any com<lb/>munication with the parties—I then told him that I was not authorized by my client to state as much, but that I thought he would probably submit to a little extortion, if the letters could be restored to him; and as he advised me not to communicate with the parties, I wished to know if he would be the medium of effecting any compromise, if it was desirable—he said, "No"—I then asked if he could give me the address of Miss Mills—he said he did not know her address—I then requested that he would postpone the publication of the letters, which he stated was to take place on the following day, until I had an opportunity of seeing my client; which he agreed to do—he said they should not appear without a previous communication with us—(<hi rend="italic">the paragraph of 14th April was here read, as in page</hi> 397)—on Monday, 16th April, I received this letter from the defendant—I had at that time made an appoint-ment with Miss Mills: at two o'clock, I went and saw her—I received this letter on Wednesday, 18th—I wrote an answer, declining to go, alleging a private engagement—this other letter I received from Mr. Bevan—(<hi rend="italic">these three last-mentioned letters were proved by Mr. Robert Wilson to be the defendant's writing, and were read, as in page</hi> 398).</p>

               <p>the understanding that she should plead guilty to the misdemeanor—she is now suffering her sentence—this trial was postponed from time to time on account of the dangerous illness of Mr. Hansill, as was represented—before I waited on Mr. Hansill I had no communication from him, verbal or written—we are Mr. Bevan's solicitors generally—we have acted for him in other matters—I did not receive instructions from him to compromise this matter, nor from any one on his behalf—I told Mr. Hansill that I thought Mr. Bevan might submit to a little extortion—I had not then consulted with him on the subject—I meant what I said—I believed that be would submit to a little extortion—I asked Mr. Hansill whether he would become the medium of a compromise—I used that expression, and meant it—he said, "Decidedly not," and added, that if any parties attempted to extort money from Mr. Bevan he advised me to indict them—if he had contentad to be the medium of a compromise I should have acted with him after consulting my client—I meant to offer to Mr. Hansill the opportunity of receiving money from Mr. Bevan—I meant to advise him to submit to a little extor<lb/>tion to put a stop to any publication in the <hi rend="italic">Satirist</hi>, and to get the letters,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then if Mr. Hansill had any appetite for extortion you set him on at this interview: you first mentioned the subject of extortion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made use of the term that Mr. Bevan would submit to a little extortion—I was not authorized to do so, but I thought it probable he might—when I asked for Miss Mills' address, Hansill said he did not know it, but would make in<lb/>quiries—I said I should be obliged to him if he would—I did not go to Mr. Hansill to entrap him into something for which he might be indicted—I did not begin this negotiation with him for the purpose of afterwards indicting him—I had not consulted Counsel before 1 bad this interview—only one of these publications appeared afterwards, on the 14th—they were in custody before next Sunday—it was about the middle of the day on Friday, the 13th, that I saw him, and the paper was published on Saturday the 14th—Ido not know whether the paper is published on Saturday morning or evening—Mr. Hansill did not say that any lady had complained to him of Mr. Bevan writing a grossly insulting letter to her, calling her a "bore," and threatening to com<lb/>municate with her friends—nothing whatever of that kind patted, nor did I make any such communication to Mr. Bevan—Mr. Bevan never saw Mr. Hansill that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi>. The deceased, Joseph Dunmore, was my brother—he was about twenty-two years of age. On Sunday morning, 15th July, I went with him to Plaistow-marshes—there was a fight there between him and Sotcher—Cockling and Boulter seconded my brother, and George and a man named Carty seconded Sotcher—there were twenty-eight rounds—it lasted about half an hour and five minutes—they both shook hands when they went in—they hit each other as hard as they could—they had several falls—at the last round they scuffled and fell, and my brother was under<lb/>neath—he was not able to answer when "time" was called—I saw no blow struck at the last round; they only fell—I took my brother home in a cart—Mr. Webb attended him—he died about half-past twelve o'clock—the fight was about half-past six in the morning—he never recovered his senses—I do not know where the agreement to fight had been made, nor the cause of it, my brother came and called me up just before five—he had told me over night that he had had a few words, and expected he was going to fight—when he came in the morning I begged him not to <hi rend="italic">go</hi>, but he said he was determined to go.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Plaistow. I saw this fight—it lasted about half an hour—there were a good many rounds—at the last round they closed and fell—there were some blows struck before that—they were fairly matched as to strength and size—there was no appearance of either having got the better of it—Sotcher had a good many bruises; I could not see whether the deceased had—I could not see anything to show that they ought to have left off before—they were stripped to the waist—they bled at the nose and mouth a little—just before they fell I saw Sotcher strike the deceased just at the back of the head—he did not fall against anything, only on the ground.</p>

"I will not trouble you to do that, I will send for her"—he said, "No; I will tend my elder brother"—while I was questioning him, he said, "Here is a watch and chain, I will have 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on these as well"—I had gone on the other side of the counter, seeing him uncomfortable, and he attempted to push by me—I would not let him pass, and sent for a policeman—I told him what had passed, and said, "You don't wish to make any alteration in these statements, I pre-sume?"—he said, "Yes, I should; let me see, what have I told you?"—I said, "You told me your name is Henry Stone; is that so?"—he said, "No, my name is Henry Norriss"—I gave him in custody, suspecting the salt-cellars were not silver; if silver, I would lend 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce on them, which would be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they weigh eleven ounces—knowing what they are, I would lend 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the four—here is the appearance of an old genuine hall-mark—they have the appearance of old silver.</p>

On 4th July the prisoners came together to our shop for some satin ribbon—I showed them some—there was none to suit them, and they left—they returned immediately and bought half a yard of calico, for which Haines paid—they then looked at some glazed lining, but bought none—Haines spoke about it—Folk whispered something to her, and they then left the shop—after they had gone I missed a scarf-shawl, which had before been at the end nearest the counter to which Folk sat—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know it is Mrs. Burford's—it has her private mark on it.</p>

I would go if I liked, and he has beaten me, and I have struck him again—there has not been jealousy between us, till within the last month or two—I knew if I went out that he would be disturbed—it was mere aggravation on my part to stop away from him—I was not thinking of leaving him altogether—I would like to live with him—it was merely the passion that made me go away—it was merely to keep him in suspense, by the way he has struck me—I went away because I was offended at his striking me—he has been in the habit of drinking much, and it has generally been then that he has got into these passions—he has been a very good husband at other times—he has been five years master of a sailing vessel, under Government, from Woolwich to Chatham, up to this time—his father sailed with the vessel for thirty years—our last child died last May twelve months—his mind has been more affected</p>

I examined the prisoner on 5th Aug., and found a large flesh-wound on the fore-part of his neck about three inches long—he was very prostrated, both bodily and mentally—he appeared to have been immersed in water, and seemed in a very dejected state—I administered brandy—when he regained his senses, I asked him about the transaction—when I inquired about his wife, be sprang up in bed, laid hold of my arm with great violence, and seemed in a state of great agitation—he did not seem to recollect anything, but next morning I had some more conversation with him—he did not recollect where he saw his wife last—he asked where he was, what he had been doing, and what was he there for—there was great incoherency about him—next evening there was great delirium—he would sing a <hi rend="italic">stave</hi>, and lie down, not knowing what he was about—delirium is connected with disease of the brain—I did not con<lb/>sider him in danger from the wounds—he was very much depressed, but from brandy and the application of warmth, he rallied—I think he did not under<lb/>stand what he was about on Sunday—there was an appearance of determina<lb/>tion of blood towards the head and face—I think he was a little more collected on Monday morning, but on Sunday evening he was entirely inco<lb/>herent; he did not know what he was about, nor what had occurred—he was delirious for a short time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to John Brogden, jun., who is carrying on the works of the South-Eastern Railway Company at Woolwich. A stack of old bricks was placed in a particular part, almost opposite the George the Fourth, for Mr. Brogden's use—part of the George the Fourth has been since taken down—I remember the sale of some old houses, which were to be taken down for the railway; I cannot recollect when that was—Mr. Davis sold the pro<lb/>perty—I believe there was more than one sale—I know Mr. Watson purchased one of those houses, which was close by the side of where I was living, in King-street—I should say that house was better than 100 yards from the stack of bricks—that house was taken down after that sale—the stack of bricks was taken away before the house was pulled down—Mr. Davis came and asked me where the boundary-wall was, (the stack of bricks was part of the boundary-wall,) I looked, and the stack of bricks was gone—the house Watson bought was then partly pulled down—in consequence of what Mr. Davis said, I said to Hawley, "You have done a fine thing for yourself this morning"—he said, "What is that?"—I said, "You have sold the bricks belonging to this boundary"—(the stack, and the shed, and the wall, com<lb/>posed the boundary)—he said, "I will go down to Mr. Davis's office and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stonemason and builder, at Woolwich. I know James Watson—I saw him on 21st May, near the Lord Howick—he asked me if I was in want of any bricks—I asked him what they were, old or new—he said, "Either"—that he had purchased a great many bricks that day—I asked what the figure was—he said, "Twenty-eight shillings a thousand"—I afterwards went to his house—he asked me how many bricks I would want, and I told him about five thousand—they were new ones—he said I should have them, he would get them in, about four or five o'clock next morning—I believe the reason he gave why he would get them in so early was, that they would be in the way of the railway—a person named Moore was there, and an arrangement was made with him to cart them—they were to be taken to Sandy-hill—next morning I received some bricks, under a thousand—on Friday night, 25th May, I again saw Mr. Watson, at his own house—I was driving by, and called in—I asked him the reason the other bricks were not sent in—he said he would cart them in the next morning—I understood that the remainder of the five thousand were to come in—I understood from him that they were somewhere near the George the Fourth—on 26th, I received about 1,800 more bricks—they were delivered at Sandy-hill, near Plumstead<lb/>common—I have not paid Mr. Watson for any of them—the price was twenty-eight shillings a thousand—I think some of them were taken up and used for a water-closet—the officers came to me on the 26th—I pointed out to them where the bricks had been used—there was "W.

I was engaged on 26th May in taking some bricks from the yard of the George the Fourth to Sandy-hill, Plumstead—I after<lb/>wards went and took a load, in company with Record and young Mr. Watson—Langley's cart went with us—it was behind—I did not bear either of the Mr. Watsons say what I was to say supposing any one interrupted me; only young Mr. Watson said, the first morning I went to work, that we were going to take them down to Woolwich—the first morning I went to work was on Tuesday—on Saturday, the 26th, I took some more bricks from the George the Fourth yard—the last time I went there, young Mr. Watson and Record were with me—we loaded up a load of new stack bricks—there might have been one or two place bricks amongst them—they were all new—while we were loading them, Dobson came up—he walked round the cart and said, "Where are you going with these bricks?"—Record said, "To the Tunnel"—he said, "It is a strange thing; we have got thirteen or fourteen barges of bricks lying there, and more are brought here every day"—Record said, "I do not know anything about it; we were ordered by the man on the wharf"—I did not hear anything said by the elder or younger Watson about what answer was to be given, supposing anybody asked the question—young Mr. Watson said he would leave us to load the cart, and he would go and meet Langley's cart—I had two bricks in my hand, and I dropped one when Record said they were going to the Tunnel—Record said, "You have not got 500 bricks yet"—I said, "No, I know that;" and he took up the tail-board and began to drive the cart—(I dropped the brick, because I thought there was something wrong)—Record drove the cart on, and I said he had not got the pins—he said nothing, but kept driving on the cart—I took the pins and put them in—as we went by, I saw Langley's cart—Langley was with it, and young Mr. Watson—as were were going by he said, "Take them down to Charlton Tunnel"—their house is by the side of Charlton Tunnel—I went on towards their house—when we got there, we drew part of the way up the hill, took the horse across the road, hung the nose-bag on the horse, and there left it, near to the White Horse—I saw young Mr. Watson at that time—he said, "Leave the horse here, and if anybody should come, tell them they have been drawn to the Tunnel"—I left the cart and bricks there by the White</p>

I was there on 18th June, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, walking between the Black Horse and Mr. Gosling's lodge—there was a hay-cart about thirty or forty yards before me on the same side of the way, the near side—I saw a barrow about the same distance off, with a child sitting between the handles—the cart was opposite the barrow when I first saw it—I do not know whether there was space enough between the hay-cart and barrow for another cart to pass, I do not think there was—I saw another cart before me—it was a light spring-cart, which the prisoner was driving—he was going at the rate of about seven or eight miles an hour—in attempting to pass between the hay-cart and the barrow the off-wheel of his cart caught the barrow, and ran over the barrow and the child—I ran up directly and assisted the child, which was lying down bleeding from the eyes, nose, and mouth—I only saw it breathe once afterwards—at this time the cart the prisoner was driving had stopped, turned round, and came back again—the prisoner said, "For God's sake help to put the poor child into the cart"—it was put in, and carried to Mr. Anderson's—the prisoner asked me the way to the nearest doctor, and I told him—the horse he was driving was quite young and very high-spirited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in marine-stores, at Twickenham. On the morning of 18th June I was driving the hay-cart, and as I was nearing Mr. Gosling's lodge, going towards East Sheen, I heard a noise behind—I looked round and saw the prisoner coming with a cart—it was going about seven or eight miles an hour, or it might be a little more, and in two or three seconds he was on the top of the barrow upon which the child was sitting—I had seen it there about twenty or thirty yards before the cart drove up—the wheel turned the barrow round, and it went over the child's head—I directly jumped out of my cart and went to the child—the prisoner's horse was stopped—he tried to pull him up as quick as possible—my cart was empty, not laden with hay.</p>

                  </hi>. I am wife of Thomas Manning, of White Lion-court, Throgmorton-street. In Jan., 1846, the prisoner came to our house, and said he had got a clock and looking-glass to dispose of; owing to being out of work he must break up his house to get some money—my husband was not at home, and he called again in the evening—my husband told him he did not want them, as he had a clock down-stairs, and one in the coffee-room, but he might bring them as he was in distress—he brought the clock next evening, and sold it to my husband—I swear this clock produced is it—we had it two years and ten months—there was no key to it, and my husband asked him for it, and how be came to purchase such a clock in his circum<lb/>stances—he</p>

               <p>said it was given him by his wife's mother—in Dee., 1848, the policeman, Gardner, came and took the clock away.</p>

"Maria Gobbett has been living with me several times for two years and ten months; she left me in May, 1848, went to Gravesend, and was committed for a month; her brother gave me this clock to sell, as he had a distress in his house, and I sold it for him to Mrs. Manning; I was taken into custody in May twelvemonth, and had twelve months imprisonment; during my imprisonment, Maria Gobbett got aquainted with a policeman, who made her drunk, and gave her a sum of money to tell what she knew about certain robberies committed by me; so I was taken into custody for this clock; the policeman has been in the habit of sleeping with her at a house of ill-fame; she has done this because I would not live with her any longer."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. On 28th June I had a conversation with Tarrant, who has pleaded guilty—while I was in conversation with him the prisoner Jacobs came in—I imagine he had heard what had passed between me and Tarrant.</p>
