            , that White, the prisoner at the bar, asked him if I was gone out? He said he believed I was, (they were both my servants;) he told me White was gone down into the cellar. I had had some suspicion he had robbed me before, we having over-night found three pieces of lead privately laid upon a shelf in the cellar; we had left it as we found it, after we had weighed it. It weighed a quarter of a hundred and three pounds; at seven that morning I had seen it lying there. I staid at the head of the stairs after he was gone into the cellar; after that I went down; the prisoner was then at the foot of the stairs; he past by me, and went up stairs; I went to see if the lead was there, and two of the pieces were taken away; then I ran after him, and found him at the room-door, and made him stand search. He went backwards, and there he dropt one of the pieces on a heap of old lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it?</p>
               <p>Bouchard. Yes, I did. Then he said to me, by G - d, master, you are catched out; you will find nothing. I said, what signifies that? you have dropt one, let us see the other piece, for you have got another; then he drew out another piece from his right-hand pocket, and gave it to me, (the two pieces produced in court, and deposed to.) I said, now I think you are catched out. He said, master, don't be ill-natured; you owe me a day and a half's wages, I will give you that towards this; and he would be d - d if ever he robbed me but once before in his Life, and he would down on his knees, and ask my pardon. I sent for a constable, and took him before the sitting alderman, there he owned he took it.</p>

            . I live at the Cock in Tottenham-court-road; I believe on the 19th of March, I was in the yard, there came three men into it, the prisoner was one of them; he asked me if I would buy this mare? there was a man that I had some knowledge of was one of them; I asked him if he knew the prisoner? he said he did, and that he was a very honest man. The prisoner asked me six pounds for her; I bid him three pounds ten shillings, he said he would not take it; at last I bid him four pounds, then they consulted among themselves, and agreed I should have her; he delivered her to me and gave me a receipt, which he wrote in my book, and we spent a shilling each for a bottle of wine. After that I was going to Smithfield, and met a friend, who gave me a printed bill, and said the mare was stole. After that I found the prosecutor ous, and we went before Mr. Fielding, and there he swore to the mare. The justice granted me a warrant to take the prisoner; when I returned home there were two men that wanted Powel, one said he was his father, the other said he was his ship-mate, and that he lodged with him; I went to his house and took the prisoner there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What value do you set on the mare?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was bid ten guineas for her that morning, find or not find her. I would not take twenty guineas for her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was in liquor when the men came and persuaded me to sell the mare; I was going to Smithfield in order to send her home by the Drovers.</p>

I went to the house of one Larkin, where they lived, in Drury-lane, and there found the prisoner in the cellar, with part of the goods in his pocket, and we found part under his bed betwixt that and the sacking; we found all the goods except two table-spoons and five teaspoons. We took the prisoner before the justice, he said there, he saw a man break open the shutter of my house, and he chucked the things into his apron, and bid him go about his business, and he never saw the man before in his life. I made a remark before the justice, that the glass of the window was bloody, the justice ordered us to look at the prisoner's hands, I found two scratches on them that seemed to be quite fresh done; the justice committed him to New-prison.</p>
               <p>Henry Green. I live at the White-hart-inn in Long-acre; I am constable; the prosecutor brought a warrant to me to search the house of Larkin; I went and met with the woman that the prisoner called his wife, she seemed to be startled, and said she did not belong to the house. I asked her where she lived? she said, in the cellar. I went down into it, there I found the prisoner; I searched his pockets, and found a large table-spoon. I took him to justice Fielding's, and found these spoons and salt-shovels by searching him there; he owned to the justice he was at the prosecutor's shop, and another man chucked the things into his apron; this he said was in St. Martin's-lane where the prosecutor lives. I went to his cellar again, there I found these other things, (producing them in the two parcels, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

            . I live with Mr. Tripp's father. The morning the shop was broke open, I went out, in order to have the things stopt, if I could meet with them. At one place I got information the prisoner's wife had offered a pair of tea-tongs to sale, and by that means I found the prisoner out. I went with the prosecutor and constable to the cellar where he lives; I saw him come out of the corner of the room. He strove to hide himself; I stopt him, and took out of his pocket a silver table-spoon, the prosecutor's property. They took him to the justice. I staid behind, and searched about for other things, and between the bed and bedding I found these other spoons tied up in a handkerchief. I carried them to justice Fielding, and as there were more spoons missing, the constable went again with me; we found no more, but by turning up the bed, found a saw and a gimblet. We asked the prisoner, before Mr. Fielding, how he came by the things? He said, as he was coming along to go to Charing-cross, a man chucked these things into his apron, and bid him be hush and say nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he held out his apron for that purpose?</p>

I went and took them, and ran away; but hearing them cry out, stop thief, I dropt the ducks, and a young man came and took them up, and carried them back to the shop, and another ran and took me, and they carried me before justice Withers, and I was admitted an evidence there.</p>

On a Saturday-night in March, to the best of my knowledge, it was three weeks ago last Saturday; she went to fetch my little girl from school, and did not return back again, and in that evening we missed the goods, then I suspected her. I went to seek for her and found her; I asked her if she had taken these things? she denied every thing, but desired she might go to her mother; I let her; there she owned to the taking of one shirt, and said she lent it to a soldier in Peter-street, Westminster, to put on to go to be reviewed, and it would be returned. She was sent to the watch-house, and the next morning before the justice she confessed to the taking another shirt and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with them?</p>
               <p>Clifford. She said she had pawned them; on the Monday morning she was had before the justice again, then she owned she had taken an apron and pawned that also, and since she has been in confinement her mother brought them all to me.</p>

            . I live in Newgate market; last Monday was three weeks the prisoner washed for us, and some time after my wife met with the prisoner's daughter, and took her to my house, she had one of my wife's aprons on, I believe it was hers, but she can give a better account.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Blizard. The prisoner has washed for me upwards of two years, and out of every washing I missed some linen; upon missing my linen I discharged several of my servants, and the prisoner would make great protestations, so I did not suspect her; the last time I washed I looked over my aprons, and after that I missed three; on the Tuesday following I met the prisoner's daughter with one of my aprons before her; I asked her whose apron it was? she, with many oaths, said, it was her own, and that she bought it. I took her home and charged a constable with her, and took her before Mr. alderman Ladbrook, she there said she bought it in Rag-fair for one shilling and six-pence, but could not tell of whom.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you'ever found the other aprons?</p>
               <p>E. Blizard. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive the apron you produce was in the wash at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Blizard. Yes it was, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner intrusted to wash it?</p>
               <p>E. Blizard. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it?</p>
               <p>E. Blizard. It is worth two shillings.</p>

She said her husband was pressed to go to sea, and she wanted to make up a little money, and had got two gowns to sell; we went into a little court in Chick-lane, there I looked at them, and bought them for eleven shillings; one I got Jacobs to sell, the other I wore myself, and wanting money to buy goods, I pawned that for four shillings. Since I have been in Newgate, a woman asked me what I came there for, and said was it not for two gowns? I knew her, when I came to see her face, by a mole, and I said I bought them of her; but she denied it. I should be glad if she might be sent for. I told it to all the people in the gaol, and they know her. (She is called down).</p>

               <p>Q. What was the prisoner in that house?</p>

After that the spoon and prisoner was brought to justice Fielding by the silversmith; I went there, and knew the spoon to be the property of my lord bishop. The justice asked the prisoner if he was guilty? He said he was. This answer he made twice over.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carman. I am a silversmith in Holborn; the prisoner at the bar brought a silver spoon to my house on Thursday the 29th of March last, it was broke in two pieces, (it is produced). This is it. I told him it could not be his, for the crest had been almost rubbed out. I said I would stop the spoon, and he should see it advertised the next day. I said I could not stop his person. I advertised in it about five or six days; a footman belonging to the bishop of Kildare came to me, and produced two spoons out of his pocket like it. At my first seeing it, I said it is your spoon. The next day the bishop's sister came, and a person with her; we talked about it; she desired me to go down to Gloucester-street to her house; the prisoner at the bar opened the door of the lady's house; I knew him immediately, and said that was the man that brought the spoon and offered it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before Mr. Fielding !</p>
               <p>Carman. I was, and heard the prisoner twice own before him that he took the spoon; after that the people said, why do you confess? why do you confess? Then he stisly denied it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>That evidence said he knew me by my person; but could not swear to my dress.</p>
               <p>Carman. I knew his person the moment I opened the door.</p>

               <p>Q. How were they marked?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. He marked them with a cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him mark them?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. I saw them after they were mark'd; then, on the 29th of March, I made an appointment with some friends to go out of town the next day. This I did in the prisoner's hearing. I got up the next morning, and I ordered Tompkins, my other servant, to go and dress himself, as if he was going out too. When he came down stairs, I ordered him to go and open the street-door, and shut it again, as if he had gone out; after that I did the same. I bid Tompkins go down into the cellar, and shut himself up in the vault there, and I went and concealed myself in the parlour behind the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this marked money at this time?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. It was then in my till in the shop. I had not been in the parlour a quarter of an hour before the prisoner came down stairs, and went into the cellar; presently after I saw him in the shop; he went behind the counter and drew out the till; I saw his hand in the till, and heard the halfpence jink. After that I saw him put his hand into his pocket twice; then he put the till in again, and was returning back. I rushed out of the parlour in order to take him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090008"/> but he was too nimble for me, and got down the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. What hole was that?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. It was a hole through which we shoot down the coals. Tomkins being below he got hold of the prisoner's legs, and held him till I came. I bid him examine his left-hand pocket, and there he would find some money; he then pulled out some marked halfpence and two sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the silver and halfpence all in one till.</p>
               <p>Nightingale. There were three or four partitions in the till to separate the halfpence, the silver, and the gold. After that I counted the halfpence and found he had taken thirteen-pence-halfpeny in marked halfpence; I charged him with taking the money out of my till, he owned he had, and also that he had been there before, but had not taken much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any sum?</p>
               <p>Nightingale. He said he had not taken above ten shillings in all.</p>

               <p>R. Raspins. I had them all at Christmas evening when she came into my house, and from that time to about three weeks before I was missing them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner at that house?</p>
               <p>R. Raspins. She was a chairwoman; and I wanted a person to wait on some lodgers, and I took her in till I could get a servant; when I suspected her about three weeks ago, I was wanting to get a search-warrant to search at a pawnbroker's; the pawnbroker heard of it, he came and owned he had such and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>R. Raspins. His name is Stringer. I went to his house; he shewed me the goods; I owned them. The prisoner was gone away, then her husband brought her and delivered her up to me, and I sent for a constable and charged her, and before justice St. Lawrance she confessed she took all the things.</p>

I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner used to pledge goods at our house; I suspected she had stolen some of them, so I went to the prosecutrix and told her what she had pledged with me, she came and owned the things mentioned. We took the prisoner before justice St. Lawrance, there she owned she took the things.</p>

               <p>I took the prosecutrix to be a mother to me, and she said to me I might make use of the goods when I wanted them; so I brought them back again. As I wanted money I took and pawned them.</p>

I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner brought this saw to me to pawn on the 1st of March, about eight o'clock in the morning; I stopped the saw, and the prosecutor came to inquire for it the same day, and I delivered it. Two days after, the prosecutor and others brought the prisoner to me to see if I knew him, I said he was the man that brought it. I suspected he was no carpenter by his dress.</p>

            . I am constable; on the 13th of March I was sent for to Mr. Mare's in St. Martin's-court, he gave me a search-warrant to search all the people's boxes that lodged in the house; when I came to search the prisoner's box, I found this parcel of things here produced. The prosecutrix said it was her bundle, and he was very much confused, nor can I tell what answers he made just then, he confessed before he went out of the room that he had taken the things, and he said the same before the justice; he had carried away the silk petticoat to another house, he said, at his being asked for it, he would fetch it, so I went with him into Market-lane, there we found it, and I brought it back.</p>

               <p>A woman was in my room with these things in her apron; she desired I would let her lay them down on my box, and she would come up to me soon again; she laid them down; I staid an hour and half, but she did not come; then I took and locked them up in my box, and left the key in it; this was about three weeks before they were missed.</p>

On the 13th of January last about six in the morning, the coach was stopt, the windows were both up, I was asleep at the time; the gentleman that sat next to me awaked me, and told me we were going to be robbed; soon after I heard something rap at the coach-window; immediately the gentleman that sat on that side let down the window. The person who stopt the coach demanded our money, watches, and purses; he had a pistol in his hand, but he did not put it into the coach.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he on horseback?</p>
               <p>Sterry. He was. The gentlemen gave him some money, and I gave him mine. There was a gentlewoman in the coach, but she did not give him any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he threaten you?</p>
               <p>Sterry. No, only demanded our money.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you give him?</p>
               <p>Sterry. Eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him it voluntarily, or from an apprehension of being shot by him, if you refused?</p>
               <p>Sterry. It was under that circumstance of fear that I delivered it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go off then?</p>
               <p>Sterry. He then demanded our watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him one?</p>
               <p>Sterry. No, I had one, but I did not give it him; after that he rode off.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the prisoner, do you know him?</p>
               <p>Sterry. I think I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think so? I observe at six in the morning, that morning, it was very dark.</p>
               <p>Sterry. It was a very starlight morning; I think it was not moonlight.</p>
               <p>Q. What cloaths had he on?</p>
               <p>Sterry. I think it was a brown surtout coat he had on, with the hood on his head.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to know him so as you do?</p>
               <p>Sterry. I don't choose to swear positively; I think he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his face covered.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090011"/>Sterry. No, it was not, the cape was flying from his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see the faces of the people in the coach with you?</p>
               <p>Sterry. We had the windows up all the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put his head into the coach?</p>
               <p>Sterry. No, he did not; I could see his face the plainer by his not putting his head into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. How did the man take the money?</p>
               <p>Sterry. I put it into the man's hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what colour his horse was?</p>
               <p>Sterry. I don't remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Which hand did he hold his hat with?</p>
               <p>Sterry. I think it was his right-hand.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What hand did he hold the pistol with?</p>
               <p>Sterry. He held it with his left-hand, pretty close to his side.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have lost the use of my left-hand these eight months.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the man since that time you was robbed ?</p>
               <p>Sterry. I saw the prisoner in Newgate, and the prisoners were called down, six or seven of them, the turnkey stood by me; I said I believed that was the man in the red coat. He desired me to look again; I said, if that is not the man, I can't tell which is the person. Then the turn-key told me his name was George; it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it you saw him in Newgate?</p>
               <p>Sterry. Last Wednesday morning.</p>

            . I am the coachman that drove the coach that day the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; do you know him?</p>
               <p>Turner. I can't say positively I do. I believe him to be the man that stopt the coach on the 13th of January, about six in the morning, and robbed the gentleman. I can swear to the horse the man rode upon; I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he stopt you?</p>
               <p>Turner. He said, coachman stop; how many passengers have you in the coach? I told him I had four. Then he knocked at the window, and said, passengers look sharp; your money, your purses. I heard the money chink in his hat; after that he rode off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him demand any thing after he had got the money ?</p>
               <p>Turner. I don't remember I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his face at that time?</p>
               <p>Turner. I could not very well, I sat so high on the box; it was a starlight morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the horse afterwards?</p>
               <p>Turner. I have; the man that owns him is at the door; I can swear to the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody did you see the horse since?</p>
               <p>Turner. I don't know his name; I saw him in a stable in Scroop's-court.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Which hand did the man hold his pistol in?</p>
               <p>Turner. I think he held it in his right-hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse is he?</p>
               <p>Turner. A large brown horse, with a star in his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed?</p>
               <p>Turner. He had a brown surtout coat on.</p>

            . I belong to St. John's college, Oxford; on the 13th of last January I was in the Birmingham coach with Mr. Sterry; about eight miles from London we met with a single highwayman.</p>
               <p>Q. to the coachman. Was it about that distance?</p>
               <p>Turner. It was; it was on this side Chevychase.</p>
               <p>Ellis. He demanded our money and watches. I could not distinguish enough of the man so as to know him again; I gave him fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there ever a pistol produced?</p>
               <p>Ellis. Yes, he held one in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put you in fear?</p>
               <p>Ellis. Yes, my lord, it was under that fear I gave him my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you distinguish his dress?</p>
               <p>Ellis. He had a brownish surtout coat on, with the hood of it pulled over his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it hide his face?</p>

               <p>Ellis. Not much; he seemed to be a dark brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any other mark on the horse?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090012"/>Ellis. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What after that ?</p>
               <p>Ellis. He muttered something and rode off.</p>

               <p>Ellis. I was a little surprised, and did not observe that.</p>

            . I live at High Wickham; to the best of my remembrance, the 13th of January I was coming along with a waggon, a man upon a large brown horse met me just going into Hanwell common.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Southwell.</p>
               <p>Weeden. Very near two miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning?</p>
               <p>Weeden. About five o'clock, or a quarter after. He asked me whether the coaches were gone by or not? I said I had not met them. Soon after the same man and horse came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this?</p>
               <p>Weeden. About five or six minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say them?</p>
               <p>Weeden. He said nothing, but past me.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress had he on?</p>
               <p>Weeden. A brown double-breasted great coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a moonlight night?</p>
               <p>Weeden. There was no moon at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the stars bright?</p>
               <p>Weeden. Not very bright.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after this?</p>
               <p>Weeden. Yes, I did; this third time was not above half a quarter of an hour after the second time; the coaches were gone along, and that man on the brown horse rode a good pace after them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many coaches were there?</p>
               <p>Weeden. There were three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after that?</p>
               <p>Weeden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come up with, or stop any of the coaches?</p>
               <p>Weeden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before you saw him here?</p>
               <p>Weeden. I saw him in Woodstreet-compter after this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body shew him to you?</p>
               <p>Weeden. No; I then thought he was as much like that man that rode that large brown horse, as any man could be.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen this brown horse since?</p>
               <p>Weeden. Yes I have, in a stable on Holborn-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that horse you saw on Holborn-hill is the same that man rode you speak of?</p>
               <p>Weeden. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any particular notice when you saw him on the road how he was marked ?</p>
               <p>Weeden. Yes, I did, the second time of seeing him I saw a little star in his forehead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He came to the Compter with five or six people with him, and a man that knew me, said, (pointing to me) that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body shew him to you?</p>
               <p>Weeden. The other men that was along with me knew him, and I thought he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. At whose house did you see the horse on Holborn-hill ?</p>
               <p>Weeden. I don't know his name, but he is at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of the man's voice?</p>
               <p>Weeden. No, I did not take any notice of the voice.</p>
               <p>

            . I know the prisoner very well, he lodged within four doors where I live, that is in Scroop's-court, St. Andrew's, Holborn; I keep a Stable-yard, I buy and sell horses, but very seldom left them out. I left the prisoner a horse on the 13th of January, he went out at half an hour after four o'clock in the morning, as the boy told me, he said he was going to a linen-draper at Stains, a relation, and must go very early before the people were gone out; this he said when he hired the horse, so I told him if he called my lad he might have him; I was not up when the boy let him have him; he said he must ride gently because he had a same arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a horse?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. A sort of a brown bay, a darkish bay horse, above fifteen hands high, a star in his forehead, and he has a large Spavin on one of his hocks, and goes lame on that leg. Mr. Turner, the coachman, came on the Sunday morning, the day the prisoner was taken; I told him that George had such a horse of me, and he should see him when he came home, the horse was then out. I afterwards shewed him to Turner; he said he was sure that was the horse the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090013"/> robbery was committed upon. The horse was taken out of the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Weeden see the horse?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. He might, but I was not at home; I left word with my wife to let any body see the horse, if they came. This was the first time he hired the horse of me, he had him out six days; he brought him back on the Saturday following; he paid me three shillings a day; I have let the horse to him twice since.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he hire him for the first time?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. He said he should want him only two days, and we agreed for three shillings a day. He was in town in the time without the horse, he told me my horse was safe at Stains, and he should go on Saturday morning and bring him home, which he did. The horse did not appear to have been hard rid when he brought him home.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for his leaving the horse in the country?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. He told me his cousin made him ride up in the coach with some valuable goods.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the second time he had the horse?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. It was the 23d of January; he went out in the afternoon, and he brought him on the Saturday morning after, about six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give any reason why he wanted him a second time?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. He said he wanted him to go to the Castle at Smallborough-green; he used to sell fruit, and I thought it was to carry some there.</p>
               <p>Q. What day had he him again ?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. It was on Shrove tuesday; then he said he wanted to see his father at Froom, and should want him ten or twelve days, and as he had used him well, I offered him at half a crown a day. He had him out in the afternoon, and kept him out eleven days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he went to Froom ?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. I dont know where he went.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition did he bring the horse home in?</p>
               <p>Peteridge. In a very poor condition, his back was hurt very much; he paid me twenty-five shillings and six-pence for the time he had him. I told him he had very much abused the horse; he said he never rode him above thirty miles a day.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Peteridge; I have known the prisoner about four months; the first time the prisoner had a horse of my master was on the 13th of January; he called me up at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning was it?</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. It was star-light, not very bright.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the Week?</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. On a Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he go out of the yard with the horse?</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. At almost half an hour after four.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did he say he was going?</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. He did not say any thing to me about that, my master had let the horse to him before.</p>
               <p>C. Describe this horse.</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. A large horse, dark bay, with a star in his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he out with the horse that time?</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. He left him at Stains, he said; I don't know when he brought him?</p>

               <p>Q. Had he him a second time?</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. He had and brought him home on a Sunday morning about six o'clock, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he him a third time?</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. He had, and at his return, the horse looked very poor, and his back had been hurt; he had been rode very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether any people came to look at the horse?</p>
               <p>Fishbourn. Yes, there were; Turner came to see him, and said that was the horse on which a robbery was committed, on the highway; so also did Weeden when he came to see him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>When I went from London that morning, I went out about five o'clock, and rode for Staines; when I came there I found my cousin in trouble; he desired me to come to London on business for him. I came up on the Wednesday-night, and left the horse there; and went down again, and brought the horse up on the Saturday. I am lame of my left-arm, and have no strength in it at all.</p>

Mr. Reynolds said he knew nothing of it, it might be so for what he knew; he asked how long it was ago? Powel said it was two years ago; Reynolds said he had sold fifty watches since that. I asked him to produce his books, saying, it might save some trouble, shewing him my search-warrant; but he refused shewing me his books, and took us up stairs, and said, we might search and welcome; he also shewed us in a Buroe several silver watches, and also he shewed us some below, but the prosecutor said none of them was his watch.

I went out to dinner on Christmas-day, the prisoner lodged in a ready-furnished room at two shillings a week in my house, I left my room-door locked, but when I home found it broke open, and several other locks; I left her at home, when I returned at about a quarter after ten at night she was gone, and all the things mentioned in the indictment. I found some again at the prisoner's lodging, and some at a pawnbroker's, by her directions, where she said she had pawned them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to be taken?</p>
               <p>Walter. She sent me a letter owning the fact, and after that came to my house, but I was so much affrighted I could not bear to see her, and bid her go out of the house; she did, and was not taken till last Wednesday. I was informed she was a patient at St. Bartholemew's hospital,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090017"/> there I took her. I took her before my Lord-mayor; I gave in a list of all the things I had lost, and she owned she had taken them all before my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the list read over to her?</p>
               <p>Walter. I gave it to some of the people, whether it was all read I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure all these goods were left in your house when you went out on Christmas-day ?</p>
               <p>Walter. I am sure the greatest part were, for aught I know she might have taken some away before.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them before?</p>
               <p>Walter. There were many of them in a trunk, and the trunk was broke open that day, part of them were in a chest in my room, and part of them locked in a chest of drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that chest of drawers was locked when you went out?</p>
               <p>Walter. Yes, I can; I always kept them locked whether I was abroad or at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other lodgers in your house?</p>

               <p>Walter. I had men-lodgers, but they were out then; there are three of them, two came in after I came home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the room you found the goods in an apartment in your house?</p>
               <p>Walter. No, it was in a lodging she went to after she left my house. She owned this letter she sent to me, and that she wrote it, and desired my Lord-mayor to read it through. (It was read to this purport:)</p>
               <p>'' Mrs. Walter,</p>
               <p>'' I think myself very wicked to use you in '' the manner I have, but had I been in my '' senses at that time I would have scorned to have '' acted such a thing by any body, much less to '' you; but I hope your goodness will bear me '' no ill, for I cannot enjoy one moment's peace '' till every thing is returned to you, and I think '' is my duty to let you know where they are '' pawned, it being out of my power to redeem '' them, that you may get them again; and as '' soon as I got a little money I will return yours '' first, and then to them. If you go to Mrs. '' Mullings's in Hare-court, you will find a pair '' of silver tea-tongs, three tea-spoons, a yellow '' stuff silk gown, another silk gown, the silk '' waistcoat and a cotton gown.'' Giving an account what they all lay for, and likewise where to find the rest of the goods; concluding she was heartily sorry for what she had done; and by way of postscript observed, poor Mr. Delerant is cast for life. Signed by her name, and directed to Mrs. Walters in White -horse-alley, Cow-cross, near West-smithfield, London.</p>

            . I live betwixt Aldersgate-street and Jewin-street, in a little square, the prisoner came to lodge in my house in the beginning of January last, and she brought a trunk and bundle with her. After she had been at my house nine days she went to an alehouse just by, and at her return there came in a man, and challenged her to be a thief; and when he went away, he said, he would go and get some help and take her up. When he was gone away she went and left her things behind. In about half an hour after she was gone away, Mrs. Walter came to my house and owned these goods here produced, (which were divers sorts of wearing apparel. )</p>
               <p>Catherine M'Lane. I live at the bottom of Cow-lane, near the prosecutrix; when the prisoner lodged at her house, I was in the court before the window. I saw a light in the prosecutor's room above stairs, about eight at night on Christmas-day; I called and asked if Mrs. Walter was at home, the prisoner came down with a candle in her hand to the door, and I observed there was no light in the room above, she answered me Mrs. Walter was gone out; she had been up stairs making her beds and doing her work. The next morning we had the account of Mrs. Walter's being robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you lock that room-door she speaks of above stairs at your going out.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, I double-locked it.</p>
               <p>(Mrs. Mullings produced a blue silk petticoat, a pair of silver tea-tongs, three silver tea-spoons, one yellow stuff silk gown, one India silk gown, one silk waistcoat, flowered, one cotton gown. )</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. I am a pawnbroker; my servant took these goods in, all but the tea-tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. I live at the corner of Hare-court in Aldersgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your maid?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mullings. She was brought to bed the day before yesterday.</p>

               <p>Lee. Some of them were found by two constables, and have been in the hands of one of them ever since. I advertised them at Goldsmith's hall, from whence notice is given to all the pawnbrokers and such places in four hours time, by distributing bills; after which, Mr. Welch the chief constable came and told me he believed he had found some of them. The prisoners were taken before the justice; but confessed nothing in my hearing.</p>

            . I live servant with Mr. Lee; on Wednesday the 12th of March, between six and seven in the evening, we lost these things mentioned out of the house; we advertised them directly, with two guineas reward upon the conviction of the person that stole them. On the Saturday morning Mr. Welch, with the other constables, and a file of musketers, came up Holborn where we live, and told me they thought they had found some of the goods we had advertised. I went with them to Mr. Welch's, there I saw these goods produced here. I made oath they were the property of Mr. Lee. My coat, and three other articles are not found; here are all the rest, (deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Q. What are these here produced worth?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. These stand Mr. Lee in upwards of seven pounds out of his pocket, and I would give any body fifteen shillings for my coat now, to sell again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I know West; on the 13th of March, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, he came in at the Bull-and-gate, Holborn, which is next door to Mr. Lee's house; he staid a minute or two, and went out again; and in about three minutes returned in again; then he staid I believe about half a minute, and turned out again.</p>
               <p>Q. In what room was this?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. It was in the kitchen; I was there with a country customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a servant in that house?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. He had a blue coat on, with a red collar; he looked bold in my face, which induced me to take notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. No, I never did; neither did I the other till he was taken up, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Cain. They are, and some we sold. We asked her if she would buy them? She said she did not rightly know how to get them out of the house to sell them again, if she bought them. After that, she asked us what we would have for them? We told her seven pounds. She said she would give us fifty shillings for them. We said we would not take it. Then she said, she would give fifty-five shillings, and no more; and as we did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090020"/> know where to carry them, we took her money. We had sold things to her before, when she lived in Brown's gardens, handkerchiefs, and what we could get; and she used to buy goods of other lads.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ask you how you came by these goods?</p>
               <p>Cain. She did not; she knew how we came by them, we told her where we got them.</p>

               <p>Q. Who opened the door to let you in?</p>
               <p>Cain. A woman that lives in the house.</p>

               <p>Cain. She was in the house, but not in the room at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Wright when you took the money?</p>
               <p>Cain. He looked at them after Peg had bid us fifty-five shillings, and said, she gave more than the value of the things, but we asked him no questions, nor he us.</p>

When we came to the house where Wright lives, part of these goods here we found in the yard, and part we found at the head of a bed, and a woman lying in the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. DID you see Wright?</p>
               <p>Flanergen. He was there; he said he had lent a shilling on the cloaths, or else he said his wife had, I am not certain which; that woman went for his wife we saw in bed. We did not go there upon the account of these goods, we had another information given us; we took the evidence Cain in the house, then he asked Mr. Welch if he could be admitted an evidence? and told Mr. Welch there was a bundle of cloaths thrown out at a window, and in such a room, near a bed, we should find the rest. We took Wright and West into custody, and brought them to Mr. Fielding. After that I took Pryer in St. Giles's, on the information of Cain; we knew, him to be frequently about St. Giles's; he would have made a discovery, if Mr. Fielding would have taken it; he told him if he could bring more to light than Cain, he would admit him; he examined him, and it came much to the same of what Cain had said.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was along with Mr. Welch and the last evidence at the taking Wright and West; it was a very disorderly house; Wright is a runner at Mr. Fielding's office to carry persons backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he lived in that house?</p>
               <p>Gee. I don't know; we had searched it once before.</p>

               <p>Q. How came the woman not to be taken up?</p>
               <p>Gee. She said she was so ill, she was not able to be removed.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you never an order to take her up?</p>
               <p>Gee. No; I heard Cain say she was by at the payment of the money, and that Wright paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Wright. How long have you known me? and whether you know any harm of me?</p>
               <p>Gee. I have known Wright three or four years; I never knew any harm of him.</p>
               <p>Flanergen answered the same to the same question; with this proviso, except keeping that house, which he said had a very bad character.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the parish to which Black-boy-alley belongs; about nine o'clock one evening I was standing at a little distance, and saw a cheese carried into Wright's house; I think it was West that had it, and there were two or three more along with him. I followed them, and saw the cheese delivered into the house, but was glad to get away. It is a very bad house; I went and told Mr. Welch of it. I went with him to search this house; we found these things there that are here produced. Wright was in his chamber; we brought him, West, and the goods away. I heard Mr. Welch ask Wright how these goods came there? He said he was in bed when his wife took them in, and said he did not know how they came there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he mean by the word wife?</p>
               <p>Martin. He meant that woman that was there in bed; he had cohabited with her some time; I have often seen them together; she went by his name.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Martin. I have known him, I believe about four months, ever since he came to that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the woman now?</p>
               <p>Martin. She is gone from that house, but she is seen about.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090023"/>Q. How came you not to take the woman?</p>
               <p>Martin. I can't tell that; I dare not watch since that; these are not a tenth part of what use the house; I have seen eight or ten come into the house together several times in the night; the character of the house is nothing but a den of thieves. I have been at the taking twenty-four people out of that alley, there was one then taken out of Wright's house, and then it was said another was let out at his back-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any sort of business carried on in that house?</p>
               <p>Martin. No other than things that are stolen, carried out and sold.</p>
               <p>Q. from Wright. What makes you think it is my house?</p>
               <p>Martin. Because I have heard Wright acknowledge he was master of it; when I took the woman out of the house he then had the impudence to tell me, he would beat my jolly head about the first time he met me in the streets.</p>
               <p>West and Pryer said nothing in their defence.</p>
               <p>Wright. I have been at the woman's house a great many times, but never to live with her.</p>

            . I was going by Farrel's door to buy a pair of old shoes about a week before St. Patrick's day, there came two sailors there, one a little man, and the other a big one, with some stockings to sell; Mrs. Farrel would not buy them. She asked the boys how they came by them? they said they were sailors; another woman that was there bid them twenty-two shillings and three-pence for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner West one of them?</p>
               <p>M. Gready. I can't say whether he was or not?</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of stockings had they to sell?</p>
               <p>M. Gready. They had fourteen pair, as I think, Mrs. Farrel did not pay the money, that I can declare upon oath, but I have no knowledge of Mrs. Farrel neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what day this was?</p>
               <p>M. Gready. I know St. Patrick's day, because we keep that in my country; it was a little before that day.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day?</p>
               <p>M. Gready. It was before twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Noon or night?</p>
               <p>M. Gready. It was in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the two boys if you was to see them?</p>
               <p>M. Gready. I believe I could give a guess at the woman that paid the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the evidence Cain; was he one of the boys?</p>
               <p>M. Gready. Indeed I can't tell; I think to the best of my knowledge he is one of them. Indeed Mrs. Farrel never bought or paid for them. I bought a pair of old shoes and paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>M. Gready. I live in White-friars; my husband is a taylor, he works for Mr. Pearson in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cain. Was any body by when you sold the stockings?</p>
               <p>Cain. There were two women in the cellar, but I never saw this evidence with my eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a woman cheapening a pair of old shoes?</p>
               <p>Cain. No, there was not. There was a woman cheapening some cloth to make up some old shirts; but she went out of the cellar before we opened the stockings. The other woman that was there lent Mrs. Farrel some money to pay for the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman cheapen or talk with you about the stockings?</p>
               <p>Cain. No, she did not; it was the prisoner only that bought and paid for them.</p>

               <p>Mazarene. I am; here are some very particular ones. (He produced a pair made of white leather, with wooden heels; and a pair of red slippers, with the names of the gentlemen in them, wrote by his own hand, they were made for. He produced another pair, which the prisoner told him he had sold a fellow pair to them in Holborn). The prisoner confessed he sold four pair of them in Rosemary-lane.</p>

            . On Monday morning, the 3d of March, the prisoner brought a pair of second-hand pumps to me to sell; (I live in Field-lane). He asked me three shillings; I bid him half a crown; he agreed to take my money. While I was paying him the money, an old gentleman came to me, and told me Mr. Mazarene's shop was broke open on the Saturday before; and bid me, if any body came with such and such shoes, to stop them. I said I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at the time?</p>
               <p>Murray. He was. After he was gone, I asked the prisoner if he had any more shoes to dispose of? He said yes, he had six or seven dozen. Then I suspected these to be a pair of Mr. Mazarene's. I kept him in talk, and told him I would go with him and buy them all. He said it was a great way to go; I said I did not mind that. Then we went together. He took me to Phoenix-street, Spital-fields; there in his room lay the shoes, covered over with some calfskins. I looked at them pair by pair, and told over six dozen; he told me he would have five shillings a pair for them. I said I dealt in nothing but second-hand goods, and could not afford so much money; but said I would give him two shillings a pair; he agreed to take my money. I told him, if he would bring them at such a time of night, I would pay him the money. Then I went away, and found out Mr. Mazarene, and told him about the shoes. We went to Sir

He said he found them in Bishopsgate-street upon a bulk. Sir Samuel said, he did not think he had strength to carry them all at once. He said no; he carried a part of them, and pushed the others up in a corner, and then went and fetched them.</p>

He told me his name; and I having known him nine years, went to Newgate<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090026"/> to see him. I asked him how many pair of shoes he had taken out of Mr. Mazarene's shop? He told me seven dozen. I taxed him with the burglary; but he made no discovery of that; neither did he say he had any assistant to help carry the shoes. He said he had sold one pair to Murray, and had bargained with him for the rest at two shillings a pair, and blamed him for discovering it.</p>

               <p>Woodcock. They were well worth two shillings a pair at the best hand. I was informed about a fortnight ago there was a boy in Clerkenwel-bridewel that impeached, that he, with others, had robbed me.

               <p>Q. How old is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Duncastle. He is about nineteen; I never had any dealings with him till about six weeks ago, last Saturday, when he and I were going down Fleet-street together he said there was a chance to get a pair of stockings at Mr. Woodcock's shop, he bid me go and pull, I went into the shop and pulled, and down came all the sixteen pair; I gave them to him at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you pull them from?</p>
               <p>Duncastle. From off a shelf; we carried them first to a shop in Field-lane, and left them, and when we came back again to them, the man of the shop said there were but nine pair; we sold one pair to a sailor, another pair the prisoner pawned, and we put each of us a pair on, and sold the rest, being five pair, all together in Chick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is this person in Field-lane, where you say you lost them?</p>
               <p>Duncastle. His name is Kenter; there is no sign; he buys stolen handkerchiefs; I used to lodge there.</p>
               <p>C. Look at these pair of stockings, (those taken from off the prisoner's legs.)</p>
               <p>Duncastle. I believe they are the same the prison er wore, they are the same colour of those he had.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the person's name that you sold the five pair to?</p>
               <p>Duncastle. I can't tell the woman's name?</p>
               <p>Q. What did you get for them?</p>

               <p>I was at play with that evidence one Saturday-morning in the market, about two months ago; I was a stranger to him; we walked about all day together; when night came on he asked me to go to see my sister? I said she lived towards Temple-bar; and said if she gave me any money I would lend him some. I missed him between there and Shoe-lane. I heard him halloo out; I ran up Poppins-alley and followed him, he had got a parcel in a white paper, I thought he had found it; I called halves, he ran and said I should have none; he went to the house he mentions and threw them under a table, and came out again, and I asked him what they were? he told me they were stockings, and said he was a stocking-weaver by trade, and he knew them better than I did. I had been sick for three weeks, and my mother went to Rag-fair and bought me these stockings that are here.</p>

            . On the 12th of March I was in a barber's shop opposite Mr. Russel's; I saw the prisoner take the piece of salmon out of the tray, as he was standing by the side of the door; he observed somebody take notice of him, I believe, he laid it down again, this he did once or twice, and, I think, the third time; he took it up, and put it under his arm and made off with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there nobody in the shop?</p>
               <p>Tompson. There were the two apprentices in the shop at the same time, but he was at the side of the door that they might not see him take it; the prisoner went up a passage, where was no thoroughfare, that belongs to a tavern where I am waiter, I followed him, he then had got a bag on his knee seemingly going to open it with an intent to put the salmon in it. I asked him what he was going to do with the salmon? he said, a gentleman in that house had sent him to a fishmonger's for some salmon for him to look at it; I said, we had no mankind in our house then, and you shall go back to the gentleman of the shop where you took it. I brought him to the prosecutor and left him to do as he thought proper with him.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Was I sensible so as to know what I did?</p>
               <p>Tompson. He was in liquor seemingly very much, he reeled about and said, I might take the salmon and do what I thought proper with it. Mr. Russel sent for a constable, who took him before Mr. alderman Alexander, and he sent him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was just come out of the London-infirmary, and had met with a friend, and he gave me some liquor, and I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Tompson. He said the same as he does here, that he was in liquor, and did not know any thing that he did, and said he was very sorry for what had happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you imagine a man that took up the salmon twice, and laid it down again, as you have mentioned, acted as one drunk?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I thought when I first saw him take it up, he did it with an intent to steal it, but when we were going to the Mansion-house I thought him very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be fuddled when he first charged him?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I did not think he did then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak like a man in liquor when he said he was sent by a gentleman to fetch the salmon?</p>
               <p>Tompson. No, he did not at that time; Mr. Russel asked him, when I took him to his shop, how he came to be so bad a fellow? he said he was going to carry it to the tavern to shew it to a gentleman; this he said several times over.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first begin to think him fuddled ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I did not till the constable asked him what he had got in his bag? and he answered, some of his working-tools; the constable looked at them; then he said to him, you, or somebody else, have wronged me of some of my working-tools; and when the constable said he should go before my Lord-Mayor, then he seemed very much fuddled.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he was fuddled ?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I do believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you imagine that to be fuddled will lay a man open to steal?</p>
               <p>Tompson. I imagine an honest man will not steal when he is fuddled. When we went before Mr. alderman Alexander, I asked him if he was in the same mind then as he was over-night, when he said somebody had meddled with his tools? he said he had not lost any, neither did he charge any body with meddling with them as he knew of.</p>

               <p>Mary Andrews. On the 17th of March, between seven and eight o'clock, I locked my room door below, and went up stairs, and left the outward door upon the latch. I came down within about a quarter of an hour, and found the street door open, and the lock of the kitchen-door broke, and that open, and I missed a box of linen and cloaths, a petticoat, and a flowered linen gown, which hung up over the box; these were all in the room when I went out of it. I told the case to an acquaintance that had been robbed, he said he would apply to a man that should see to take the thief; and next day the two prisoners were taken, and some of the things I lost were found upon them. I went before the justice, there I saw the two prisoners, and Watts the evidence.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is Tom. Smith ?</p>
               <p>Watts. That is the prisoner's right name; they call him Metcalp. He said he wanted money, and he would get some that night; and he would break that door open, and desired me to be concerned with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pitch upon that house?</p>
               <p>Watts. We had seen the woman and her husband by looking through the key-hole, and we thought the man was upon going out. After a little time he came out, and she went up stairs; then we went in, and I broke the inward door open with my foot; the street-door was left upon the latch. We took out a boxful of linen, and several things; there was a capuchin, a silk hood, a table-cloth, and child-bed linen.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Are any of the things you found here?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Here is a fustian frock, a red cloak, a gauze handkerchief, a pair of shoes, a petticoat, (producing them.) We did not mention all the things in the indictment that we lost.</p>

               <p>Watts. He said, if she would not go directly, he would by force of arms with a stick break her neck. She went, and returned with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you send her to?</p>
               <p>Watts. She said she sold them some to Dockery, some to Bray, some to Madams, and some to one Peacock, in George-yard; some in Whitechapel, and some in George-street. She said she had had a hard task to get them off, and hoped she should never have such a piece of work to do for any body again.</p>

               <p>Watts. As a bedfellow, no otherwise.</p>

               <p>Watts. None, only going to sell things; sometimes sparts, and other things.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did she bring you for the things she sold?</p>
               <p>Watts. She brought six shillings on the frock, six on the petticoat, two on the cloke, and several sums of money for the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived at that house?</p>
               <p>Watts. We had lived there a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Lacy any connection with the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Watts. No, none at all; he said if she would go and sell the things, he would give her two shillings for doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did she bring in the whole?</p>
               <p>Watts. She brought about fifteen shillings; she never went on such an errand before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give her the two shillings?</p>
               <p>Watts. No, she gave it him again.</p>

               <p>Q. How came she to go to them so readily ?</p>
               <p>Watts. By sometimes carrying to pawn a shirt of mine, or a shift of her own, and fetching them out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did she give the money to?</p>
               <p>Watts. She gave Metcalp the whole.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to be taken up?</p>
               <p>Watts. I was taken up at Rag-fair, and carried before Sir

            , and the two prisoners were brought there; one of them was taken up at a lodging-house at the bottom of Rag-fair, and the other at the Fountain; and when Metcalp was in the office, he swore bitterly because he did not make his information before I made mine, because he was taken up the over-night and did not own it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was taken up first?</p>
               <p>Watts. He was, but he was let go again, because he did not own it; and when I was in New-prison, he used to send me many letters, praying of me to be as favourable as I could to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are those letters ?</p>
               <p>Watts. I have not them I used to write on the back of them, and send them back again, and desire him not to send any more.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say before the justice ?</p>
               <p>Watts. He denied it all there.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she hired to him?</p>
               <p>Watts. He made her take a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say she gave it him back?</p>
               <p>Watts. She did, but he made her take one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you call this a hired servant ?</p>
               <p>Watts. He told her at first he would give her two shillings; but afterwards he gave her but one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take it?</p>
               <p>Watts. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get your living?</p>
               <p>Watts. I draw patterns for the silk-weavers, and have this nine years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was tried for taking a gentleman's hat from off his head.</p>
               <p>Watts. I was only arraigned for it, but I never did it; Metcalp has been tried before.</p>
               <p>Q. from Lacy. Did I take any of the things?</p>
               <p>Watts. No, she was only at the door when we took them, we were going by.</p>
               <p>Q. What all three of you?</p>
               <p>Watts. Yes, all three together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she stay at the door while you went in?</p>
               <p>Watts. She did? but she did not assist.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see you bring them out?</p>
               <p>Watts. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she, after that, go along with you home?</p>

               <p>Watts. She heard him bid me do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she endeavour to dissuade you from it?</p>
               <p>Watts. Yes; she begged of me, and fell down on her knees at the door, and prayed I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you make her ?</p>
               <p>Watts. I bid her hold her tongue, and said I would do it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to do it?</p>
               <p>Watts. Because Metcalp persuaded me to it, and gave me liquor; he was hardened in it.</p>

Lacy did not own she had any hand in the robbery there; but when we were going along with her to Clerkenwell-bridewell, she said she could make a greater discovery than the others. I said, let us go and find the things first. We went to the several pawnbrokers; she went in first, and asked for the things that she had pawned, and we found several things, which the prosecutrix owned, and are here produced.

               <p>On a Saturday Watts met me in Rag-fair, I had not been well, I had no victuals, and was going to pawn a new shirt. He said, come along with me; he gave me a halfpenny, I bought a halfpenny-worth of pudding, and went with him home. He gave me some bread and butter, and I lay with him that night. He asked me the next day to go along with him to a cousin's house; I did, and on Monday we went out together. I came home; this woman and her mother were sitting by the fire; she had a child in her arms; she asked where Watts was? The mother said, he was gone to a cousin's to move some goods. Lacy desired me to go with her to meet him. We went, and met him with some things on his head. Under a door were more things, he put them into her apron, and she and I came home. We had not been at home along, before he came in with a box on his head, and hit Lacy a blow because she would not go and pawn them.</p>

            . I had occasion to land at Black-friars on Monday the 17th of March about eight at night, there lay a wherry and some sacks in it marked Truss; I knowing the sacks to be Mr. Truss's property, I suspected them to have been stolen; I made it my business to inquire who owned the boat, no body would own it; I found the sacks had malt in them, as full as commonly sacks are. I went to Queenhithe and found Mr. Truss, and had ordered the boat to be brought there, he came down with a lanthorn and looked at the sacks and owned them, but said he did not know any thing of the malt; I found the owner of the boat when I had got her to Queenhithe, the person that lets the boat out, told me the man who hired the boat of him, was standing amongst the other watermen at Black-friars, when I inquired whose boat it was, when none of them would own the boat, the malt was put into a warehouse till farther inquiry could be made. In a day or two after we found the man that worked the boat, who declared the prisoner at the bar was one of the men that hired him to take the malt out of Mr. Truss's barge to carry it to black-friars.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when you landed at Black-friars?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing in your boat when you went there?</p>
               <p>Sherret.

               <p>Truss. No, he did not, but he came up with another; I had two barges up.</p>
               <p>Q. How much malt was in that barge?</p>

               <p>Pardoe. He lives in Great-russel-street, Bloomsbury; these things were carried to the inn in order to go down into Wales. I set them down at the warehouse-door and went to look for the book-keeper; when I returned, the box was gone; I advertised the box on the Monday following, and on the Tuesday the prisoner was brought to the Yorkshire grey in Bloomsbury-market<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090033"/> by Mr. Bunn, a pawnbroker; I was sent for there, there was the piece of silk and gown produced; I asked the prisoner how he came by them? he said he bought them in Covent-garden-market for sixteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear they are the same ?</p>
               <p>Pardoe. I can't be positive, but our housekeeper is here, she can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them put into the box?</p>
               <p>Pardoe. I put in the seeds myself, and saw her put in the gown and silk, and I nailed and corded the box up. I went to Mr. Welch the high constable, he came and took the prisoner into custody, and carried him before justice Fielding, there he said before the justice he bought them in Covent garden; the justice asked him if any body saw him buy them? he said, no.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say who took the goods away?</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Houndsditch; on the 20th of January a Jew woman in our neighbourhood, that I knew brought me thirteen yards of blue Persian silk, and this blue tabby gown unmade, to pawn. I lent her a guinea on them; and about two hours after, I was reading the Daily Advertiser, and I saw an advertisement of a box, and some garden-seeds, and a gown, and thirteen yards of blue silk, lost from the George on Snow-hill; then I suspected this gown and silk to be the same. I sent for the woman that brought them; she said she had them of the prisoner's sister, then I sent for the prisoner, (he is a Jew, and lives in Houndsditch;) he came, and said he gave it to his sister, in order for her to pawn it, to make some money.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody has it been since?</p>
               <p>Bunn. It has been in mine ever since. ( The gown and thirteen yards of silk produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. to M. Dobson. Look at them, do you know them?</p>
               <p>M. Dobson. These are the same I saw before the justice; the gown I am certain to, and the other is the same both in quality and quantity.</p>
               <p>Bunn. I took the prisoner to the Yorkshire-grey, there he said he could not produce the person he bought the things of; but said he had an apron on, like a porter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the prisoner deal in buying and selling old cloaths?</p>
               <p>Bunn. Yes, I believe he does; I know him no farther than by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go with you freely and voluntarily to the Yorkshire-grey?</p>
               <p>Bunn. He did.</p>

               <p>I am intirely innocent of what is laid against me; I am a young man that gets my living by buying and selling of cloaths; coming along, I call'd out, old cloaths! A man gave me a call; he took the gown from under his arm, and I bought them of him. He was a little higher than I am, and had on a brown coat.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175504090034"/>E. Goburn. It was on a Monday, about eleven weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see it?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I deal for China; a man offered it me to sell coming up Half-moon street by the church in Covent-garden; he had it in the lining wrapt up.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the man dressed?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. He had a brown coat, with a cape to it. He asked me if I would buy a gown ? I said I would if I could. I looked at it; I said there was not a gown, there was but six breadths. He asked me a guinea; I offered him twelve shillings, after that thirteen; I thought I could not afford any more; I left him, and the prisoner came from towards Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually buy things in the street?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. Yes, we frequently do. I looked back to see if the man would call me, and I saw the prisoner with the man, with the gown in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What size man was he that offered it to you?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. He was a little higher than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an apron on?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I did not mind that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I live in Woolpack-alley, in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I have known him some time; I never knew him for any ill.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be in Covent-garden at that time ?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I buy my china at the corner of Grocer's-alley, of Mr. Wood, and I had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner buy the gown?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I saw him put his hand into his pocket, and saw him wrap the gown in his handkerchief afterwards; but I would not take a false oath for a thousand or ten thousand guineas, I can't say what he gave for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after this?</p>
               <p>E. Goburn. I met him on the Monday night in Rosemary-lane. I said I hope you have got a bargain, though you did buy it out of my hands. He said he had not sold it yet; and on the Wednesday I met his mother, and she said to me, you need not grudge my child it, for if I had bought it, I might have been where he is.</p>

            , Esq; We had had the distemper amongst the horned cattle, and I being in the commission of the land-tax, on the 24th of March last I saw some cattle driving along in a lane. I took my horse and rode to them to know where they were going, there was the prisoner and another man; the prisoner told me they had left their certificate behind them; I said, where? they said, at Edgware; I said, I must know how you came by them; finding he began to hesitate, I said, you stole them; then the prisoner jumped over a five-bar-gate and away he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. What cattle were there?</p>
               <p>Burgoine. There were three heifers and a black mare; I jumped my horse over the ditch and rode after him, he fell into a ditch and was intangled with the briars; I took him by the collar and said, I would rip him up if he did not surrender, he surrendered; I took his handkerchief from his neck and tied his hands behind him, and brought him to the other person, whose name was Lloyd, the prisoner then declared Lloyd was innocent. I mounted the prisoner on the horse and brought him down to Edgware, and then charged him with stealing the mare, he owned he stole her and the three beasts, and that he had hired Lloyd for certain wages to go with him and help to drive the cattle; he told me also what part of the Chase he stole them from, which was by Winchmore-hill, near where the men hang in chains; the mare was with foal.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was the mare you lost with foal ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She was forward with foal.</p>
               <p>Burgoine. The prisoner owned to me he had borrowed a bridle and saddle of a person in London; I asked him whose mare it was? he said he could not tell; that he catched the mare and put the bridle and saddle on her between seven and eight o'clock on the Sunday-night; that they had passed the cattle to go to the mare, and then they brought the mare up to the cattle, and he said these are my three beasts; he was taken before the justice and there confessed the whole and signed it, this is it (producing it) I heard it read to him before he signed it; he signed it voluntarily and free.</p>

               <p>Burgoine. Quite reasonable. When he came to the constable's house, he would not eat; he said he had eat his last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at first own he had stole the mare ?</p>

               <p>Q. Did he own it at first ?</p>
               <p>Readwood. At first he said little or nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be under any condition of insensibility at all?</p>
               <p>Readwood. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I am very innocent of it; the young man that was along with me came to me on the Friday in the afternoon, the 24th of March, where I work, and begged of me to let him have a little money, saying he was starving. I told him I had got none. He wanted me to borrow some of my master; I said no, I could not, I owed him some, and wanted to pay him. He said he had been out of place a great while; he told me he had got some heifers at Enfield-chase, and a mare, and desired I would go along with him, and he would pay me the rest of the money he had borrowed of me before; he would sell them, and put himself into service, saying he could have a very good place in Cheapside if he had but some cloaths, for he was not fit for service without; and he went that afternoon to Smithfield, to know what fair there was in the country; he came and told me there was some fair in the country about forty miles off. I went to a chandler's shop, there we had a three-penny loaf, and half a pound of cheese; he said he had no saddle, and desired me to borrow him one, and told me where to call upon him. I did, and we went to Enfield-chase; he bid me go to the sign of the Black-bull, a public-house, and get a pint of beer, and he would go and call upon his friend that kept the cattle for him; he went and returned in about an hour.</p>

            ; before she had eat it, in came the two Duffeys, Jordan, and Malone. They went into the tap-room to Farrel; after they had been there together two hours, I wanted to go and see the prisoners, then Farrel sat at the end of the table, with a yellow bed-gown on, the same that Golden came in with, and Golden had her gown on, and Farrel had a hat and cloak tied over her eyes; it began to grow late, and my master ordered me to lock up; then I called out, as usual, All strangers! I opened the gate, and out went the three men, and Farrel; Jordan was much in liquor, he followed Farrel, and gave her a shove; I went to push her back, turned them all together, secured them all, and locked them in again. Farrel's face was hid, I could see no more of it than if she had a sack about her head, she had a handkerchief about her mouth.</p>

               <p>Farrel told me Mrs. Pentelow found fault with her in going so dirty, so I took her gown to carry it home to wash it, and she put mine on the while.</p>
