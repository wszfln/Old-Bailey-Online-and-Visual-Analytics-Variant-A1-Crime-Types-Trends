I saw the prisoner there, and he moved the tankard to where he sat, and put it on the seat behind him; he moved from one box to another; he asked what it was o'clock, being told, he said it was time for him to go. I wish you a good night, and was going away with this tankard. I said, my friend, leave the tankard behind you, and laid hold of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How had he the tankard?</p>
               <p>Kelley. He had it under his coat, and was got to the door; there are two doors. I laid hold of him in the first door way, that door stood open. Mrs. Wilson took the tankard out of his hand.</p>

When we had talked together a little, he asked me to drink. I drank out of the same tankard. Then I put my beer into the tankard, they went away, and left me a little beer in it. I called for a pennyworth more, and had it in the same tankard. When I was going away, I saw some ragged men set just by the fire place; I took the tankard in order to put it safe; when I was near the door, I thought I saw a man that I knew; I just took hold of the door to see whether I knew him or not.

I shew'd her some: after we had agreed for one, she made a frivolous excuse to go out, and asked for a bit of foul paper. I missing a parcel of handkerchiefs, went out after her, and took her with the handkerchiefs mentioned in the indictment upon her, (produced in court, and deposed to as his master's property) here are our private mark upon them. She left a half guinea on the counter to be changed, and the other woman was to have taken the change, but upon my going out after the prisoner, that other woman made off.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she cheapened a handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Risby. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she also leave a bundle on the counter?</p>
               <p>Risby. There was a bundle left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into that bundle?</p>
               <p>Risby. No, I did not, the constable did, but he has business else-where, and is not here. There was some dirty shirts in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a child with her?</p>
               <p>Risby. She had one in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that piece of handkerchiefs be taken up by mistake with the child?</p>
               <p>Risby. No, because she begged I would not hang her, and said it was the first time that ever she was guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the shirts she left?</p>
               <p>Risby. I know not the value of them, they were old and of little value.</p>

             brought the prisoner into my master's shop; his name is Johnson, who lives just by him. He desired I would take notice of what was in her apron; I saw him take out of it a dozen of silk handkerchiefs. He desired me to fetch a constable; I did, she fell on her knees, and desir'd he would not prosecute her for the sake of her children; after that she was taken before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went into that shop to buy a silk handkerchief; I bargained for one for 3 s. 6 d. I had my child in my arms; I laid it on the counter to give it the breast; laid down half a guinea; I found my child had fouled itself; I swept its things up together, and went out to clean it; he came and taped me on my shoulder, and said I had got something of his; I said if I had, it was more than I knew, if I had had a Mind to have defrauded him, I should not have left the half guinea; I intended as soon as I had cleaned my child to return again for my change; my shirts that I had left there, were worth about 30 s. at 3 s. 6 d. each. I am downright innocent before God and the world; I had no woman with me in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Risby. How many shirts where there in her bundle?</p>
               <p>Risby. I do not know, the woman that came in with the prisoner, was to have taken the change of the half guinea, and was to take care of the shirts, but upon my going out after the prisoner, she went off immediately.</p>

               <p>William More. On the 30th of April last I lost a guinea and a shilling out of my box, upon inquiry I found the prisoner had changed a guinea in Hedge-lane. I went to the woman named Nugent, she said it was a little man that brought it and she should know him again. I took up the prisoner having a suspicion of him, and he confessed that he took the guinea out of my box.</p>

               <p>Edwards. He asked me to go to a society or club; and there he pulled out these things from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he came by them?</p>

               <p>Q. Where is that house you speak of?</p>
               <p>Wallis. It is by the Galleons, almost opposite Woolwich : I had met with a man that belongs to the sign of the plough, and bought a lamb of him; I was pretty much in liquor before, and drinking there, I was pretty much intoxicated in liquor, and fell into a ditch, and was almost suffocated, and could not get out. I said, for God's sake, so many people standing by, and nobody help me! I had struggled and swallowed a great deal of filth and stuff; I was helped out then; I clapt my hand to my pocket, and found my watch was there; I had drank myself insensible; but being in the water brought me to my senses; I heard a voice which I knew to be the prisoner's; I called out

            ; he answered me; I said do pray see me home some how, or other; I can tell no further of that, whether he was the man that robbed me or not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss your watch?</p>
               <p>Wallis. I missed it some little time after that, as he was leading me home; then I said where is my watch? I will not go home without my watch. Some time after I went to ask the prisoner, in a private way, at an alehouse, if he knew any thing of it, saying I was robbed of it at such a time; and if he would help me to it, I would give him a guinea for his trouble; if the prisoner at the bar denies it, then I am wrong; there he stands.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you lost it?</p>
               <p>Wallis. This was two or three-days after; I being a poor man did not give myself the trouble to make a strict enquiry after it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Wallis. He asked me if I knew the name and number of it; he is there to answer to the thing; I said I believe she had no number; and as to the name, I believed I had that at home, but could not be positive; he desired me to go and find it, and leave word with his wife; I went and looked, but could not find it. I went and told his wife, I could neither find name nor number.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner and you alone together?</p>
               <p>Wallis. There was nobody in company with me but a young single lamb.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner see you home?</p>
               <p>Wallis. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he part with you?</p>
               <p>Wallis. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you lost your watch, while he was in your company?</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain after the man had helped you out of the ditch that you had your watch?</p>
               <p>Wallis. After I came out of the ditch I felt in my fob, and found my watch was there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had drank yourself insensible, how came you to have your understanding so soon?</p>
               <p>Wallis. It brought me almost to my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Wallis. It was between the hours of seven and eight in the evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Boswell. We were at the Three Goats Heads in White Chapel; upon seeing a croud of people, we went to see what was the matter; when we came there, we found the prosecutor was just pulled out of the ditch; he was on the edge of the bank; we set him on his legs, and he fell down again; he was so black with the mud and filth of the ditch, that nobody knew him; I knew him by his tongue, and he knew Latter's tongue.

               <p>Q. Were there any other people there besides you?</p>
               <p>Boswell. There were several others. As he was leading him along Montague-street, he was very desirous of my taking him by the other hand; a tall man had hold of it then; I then took hold of that hand, and Latter and I led him along. Going along, Latter shoved him up against the pales, stood before him, and catched hold of his watch-string; then I let go my hold, and wiped my hand on a post to clean it; then Latter let go and wiped his hand with his handkerchief, I thought he was going to give me his handkerchief. Holding his hand out, he put two seals and a watch-key into my hand; I throwed them into the kennel directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do that for?</p>
               <p>Boswell. Because I did not like to be concerned in any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Boswell. This was in Montague-street, then I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the seals and key afterwards?</p>
               <p>Boswell. I never went to look for them afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of seals were they?</p>
               <p>Boswell. I know there was a white one, and a yellow one. Presently the prisoner came to me (as I was going away) with a watch in his hand. Breebrook said, Jack has certainly robbed that man. Latter held the watch behind to give it to me unknown to Breebrook.</p>
               <p>Q. What a watch was it?</p>
               <p>Boswell. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of the people here that were leading him along, or attending him.</p>
               <p>Boswell. Yes: there are three or four of them I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for slinging the seals and key away?</p>
               <p>Boswell. I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing at that time towards stopping the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Boswell. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch then?</p>
               <p>Boswell. No, at that time I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the string?</p>
               <p>Boswell. The seals and key were on an old black ribbon; the ribbon broke, I suppose, in pulling the watch out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner and you any acquaintance together before that?</p>
               <p>Boswell. I have been with him often to do business.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Boswell. He is an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never cause him to be taken up on any warrant?</p>
               <p>Boswell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever declare to any person, that if he would pay your expences which you had been at, you would not appear against him?</p>
               <p>Boswell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Haywood?</p>
               <p>Boswell. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with him about Monday last?</p>
               <p>Boswell. I know no such man; it may be I may know him if I see him: I had some conversation with a man on Monday and Sunday too; they offered me something if I would go into the country, and keep out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Who offered that?</p>
               <p>Boswell. Mr. Ambler did; he desired me to meet him at Clay-Hall by Bow.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer you?</p>
               <p>Boswell. He offered to pay me all the expences that I had been at; and desired to know what I would say, and whether I would say any more than I did before justice Fielding; and said if I said no more, they would give me two or three guineas to go into the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the hearing of this?</p>
               <p>Boswell. One Wilson was there; but they took me aside when they talked with me about this; he desired me to meet him on the next day, which was the Monday, they put me into the gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What for?</p>
               <p>Boswell. For a quarrel, which was about this time twelve months, which happened at skittles; they gave that man that I quarrelled with a crown to put me in the gatehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation on the Monday evening with any body else?</p>
               <p>Boswell. No, I had with none but Mr. Ambler.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. The watch was lost on the 30th of March; whether or no I and you and others were not in company together at the Bull<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100011"/> in Spittlefields market since that?</p>
               <p>Boswell. Yes, we were.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Boswell. He was taken up last Sunday was se'nnight.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to conceal it so long?</p>
               <p>Boswell. Because I was afraid of being put in gaol; so I shall now when I go from here, I don't doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to fear that?</p>
               <p>Boswell. Because if any body disobliges him, he will go to his usurer and get their notes, and then put them in gaol.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether you was not in company with the prosecutor and me on the 7th of April.</p>
               <p>Boswell. I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been in company with the prisoner since the watch was lost?</p>
               <p>Boswell. Six or seven times, or more; I can't pretend to say how many times.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take courage to discover this matter?</p>
               <p>Boswell. I did it because I would not swear a man into gaol for them.</p>
               <p>

            . Last Monday was a month, the prisoner came to my house in Spittlefields market, and wanted me to bail him for a fraud; it was for defrauding a man of six guineas. He called me out between my two rooms, and told me he had a watch which he would sell me very cheap, if I would buy it; I said how came you by it, he said I mell'd one in the market of it. I said pray who was that, he said Will Wallis.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by this word Mell?</p>
               <p>Fitz. The word Melling I did not understand, but when he said Will Wallis, I thought he must steal it, or get it clandestinely.</p>
               <p>Q. If he spoke to you in a language you did not understand, how came you to say who?</p>
               <p>Fitz. I did say who, but did not understand the word mell'd?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce the watch to you?</p>
               <p>Fitz. No, he did not; I said I was surprized he was not afraid of being hanged or transported for such a thing; he told me as long as Mr. Wilson and Ambler lived, he could be bailed for murder; that he had so many boys and girls at home that could buss the book for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Fitz. I am a Salesman in Spittlefields-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in that employ now?</p>
               <p>Fitz. No, I am not now.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you left it?</p>
               <p>Fitz. About four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. What business have you followed since that?</p>
               <p>Fitz. None at all; I live upon what I have; my spouse died and left me some hundreds.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she make a will?</p>
               <p>Fitz. No, she made no will at all; she and I got it together; I have lived on that spot thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you an acquaintance of Latter's before?</p>
               <p>Fitz. I have known him five or six years; and have employed him to serve several writs for me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to think you a proper person to apply to about a watch.</p>
               <p>Fitz. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. When he offered to sell it you very cheap, what did you say to him?</p>
               <p>Fitz. I said I would have no concern with it, if he would sell it for a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to stop him when you suspected he stole it?</p>
               <p>Fitz. No; if I had he would have knocked my brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to a constable about him?</p>
               <p>Fitz. No; I thought he wanted to draw me in to be bail, so I dropped them all; and the woman that lives with me and I locked the door by agreement and went into the country.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you applied to, to be a witness in this affair?</p>
               <p>Fitz. It was about ten or twelve days ago.</p>

            . The night that Mr. Wallis fell in the ditch, after he was pulled out, the prisoner said to him I will see you home. He went to some people on the other side of the way; and said he is a staunch man and keeps the market. He and another took him up a great garden to Montague-street, and set him down on a bench, at the Cock and Key in that street. I was then about forty or fifty yards before them, he did not sit long, then they helped him along near a hundred yards; Mr. Wallis missed his watch and asked for it, Latter said d - n your watch, never mind that, I will take care of that: he dragged him twenty or thirty yards further. Wallis said he would not go any further without his watch, then he let him fall, and left him, and went on, and called to Boswell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100012"/>Q. Who was by him besides the prisoner at that time?</p>
               <p>Fielding. I was the nearest to him except the prisoner: I was about ten yards off them; there was no body helping him then but the prisoner. Boswell had helped him before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Boswell when he missed his watch?</p>
               <p>Fielding. Boswell was a-head of them.</p>

               <p>Fielding. This was about the dusk of the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Boswell by when he was sitting on the bench?</p>
               <p>Fielding. I do not know that, because I was thirty or forty yards a-head, he was with him before I went on to go before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were they when the prosecutor said he missed his watch?</p>
               <p>Fielding. They were about twenty or thirty yards from the corner of Brick-Lane; as they were going along, I saw the prisoner's left hand in Wallis's right hand breeches pocket; he was hugging of him to get him along, and the pocket was turned inside out when he was left alone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this you saw that.</p>
               <p>Fielding. It was just at the time Wallis said he missed his watch; I went then to help to take the man home, when he left him.</p>

               <p>Q. When Wallis was on the bench under the Cock and Key, was any body else by him besides the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at the time you saw the prisoner's hand in Wallis's pocket offer to take him up.</p>
               <p>Fielding. No; because I had heard what a sort of a man he was, and dare not, but my will was good.</p>

            . I saw Mr. Wallis fall into the ditch, with a young lamb on his shoulder; I ran and got in and took the lamb out, and carried it into the Dolphin alehouse; there was Boswell and the prisoner pretending to be his friends; they brought him into that alehouse; I was by the fire-side taking care of the lamb; one of them went to take Wallis's buckles out of his shoes; the other said let them alone; they were silver; they took him into Mountague-street, Latter got his hand round him hugging him up against a house, and set him down by the side of a door. I believe Boswell was about a hundred yards before him when he sat down; after that, the prisoner took Wallis about a hundred yards farther, till they came to the King of Prussia's Head; then Wallis asked for his watch; the prisoner said, d - n your watch, never mind your watch; then he took him about fifty yards farther, till they came betwixt Brick-Lane, and Dirty-Lane end; then Mr. Wallis said he would not go any further till he had his watch; then the prisoner left him, and called out Boswell, Boswell.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did Boswell assist in taking him along?</p>
               <p>Eaben. He might help take him about a hundred yards from the Dolphin, which is about half way to the Cock and Key, when they brought him in the house, Boswell had hold of one arm, and the prisoner the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe Wallis jostled up to some pales?</p>

               <p>Eaben. I was just behind with the lamb in my apron; they said they were his friends, and would see him home, and I followed them close behind with the lamb; and when the prisoner left him in the cart way, I got this Mr. Fielding to assist in getting him home.</p>

               <p>Q. When Mr. Wallis fell in the ditch where was you?</p>

Going out to bar up my windows, as I stood to make water, came the prisoner and another man, I found my handkerchief was gone. I walk'd up before them; there was a soldier; I told him I had had my pocket pick'd, by two men coming along. I took hold of the prisoner's collar: I took him into a tin-shop, in Fleet-street; there he pull'd my handkerchief out of his pocket, and ask'd if it was mine. I said it was; he said, he had just pick'd it up. I took him to the Plough ale-house; there he said, before the constable, he'd down on his knees and ask my pardon if that would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it go?</p>

            . I am a goldsmith. About the 14th or 15th of December last, the prisoner came to my house, and ask'd me to lend him a silver tea-kettle and stand to shew to a customer. I told him I had never one that I could spare. He said he had seen one at my house the other day, and he should be glad if I could lend him that I said I had promis'd it to a gentleman; he said if I would do him the favour in lending it him, I might depend upon having it in a few hours. I said why do you come to me, having a great many at your own home? his answer was, mine was of a different shape from his, and it would be a variety. I let him have the kettle and stand, and he took them away with a promise to return them in two hours; but before he went out, I told him I could not part with them, and did not weigh them to him; and said he must not let them go upon any account. I went to his house the following day, he was not at home; when I saw him, which was two or three days after, I ask'd him how he could serve me so, in keeping the kettle so long; and ask'd him for them. He said I am sorry I should disappoint you in this manner; but if you will stay till the afternoon, I'll go to the gentleman and bring it to your house, he not bringing it, the next day I went to him again, and then he said the gentleman was out of town, and his butler had inform'd him that he would not be in town till the Thursday following. Not bringing it on that Thursday, I went to him again; then he said he would go to the gentleman that afternoon, and inste ad of coming to me, he sent me a line that the gentleman would not be in town that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after this did you hear of your kettle?</p>
               <p>Preist. I did not hear of it till after the prisoner became a bankrupt. He came a few days after to me, and said he had seen a silver table, and desir'd the favour of me to let him have that to shew to a gentleman, (that was about twenty-three pounds value) he said he'd return it in two or three hours. I let him have the table, but told him I had dispos'd of it to a gentleman. Instead of returning with that, he carry'd and pledg'd it to Mr. Rochfort, in Covent-garden, where I found it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the tea-kettle and stand?</p>
               <p>Preist. At Mr. Price's on Snow-hill. The prisoner told me he had pawn'd them there, and Mr. Price says he has a tea-kettle and stand, which he took in of the prisoner, which are the same weight of mine, but he will not deliver them.</p>
               <p>A search warrant and officer is sent to fetch them.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Preist. I have known him about a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he ?</p>
               <p>Preist. He is a goldsmith.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you first acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Preist. Through Mr. Gladwin, a goldsmith, his father-in-law; he brought him to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose was it that he introduc'd him?</p>
               <p>Preist. I apprehend it was to carry on the scheme he has been guilty of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner keep a public shop?</p>
               <p>Preist. He did in Cornhill, and he ow'd me a great deal of money at the time he came for the kettle.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual, in the way of trade, to borrow goods of one another to shew or sell?</p>
               <p>Preist. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him have it as in the common course of dealing, as one silversmith lending to another?</p>
               <p>Preist. No, I did not lend it him to take to pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. If he could have sold it had you any objection to that?</p>
               <p>Preist. I had an objection. I let him have it to oblige him, that he might shew the gentleman as great a variety as he could; if the gentleman had lik'd it, he might have had another made to match it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you receiv'd several sums of money of him?</p>
               <p>Preist. I have receiv'd five guineas, and five pounds eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not receiv'd money of him since the tea-kettle and stand were deliver'd to him?</p>
               <p>Preist. I don't know that I have.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100015"/>Q. In the common course of dealing, do you charge him debtor for them in your book?</p>
               <p>Preist. I never charg'd it, it never was set down to him.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had wanted the same, would he not have lent them to you, if he had had such?</p>
               <p>Preist. I apprehend he would.</p>
               <p>Q. If the plate is not return'd, don't you expect the value of it return'd?</p>
               <p>Preist. Yes; but that was not to be dispos'd of. I expected that again.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he become a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Preist. He was prov'd a bankrupt the 7th of January last.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this prosecution begun before or after he became a bankrupt?</p>
               <p>Preist. It was not begun till after. I did not know that I had been cheated out of it till after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in trade?</p>
               <p>Preist. About four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not you have charg'd this as a debt?</p>
               <p>Preist. I prov'd my debt under the statute, but I did not consider this as a debt.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a partner?</p>

               <p>Preist. I have. His name is

            . I am servant to Mr. Shaw and Mr. Preist. I was present when Mr. Frost came and had the tea-kettle and lamp away; which was about the eighteenth or twentieth of December. They never were set down to him in the book, being to be return'd in so short a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the conversation that pass'd upon it?</p>
               <p>Dunkerly. He came and said he wanted to borrow a chased tea-kettle and stand to shew to a customer. Mr. Preist was above stairs, he came down and said, what makes you borrow of me, when you have so many of your own? He said it will make a variety, and promis'd to return it in an hour's time, and tied it up in a handkerchief and carried it away, and I never saw it since. The prisoner came to our house several times after that, and said the family, where he had left it, were out of town; and he believ'd they would not be in town till after Christmas, and he wrote a letter to Mr. Preist to that purport.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether it is not customary to lend goods to a Brother trade to sell?</p>
               <p>Dunkerly. This was lent to shew, but with a promise of being return'd again in two or three hours, because it was sold to another gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that is not the method, if goods are not sold, to make the person debtor in the book?</p>
               <p>Dunkerly. Yes; but this was an unfinish'd thing and not deliver'd for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. to Preist. Do you know this hand-writing?</p>
               <p>(The letter produc'd.)</p>
               <p>Preist. This I believe, upon my oath, to be Mr. Frost's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write?</p>
               <p>Preist. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it that the prisoner had the tea-kettle?</p>
               <p>Preist. I can't take upon me to say the exact day; it was about a fortnight before Christmas.</p>

            . I live servant to Mr. Price, a pawnbroker, on Snow-hill. (The tea-kettle and stand produc'd.)</p>
               <p>I remember this tea-kettle and stand being brought to pawn, by the prisoner at the bar, about six or seven months ago. I can't tell the day, he said they were his own.</p>

               <p>Beadle. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Owen and Mr. Brent, two sheriffs officers, depos'd that this witness told them, he should not trouble himself about them; his master was cut of town, and he should not send them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Beadle. Were they pawn'd before or after Christmas?</p>
               <p>Beadle. It was before Christmas.</p>

            . I did the doors about 10 o'clock; the maid got up first and found the house had been broke open, then she call'd me, I got up and found the cellar-door had a hole cut in it, that a person could put in an arm and unbolt a bolt, and also unskrew a skrew that fastened down the bar of the window; the hole was in the middle, so that by turning the arm up and down the fastening could be undone. It appear'd to be done by some body that knew the fastening without-side. The compting-house door was burst open, and the desk broke; and I am positive there was more money taken out of the desk than I have laid in the indictment. I chose to lay the indictment rather less than more.</p>

I asked her if she would give me leave to keep them till the next day, when she should have them, or the money.

We drove to the justice's door; when we went out on the left side, to go into the justice's house, he jump'd out on the other side and ran away, the people call'd stop thief; and this witness that took him before, being behind the coach, ran and took him again in a cellar. Upon his examination he said, that the goods and money were left him by a soldier that was gone abroad. Here are some tools that we found in his house (producing an iron colt-chissel about 14 inches long, a tinder-box, matches, flint and steel, and two gunlets). When I was searching the house, the woman said, her husband had brought home some money, and it was in a little box; we went and found in it about 16 l. and a receipt of his landlord, for rent he had just paid.</p>

               <p>THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH SWORN.</p>
               <p>I receiv'd this letter from an unknown hand, dated the 29th of November, and directed to me, appointing me to meet the writer on a certain spot in Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>The letter read.</p>
               <p>To his Grace the Duke of Marlborough, with care and speed.</p>
               <p>XXVIIII November.</p>
               <p>' My Lord,</p>
               <p>' as ceremony is an idle thing upon most ' occasions, more especially to persons in my ' state of mind, I shall proceed immediately to ' acquaint You, with the motive &amp; end, of addressing ' this epistle to You, which is equally ' interesting to us both: You are to know then, ' that my present situation in life, is such, that I ' should prefer annihilation, to a continuance in it: ' desperate diseases, require desperate remedies, ' and You are the man I have pitched upon, either ' to make me, or to unmake Yourself; as I ' never had the honour to live among the great, ' the tenour of my proposals, will not be very ' courtly, but let that be an argument, to enforce ' the belief, of what I am now going to write; ' it has employed my invention for some time, ' to find out a method to destroy another, without ' exposing my own life, that I have accomplished, ' and defy the law; now for the application of ' it, I am desperate, and must be provided for; ' You have it in your power, it is my business to ' make it your inclination to serve me; which ' You must determine to comply with, by procuring ' me a genteel support, for my life, or ' your own, will be at a period, before this sessions ' of parliament is over: I have more motives, ' than one, for singling You out first, upon this ' occasion; and I give you this fair warning, because ' the means I shall make use of, are too ' fatal, to be eluded by the power of physick: if ' you think this of any consequence, You will ' not fail to meet the Author, on Sunday next, at ' ten in the morning, or on Monday (if the ' weather should be rainy on Sunday) near the ' first Tree beyond the Stile in Hyde-Park, in ' the foot walk to Kensington: secresy and compliance ' may preserve You, from a double danger ' of this sort; as there is a certain part of the ' world, where your death has more than been ' wished, for upon other motives; I know the ' world too well, to trust this secret, in any breast, ' but my own; a few days determine me, your ' friend or enemy.</p>
               <p>' Felton.</p>
               <p>' You will apprehend that I mean you should be ' alone, and depend upon it that a discovery of ' any artifice in this affair will be fatal to You, ' my safety is insured by my silence, for confession ' only can condemn me.'</p>
               <p>Q. What did your Grace do upon the receipt of this letter?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I went to the place at the time appointed. It was at the first tree near the style in Hyde Park, in the way to Kensington, at the end<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100020"/> of the Serpentine water, betwixt that water and a little pond. I was there some time, and saw nobody stop that I could suspect to be the person; upon which I was going away: but as I came to Hyde Park corner, I turn'd my horse and saw a person stand loitering, and looking at the water over the bridge. This was, I believe, within twenty yards of the tree, and this induc'd me to go back again. I rode up to the person very gently, and passed by him once or twice, expecting him to speak to me; he did not: I made him a bow, and ask'd him if he had something to say to me? he said No, I don't know you. I said I am the Duke of Marlborough: Now you know me, I imagine; you have something to say to me: he said No, I have not. Then I rode away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your Grace arm'd?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I had pistols before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your Grace any great coat on?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No, I had not. My star might easily be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your Grace see any body here that you saw there?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. It was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your Grace any servant or attendant with you?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I had no servant with me, there was a person, a friend of mine, at a good distance in the Park. A day or two after, I can't be sure whether it was the next day or the day after that, I receiv'd a second letter.</p>
               <p>It is read.</p>
               <p>To his Grace the Duke of Marlborough.</p>
               <p>' My Lord,</p>
               <p>' You receive this as an acknowledgement of ' your punctuality as to the time and place of ' meeting on Sunday last tho' it was owing to ' You, that it answered no purpose, the pageantry ' of being armed, and the ensign of your ' order, were useless, and too conspicuous, You ' needed no attendant, the place was not calculated ' for mischief, nor was any intended: if ' You walk in the west isle of Westminster-Abbey, ' towards eleven o'clock on Sunday next, ' your Sagacity, will point out the person, whom ' you will address, by asking h company, to take ' a turn or two with You; You will not fail, on ' enquiry, to be acquainted with the name, and ' place of abode, according to which directions, ' You will please to send, two or three hundred ' pound bank Notes, the next day by the penny ' post; exert not your curiosity too early it is ' in your power to make me grateful on certain ' terms I have friends who are faithful, but ' they do not bark before they bite.</p>
               <p>' I am &amp;c. ' &amp;c. ' F.'</p>
               <p>Q. What did your Grace do upon the receipt of this second letter?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I went to Westminster Abbey at the time the letter appointed. I had been walking there about five or six minutes before I saw any body that I suspected; then I saw the person I had seen before in Hyde Park, and another person who seemed to be a good looking man, a substantial tradesman: they came in and look'd on the monuments. I knowing the person again, went and stood by them; but the prisoner said nothing to me: soon after they both of them went towards the choir; the stranger, I may call him, went into the choir, and the prisoner turn'd back and came towards me, but did not speak to me. Then I ask'd him if he had any thing to say to me, or any commands for me? He said No, my Lord, I have not. I said, sure you have, he said No, my Lord; he walk'd up and down one side the isle, and I the other to give him a little more time; but he did not speak, then I went away out at the great door, and left him in the Abbey. I look'd back to see if he watched me going out, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your Grace any body with you in the Abbey?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. There were two or three people placed in disguise, ready, if I had given them the signal, to have taken him up. Though I was certain it was the same person which I had seen and spoke to in the Park, thought not proper to give the signal, but to run a little longer risk rather than to take up an innocent man. Very soon after this I receiv'd another letter, this is it.</p>

               <p>The third Letter read.</p>
               <p>To his Grace the Duke of Marlborough.</p>
               <p>' My Lord,</p>
               <p>' I Am fully convinced you had a companion on ' Sunday, I interpret it as owing to the weakness ' of human nature, but such proceeding is far ' from being ingenuous, and may produce bad ' effects whilst it is impossible to answer the end ' proposed: You will see me again soon, as it ' were by accident, and may easily find where I ' go to, in consequence of which by being sent ' to, I shall wait on your Grace, but expect to be ' quite alone, and to converse in whispers, You ' will likewise give your honour upon meeting, ' that no part of the conversation shall transpire, ' these, and the former terms complied with, ' ensure your safety: my revenge in case of ' non-compliance, (or any scheme to expose me) ' will be slower, but not less sure, and strong ' suspicion, the utmost that can possibly ensue ' upon it, while the chances would be ten-fold ' against you. You will possibly be in doubt ' after the meeting but it is quite necessary the ' outside should be a mask to the in, the family ' of the BLOODS is not extinct, tho' they are ' not in my scheme.'</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. At about two months after the receipt of this, I receiv'd another letter, this is it.</p>
               <p>The fourth Letter read.</p>
               <p>To his Grace the Duke of Marlborough.</p>
               <p>' May it please your Grace</p>
               <p>' I have reason to believe that the son of ' one Barnard a surveyor in Abingdon Buildings ' Westminster is acquainted with some secrets ' that nearly concern your safety, his Father is ' now out of town which will give you an opportunity ' of questioning him more privately; ' It would be useless to your Grace as well as ' dangerous to me to appear more publickly in ' this affair</p>
               <p>' Your sincere friend. ' ANONYMOUS.</p>
               <p>' He frequently goes ' to Storeys-Gate ' coffee-house.'</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. There is no date to this letter. About a week or ten days after I receiv'd this letter, I sent a message to the Coffee-house, by Mr. Merrick, who return'd and told me he found Mr. Barnard there, and that he said, what could the Duke of Marlborough want with him? he had spoke with him once in Hyde Park, and another time in Westminster Abbey. The messenger told me, he said he'd wait on me, which he did at Marlborough-house, about half an hour after ten o'clock. I think, on the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was Thursday, my Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100023"/>D. of Marlb. I can't be sure as to the day. When he came in, I knew, at first sight; it was the same person that I had seen in the Park and in the Abbey. I desir'd him to walk with me into a room, and immediately shut the door when we were in. I ask'd him as before, he said he had nothing to say to me; then I told him of the last letter I receiv'd, that it mentioned his name, and that he knew something concerning my safety; he said he knew nothing of it. Then I recapitulated all the letters, beginning with the first, and remark'd to him that it was strange to me, that a man that wrote so very correct, without false English in any shape, should be guilty of so low an action; he said a man may be very learned and very poor. I then took notice of the second letter, and said there must be something very odd in the man; he said I imagine the man must be mad; I said he seems surpriz'd that I should have pistols; said he, I was surpriz'd to see your Grace with pistols, and your Star on. I said, why was you surpriz'd at that? his answer was, after stopping a moment, It was so cold a day; I wonder'd you had not a great coat on: then I afterwards shew'd him the letter again where his name was mention'd, and walk'd with him to the window, and as I read it, when I came to that part where it said his father was out of town; he said it is very odd, my father was then out of town. I said nothing to him of that, though it struck me a good deal, as there was no date to the letter. I said, if you are innocent, it behaves you much more than me to find out the author of those letters, particularly the last: for it was an attempt to blast his character behind his back; he seem'd to give me a smile and away he went. I did not apprehend him then.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did your Grace receive this first letter ?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I am Master of the Ordnance. Some body or other had put it under the door of the office in the night time, and the keeper of the door sent it to me the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the second letter, which way did your Grace receive that?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. That was sent the same way, by being put under the door as the other.</p>
               <p>Counsel. In consequence of the first letter, your Grace went into the Park on horseback, and was there some time without seeing any body you suspected; Were there not people there ?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I saw several people on horse back, and some few walking in a hurry on foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray my Lord Duke, after you had seen this person lostering, was there any thing going forward, such as hunting a duck, or the like?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No, nothing in the world as I saw, it was a very cold day.</p>
               <p>Q. Your lordship said there was another person at a distance, an attendant on your Grace; how far might that person be off when you was speaking to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I cannot tell exactly. I had spoke to him to keep a great way off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in view of your Grace?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I dare say he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not any person equally see that person as well as your Grace?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I suppose they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be observable to any third person that your Grace spoke to Mr. Barnard?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I suppose it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your Grace there at the time?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I was there rather before the time, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he in the least offer to follow your Grace?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No, he seem'd to go the other way.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the second letter, your Grace went according to appointment to Westminster Abbey, and saw the prisoner and another person come into the Abbey, before that other person had left him, had your Grace been near him?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I had, I stood by him in hopes he wou ld speak to me, if he was the person that wrote the letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the circumstance was not such, that that other person might very well believe your Grace wanted to speak to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. That I can't tell, I stood very near the prisoner wanting him to speak to me; it is possible he might think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there was not at that time several persons attending on your Grace?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. There were two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your Grace speak to either of them in the Abbey ?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100024"/>Q. Whether if there was any other person in Westminster Abbey at that time, whether that third person might not have taken Mr. Barnard for your Grace's companion, as your Grace spoke to him?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. Upon my word I can't tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there be a person to whom that expression, in the third letter, might be apply'd, referring to your Grace's companion, besides Mr. Barnard?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. Yes, It might be apply'd to a gentleman that went away with me in the coach from the Abbey.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether your Grace did not bow several times to the prisoner before you spoke?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No, I don't think I did.</p>
               <p>Counsel. With respect to the third letter, your Grace heard no more of that till the 4th came.</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I did not, and when the 4th came I sent to Mr. Barnard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your Grace know Mr. Barnard before you receiv'd these letters ?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No, I did not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your Grace now know whether he was a person in such situation in life, as answered to the description in the letters?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I don't know the least thing of him, either character or circumstance.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then, abstracted from these circumstances, should your Grace have entertained any suspicion of him more than of any other person?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I did not know there was such a man in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came to your Grace's house, did he come in very readily?</p>

               <p>D. of Marlb. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether his answer was, I was surpriz'd to see you arm'd too, or I was surpriz'd to see you arm'd?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I can't take upon me to say whether he laid such an emphasis on it or not.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then he made no secret of seeing your Grace in the Park.</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Nor in the Abbey?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your Grace mention'd, he said, it is very odd my father was out of town then! could your Grace apply that in the manner it was spoke, that his father was out of town when the message came to him?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I really understood him, that he knew his father was out of town at the time of his writing the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your Grace mention the time you receiv'd it?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. No, I did not mention any time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come punctually to his time?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. He did, I think the messenger said he would wait on me about half an hour after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner was he apprehended?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I do not know; I understood he was summoned.</p>
               <p>Q. It has been said, he went away with a smile; pray, my Lord Duke, might not that smile express the consciousness of his innocence as well as any thing else?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I shall leave that to the Great Judge.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, a man might be very learned, and very poor; does your Grace know whether this person at the bar is either learned or poor?</p>

               <p>D. of Marlb. I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. May not that expression fall from any man whatever?</p>
               <p>D. of Marlb. I cannot say as to that.</p>

            . I was directed from his Grace to carry a message to Story's Gate coffee-house; I went, and there was the prisoner at the bar: I told him, the Duke of Marlborough wanted to speak with him; he expressed some surprize at what the Duke should want with him, but no fear.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Merrick. This was on Tuesday, the 25th of April, in the evening; and he said, he would wait on the Duke on the Thursday following, between 10 and 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did he give for not waiting on his Grace sooner?</p>
               <p>Merrick. His excuse was, he was going out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you of his having seen the Duke before?</p>
               <p>Merrick. He did. He said, he had seen his Grace three times in his life, once in Hyde-Park, and once in Westminster Abbey, and once at the camp at Byfleet; he said, he did not know the Duke when he saw him in Hyde-Park, till the Duke himself told him who he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100025"/>Q. Did he tell you what had passed either in the Park or in the Abbey?</p>
               <p>Merrick. He told me that in the Park the Duke rode up to him, and asked him, Sir, do you want any thing with me? His answer was, No. Then the Duke asked him, If he knew who he was? he answered No again. Then the Duke told him, he was the Duke of Marlborough; then he made his bow: and in Westminster Abbey he told me, he thought the Duke had spoke to him; but on turning about he said, he did not; and he turn'd and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you this conversation?</p>
               <p>Merrick. This was in a room in the coffee-house by ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you this voluntarily?</p>
               <p>Merrick. He did. At first he seem'd surprized, and then said, he recollected these circumstances.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he express any signs of fear?</p>
               <p>Merrick. No; but he seemed much surprized.</p>

            . I was appointed by his Grace the Duke and justice Fielding to watch the Duke in Westminster Abbey, and had two constables there in order to apprehend the person, if his Grace had thought proper to give the signal.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all together?</p>
               <p>Marsden. No, but so dispersed that our intention might not be known; I was within the choir hearing the prayers for some time; there was a gentleman near the Duke with a sword, whom I thought the person at first, but I learned afterwards, he was an acquaintance of his Grace's; I was not apprized that any such person would attend him: I saw Mr. Barnard and another person come in, and his eye was fix'd on his Grace as he walk'd in the isle; they walk'd down the middle isle, not directly to his Grace; in a little time I observed his Grace to meet them, and as I thought by the behaviour of Mr. Barnard, that he spoke first to the Duke presently after that Mr. Barnard's partner went off from him; then Mr. Barnard went and stood looking at the Duke; then I thought Mr. Barnard was the person; so I did not mind the other: I saw his Grace speak to him again, but was not near enough to hear what they said: after that, his Grace walk'd backwards and forwards once or twice, and went out at the door he came in at; the other gentleman immediately followed the Duke; I followed to see what pass'd; the gentleman, the Duke's acquaintance, walk'd opposite to the Duke, Mr. Barnard was got looking behind a post, any body that was on that side he was on could see him; but a person on that side his Grace was on could not, I believe it was impossible for his Grace to see him at that time, he look'd after his Grace a considerable time, then walk'd back: I followed his Grace and told him what observations I had made; his Grace immediately told me, the man in black was the man that he had seen in Hyde-Park: then I said, I wonder your Grace did not give the signal to have him apprehended; his Grace said the same as repeated here, He would rather let it be a little longer, than to take up an innocent man; he should hear of him again he apprehended, for he seem'd to be afraid to speak to him at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he apprehended after this?</p>
               <p>Marsden. He was. I procured him to come before justice Fielding, by a sham summons, in which he was accused with assault and battery: he was not taken up till he came there, then he seemed surpriz'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you about any thing that happen'd in Westminster Abbey?</p>
               <p>Marsden. I was with him in the dining room at Mr. Fielding's, in order to take his examination; I went as it were out of complaisance to him not to leave him alone, he talk'd a good deal, but I did not make such observations of it as I should have done if I had thought of his coming here: I remember he said he order'd his friend to walk off, that he might see what the Duke wanted with him, and said he thought the Duke must come there by appointment: he mentioned something about the Duke's giving him a place or post; I think he said he ordered his friend to walk off, to see if the Duke would give him some place; or, perhaps, the Duke wants to give me a place.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said the Duke wanted to give him a place? or, that his friend said, Go towards him, perhaps the Duke wants to give you some place?</p>
               <p>Marsden. I cannot be sure which; I know the word place was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the summons ?</p>
               <p>Marsden. This is the summons, ( producing one;) I did not serve it on the day it bears date; it was made out on Saturday the 29th of April. I was to have given him it that afternoon, but I was told he was gone to Brentford; so I went early on Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100026"/> morning following, and gave it him: this was only made out as a decoy; the name in it is one of the constables that was fix'd in Westminster Abbey, named

               <p>Q. Did he shew any unwillingness to come?</p>
               <p>Marsden. No, none at all; he look'd at it and said, it is a summons from Mr. Fielding; he read it over and said, Roger Bowsher! I know nothing of him; give my compliments, tell him I'll wait on him.</p>
               <p>Q. As to this place that he look'd thro', which door is it at?</p>
               <p>Marsden. It is the west gate near the Gate-house, just at the corner there is another gate, and next to the wall is a sort of a post, which is what he look'd through, or by.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that gate, as you call it, a close wainscoted door?</p>
               <p>Marsden. It is a door, but the place where I mean is a post; he peep'd between the post and the wall. I have never been since to look at it; if there is not a hole between that and the wall, he must look by the other side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was his head?</p>
               <p>Marsden. That was towards the gentleman who was close to the wall, opposite him; he must have turned his head farther from the wall to have seen his Grace, as his Grace was going to take coach.</p>

            . He has, of considerable sums; I have oftener asked him for money than he me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion to send him to Kensington on Sunday the 4th of December.</p>
               <p>J. Barnard. I had nothing, but circumstance; brought the day to my mind since: I gave him an order on that Sunday morning, when we were at breakfast, to go to Kensington, to know whether there was some money paid by the treasurer of the turnpikes for gravel: I have a brother there, named Joseph; he went there and did his business, and dined with my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that ?</p>
               <p>J. Barnard. Because he told me so; and the solicitor of the turnpike told me he had been with him, and in consequence of which I had my money afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard your son take any notice of his meeting with the Duke of Marlborough that day?</p>
               <p>J. Barnard. When he came home he told me, he had met the Duke of Marlborough, and these circumstances of his Grace's taking notice of him; he mentioned it as an extraordinary thing. I ask'd him, if he had not look'd a little impudently (as he has a near sight) at him, or pull'd his glass out? He said, he saw another gentleman at a distance, and the Duke was arm'd; and he imagin'd there might be a duel going forwards; he has from that time to this mentioned it as a very strange event, several times in my house, without any reserve at all.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you sent your son to Kensington on the 4th of December, suppose you had not given him an order to go there, whether he was not at liberty to go where he pleased?</p>
               <p>J. Barnard. Yes; I never restrain him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was surpriz'd to see the Duke without a great coat?</p>
               <p>J. Barnard. I can't remember that particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him mention his seeing the Duke of Marlborough in Westminster Abbey?</p>
               <p>J. Barnard. I have very often, and very publickly, and with some surprize, as he has that in Hyde-Park. I said to him, I would not have you be public in speaking of things of this kind, left an use be made of it to your disadvantage.</p>

            . I am first cousin to the prisoner at the bar. On Saturday the 3d of December, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100027"/> was at Kensington, and lay at my uncle's house there, and dined there. On the Sunday the prisoner came there before dinner, he said he had been to do some business that way. He dined with us, there were my uncle, aunt, he, and I; he related that circumstance to us of meeting with the Duke of Marlborough in Hyde-Park; he said he rode up to him, and asked if he knew who he was; he answered no; he replied I am the Duke of Marlborough; he related it with some chearfulness, tho' as matter of surprize.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>T. Barnard. From his birth: he is in business with his father; I always understood he would succeed his father; I never knew him to behave any otherwise than well in my life. I never thought him extravagant, nor never heard so; I had always looked upon him to be an honest man; his father is in very great business.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you look upon it, that a small place would be equal to the chance of succeeding his father in his business?</p>
               <p>T. Barnard. I should never have thought of such a thing; I look upon his situation in life to be a very extraordinary thing: I thought he would give the preference to that above any thing else.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>

            , lay at my house on the Saturday night, and dined with the prisoner at the bar on the Sunday. I remember he then mentioned having met with the Duke of Marlborough in Hyde-Park, while we were sitting at dinner. I said I was surprized he should meet with him that day; he said he saw but one gentleman at a distance, and the Duke was armed; and his Grace looked him full in the face, very earnestly, (which he seemed to speak with a great deal of pleasure to me) he is very near sighted, he can see nothing at a distance without the use of a glass. I have heard him since speak four or five times of seeing the Duke in Westminster-Abbey.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago?</p>
               <p>Jos. Barnard. About a month ago. He is brought up under his father in very considerable business, and a man of some property besides, and was employed as his clerk or book keeper?</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a sober man?</p>
               <p>Jos. Barnard. Very sober; I never heard to the contrary; neither did I ever hear his father speak of him as idle or dilatory.</p>

            . I live at Kensington: I remember the prisoner coming there on a Sunday morning; a very cold foggy morning; with some message from his father to me, to know whether the solicitor had paid some money or not. He was under his father, as I am under mine; he desired me to go with him; I said stay and dine with me; he said he could not promise, because he had promised to dine with his uncle Joseph: he went into the parlour, and said it is vastly cold. There has been the oddest accident happened as I came over the Park; the Duke of Marlborough came up to me, and asked me if I knew him, I said no; he asked me if I wanted any thing with him, I told him no; he said I am the Duke of Marlborough, if you want any thing with me; then the Duke went away, and he came there. He expressed a great surprize at it, and I thought it a very odd affair.</p>

            , Esq; I have known the prisoner two years; I remember dining with him on the 8th of December, at his father's house, with a great deal of company; I heard him then say at dinner, that some few days before, he had met the Duke of Marlborough in Hyde-Park; that the Duke asked him if he had any business with him, he said no; he then told him who he was, and asked him the same again, he said no; that the Duke seemed in some confusion and was armed; and he thought he was about a duel; and indeed I thought it was a very great lie. I have gone very frequently to his father's in relation to Brentford bridge. I have no other acquaintance with him, only going to his father's, so can't say any thing to his character either frugal or extravagant.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any body that dined there that day?</p>
               <p>Mr. Clive. Yes, there was Mr. Wilson and his lady, Mr. Tunstall and his lady, another gentleman and his wife, and the prisoner's younger brother that is at Westminster school.</p>

            . I dined at Mr. Barnard's on Thursday the 8th of December; the prisoner, I remember, said he had been in Hyde-Park some days before, and there he saw a gentleman on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100028"/> horse-back come up to him, and asked him if he had any thing to say to him, he said no; then he said I am the Duke of Marlborough, now you know me, have you any thing to say to me? he said no.

            . I live at Deptford, with a relation in the brewing way; I came from Deptford on Saturday to the prisoner's father's; and on the Sunday following I was there at breakfast; I solicited the prisoner to get himself dressed to go with me into the Park, being to meet a person at twelve o'clock; I with a good deal of difficulty got him to dress himself; I put my shirt on in the parlour, and after that he put on his; I fancy we breakfasted about 9 o'clock; when we got to the end of Henry the VIIth's chapel, the prisoner would have gone the other way into the Park without going thro' the Abbey, I took hold of his sleeve, and said, Barnard, you shall go thro' the Abbey; this was a little after eleven; this was no unusual thing; we have several times walked in the Park, and some times parted.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is the nearest way to the Park?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. I do not know which is the nearest way, thro' the Abbey, or by the side of it, this was the first time I believe that I ever saw the monument of general Hargrave; after that we walked down to the monument, erected at the public expence for captain Cornwall; the preacher was in the pulpit; when we were standing at capt. Cornwall's monument, the prisoner made some observations on the execution of it in his own way. After we had staid there some time, I saw his Grace the Duke of Marlborough, who was got pretty near us: upon seeing the Duke I jogged him by the elbow, and said, step this way, he seemed to look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard what happened in Hyde-Park, previous to this?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. I had; I believe it was told to me by the prisoner at the bar; on my jogging him we walked up the middle isle towards the choir, I said did you see that gentleman in the blue coat, or do you know him ? no said he, not I; no, said I, it is the Duke of Marlborough! we will walk to the monument again; the Duke came, and placed himself pretty near me a second time, after this we walked away. I believe we walked some considerable time in that isle, in which is the monument of sir

            , there I believe we pass'd and repass'd again.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you jog him ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. Because he is very near sighted. At last I think it so happened, we pass'd the Duke between two of the pillars; and as I had hold of his arm walking together, there was barely room for three people to pass a breast; the Duke rather gave way, and made as I thought a kind of a bow. Upon this I said the Duke of Marlborough's behaviour is extremely particular; he certainly has something to say to you; I suppose he does not chuse to say it while I am with you, I will go into the choir, and do you walk up and down here, and possibly he will speak to you. While I was there I looked; the first thing I saw was the Duke of Marlborough and the prisoner at the bar with their heads bowing together, as if it was the first salutation.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the least inclination to go into the Abbey before you proposed it to him ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. No; he did not discover any ?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he discover any inclination to be left alone, when you proposed to go into the choir ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. No, he did not in the least; in some few minutes after, the prisoner and I met together, he told me the Duke of Marlborough was gone out of the Abbey, he had seen him go out; I said what pass'd, to which he replied the Duke said did you speak to me, or who spoke first I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. In this transaction did the prisoner appear openly, or as if he had some secret transaction to do with the Duke?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. No, it was open and clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Duke come in?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. No, I did not; we were employed at looking at the monuments; we looked at several.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you first came in?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. We walked along and looked on the monuments.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner's eye fixed on any person ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Barnard very near sighted ?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. He is; I question whether he can be able to see a person across this room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go, when you went out of the Abbey?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. We went immediately, into the Park, and after walking there, we met with two Ladies whom I knew and to whom Mr. Barnard was not unknown, to whom we related this affair; he always repeated these things, that is, this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100029"/> and that in Hyde-Park, as matter of great curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. I have been acquainted with him seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his character?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. I know nothing to the contrary but that he is an industrious sober young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that he was a profligate expensive man?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. His father is in great business: is he not?</p>
               <p>Greenwood. His father's business is a very considerable thing.</p>

I said, Leave any message, I'll deliver it to him; he said, he wanted to see him that evening; he left his message, I delivered it to him, and he came rather before 8 o'clock to him. He has used my house some years, always a well-behaved man; I never perceived any extravagancy in him, always a sober regular man.

               <p>Counsel. We will now shew his behaviour after he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. While he was in custody, Mr. Fielding did me the honour of sending for me, he told me it was upon some business which concerned the Duke of Marlborough's life; he asked me to go along with him and Mr. Box to New Prison, which I consented to; we went together in a coach; this was about 12 at night, and Mr. Barnard was then in bed; I have really forgot what day it was: Mr. Fielding told him, he had omitted examining his pockets at the time he was before him; he then search'd his pockets, in order to see whether he had any letters or any writings that might give light into the affair; he very readily let me look into his pocket-book and papers. Mr. Fielding with great candour told him, he was in the hands of a very honourable prosecutor, and one that would be as glad to discover his innocence as his guilt. Mr. Fielding asked him for his keys, and he gave him the keys of his escrutore and compting-house with great readiness; and I remember that I then told him, that, if he was guilty, some copies might be found to correspond with the original letters; and if nothing of that sort did appear, it would be a circumstance in his favour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or Mr. Fielding tell him he was not oblig'd to part with his keys, and did he do it as matter of choice?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ford. I don't recollect that; I know he parted with them very readily.</p>
               <p>The Revd. Dr. Markham. I have known the prisoner some years; I have always considered him as a young man of remarkable sobriety and attention to business: I have had some experience of him; I intrusted him with the execution of some matters of importance relating to myself, in regard to surveying and valuing estates, in which he acquitted himself ably and honestly; that is the character he always had: he lives in my neighbourhood, his father is a man of considerable property, and carries on a large business.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then you don't suppose the prisoner to be in distressed circumstances?</p>
               <p>Dr. Markham. I never supposed it, I have no reason to imagine it; if he had come to me, wanting money, he might easily have imposed on me; he is one of the persons I chiefly trusted, and I don't know a man on whom I would have had a greater reliance: I thought him remarkably able in his business, and very likely to be a considerable man; and I never was more astonished in my life than when I heard this strange story.</p>

            , Esq; I have known Mr. Barnard about the space of three years last past. The beginning of my acquaintance was on the account of his surveying of houses in the New Square Dean's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175805100030"/> yard; the surveys were generally made by him; he did his business with such accuracy, that I have always thought him a man very attentive to his business, and very unlikely to be charged with this fact; and upon his being employ'd upon publick schemes, I employ'd him in my own affairs; I employ'd his father to finish some houses for me at Hammersmith, the son was constantly employ'd till the 6th of April last; I have at different times paid to Mr. Barnard about 700 pounds, all, except 50 or 79 pounds, paid into the hands of the prisoner. He has appear'd as the person that manag'd his father's business; If he had come to me, and mentioned any want of money, upon his father's being out of town, or the like, he might have had 2 or 300 l. at any time. When I first was acquainted with him, I observed he had a remarkable short sight; when he has look'd full at me, I have thought he snear'd at me; he has such a fall with his eye-lids on the account of his short-sightedness; I have found his eye so fix'd upon me, that I have been going to speak to him, which, by a long acquaintance with him, I since found was only an accident.</p>
               <p>Robert Vansitturt, Esq; I have known Mr. Barnard about 5 or 6 years; my acquaintance with him was by being acquainted with his father, who was employ'd in carrying on a large building for Mr. Lee an acquaintance of mine in Oxfordshire, and this five years I have been acquainted with the son, and frequently in company with him. In the beginning of April he was in my chamber, putting up some book-cases; I remember one morning at breakfast he told me the circumstance of meeting the Duke of Marlborough in Hyde-Park and in Westminster Abbey, in the same way as the court has been told from his Grace and the rest of the witnesses: it appear'd to me to be a very strange story, and he seem'd to tell it as such, as I or any body else would have told it; I suspended my judgment upon it, and never related it to any body, only to my father and another gentleman, and they look'd upon it as a great lie that Barnard had invented; I knowing his character did not take it as such, but thought he must have known it to be as he said.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of him as to his business?</p>
               <p>Vansittart. From my own personal acquaintance with him, and from the many surveys, I have seen of his, he certainly is very capable and master of his business. I never heard any thing ill as to his private character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write?</p>
               <p>Vansittart. No, he draws very well, I have seen him draw.</p>

I considered him as a very promising genius, in his way, and one capable of conducting his business with reputation and character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon him likely to be driven to distress, or in want of a place?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, I did not. I can with great truth say, most of the payments in my compting-house, on his father's account, have most of them been paid by the hands of this young man; except the last five hundred pounds: then Mr. Barnard and his wife came over and dined with me and paid it; and then I blamed him for not bringing his son.</p>

I have known the prisoner several years; I always thought him a very honest, sober man, capable in his profession: the money that has been paid to us lately, except that five hundred pounds has been by him; they never paid less than a hundred pounds at a time except once.</p>
