             was the man that told me they had pistols and cutlasses, but I will not swear it, I believe it to be him both from his voice and heighth; the other was pale, and I observed one was ruddy faced.</p>
               <p>Then you are very far from being sure as to him, but you form a belief from the appearance of his person? - Yes; the prisoner Chaffey; was not taken till a few days afterwards; the three I saw at Mr. Wilmot's, were Thrush, and the accomplice, and Merryman; I will not swear to Merryman.</p>
               <p>Was not you a good deal alarmed? - I was not, I could not account for it; I could not see them while they were beating me, it was before, I am perfectly sure; as to Thrush I never saw him before to my knowledge, but he stood directly before me, and I saw him perfectly twice; I had seen the accomplice an hundred times, yet I did not know him; it was Chaffey that stopped me first, and said, give us your money, and we will not hurt you; Chaffey was not taken till a week after the others or more; the others I saw on the Wednesday, so that it was a fortnight after the robbery when I saw him; I am sure of him: I described the people to the Justices men.</p>
               <p>How long was it after this before you went to tell any body? - I did not tell any body; it is amazing to me; I went to a surgeon, and there was a clergyman's servant, that lives in the neighbourhood; and I fancy it must come from his report; for I was so covered with blood, that the surgeon told me on the Sunday, he expected my head was fractured; I had given no information at all then; they did not take the people up from any description of mine; I cannot say how they were taken up, but I perfectly well knew them, when I saw them.</p>

               <p>What business are you? - I deal in yeast and beer a good deal; I did deal in the yeast trade, at the time that the North country business came on; I was going home, I had been in town, as I do every day; I had dined.</p>
               <p>Had you been drinking pretty freely? - No, Sir, I had not.</p>
               <p>Was you very sober? - I was entirely sober.</p>

            ; then we walked on and turned to the right, and that took us into Mile-end road; then we went up Globe-lane, and in Globe-fields we met this man, the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100007"/>Did you know him before? - No, Chaffey stopped him and demanded his money, and the man resisted.</p>
               <p>Was you near enough to see Chaffey stop him? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him demand his money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what he said? - The man resisted, and Merryman struck at him with his stick, and knocked him down; and when we had taken his money, we all left him; and two took to the right and two to the left; and Merryman and I returned home together, and the other two went somewhere else.</p>
               <p>Do you know which of you it was that put your hands into his pocket? - Chaffey; I offered to put my hand into his pocket, but Chaffey shoved my hand away; it was a darkish night, just at the dusk of the evening.</p>
               <p>Was there any moon light? - No, Sir, there was not.</p>
               <p>How long might you be with the prosecutor? - About the space of eight minutes; nothing else was said to him that I know of, only I bid him stand still, and we would not hurt him.</p>

               <p>Did Merryman knock him down at the place where you first met him, or had he got away from the place? - He had struggled a little way from the place, about a yard.</p>
               <p>What sort of resistance did he make? - He caught hold of Chaffey, and held him; then Merryman struck him with a stick; I do not know where he got that stick, he had it in his hand before; the prosecutor said afterwards that Merryman took the stick out of his hand, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any thing said about cutlasses and pistols? - No, Sir, nothing at all; I did not hear any thing said by Merryman.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said about covering the face? - No, there was not; but Thrush did cover the man's face with his hat, when he resisted; I told him to stand still and he should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was not moon light? - Yes, I am sure it was not moon light.</p>
               <p>How long had you and the prisoners been out together? - We went out about two o'clock; we had been drinking together at the house where we went from before we set off.</p>
               <p>Were you in liquor, or sober? - Sober; I was not in liquor, nor I did not see that they were.</p>
               <p>Had you any acquaintance with Thrush before that time? - Yes, I knew him about a week; he used to use the house, but he had been away a great while; I had known Merryman to use that house for the space of three weeks; I had known Chaffey a great many years; I worked with him some years back, in the pack-thread spinning way; when I used to work with him, he lived in George-street.</p>
               <p>What is that house? - A publick house.</p>
               <p>What publick house? - The sign of the George, in George-yard, Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Were you at that house often? - I went there every night; I left the spinning trade, and was bound apprentice to a silk throwster.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoners Thrush, Merryman, and Sherrington in company; between seven and eight, at a publick-house in Whitechapel, I believe it is called George-yard; they were all in the publick-house.</p>
               <p>Were they in company together? - It was a strait seat were they sat, and there was another or two sat in the same company; Mr. Bevan, the prosecutor was sent for to Mr. Wilmot's; and the prisoners were committed; he came in a day or two afterwards, or I believe the next day.</p>
               <p>How came you to go after these men? - My Lord, I had information of Mr. Bevan's robbery; I had not seen Mr. Bevan then; I had seen an officer that belonged to our office, that came from him, and it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100008"/>was from that information we apprehended the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Was there any description given of them? - The description that came afterwards was from people that were in the neighbourhood; but I never received any description from Mr. Bevan.</p>
               <p>How came you to take up these people rather then any others? - From the information we received on going down to the gaol. - I heard Merryman and Thrust say to the accomplice, Sherrington, you B - r what did you narle for; I heard them say so more than once or twice; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Had Sherrington at that time told? - Yes, he had told the whole.</p>
               <p>Did Sherrington tell the whole immediately upon being taken up? - They went down as a night charge, and the next day he told the whole before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was it a wet night or a fair night? - It was rather hazy, it was not wet, it was perfectly light, because I could see perfectly over the fields, almost as perfectly as I can see now.</p>

Somebody was talking of searching, and at the same time, somebody said there was a watch on the ground, and a watch was found on the ground, just at his feet; and I believe the watch was picked up by the same person; I then said it was proper to take the prisoner to the watch-house, and I assisted to take him there.</p>
               <p>Then Strickland was the only person that you took up? - I did not hear that any body else was concerned till after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Strickland. He said, he would do me, and bring an assault against me; I said, if you think I have any thing, search me? - I said, in case you get through this, for your treatment to me, I will bring an action against you for an assault; because he did not only strike, but kicked me; I did not wish to mention that circumstance.</p>
               <p>Did he say to you, if you think I have any thing about me, search me? - I do not remember any thing of the kind.</p>

               <p>About eleven o'clock the 24th evening, coming through Cranbourn-passage, at the end of Castle-street, I saw the prosecutor, and heard a cry, I have lost my watch; Strickland ran away; I came up immediately and laid hold of the prisoner's arm, and conveyed him to the corner of Cranbourn Alley, when he put his hand to his pocket as I had hold of him, and dropped the watch, I saw him drop it. I never saw him before, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What distance was that place where you was first hustled from the place where you lost your watch? - About as far as from here to that window.</p>
               <p>PRISONER STRICKLAND's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I work for one Mr. Smith in the Alley; I had two pair of shoes in my pocket; there was a mob of people; this gentleman was quite in liquor; and between Mr. Young's shop door and the corner, there was a watch; there were ten people trying to get hold of the watch; I might stoop to pick the watch up, I do not doubt but I did. I did not get hold of it, somebody kicked me over the hands; they searched me in Cranbourn Alley, and the watch was found in Castle-street.</p>
               <p>Who searched you? - This gentleman here in the white coat, and this gentleman in the blue coat.</p>
               <p>To Ravenhill; did you search him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He felt every where; the watchman had a person in custody for taking the watch from him at the same time, and the watchman then said he would swear to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Although your Lordship does not call on the other prisoner, John M'Intosh, for his defence, I think it necessary to state to the court, that he is an apprentice to a reputable tradesman, and has many persons of great consideration to appear to his character; it is a shameful thing they should have brought him here.</p>
               <p>Court. There is not the least imputation upon him.</p>
               <p>Ravenhill. I delivered the watch to the constable of the night; I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Have you the watch? - I have not seen it since that night at Mr. Hyde's office, it was shewn me, but they durst not let me have it.</p>
               <p>Did you see it after it had been pickt up, and before you went to the Justice? - Yes, I did; and at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100011"/>Can you swear it was your watch? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>What is the constable's name? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newman. It appears by the commitment, that his name is David Chrichton.</p>
               <p>Where is he?</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; on the 3d of November, as I was going home through the King's Mews, I think between eight and nine in the evening, I came through the south part of the Mews into <placeName id="t17881210-6-crimeloc32">Castle-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17881210-6-crimeloc32" type="placeName" value="Castle-street"/>

                        targets="t17881210-6-off30 t17881210-6-crimeloc32"/>, and this woman asked me in a familiar manner, how I did; I stopped; she gave me a pinch of snuff, and asked me for something to drink; I think I gave her a penny; and I think she desired me to step within-side the Mews; I was then out of the Mews.</p>
               <p>She asked you to step into the Mews? - I think so; however we went into the Mews; she pressed me close against the wall, and asked me what I would give her, I said I had some half pence in my pocket, and I would give her all the half-pence I had; at the same time, I removed my watch into my waistcoat pocket, chain and all; for I suspected by her manner, she meant to take it; she pressed me close to the wall again, and went from me abruptly; I put my hand to my waist coat pocket, and missed my watch; I made a stretch after her, and caught hold of her left hand; I said she had taken my watch, for all her kindness; she denied it; I asked to search her, and she would not permit me; a person unknown to me came past at the time; I desired him to search her, which he did, and declared she had no watch; I did not know that person; it was dark.</p>

               <p>She would let him search her, would she? - Yes; I said she had my watch, and I would keep by her till I had her searched; we went then out of the Mews into Castle-street together; I had hold of her arm all the while, and through Orange-court, into Orange-street; and I entreated her to give me the watch; and I said I would take her to the office. She wanted to get into a publick house in Orange-street to get gin; I said it was not gin I wanted, I wanted my watch; she struggled then not to go into the office; we went through Long's-court, and she went into the pawn-broker's at the corner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100012"/>we both went in together; she said she wanted a petticoat; that she had a countryman, who would pledge his watch; I said she had stole or picked my watch out of my pocket, and I wanted her searched; a person in the shop discovered the watch in her stocking.</p>
               <p>Did you see it taken out? - Yes; she took it out herself, and desired I should take it. Mr. Crouch, the pawn-broker, desired I should not, till he had sent for constable: she laid it down on the counter till the constable came in; she begged of me to take the watch, and I wished to have taken it; however the constable took her away and the watch; I went to the office, and begged the clerk and constable to discharge her, and they said they could not; and I was obliged to attend the next day at the office; I told them if it was possible to discharge her, I wished it; they said they could not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>He gave me the watch, when I told him I was in distress; he said he did not mind pawning his watch for half-a-crown, so as I would give him part of the money; the next day we went to the pawn-broker together, and the pawn-broker said, did you give the woman the watch, or did she take it; he said I took it, and the pawnbroker sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was this woman an acquaintance of your's before? - I think I have seen her in the street before.</p>
               <p>Was she a country woman of your's? - I only know by her manner of speech; she affected the Scotch dialect, and spoke very familiar. I know no further.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you give her the watch? - No, by no means.</p>
               <p>Nor you did not agree that the watch should be pawned to redeem her petticoat? - No.</p>
               <p>There was not then any agreement between you that any money should be raised on this watch? - None at all; I gave her nothing but the half-pence, nor promised her any thing but the half-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me nothing.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was you in liquor at all? - No quite to her; I had walked eight miles, and was on my way home; then I had nothing.</p>
               <p>I think you said you had some suspicion before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive her hands about you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive them in your pocket about your which, that made you suspect? - No; I do not recollect that I felt her take the watch from me.</p>
               <p>But you will not swear upon your oath, that you did not perceive, at the time just before she abruptly left you, you did not perceive her hand in your waistcoat pocket? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she walk away from you? - Yes; a few paces, about two yards.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CROUCH sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawn-broker; on the 3d of November, the prisoner and the prosecutor came into our shop; the prisoner said she had brought a countryman to pawn his watch; he said no, she had robbed him of his watch, and that she denied having the watch; and he said he was quite confident she had it; I asked her if she had taken his watch from him, and she denied it to me; then he wished to have a constable sent for; and when the constable was going for, she put her foot on a bench in the shop, and I looked over the counter, and saw the watch in her shoe, and she took it out from her stocking; the constable came, and the prosecutor wanted me to give him the watch; the constable took the watch off the counter, and took her to the justice.</p>
               <p>Was the man sober? - Yes; he appeared as sober as he is now.</p>
               <p>Was the woman sober? - I believe she was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you know the woman before? - I have seen her before.</p>
               <p>Had she ever pawned any thing at your shop? - Nothing but her own articles.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing in pawn of her's at your shop at that time? - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100013"/>recollect that there was; she mentioned something of a petticoat, she either said she wanted to buy one, or to fetch one out of pledge, I am not sure which; I was busy with other customers.</p>

            , Mr. Pritchard's apprentice, came to my shop, I was writing at the compting-house; he begged I would go and take two men; the prisoners were walking together up Caray-lane, and I following them; the prosecutor's shop is in <placeName id="t17881210-16-crimeloc71">Goldsmith's-street</placeName>

               <p>Where was the counterpane? - Under his arm.</p>
               <p>Was it under his coat or not? - No, under his arm, I believe his left arm, openly; it was not wrapped in any thing.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any conversation at this time between the other prisoner and Harris? - I do not know that they said a word, they appeared to be talking, but I could not hear a word.</p>
               <p>Were they arm in arm together? - No, they were not, at they were walking very close.</p>
               <p>When you laid hold of Harris, did the other man walk on before you took the parcel, or afterwards? - He went on, upon my taking the parcel he walked slowish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner Harris's counsel. Where was it that you first got sight of these people; you say in Cary-lane? - Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>I believe they were pretty near the end of Cary-lane when you first got sight of them? - They were nearer to Gutter-lane.</p>
               <p>Harris made no resistance when you took him? - No, only said, do not collar me.</p>
               <p>And the bundle quite visible to any body, as you would carry it? - Just the same.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you at the time you took hold of him that it was that man who had the bundle, that he had given it to him to carry? - I do not recollect that; I recollect his saying, when I told him he had robbed Mr. Gibbons, you are mistaken.</p>
               <p>And the other walked off? - He said not a word, but walked off; he took the first opportunity of turning up the first court that came in his way.</p>
               <p>I believe you have heard the other confess that he was the man who took it, and that he only gave it to Harris to carry for him? - I believe Solomon said, as they went into the coach to Newgate, that if he was cast, his father would have no peace in the synagogue.</p>
               <p>Is that parcel in the same state it was when you found it? - It has been opened before the Alderman and the Grand Jury.</p>

               <p>I am a hair dresser; the prisoners came along the street, and stopped under Mr. Stokes's window, and discoursed one with the other; I do not know what they said; this was in Goldsmith-street, they looked round them and walked back, and looked in every window till they came to Mr. Gibbons's, then they crossed to the otherside of the way, and went a little way up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100016"/>Wood-street, I cannot tell how far, I could not see round the corner, they came back again, then Solomon crossed over to Mr. Gibbons's, and just put his foot into the house, and listed off this counterpane, and came out again with it hanging at his side, in his hand.</p>
               <p>What was it from a shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he do with it? - He had it hanging on his hand, and he put it under his arm, when he went four or five yards from the house; I left my master's shop, and ran to Mr. Stratton's, and informed him, and desired him to follow them; Stratton is ablacksmith, he is a constable.</p>
               <p>What became of Harris? - Harris was on the otherside of the way when Solomon went into the shop, and when he had got about two doors from where he took the counterpane, Harris crossed over to him; I could not hear any conversation pass between them.</p>
               <p>Did Solomon part with the counterpane? - Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Are ye sure they went away together? - Yes, I went to the constable, and they were taken in Foster-lane; the prisoners are the men, I saw the property taken from Harris, I took it from the constable, and took the prisoners by the collar; when we went to the counter I gave it to the constable again; this is the same counterpane I am sure, it was tied in this paper, there was a mark tore out of the paper, and here is the place where it was tore.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen, Prisoner Harris's Council. How far distant from the prosecutor's shop is it that you live? - About eight yards.</p>
               <p>Had you the same opportunity of seeing both the prisoners? - I saw them both very plain; I saw Harris plainer than the other, because he stood out of the shop, and Solomon, went in.</p>
               <p>Have you never said that you could swear to Solomon, and not to Harris? - No, Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>Then you undertake positively to swear to one as well as the other? - I do.</p>
               <p>In what situation was Harris, that you can swear to him so positively? - He had not the same cloaths on I know, but I can tell him by his hair being cued, and curls in his side, and his features.</p>
               <p>Did you never say you could not swear so positively to Harris as to the other? - I can swear to them both alike.</p>
               <p>And that you have always said? - I have.</p>
               <p>You swear to that? - I do.</p>
               <p>This was found openly under his arm? - Yes, he made no resistance at all.</p>
               <p>Mr Gibbons; this is my counterpane, I had such a one in my shop; when I went out, it stood in the corner of the window.</p>
               <p>When you returned was it missing? - It was.</p>
               <p>Do you believe that to be your counterpane? - There was a mark on the paper that is torn out; I do not know it by the counterpane, but by the paper; there was a mark of the prime cost in letters, and also there was a small mark signifying the size of the counterpane, the one mark is entirely torn away, in the other there is a small part left.</p>
               <p>Was that your writing? - One of them was.</p>
               <p>And no part of the paper was torn, but this where the mark was? - No, Mr. Knowlys.</p>
               <p>You say there is no letter remaining, which expresses any part of the prime cost, but there is a part of a stroke? - No writing more.</p>
               <p>Then I take it for granted you cannot distinguish that small part of a stroke that distinguishes, it from any other person's stroke? - I had an eight quarter counterpane standing in my house, when I went out, and when I returned I missed it.</p>
               <p>Have you any of your servants here? - No, no servant of mine could ever swear to the counterpane, because had this been mixed with eight or ten more, it would have been impossible for me, or any body else, to have sworn to it.</p>

               <p>I know Harris the prisoner, I have known him a year and half, he gets his living in going to sales. On Thursday the 18th of Sept. I went with him to a sale, I called upon him in the morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, the Sale was at Robins's in Covent Garden; and going along through Cary-lane, the other prisoner met with him, with a bundle under his arm.</p>
               <p>Before that time, I had he been with Solomon, or with you? - No, he was with me, I called upon him at his lodging, at No. 4, Carter-street, Hounsditch; the other prisoner desired Harris to take hold of the bundle, while he was doing something to his shoe, and they stopped together; I told Harris I could not stop, I would meet him at the sale in Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>What sale was that? - Robins's sale, in the Piazzas. I left Harris along with the other prisoner, in Cary-Lane.</p>
               <p>Court. What time was this? - Between ten and eleven in the morning of the 18th of September.</p>
               <p>Did you and he go to Cary-lane together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And had you been with him all the morning before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to North. What time did this happen? - Between eleven and half after, or or a quarter, I cannot say rightly to the time.</p>
               <p>They were out of your sight before they were taken? - Not a minute hardly.</p>
               <p>Court to Levy. Did you leave him after this? - I left them both together in Cary-lane, I was not present when they were taken.</p>
               <p>How do you know it was between ten and eleven, when you called upon him? - Because the sales generally begin between twelve and one, and we generally go there an hour before the time, to look at the goods; it was very near eleven when I called upon him.</p>

               <p>I apprehended the prisoner on the 31st of October; Mr. Morgan shewed me seven deals, in a shed, in Shoulder of Mutton-Alley; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Morgan. They are the same deals I saw the prisoner put into the shed; I put my name upon them.</p>

               <p>I let the man through the lock, and he desired me to shove the barge to the wharf, I did so, because she lay adrift; Graham jumped on board the barge; I never saw the deals taken out of the barge; a young fellow gave me a glass of liquor, and asked me to carry a deal.</p>
               <p>Court to Whatley. Was he in liquor? - He appeated so.</p>
               <p>Morgan. He did not.</p>

            ; I was one; as we were coming by Northumberland-house, there were two women and the prisoner; there were a great many people: I had on my head some prints; I happened to come between these two women, and the bundle that was on my head happened to touch one of the women over the head; the prisoner at the bar made no more to do, he laid hold of the bundle, and pulled it off my head; he struck at me, I struck at him again, which blow I missed; then he struck at me again, and knocked me down to the ground; I got up again; I could hardly recover myself from the blow I received; for when I was down, he kicked me in the eye; I said to the people, how can you see a man knocked down in this manner, and not take a boy's part; I said, says I, d - n me, lend me a stick, and I will knock him down; then he ran after my fellow-apprentice; and a boy said, that woman has run away with your goods; and I ran to several places after her, but never heard of the goods afterwards; I had hold of the goods, when he pulled them; I had not much power to hold them as they were on my head.</p>
               <p>Did he pull them away clean from you? - I felt him pull them off.</p>
               <p>When you struck at him again, you neither of you had the bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>What time was it? - I believe, to the best of my knowledge, it was about six in the evening, or rather after; there were a great number of people passing by.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's council. Was it on the Northumberland side of the way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The shops were not shut up? there was light enough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No great chance of a man's getting away? - No.</p>
               <p>Those two women were women of the town? - They seemed to be so.</p>
               <p>You and your fellow-apprentice were a little witty with them? - Yes; I said d - n you, stand out of the way.</p>
               <p>You said d - n you, you b - h, stand out of the way? - I did not say b - h; the bundle was gone before any blows were struck.</p>
               <p>When he had licked you, then he wanted to lick your fellow-apprentice? - Yes; as I lay on the ground my fellow-apprentice struck at him.</p>
               <p>How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Dorrington? - I never saw him, to the best of my knowledge, till I came to Mr. Hyde's.</p>
               <p>Dorington is the sweeper at Mr. Hyde's? - I do not know, I heard him say he belonged to Justice Hyde.</p>
               <p>He advised this prosecution, I believe, and was to have three guineas? - I never heard he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100029"/>What are you to pay him? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Has not he preferred these two indictments? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether there is any reward in case this man should be convicted of a highway robbery? - I heard say there was, but I said I did not want any thing.</p>
               <p>Then you heard it was twice forty pound if you could but find him guilty? - I heard there was forty pound among four.</p>
               <p>What four? - The two that took him; they belong to one Mr. Smith, an ivory turner, and me and my fellow-apprentice.</p>
               <p>Is not Dorrington the fourth? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who was this judge that told you about the reward? - It was Mr. Whitfield.</p>
               <p>What judge is he? - That was at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Then this man never meddled with you till you told the women to stand out of the way? - No.</p>
               <p>And then he licked you both? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much is the grave-digger to have? - I did not hear.</p>
               <p>Court. When you ran after the woman, did you come back again? - Yes; to see if I could see my fellow-prentice any where, and two women told me the man was in the watch-house; I went there, and then to my master.</p>

               <p>I am the fellow-apprentice of the last witness; we usually go round to the customers for linens; we went down to Westminster about half after six; coming by Charing-cross, we saw two women and the prisoner; the other witness had the load on his head; he went between the two women; the bundle touched one of them over the head; the man caught at the bundle, and pulled it off; he turned round to save the bundle, and the man knocked him down, and kicked him on the ground; I went to assist him, and the man struck at me; I ran away from him, and he ran after me; and caught hold of my handkerchief, and almost throttled me, and tore my shirt; he was taken into custody by one Smith, and he threw something on the ground; I do not know what became of the bundle; it was lost.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner touch the bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him pull it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he was pulling at the bundle, did not you think it was necessary to take some care of it? - I did not see what became of the bundle at all.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing said by your fellow-apprentice? - I did not hear him say any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner say any thing? - No; he pulled the bundle off his head, and he struck at him, and the prisoner struck at him again; I did not hear the prisoner say any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There was plenty of room for your fellow-prentice to pass between the women? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Of course he said nothing to them, not they to him? - No; I am quite sure I heard nothing pass.</p>
               <p>If he had said d - n you, get out of the way, to the women, you would have heard that perhaps? - I did not hear any thing.</p>
               <p>How much of the reward are you to have? - I have not heard any thing about a reward.</p>
               <p>You was not at the office with your fellow-apprentice? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Do you know a person of the name of Whitfield? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you hear Whitfield say that there was a reward of forty pound to be divided among four of you? - I did hear something of forty pound penalty; I did not know any thing of any reward I was to have; I understood that it was forty pound penalty if we did not appear.</p>
               <p>Did not he say, there was forty pound to be divided between four of you? - I have heard talk of forty pound reward.</p>
               <p>Why did you tell me just now that you knew of no reward? - I had heard of it.</p>
               <p>Who advised you to prefer an indictment<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100030"/>for a highway robbery? - They said, at the office, that it was a street robbery.</p>
               <p>Who said so, Dorrington? - I have not seen him; he only sent us to Hicks's-hall, and gave instructions for the hill.</p>
               <p>How much is Dorrington to have, if you convict this man? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he is to have three guineas? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know what the goods were that he had on his head? - There were two whole pieces of callico, one was ell wide, and the other yard wide, and there were other quantities.</p>
               <p>What colour? - The yard wide one was a dark pattern, and the other a lightish pattern.</p>

               <p>When the man was taking the prisoner to the watch-house, I missed my handkerchief; I had it when I went to Westminster, and when I was at Charing-cross I had it.</p>
               <p>Was it about your neck or in your pocket? - In my pocket; they went down stairs to search the man, and they brought up two pocket-handkerchiefs and a rule; and I said one was mine; there was W. T. at one corner; and they looked and found it.</p>
               <p>What passed between him and you before? - He had got hold of my neck by my handkerchief when Mr. Smith came out; and he struck me several times.</p>

               <p>Had you your handkerchief then? - I do not know; I did not know I had lost my handkerchief till I got into the watch-house; I lost nothing else.</p>
               <p>Had you any money in your pocket? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100031"/>Yes, I had some halfpence in my waistcoat pocket; the handkerchief was in my coat pocket.</p>

               <p>In the scuffle he had changed hats with your fellow servant? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your handkerchief was not worth stealing? - It was of no great worth.</p>

               <p>Court. Was that found in the same pocket with the rule and the other handkerchief? - One handkerchief was in each pocket, and a rule in his breeches pocket.</p>

               <p>I was present at the time of this affray; the boy was running up St. Martin's-lane, and the prisoner after him; the boy crossed over the way, and ran into a publick-house, and the prisoner ran after him; the boy laid down a light-coloured handkerchief, I cannot say this was it; he took it up, and put it in his pocket; the prisoner took up the handkerchief off the ground, and the hat laid in the kennel; the prisoner had no hat on; I took the hat and put it on the prisoner's head, then the boy said, why did you rob my fellow-servant; I saw the handkerchief picked up.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, you see, with respect to this, it was a suspicious circumstance; in the scuffle it some how got out of the man's pocket, and this young fellow took it up; he had lost his hat, so that it seems very little probable that he should be committing a highway robbery for the sake of such an handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Was you in the shop? - I was engaged with five or six customers at the time the apprentice came up to me, and said there was a woman in the shop that he suspected had pilfered something; I said, do not let her go out of the shop, but take it from her, if she has any thing; with that the woman was just coming out of the shop, opposite to me, and made me a very low curtsey, and bade me good night; the boy said this is the woman; I stamped with my foot, and said, why do not you take the goods from her; with that the boy went up to her, and followed her out, but still did not take the goods from her; I jumped over the counter, and went out after them; I met the boy in the doorway, she was with him; he had hold of her shoulder; I laid hold of the prisoner, and saw her drop a piece of printed cotton, and I took it up; I felt it drop on my foot.</p>
               <p>Did you see her drop it? - I saw her drop it from under her left arm; I stooped and picked it up, and delivered it to the constable, who has it; the piece was the same I saw her drop; when she came back into the shop, she kneeled down, and begged forgiveness.</p>
               <p>What was become of the other young woman that came into the shop with her? - She was gone off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's council. How many persons were there in the shop at the time this happened? - I think as near as I can guess, half a score customers, and about six young men behind the counter.</p>
               <p>You, of your own knowledge, had not observed any thing till your boy gave you notice? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was taken into another room and searched? - No, she never was searched; she was taken into my warehouse till the constable was sent for; I had found the goods before she was taken there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Let the boy go out for a moment. You did not know the prisoner before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Therefore the boy could not direct you to her by any name; what description did he give you of her; did he tell you the woman in red hair? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Was not there, in truth, another woman in the shop at the time in red hair? - I do not know, indeed.</p>
               <p>Do you know now that another person in the shop had red hair? - There were a great many other persons in the shop.</p>

               <p>I was standing in the shop lighting the lamps, when the prisoner and another person came in; there was a large pile of prints about two yards from her, and she moved on the other side of the pile of prints; I did not see any thing that was done, for the prints hindered me; but when I had done lighting the lamps, I missed a particular piece of print which laid there single by itself, about eight minutes before; I told my master I thought that woman had something with her; he told me to follow her; I rather refused, I was not sure; I did not like to go; he was angry, and I was obliged to go; I followed her, and brought her back to the door, and there she dropped a piece of print by his foot, and he picked it up; that particular print lay by itself under a pile of prints.</p>
               <p>Did you see her drop it? - No, I did not, distinctly; my master had hold of her.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take it? - No, I could not see her take it, for the prints prevented me seeing her.</p>
               <p>How many of your own people were there in the shop? - About five or six who served customers.</p>
               <p>Who was the person that was serving this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100033"/>young woman? - His name is James; he is not here.</p>

               <p>Did you see him lay it down? - I did; then he returned to the contrary side of the way again, and was stopped by Mr. James Sansom, then, by this time that he was stopped, I had taken my bonnet in my hand, and I came up, and said, that is the man who has knocked me down, see in what manner he has used me, with my cap hanging in this manner; the watchman came up, and I said to him, take care of him; then he said, he was not the person, that he did not push me down, he did not offend me; to be sure he saw me lay there, but that he did not push me down; then he said, if I have affronted you, Madam, I ask your pardon; says I, young man, the affront you have put upon me, was it nothing else, I am determined you shall ask my pardon in another manner, such insults as these are not to be born; upon that he was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>What distance was he from you when you first saw him? - I might be as far from him as that gentleman who stands by the candle.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - To my knowledge, I never saw him in my life.</p>
               <p>Did you see him all the while? - He never was out of my sight from the time he took my bonnet, till I left him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Then, upon your oath, could you be sure of the man? - Upon my oath I could single out that man from five thousand; he was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>You lost nothing else? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. Mrs. Partridge, he spoke of what he had done as an affront, which he begged pardon for? - Yes, Sir, and my words were, was it only for the insult, I would punish him.</p>
               <p>Describe a little the manner in which you was thrown down? - I must, I suppose, Sir, be particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100036"/>If you will be so good; it may be disagreeable; it at first had the appearance of an indecent attack upon you; of a rude and immodest attack? - Rather so.</p>
               <p>You conducted yourself, as undoubtedly you are, like a modest woman, who did not chuse such an attack? - I did, it was done so instantly, I had hardly any time for recollection.</p>
               <p>The first attempt was that which, unfortunately, modest women are subject to from low fellows in the street, indecently laying hold of part of your cloaths? - He turned round and met me, with one hand he stooped down and laid hold of my leg, with the other he laid hold of my clothes behind, and threw me down with the greatest force.</p>
               <p>Recollect, and be so good to understand I am not questioning your veracity, tell what the charge was, that you made at the watch-house? - Perfectly well, Sir, I remember the charge I gave; I went with my bonnet in my hand, it was not in a state fit to put on; I waited there a full hour for the officer of the night; in which time I put my bonnet a little straight; I told him he had torn my cap, and had taken my bonnet away; and described the manner in which he took it, and brought it back; how they set down their charge I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was not it knocking her down and otherwise ill-using her, the corner of Tavistock-street? - I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Was not it treated as an impudent immodest thing in this fellow? - It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Did it enter your head at all that this man intended to rob you, or did you charge him with a robbery? - I certainly did, or else I would not have called out stop thief.</p>
               <p>Was you present when he was searched? - I never saw him searched at all.</p>
               <p>Do you happen to know whether there were any weapons of any sort found upon him? - I never heard any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>He did not make any demand of money, or say any thing to you? - He did not speak a word to me.</p>
               <p>Court. You say he ran across the street with your bonnet in his hand? - He ran across Tavistock-street, which I believe is about the width from where I stand to the window; upon my crying stop thief he returned again to the same side of the way, and about twenty yards from me, he laid it down on the pavement, and then returned to the contrary side of the way again.</p>
               <p>There were people in the street, was not there? - My Lord, it was a snowy night, I walked very fast, I passed a gentleman and lady near the middle of the street, I believe they were behind me, they followed me to the watch-house door, but was not admitted; they were the only two people I saw in the street; Tavistock-street is not a very publick street at night.</p>
               <p>Were the shops shut? - Yes, I believe they always shut up there at eight o'clock.</p>

               <p>Was he drunk or sober? - To all appearance he was very sober; the constable said to him, young man you seem very sober; he did not say a word to me, till she came down.</p>

               <p>Court. When one half of the sash is pulled to, is the other half large enough for a man to get in? - I do not think a man could get in, but a boy might; there was nothing gone out of that room; I proceeded to the next room, and then to another, there I saw the drawers of the bureau were driven out, and his clothes pulled about; there was a wooden box which had been locked, was broke open, and the shirts and stocks that were in it pulled about, but nothing gone; I went into the yard and saw the ladder taken out and put against the next window to mine; it was the same sort of window; in the farm yard we found the cow-house door open, and the lock of the gardiner's tool-house was burst open, from whence the ladder was taken; I saw nobody about the house overnight, but between eleven and twelve o'clock when I went to bed the dog barked very much; the prisoner had lived in the family; when the prisoner was taken and going to the justice, he stepped aside to speak to me.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise or threatening used to him? - No, it was by the Adam and Eve, at Kensington; he said, Thomas, I hope you will not hurt me, I was drunken and foolish and did not know what I was about; I have done no harm, I have taken nothing away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's council. Explain what this place is; it is the outhouse, is it? - No, it is adjoining to the house, it is part of the mansion.</p>
               <p>How long did this man live in the family? - About seven months; he left us about February last.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner bear a good character? - But very indifferent.</p>
               <p>Not dishonest? - No.</p>
               <p>Drunken and foolish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner tell you who had been making him drunk? - No.</p>

               <p>Had you been much acquainted with him before? - No, I knew him when he was coachman at Ealing; there were two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100049"/>men in company, one is soldier, and the other a day labouring man; he went to another publick house, the Rose and Crown, staid there half an hour, and from thence to Brentford, I went with him, by the constable's orders the constable had taken the other two men, that were with the prisoner, but he did not know that; I did not go with him to the house; he went to Brentford, and from thence in Turnham-Green, and from there to Hammersmith, and at the Coach and Horses he gave me sixpence, to buy the dog some liquor; I gave it to the constable; he jumped over into the garden; I went and entered the garden with him, and then gave a signal for the other man to come up; he said, d - n your eyes, if you do not stand staunch to it, I will cut your throat; he jumped over into this garden, and we saw no more of him; we staid till about two; I believe the garden he jumped into, was about two hundred yards from Mr. James's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What are you? - look to those gentlemen? - I am a hard working man; I have a wife and family to maintain.</p>
               <p>What business? - I have been a postition.</p>
               <p>There has been a great many robberies in the place where you live? - A great many.</p>

               <p>Was your eye upon the door the moment the latch was lifted, if opened at all? - Certainly; the door was upon the latch when he opened it.</p>
               <p>Was your eye upon the latch when the latch rose, if it rose at all? - It was upon the door.</p>
               <p>Was it upon the latch? - Certainly it was, at the closure of the door.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the latch lift? - I heard the door open; it was opened as soon as possible.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the latch lift? - I did not positively hear it, because he opened it softly.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the door was latched at the time he came? - I am positive of it, upon my oath.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you never challenge the prisoner to fight, and he refused you? - If he did, I forget; I am very little for fighting.</p>
               <p>Was there any warehouse opposite to this, in which the sugar was kept? - One is here, and the other there; very like my master's dwelling house may be opposite; the warehouse is not directly opposite.</p>
               <p>(The prosecutor explained to the court, that the warehouse was not directly opposite, but they might see a part of each warehouse looking obliquely.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Schoen, prisoner's counsel. What way of life are you in, Sir? - I am <rs id="t17881210-86-viclabel383" type="occupation">with an attorney</rs>

               <p>And for the ornament of it I hope: this was about twelve at night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Curiosity, a very prevalent motive we know, induced you to follow them up the passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The same curiosity kept you three minutes there, to hear what they were mumbling? - I do not know whether it was three minutes.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was you all the time attending to the mumbling of these girls? - No, I was not, one of them was absent up the alley; my curiosity led me to see what she was going to do.</p>
               <p>This was a dark passage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That which you wished to hear talk, stood near to you of course? - I did not wish to hear either of them.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. You say there were four or five women round him? - There might be five or six.</p>

               <p>Mr. Peatt. Does it fall to your share to make the beds, or your Duenna? - Sometimes one and sometimes the other; it was not made that I know off till the next day; there were other people in the room, a man and woman were there after; we found nothing; there is a middle door, I opened it when they came down, and I saw the gentleman salute both the ladies when I carried up the wine, I am sure the presecutor was sitting in a chair, and he rose up to pay me.</p>

               <p>"According to my promise, I give</p>
               <p>"you commission for silks for gowns;</p>
               <p>"and I beg that you will take care that</p>
               <p>"they shall be very good, and particularly</p>
               <p>"in the colour, otherwise they will</p>
               <p>"not answer, as I told you before; you</p>
               <p>"may send also some cards of French</p>
               <p>"lace, the Tame as the last; and six or</p>
               <p>"eight pieces of China linen (nankeen)</p>
               <p>"as the other that were before sent to</p>
               <p>"me." The other parts of the letter are what she will do when she comes to town: In this letter was enclosed a bill of the Antwerp, which failed either the 11th or 12th of October; I sent the prisoner with it on the 11th of October, and three or four times after I sent him with a box; he asked me if I had wrote to Miss Bate of Aberdeen, as he received an answer by the post from her; the order was for two pieces of mode at 5 s. 6 d. and a piece of white satin at 7 s. or 8 s. Before I executed the order, I enquired Miss Bate's character, and received so satisfactory an account, that I determined to execute the order; and the order for the nankeens, I gave to Messrs. Leise and Co. In consequence of a letter I received, I suspected the goods were not sent; the prisoner was out at the time I went to the wharf to enquire if any such parcel had been brought there; in the course of the evening afterwards, I accused the prisoner; he denied it; I told him, that I had reason to believe that the letter which he had brought me, purporting to be the hand-writing of Miss Bate, was a forgery of his own, and that the receipt which he brought me, purporting to be the hand-writing of Captain

            , was a forgery also; and that the goods were made away with: he seemed to be much struck that I should entertain any such idea; why, says I, Jones, it is in vain for you to deny it; says I, here are two capital offences against you, two forgeries; he stood speechless for a quarter of an hour, looking down on the ground; at last he said, you will never see them again.</p>
               <p>You told him they were capital offences? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him it would be better for him if he did, or worse for him if he did not, confess? - I told him it was a duty incumbent upon me, both to myself and to the publick, to give him up to the law.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that it would be better for for him to confess the whole? - I told him, probably it might obtain him favour in the court, but I never promised him any mercy.</p>
               <p>Court. After that we cannot hear what he said, but you may tell us what you did in consequence of what he said? - We found part of the goods at Mr. Cave's, I think, the last Friday in October; there were twelve yards of the white sattin, part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100064"/>of forty-one yards, and some cards of lace, which are in court.</p>
               <p>What is Mr. Cave? - A haberdasher in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Were these things that you found at Mr. Cave's, part of the order? - They were; and the goods are in court; I found four pieces of nankeen at Mr. Bradbourne's, a taylor; a piece of lace at Mr. Fletcher's in the Strand; one piece at Mr. Wanley's; part of the modes, and four pieces of nankeen at the prisoner's lodgings in his box; I knew the lodgings to be his the whole time he lived with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask Mr. Loveday, whether he did not promise me not to prosecute, if I would produce the goods, or procure 40 l. to pay him down immediately? - He wanted me particularly to go to his friends to take a bond, which I refused; I told him it was neither doing justice to myself, nor the publick; I never made him any promise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to ask Mr. Loveday, whether he did not tell me, if I was given up to the law, I was a dead man; but if I could procure a friend to enter into a bond, either jointly or separately, or lay the money down, he would burn the paper, and say nothing more of it? - I never mentioned a word relative to burning the paper, of any kind.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect a remnant of white satin, and some lace that were found in your shop? - Yes; I bought them of the prisoner the latter end of October; they were found by Mr. Loveday and Mr. Leise.</p>
               <p>When, and from whom did you get these goods? - From the prisoner; I believe it was on the 14th of October, the prisoner called at my house, and solicited an order for Mr. Loveday, which he had frequently done before; I informed him there was nothing wanted; he then mentioned to me, that Mr. Loveday had got a piece of three-quarters satin that was damaged by the dresser, and he meant to return it on the dresser's hands; if I wished to buy it, he could sell it me a job; I told him it was an article we had very little call for, and sold very little of; but if Mr. Loveday proposed selling it very cheap, the first time he came by our house, he might call and shew it to me; he accordingly came the same morning, about three hours after, about three o'clock the same day, telling me had brought the piece of satin he was mentioning to me; I desired him to open it; I looked at it, and found it was burnt in several places, apparently by the dresser; I asked him the price, he said 6 s. or thereabouts, allowing two yards damages; I told him I could buy it cheaper; I made an account, and I offered him 4 s. a yard, that was the most I told him, and I would give no more; he told me he could not sell it for that; I told him I had not the least wish to give more; he stopped some time, and he said, he believed he must let me have it, and he would have no farther trouble with it; accordingly when I bought the satin of him, I desired him to make a bill of it, and I would pay him the money; I looked over the bill, and found it was right; then I said, I expected an interest of five per cent; he objected to that, that Mr. Loveday would not find it agreeable to him; I told him then to make my compliments to Mr. Loveday, and tell him to set it down to my account; he said the dresser was accountable; he believed he must let me have it; and I took the discount of five per cent. for them; after he had sold me the satin, says he, Mr. Cave, I have a few cards of black lace that I have to sell by commission, for a friend of mine, who supposes, as I know the trade, I should be more likely to sell them than he should; I looked at the laces, and asked him the prices of them; he told me the price; I thought them too dear; I left him: that was the only business at that time, and he went away; about ten days after he called, soliciting an order as before, for Mr. Loveday; I told him there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100065"/>was nothing wanted; he then mentioned to me that he had not sold all the black laces he shewed me before, he had a part of them left, and if I would take the trouble of looking at these he had, and he would tell him the most I would give for them, if he could take the money he would, as they were for a stranger, that wanted money; I looked at them, and told him the most I could give, paying ready money; he objected to the price of one or two, and said he could not take it; there is a bill in court, which the prosecutor has of the prices: after I paid him for the laces he went away.</p>
               <p>Court. You are a haberdasher in Holborn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any dealings with Mr. Loveday before this? - Yes; I bought some things some time back; I never bought any goods of this man; he called for orders; I never gave him any orders; I have dealt at Mr. Loveday's, but not in the time of this young man's living there.</p>
               <p>In what manner did you deal at that time? - They were gauzes, and some things; I did not go to the shop; I never go out; the goods are always brought to me; I gave my orders to the former young man that lived with Mr. Loveday; I do not know his name; the goods were bought with my approbation, and a bill of parcels were made of them; I bought them for credit; they were placed to my account by Mr. Loveday.</p>
               <p>Had you ever bought any for ready money before? - No, I believe I never did; I did not certainly; the account was closed some time back.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me advise you never to buy bargains in this way again; it is not a proper conduct for reputable men in trade; but take my advice, and do not do it again? - I will not, my Lord, I have had enough of it in this transaction.</p>
               <p>(The things produced.)</p>
               <p>This is the satin found at Mr. Cave's; I would not swear positively to the satin, because it is not impossible that another piece might be similar, but the papers they are in I swear positively to, with my own hand-writing in it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is that satin really damaged? - The satin when it went out of my house was quite perfect, as good a piece as ever I saw, but it had been singed in two places; Mr. Cave shewed me one part, which is about fourteen inches to the best of my knowledge; I asked him to give me that up with this, but it has never been given up; he then said, there was another piece that was cut out; the satin was worth 8 s. a yard, and Mr. Cave gave 4 s. for it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Several of the jury are in the satin trade (looks at the satin.)</p>

               <p>Look at those cards of lace? - I believe the laces are mine, but the cards are changed.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing that enables you to speak with certainty as to the laces? - I believe they are my patterns, but the cards are changed.</p>
               <p>Cave. I changed the cards; I will speak if you please; the laces were measured over when they were bought from the prisoner; the cards they were on were very indifferent ones; I desired one of my servants to put them on better cards, as they shewed better; that was the reason they were changed.</p>
               <p>What became of the other cards? - They may be about the shop now; we always change the cards: the satin was cut in three or four different parts of it; we threw away what we could make nothing off.</p>
               <p>Court to Cave. It is fit you should know the full extent of your imprudence, to call it no worse name. I can tell you this, that if you had been indicted on this, I should have left it to the jury; I should have given them no direction to have acquitted you; you do not stand in that situation now, and I hope your future conduct will keep you from the like again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to Cave. Whether there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100066"/>not some previous agreement between you and me before I brought the satin?</p>
               <p>Court. As that question goes rather to criminate Mr. Cave, than to excuse you, and as he is not indicted, I will not put that question to him.</p>
               <p>Cave. I will answer it, my lord, if you please, I wish to answer it; he never spoke to me respecting the satin, till the morning he called upon me, in the same manner I have related; there was no previous agreement.</p>
               <p>JAMES STARKEY sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner lodged at my house, I know when the prisoner brought his box to his lodging, five weeks last Saturday; I asked him what he had there; he said he had a box that was sent him out of the country; I cannot say whether it was the box that was found there, I never saw the box any where till it was brought down broke to pieces.</p>
               <p>Court to Loveday. What things did you find in this box? - Here are part of the modes, each piece has been cut.</p>
               <p>Are there any of the packages that you know? - I can swear to my hand writing on both pieces.</p>
               <p>Liefe. I can swear to the nankeen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I wish to ask Mr. Liefe a few questions, whether he did not go with Mr. Loveday and myself, to my uncle in Oxford-street, on purpose to get a bond signed for forty pound, in order to have the papers burnt, and the affair compromised.</p>
               <p>Liefe. We went with Mr. Jones, as he said, to his uncle's; Mr. Loveday went out of the coach to his uncle's, and I staid in the coach with Jones.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What have you else to say? - I have not been able to subpoena witnesses, otherwise I have very material ones.</p>
               <p>Court. You are not so uninformed a young man, as not to know that you have a right to subpoenas for your witnesses; and that if you could not have procured the attendance of those witnesses, the Court would have put off your trial? - I did not know it, I have several respectable gentleman to my character, but they are not in Court.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. The question whether this order was real or forged, is not material in the present case; and in this I have also the opinion of Mr. Justice Wilson; this might be an order of Miss Bate, of Aberdeen, and there might be a further order. If the prisoner had obtained the goods in consequence of that order, the offence would rather have been that of obtaining goods by false pretences; than that of felony; but whether the goods were obtained by a real order or not, it appears that instead of carrying them to the wharf, he opened the box, and took out the goods; that is clearly a felony.</p>

               <p>Court to Prisoner. You have been convicted upon very clear and satisfactory evidence, of an offence, attended with such circumstances, which if they had in point of law warranted an indictment and conviction for a capital offence, I certainly should not have recommended you to his majesty's mercy, because I do not remember a circumstance that appears more dangerous, as more aggravated by a breach of trust; you by an artful contrivance have availed yourself of the goods of your master, to plunder and convert them to your use; under these circumstances therefore you certainly ought to receive as severe a sentence, as the law can inflict; and the indictment not being capital, the punishment of the law is transportation for seven years; if the law permitted me to go further in this case, I certainly would do it; and therefore you may rest assured, that any reference of the case to me, unless any circumstances, that seem to be impossible, in this case should come out, I shall never recommend you to any remission of that sentence, which is, that you be <rs id="t17881210-89-punish398" type="punishmentDescription">

In a minute or two somebody hit me behind over the head, not the prisoner; Filcock came and assisted me to take him to the counter; I searched him, and found nothing upon him; we went to the City Arms in Lombard-street, and a witness came in named Clarke, who took the Black's account of the watch and locket, and delivered to him a watch and a locket, which the Black said were his, and which Clarke said he found, and a locket.</p>

               <p>Was you in company with the prisoner on the night he was taken at the fire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Relate what you know of this transaction? - I was at one Mr. Gill's, in Whitechapel; we had a pot of beer, the prisoner and me; I was going home to Hammersmith; I said you may as well take a walk along with me, it was between the hours of eight and nine; there was a fire.</p>
               <p>Where does the prisoner live? - In Priest-alley, Tower-Dock, No. 11.</p>
               <p>Was the alehouse from whence you went in the way to his home, as well as to yours? - No, it certainly was not: coming to the fire, I stopped there about five minutes; that might be between eight and nine; the prisoner had his left hand on my right shoulder, and a stick in his right hand; he was complaining to me of a pain he had in his leg, from a fall from a horse, about five weeks back; there was a bustle among the people, and a shoving, and the prosecutor took hold of a stout lusty man, in a light-coloured drab coat, he got away from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Then you swear that the prosecutor first took hold of a stout man,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100069"/>with a light coloured drab coat on, who got away from him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did he take hold of him? - By the collar; I might be two or three yards from him, I cannot tell exactly the distance, by the crouding of the people; I could not hear any thing he said to him; the man broke away from him; the prisoner had hold of me at that time.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner nearer to the black man than you was, or was you nearer to the black man? - I never saw the black man, till he seized hold of the stout lusty man; I saw him then; to the best of my knowledge I was nearer to him, he had his left hand on my right shoulder; he had a stick in his right hand; the stout lusty man got away from the prosecutor, and he seized hold of the prisoner, and said, you have got my watch. I have got no watch, says the prisoner, search me; and the scourge of people took away the prisoner and carried him to the counter.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is a butcher, I believe? - I believe he is a butcher, and kept a shop in Russel-street, Covent-Garden, about two years back; his father before him was a butcher; I have known the prisoner from a baby.</p>
               <p>He had the misfortune to fail? - He had, he is now a journeyman; I never knew any thing against him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Newman, or Fillcock, or Harrison there? - No, there was a struggling among the multitude, and the prisoner was taken away; I do not know by who; I could not follow then, but an hour after I knew he was carried to the counter; I could not get time to tell them he was innocent when they took him, the people crowded so.</p>

               <p>Was the fire in your road home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was the prisoner going with you? - As far as St. Paul's, to the Goose and Gridiron; then I should have gone to Piccadilly, and taken the stage.</p>
               <p>You knew nothing of the fire when you was drinking at the alehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>Then coming along you stopt out of curiosity? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You did nothing good or bad? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did you desert your friend, when they charged him with taking the watch? - The hustle of the people was so great, that I did not know which way he went, when they carried him away, till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Did you appear before the justice the next morning? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Was you examined? - I was called in, and sent out again; before I went in again, they said I had no business there; Mr. Harrison says to me, you have been making it up with this man, concerning the watch; No, says I, I have not; I went to him, and spoke to him directly, and asked him; No says he, I never saw you before; there was a little man, a barber, with a loose coat on Mr. Harrison, said I, wanted to make it up with him.</p>
               <p>Court to Harrison. Was the witness at the justices the next day? - He was; I know him very well; he came to give an account, if they would let him; I told him afterwards, that I suspected he was going to make it up.</p>
               <p>Jury to Fisher. What way are you in now? - I have not followed business these two years; I have above fifty pounds a year, and I had one hundred fifty pounds, when it was left me; I have nobody but my wife and myself; and we live upon it, at Brook-Green, under Mr. Ward.</p>

               <p>Then you have not had many opportunities of being with this man or seeing him? - No, [the prisoner said something to the witness.] the day he was apprehended, his sister asked me to go to a publick house, facing the mansion house; I went into the publick house; his sister was speaking to the prosecutor, and I heard the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100070"/>black man say, that all he wanted was his property again; that he could not swear to any body.</p>
               <p>How came you forget this when you first came up? - Are you asked me the other question first.</p>
               <p>Has any body put it into your mind since? - No, Sir, nobody.</p>
               <p>Has nobody spoke to you? - Nobody, not till now, that the prisoner spoke to me; the black man said, that he only wanted his property again, as he could not swear to any body there were the words.</p>
               <p>That was said before the sister of this prisoner and you, and several other people? - I do not know, to my knowledge, they there was any body heard it besides the prisoner's sister; and myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Darby. Did you say to this woman, or the prisoner's sister, or to any body, that you could not swear to any one? - I did not say any such thing, they came after me to make it up, and I told them I would not.</p>
               <p>Did this woman come to help to make it up? - Yes, with another woman, wanted to ask me questions, I told them I could not; they wanted me to go with them, and wanted to ask me questions; my business was at home, I would not.</p>
               <p>Did this woman, or did the other woman in her presence, and when she was there, offer to make it up with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How was that offer made? - The value of the watch to make it up, and not make any words.</p>
               <p>Who offered the value of the watch? - His sister.</p>
               <p>Was this woman present? - She was there, she heard it.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Leak. What did you go to him for? - I went with his sister, I cannot say what she went to him for.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing said about making it up, upon your oath? - Not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Not a syllable? - Not a syllable.</p>
               <p>Nor about giving him the value of the watch to drop the prosecution? - Not in my presence; I did not ask him any questions; I went with her; I cannot positively say I did not hear her asked the man any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Then he voluntarily without being asked any questions, said, what he wanted was his property again? - She went and spoke to him, I do not know what questions she asked him; I heard him say, what he wanted was his property again, that he could not swear to any one; I did not hear the question, I only heard the answer.</p>

               <p>Then all that he said to you was, that your master had sent him for a couple of hats? - Yes, he said your master is at our house, and says you must give me the cocked hat, and round hat, that lay in the window; upon which I delivered them to him.</p>
               <p>Did you deliver them because you thought your master was at this house, and had sent for them? - I did; I saw him come in to order them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you send the prisoner, or any body for the cocked hat, and the round hat, out of the window? - No, I did not.</p>

My Lord, I mean to submit to your Lordship, that upon the facts which have been stated, it is impossible to sustain the present prosecution; I need not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100072"/>cite to your Lordship, cases to establish this, which I take to be the first principle of criminal law; for from the definition of larceny, and other offences, which are perfectly distinct from that of larceny, it is perfectly clear, that this is not a felony; and I shall take the liberty of contending that it is no other crime punishable here; the definition of larceny from Serjeant Hawkins's Pleas of the Crown, is in point; and I submit that there has not been any thing in this case, but that which by the most forced construction can be made a misrepresentation; he mistates a transaction, he lays his caution asleep, and induces him to part with the goods of his master; my Lord, I submit that includes no trespass in point of common sense, or in point of law: my Lord, I contend this would not constitute a cheat; and that if this man was now trying under such an indictment, he could not possibly be convicted; and for that, I think, I have the authority of all the writers on criminal law; Serjeant Hawkins says, of cheats punishable by prosecution, there are two kinds, &amp;c. and he says,</p>
               <p>"A cheat that is accompanied</p>
               <p>"with no manner of artful contrivance,</p>
               <p>"is not punishable by a criminal prosecution." He does not say it is not punishable as a felony, but it is not punishable by a criminal prosecution; and he says,</p>
               <p>"Because it is accompanied with</p>
               <p>"no manner of artful contrivance." What is the present case? A false pretence of having a message and order for that purpose; and I argue from proving that it is not a cheat, a fortiori, that it cannot be a felony. This transaction is accompanied with no manner of artful contrivance; if he had brought one of his master's shop-bills, one of his master's hats, or his master's name on a card, I agree there would have been an artful contrivance; and Serjeant Hawkins proceeds, and says, it wholly depends on a bare naked lye, &amp;c. Now, is there any thing in the present case beyond that? If this message had been addressed to any body of riper years, they would have said, very good, I will carry it; and a person of still more caution, would not have carried them at all. I remember a case which happened very soon after I was at the bar, before Mr. Justice Ashurst, where the representation was of this sort: I have taken the Essex Arms in Essex-street, and I shall want a great number of candles: the allegation was,</p>
               <p>"That whereas he</p>
               <p>"had not taken the Essex Arms, nor any</p>
               <p>"other house;" and the learned judge was of opinion, that it was a bare naked lye; for the prosecutor could have gone to the landlord, and made himself certain. My Lord, if I was defending this man on an indictment for a fraud, I should content myself with reading this line from Serjeant Hawkins, to your Lordship, he says,</p>
               <p>"it is said to be needless to provide</p>
               <p>"severe laws for such mischiefs." - What severe laws? Punishing him for a cheat? then this monstrously absurd doctrine follows; that if this man had been indicted for a cheat, upon which this court could only impose a slight punishment, if he was convicted, but which the law authorities have said is not the subject of any criminal prosecution; yet you are called here today, though sitting here, as I contend, without a power of convicting this man of a fraud; and sitting on a case where the law says, it does not make a severe punishment necessary; you are to punish him with more severity. My Lord, I submit it is not even a cheat, and if it is not a cheat, it cannot be a felony; I submit that there is no ingredient of larceny in this case, no trespass, but that it is a bare naked lye.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you distinguish this case, Mr. Garrow, from the case of a man going to buy a horse, and saying, Sir, I will be obliged to you to let me try this horse's paces; he gets on the horse's back with the consent of the owner, and rides away with him. Then there was the case of a man who bought a coffee-pot, or some piece of silver, and carried it to Gray's-Inn coffee-house, and delivered it to a person at the bar, and says, take care of that till I come again; soon after he was gone<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100073"/>out, she says to the boy, if the gentleman calls for that piece of silver, you must give it to him; she went out, another man came in, and it was delivered; he did not say I am the man, but he came so immediately in the same manner that the other man did, who said he would come, that the boy delivered it; and there it was held to be a felony. Then there was another case, where a servant, a porter, I think, was carrying goods, and he was met by some of his companions, who said it would be a better thing to take them to another place and sell them, and prevailed on him to do so; that was a stronger case; for in all the other cases it had been held, that if the fraud was done at the time, animo furandi, then it was a felony; but if afterwards the man was tempted to do it, then it was not a felony. But there is so little distinction between frauds and felonies, that I think it my duty to save this case for the opinion of the Judges, to see if we can get this doctrine of felony and fraud into something of better order, than I confess it is at present, in my mind, at least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow requested to have a special verdict, to which the court assented.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to prosecutor. I have only one question, Sir. My Lord put it to you very distinctly; do you mean to swear positively that this is the man? - That is the man that came to me into the shop first.</p>
               <p>It is stated to me, that at first you charged him only on suspicion? - I certainly did; I committed him that night on suspicion, because, though I was certain in my own mind, without the smallest doubt, yet if I found on the boy's seeing him, and the other gentleman's seeing him, that they would not identify him, I did not intend to prosecute him; the boy was shewn the man in the Compter, in presence of several people, and he picked him out directly.</p>
               <p>The boy had been informed, I take it for granted, before he went into the Compter, that you had taken the man that you had seen come into the shop that evening? - Yes, that he did know.</p>
               <p>The boy is represented to me as having cried a great deal? - He did cry before the magistrate, but it was at the appearance of the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Did the boy at any time express any doubt on the subject, or do you believe his mind has been made up since? - Never, on my oath; the moment that he saw him, he pitched on him directly.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear there was a person in Clerkenwell, that was committed for the same crime? - I never did.</p>
               <p>What day did you charge him upon suspicion? - The 19th.</p>
               <p>You had not seen him for twelve days? - No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, this is an indictment for stealing two hats, and there will be two questions for you to consider: the first is, whether from the character given of him, and the evidence taken altogether, you believe him to have been guilty at all; whether he is the person that has done it, or if he did it, whether he did it with any bad intent at all: Mr. Rankin tells you, he is quite sure the prisoner came into his shop in the evening of the 7th of November, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here the learned judge summed up the evidence, and then added -</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, if you are of opinion, from these circumstances, that the prisoner did go with this false story, with intent to get into his own possession, and convert to his own use, the hats belonging to the present prosecutor, and that he was the person that came back with that other false story, that Mr. Rankin had sent for those hats, and that by that means he obtained the hats in order to convert them to his own use, then you will tell us so, and we must put that on the record, for the Judges to decide, whether that under the circumstances be a felony, or if it be only a fraud: if it be a felony, the court will determine on your stating the particulars, that he is guilty, and they will punish him accordingly; if it is only a fraud, of course the prisoner, being now indicted for a felony, will be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100074"/>acquitted; and it will be for consideration afterwards, whether he shall be indicted for a fraud or not.</p>
               <p>Jury. My Lord, we are bound to believe the evidence, and that the prisoner was the person that obtained the hats.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton read the special verdict. That the prisoner, with intent unlawfully to obtain, and to convert to his own use the goods mentioned in the indictment, went on the 7th of November to the shop of Mr. Rankin, and there told Mr. Rankin, that Mr. Sansum,</p>

               <p>[Court. I suppose the jury mean to find, that when he went in the first time, he had the same intent? - Jury. No doubt.]</p>
               <p>who lived in London-street, wanted a hat, and desired that he (Rankin) would carry him some to look at:</p>
               <p>[Court to Rankin. You did carry some hats with you? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Did the man go out after you, or before you? - Before me.]</p>
               <p>Mr. Rankin then went with some hats to Mr. Sansum, in London-street; while Mr. Rankin was gone, the prisoner at the bar returned in three minutes to the shop, and said to the man who had been in the shop when the prisoner first went there,</p>
               <p>[Mr. Garrow to Morgan. Little boy, was you in the shop when the prisoner first came and told your master? - Yes, I was.]</p>
               <p>your master is at our house, and he has sent me, and says, you must give me the cocked has and the round hat that are in the window, which he accordingly than and there delivered to the prisoner, who went away with them, and converted them to his own use; and they further find, that Mr. Rankin did not send the prisoner, or any other person for the hats.</p>

               <p>State to my Lord and the Jury the circumstances as they arose in Wiltshire, when this assault was made on you and Curtis? - It was the 25th of December, 1786, in the parish of Aldborough, I went by myself between eleven and twelve in the morning; I found a large quantity of tubs; as soon as I found them, I tasted one of them, and found it to be brandy; I found them in a thicket; I waited there about twenty minutes, as near as I can guess, and then

            , officers of Excise, and John Owen, collector, came to me with three marines; I had received information in the morning of that day; I had given them previous notice of my intention; Owen went away immediately to get a waggon, and Williams, and Curtis, and myself, assisted by the marines, began to take the tubs out of the thicket, that we might have them in a convenient place for loading; when we had got them nearly all out, (I suppose there might be about twenty left in the thicket) there came a large gang, a large company of men; one in particular had his face blacked, some were armed with horse-pistols, others with a pocket-pistol, one with a blunderbuss, some with prongs and long sticks.</p>
               <p>Are you enabled to say nearly how many the number might consist of? - As near as I can guess, about thirty, but they were not all armed; I recollect one had his face blacked, and one bad a double barrel-gun.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive England, the defendant, at the bar, among the number of men? - I do not recollect that I did: when they advanced upon me, I desired them to desist; there was a gate between us; we laid the tubs against the gate which separates the road from the field; I was on one side of the gate, and this gang of men on the other; some of them presented their arms over the gate towards us, and the others drew off to the part where the tubs were, and sunbunded us; I persuaded them not to meddle or make with them; I told them that I know a great many of them, and that they would forfeit their lives, if they meddled with them; they swore; I threatened them; and the man who had his face blacked, whose name is

            , came and beat in the hand of one of the tubs with the heel of his shoe, and prevailed on the soldiers to drink; I desired them not, but I could not prevail on them, so the soldiers took a little of the brandy; after they had been there about ten minutes, there came two waggons, and the mob, the company of men, immediately began to load the waggons.</p>
               <p>Were those the waggons that Owen was to bring? - No, their own waggons; some of them formed themselves into a sort of line, and handed them one from the other, and some carried them in their hands; when they had got them all up in the waggons except about twelve, they consented to give us forty of them; and I asked them for a waggon to take them away, and they said we should not have one of their waggons, but they would let me have a cart.</p>
               <p>How many tubs might there be in all? - About two hundred; one of the men immediately went with me to a farmhouse and got a cart; I left Williams and Curtis with the tubs; I returned in about twenty minutes, then the waggons were gone, but the people were not doing any thing; one of the waggons was gone before I went for the cart: I saw England in the line long before that; the first time I took any notice of him was when he was lifting the tubs in the line.</p>
               <p>Was he amongst the men in this line, lifting the tubs from one another? - He was.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive, or take any notice of him at any time when you saw him in that situation? - No, I did not; I am sure he is the man; for when I went to the farmhouse with the cart, I accused him with it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100076"/>says he, I have a night to do what I please on my own gowned and I think I saw head about way to the farm-house.</p>
               <p>Then you have no doubt at all of the man? - I am sure it is the man.</p>
               <p>Did Williams and Curtis drink of this brandy when the cug was open? - I do not know; yes, Williams got very drunk, Curtis was very sober; when I was going away with the cart loaded, one of the soldiers was so drunk, he could not walk, and I was unwilling to leave him behind, and we lifted him on the cart, and we had a great struggle; and I tied him on with one of the things; and Williams was so drunk, and he lifted up his eyes, and I tied him on with the soldier, and I fastened him on, and the horse was not able to draw him, and I took him off and put him down; and one of the smugglers took him on his back, and ran away with him; and so I desired Curtis to take care of the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd, prisoner's council. How long might you be about all this, from the time you first made your seizure? - I suppose it might be two hours or more; I cannot so well conceive of the time in such confusion.</p>
               <p>You did not see this man at first? - No.</p>
               <p>The first time you observed him, was lifting the tubs from one another? - Yes; they formed a line in the place.</p>
               <p>Was not that after you had agreed to take the forty tubs? - No; they never proposed giving us forty, till they were all loaded, except twelve.</p>
               <p>Did you see England there till after you made the agreement about the tubs? - Yes, long before that; he never spoke to me at all, nor I to him in my life, till I spoke to him at the farm-house.</p>
               <p>He was not there when the forty tubs were loaded? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a woman going to strike you? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not England prevent the smugglers from beating and attacking you? - No, not in the least; if he did, he did it secretly; I am sure I am a stranger to any such thing.</p>
               <p>Had he any arms? - I did not see that he had any.</p>
               <p>How long had you been at the spot before you saw him? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>You must recollect; I mean from the time of the first seizure? - I suppose more than an hour before the mob came; I cannot tell exactly.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that? - I cannot tell exactly; we must be pretty near an hour before any of the mob came.</p>
               <p>How long after the mob came did you see England? - I suppose about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>I think you say you told several of them that you knew them, and they were committing an offence against the laws? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know several of them now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How comes this man to be the only one against whom you gave information? - They are not yet taken.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen them since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have not you frequently seen them within the last two years? - Yes, many of them, but I knew I did not dare to touch them.</p>
               <p>How came the others not to be taken? - I hardly dared to look at them; I staid there at the hazard of my life; I did not fix upon England; it was not I that took him; I have been gone from the country above a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you could not have taken many of the others in the same way you have taken England? - I</p>

               <p>have met several of them, but I knew I did not dare to meddle with them; I did not dare live in the place with any safety.</p>
               <p>This happened, I think, near two years ago? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was that man taken up? - I do not know particularly.</p>
               <p>Was not it a twelvemonth very near after it happened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not he taken last September, and do not you know it? - I do not know the month without some recollection: I never knew anything of his being taken, till I read orders to attend the trial.</p>
               <p>Do not you know now that it was last September that this man was taken? - It was sometime about the last sessions.</p>
               <p>How long did you remain in that part of the country after this happened? - I suppose eight months.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen England between the time that the affair happened, and the time that you quitted that part of the country? - I had.</p>
               <p>At his own house? - I never was at his house in my life to my knowledge; I saw him at Salisbury market, and frequently about Salisbury.</p>
               <p>Did you know where he lived? - I knew he lived at Aldborough, but not particularly to the house; I knew his name.</p>
               <p>You saw him several times at Salisbury about his common ordinary business? - Yes, I saw him several times at Salisbury.</p>
               <p>You took away your forty tubs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>By agreement? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you to compound? - We could not get the whole.</p>
               <p>Did you make a bargain with these smugglers to take forty, and that they should have the rest? - They forced us to do it.</p>
               <p>So that you thought if you could not make a seizure according to your duty, the next best thing was to make a bargain with the smugglers? - I did the best I could.</p>
               <p>When did you give information about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100079"/>this? - That was not my business; I informed the collector immediately; I knew if I attempted to take any of them, I was liable to have my house pulled about my cars.</p>
               <p>Did you ever point them out? - Yes, I did to the collector; he informed the Board of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I believe you was in Essex, when this man was apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had discharged your duty in informing the collector? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When some of the people presented their arms at you, their guns, and blunderbusses, and pistol, and the other part drew off to the tubs, you did not at that time see England there at all? - I do not recollect I did; I had no personal knowledge of the man before; the first time that ever I took notice of him was when he was handing the tubs in the line.</p>
               <p>Then after you saw England there, there were no arms presented at any of you? - They had conquered us then; the arms were with some of the smuglers.</p>
               <p>When they took the tubs, and put them into the waggons, you were entering into a treaty and capitulation? - They had taken all up but twelve; then they consented to give the forty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Was not there for a long time a dispute whether you should have thirty or forty? - They would not consent to give us any at first.</p>
               <p>Did you ask any? - Yes, I intreated them a great many times not to take any away, but they would not.</p>

               <p>Did you ask them for any smaller number? - They made the proposal, they first proposed forty; that was the first consent they made.</p>
               <p>What proposal, and what conversation was there about dividing this between you; about their having one part and you another, before they consented to give you forty? - The agreement was among themselves; I consented to take forty, and if they had offered me but ten, I suppose I should have taken it, rather than have gone away without any.</p>
               <p>Then there had never been a word about their giving you thirty, upon oath? - Not that I know of, I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Why you recollect whether there was any bargaining or no? - There was no such bargain; it was among themselves, if they made any bargain, it was their own proposal.</p>
               <p>Then among you officers there was no bargaining that you should take less than the whole? - Not at all; we consented to take the forty; I was afraid they would not let us have the whole; there were six of us, and more than thirty of them.</p>
               <p>If they had a mind, they could have carried it all away? - They could if they would.</p>
               <p>There were several of them armed, and about forty against six? - Yes, they might very easily have carried away the whole if they chose it; the remainder of the forty, above the twelve, were unloaded out of the waggon; they sorted out some of the common liquor, and I objected to take it, but they said I should have that or none.</p>
               <p>As they could clearly have carried away the whole without your being able to give them any obstruction at all, how could you object to any thing they thought fit to give you, unless there had been some bargaining between you, that nothing more should be said; was there any thing of that sort upon your oath: you thought yourselves in a scrape; these men could murder you; did you, in order to get out of that scrape, and to get quit of these fellows, say if you will give us thirty tubs or forty tubs, we will part friends, and there shall be no more of this? - I did not say we would part friends; they proposed it, and we consented to take forty.</p>
               <p>Then after you had consented to this, you thought they were not using you fairly, in giving you common liquor, and you objected to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the possessor of that ground, as he said he had a right to do what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100080"/>he pleased on his own ground? - I do not know.</p>

               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Why these smugglers were very generous? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You told them you would have nothing to do with it, except you could get the whole? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you took forty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You said no, and took them? - Yes, but not to come to any capitulation.</p>
               <p>You had the tubs, and what they produced at the sale? - Yes, I suppose so; I never asked them for any, not ever heard any word pass that nothing more should be said, if they would give forty; that I swear.</p>
               <p>When did the Excise-office hear of this? - I do not know; it was not to get myself out of any charge; I was sent for to town, last September twelvemonth; we were before an attorney in Salisbury.</p>
               <p>How long was it before the smugglers came up, that you first saw England? - It might be five or ten minutes, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>No more; rub up your memory? - I cannot pretend to say; ten minutes or a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was not half an hour? - I cannot pretend to swear, it may.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot tell whether it was five minutes, or half an hour? - I cannot say, we were all in confusion; the first I saw of him, he was moving the tubs.</p>

               <p>Was it not above half an hour after? - It may be about that time.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed; in his Sunday cloaths? - Very tightly.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. What are you? - A little farmer and butcher; I live in the parish of Aldborough.</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether you were at church or not on Christmas day, 1786? - Yes, I was at church, and received the sacrament there, at Aldborough church.</p>
               <p>Do you remember coming from church? - Yes; and I remember coming through my own ground; and when I came within a stone's cast of my own ground, I saw a parcel of people got together; and great disputes; a quantity of people, men, women, and children; when I came there, I saw Hiscott and Williams, whom I knew very well; and then I knew what was the matter I did not know Curtis.</p>
               <p>Did you see Mr. England there? - No, I do not remember that I saw him there; for I was not there but a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing of England that day? - I do not know that I saw him all the day.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation what those officers were about? - I went to Mr. Hiscott, and asked him; and he said they could not agree concerning the tubs; and I asked him what agreement they wanted, and he said that he wanted forty tubs, and never no more should be said of the matter; that it should end there.</p>
               <p>What did they say to you first? - When I first came to Mr. Hiscott, I asked him how he did, and said, Sir, I am for this; says he, so am I; are you come with respect to these tubs; I said no, I am just come from church; it is our road: he said they would not come to an agreement about these tubs; and he said they wanted forty; and I went to the opposite party, that was against them, and said, gentlemen, here will be rioting; there were a parcel of women; they were got very rude; and I said there certainly will be mischief; you had better agree; you cannot blame the officers, they are in the king's business and immediately I went and told them of the consequence of these here things; they agreed to take forty tubs; and there was a sample lay on the ground, and I went home directly. Hiscott, and Williams, and Curtis were called together, and they all three agreed that nothing should be said of the matter, if forty were given; the smugglers were not willing to give more than thirty at first; I persuaded them to give all that they required; for I thought the consequence would be great, and mutiny would ensue.</p>
               <p>Who counted out the tubs? - I do not know; the officers stood at the same time to see that they had forty: as soon as it was settled, I said good morning to you, gentlemen, and I went home to dine with my wife and family; I was not there above a quarter of an hour; I know England very well; he is a dairy-man, and keeps cows; he has four children; he has been next door neighbour to me for twenty-four years; I knew him that while; I never knew but that he was always a very honest and industrious man; I never knew him guilty of any smuggling, nor never heard by any man that he had a bad character, or was a man of that sort; he was always an industrious man for honesty; I have had a deal of dealings with him myself.</p>
               <p>From the time that this transaction happened, where has he lived ever since? - There, in the same house; always attended the markets every day, except two days, then he had the misfortune to put his knee out; he was never in secret, he always was at market twice a-week with his butter and bacon.</p>
               <p>Was he lame in Christmas, 1786? - Yes, he was a little limping; he could not walk without a stick.</p>
               <p>Was this place in your way home from the church? - Yes, in the high-road; it was not two stones throw from the road; it is England's road from the church, and his road to the ground that he rents for his dairy; we can fling a stone.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100082"/>Mr. Fielding. Cross-examination. When did you come to town? - Tuesday morning I sat out this day se'nnight for Salisbury, at four o'clock; I do not remember that I saw him that day, but I question but I might.</p>
               <p>Why did you say to Williams and Curtis, you were sorry for this? - Because I thought there would be mischief by the women being almost drunk; I was sorry to see there was such a riot; I was come from such a place of receiving the sacrament, I was coming into a very bad place.</p>
               <p>But you knew they had seized a parcel of goods, and were opposed by a parcel of smugglers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you offer any assistance to them? - Hiscott asked me if I would go and ask them to come to their terms; he said he, did not like it; and I went and apprized them, and they come to the terms.</p>
               <p>In what manner were the people employed when you first came up; were they putting the cags into the waggons? - Oh, no, nobody meddled with the cags at that time.</p>
               <p>The waggons were there at that time? - There were some in the waggons, and some laid on the foot path.</p>
               <p>Were not they then in the very act of putting those cags into the waggons? - They were put into the waggons, I believe, except them on the ground; they took enough out of the waggon to make them forty; I staid till the forty tubs were put on a heap, and they agreed; and then I bid them a good morning, and went home.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Bungay? - Yes; he was at church.</p>
               <p>But your next door neighbour you did not see? - We sit at a great distance, and then I staying behind, and he did not; that might be the case; I believe he might be at church.</p>
               <p>Court. All that were put into the waggons that you saw, were put into the waggons before you came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the bargain was not compleat, for you assisted in making this bargain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shepherd. Did you see Williams? - Yes; he was as sober as I am at this very minute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. What, was Williams sober? - He was as sober as any man in England.</p>
               <p>Did you see the marines there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How were they? - They were very sober; they told me the women got a cag, and beat in the head, and drank out of their shoes.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you an officer of Excise at this seizure? - Yes; we found a quantity of goods in an open copse; they were cags of brandy; then we removed them to a little distance, about two hundred yards; we came there about nine; it took us near an hour to remove them; we put them close against a gate; the smugglers came between ten and eleven; they said they would have the goods; they did not belong to us; we at first said they should not; this was about an hour before the waggons came; I do not know who fetched the waggons.</p>
               <p>Was you resisting when the waggons came? - Yes; he proposed to let us have a few, if we would accept of them; as near as I can guess, it was ten in the first place; there several propositions, so they came to fifteen, twenty, thirty; they were loading the waggons all the time, so we said we would not accept of one less than forty.</p>
               <p>Who said that? - Mr. Hiscott, and we all together; we said we would not accept of one less than forty; there were women by at the time of this conversation; the prisoner, I am sure was one; he tried to persuade them to give up the forty tubs, and Mr. Symonds was the other, he tried likewise, and at last they agreed to give us forty tubs; and we said that then they should carry them safe home to the Excise-office; the defendant went away with Mr. Hiscott to borrow a cart; they did borrow one, and the defendant helped me in particular to load the forty tubs into the cart:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100083"/>the defendant had the same clotahs on then he has now.</p>
               <p>At the time the smugglers first came up, was the defendant there, or was he not? - I never saw the the defendant till about twelve, or a little after, not to take any notice of him; that was more than half an hour after the smugglers came up.</p>
               <p>Had he any man with him? - Nothing, but a little stick, about the size of mine.</p>
               <p>Did he attack or abuse the officers in any way? - Not in the least. There was a woman going to strike me, and going to strip to fight me; the defendant took hold of her, and persuaded her to be quiet, and put her on one side.</p>
               <p>Then you say he did nothing at all to hurt any body, or to abuse the officers? - Nothing at all, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Cross-examination. You knew the prisoner before, I take it for granted? - I had seen him before, several times, in the market.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure of your man? - Yes, yes.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure he was the man who endeavoured to persuade them to give you up the 40 s.? - Yes, he and Symonds in particular; and there was another man: they did that as soon as I saw them.</p>
               <p>Did you see which way Symonds and the prisoner came? - No, Sir, I did not take any notice till they began to interfere; I do not know whether they came up together.</p>
               <p>It was a very fatiguing day to you, Mr. Williams; you could not walk home? - Yes, it was. I fell down.</p>
               <p>I believe the marines had some hard service? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You and the marines had such hard service that you were very much fatigued? - We had a good deal of trouble in removing the tubs.</p>
               <p>Who was put up into the cart? - I never saw any body put up on the cart.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, you was not put up on the cart? Come, now, with this hard service of yours, - I was not put on the cart.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to deny that the marine was put on the cart? - I cannot say, because, after I fell down, I could not go any further.</p>
               <p>There was nothing to drink; you did not drink? - Yes, I did; I drank twice.</p>
               <p>You drank by word of mouth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What liquor might you have? - It was brandy.</p>
               <p>You took two hearty sucks at it? - Not very hearty.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was the man that came up with Symonds? - Came up with him! I never took any notice of him, till he interfered. I saw Symonds in one place interfering, and the defendant in another. Sometimes they were passing each other; sometimes very near to each other.</p>
               <p>Near enough for near neighbours to know that each other were there? - I should imagine so. The prisoner did not go away with Symonds; Symonds went away directly, as soon as the matter was settled. The prisoner went away with Hiscott, to borrow the cart. I saw the line of tubs formed: I did not see the prisoner at that time.</p>
               <p>Who took you up, like any other drunken log, and carried you away on his back? - I cannot remember. I believe Curtis was there, by my side.</p>
               <p>Where did you find yourself when you got to your senses? - Why, at a farmhouse. I was in my senses before I got there.</p>
               <p>Who was the farmer? - His name is 
               <persName id="t17881210-93-person676">
                  John

            . It might be between three and four.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that Lawrence is one of the defendants in this indictment? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Was not he one of them that were armed in this affray? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>What piece of fire-arms had he? - To the best of my knowledge it was something of a gun broke, only longer than a pistol.</p>
               <p>A gun-barrel cut down; that is what you mean? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of the smugglers, so armed, carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100084"/>you away? - Yes. At that time I was hurted by my fall.</p>
               <p>But, except being hurt by your fall, you was as sober as you are now? - There were many hurt besides me.</p>
               <p>Do you remember being tied up on the slings on the cart? - No, nor nobody else; I will contradict it.</p>
               <p>What was you turned out for? - I was not turned out the last time; I was turned out once. I have now got an estate of about 60 l. a year left me, and I thought it was a deal better than the excise.</p>
               <p>I believe you had had a hint that it was as well to resign? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Do you live near the prisoner now? - No, seventy miles below that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you drink any of of this brandy till all the matter was over? - Yes; once after we removed the tubs we every one of us drank, and not a drop after that till all this matter was settled; and that only once.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you drunk or sober when you fell down, upon your oath? - As sober as ever I was in my life, till I fell down. It was so slippery, that no person could hardly stand, neither horse nor man, and the ground all a cake of ice. I mean to say that I was sober, sober enough: I cannot say but that the brandy might effect me a little, having eat nothing all day; but sober enough to know what I was about before my fall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Hiscott. You hear this? - Upon my oath, I was the person that assisted in putting him on the cart: he was put there on account of his drunkenness, and being unable to go; and there he would have lain, if the horse could have drawn him: and as soon as we took him off, we laid him on the green, and he lay as dead, like a post; and one of the smugglers, Lawrence, took him up, and run away with him; and I desired Curtis to go after him.</p>
               <p>Court to Curtis. Upon your oath, was he drunk or sober? - He was very much in liquor; he could not walk; and I assisted Hiscott in putting him on the cart; and then the horse could not move, and he was taken down again. I clapped him upon his back.</p>
               <p>Was he so drunk as to be unable to move or stir, or take care of himself? - He was not able to walk at all. I never drank myself till after Mr. Hiscott was gone after the cart.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear that Williams was in liquor, or might he not be able to walk from the blow? - He did not fall till after he was on the cart, and taken down again. I helped to lead him some distance on the arm, behind the cart.</p>
               <p>Court to Hiscott. Did you hear the evidence of Symonds to day? - Yes. I very well recollect seeing Symonds there, but the particulars of the conversation which passed between us I cannot recollect a syllable of it. I was in such a slurry, and so frightened, that I cannot say what I did say; and so much time has elapsed since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester replied, and the learned Judge summed up the evidence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You was the commander of the British King revenue cutter? - I was in the service of the excise.</p>
               <p>Was you on board the cutter on the 3d and 4th of April, 1787? - I was.</p>
               <p>Be so good as to tell us what your directions were on the 4th of April? - On the 3d of April, in the evening, I was sitting in a coffee-room at Falmouth. I had some information of two boats coming in, which led me to man my boats. I went off from Dean's Castle, and there I waited with my people till between one and two in the morning. My force was five men and myself. I saw a small cutter boat coming in for harbour: we perceived her standing in: we rowed further into the harbour, close into Falmouth harbour, within the port of Falmouth, over the bars. When we perceived her far enough, we rowed forward, and came up to her. Whenever she perceived us, she stood right for the shore. We overtook her on the rocks, and laid hold of her with the boat-hook. Soon after we hooked her, she struck on the rocks. We told them it was the excise-boat, and to lower their fails. Just as she struck, there was a pretty fresh breeze of wind. I got on board of her. I was surprized to see so many men; I did not expect above four or five; there appeared to me to be ten or twelve people, or perhaps more. They were sitting on the casks when we boarded her: they were casks full of brandy, I suppose about nine gallons each cask.</p>
               <p>What quantity do you imagine were on board the boat? - Twenty-one. When I saw so many men, I was a little alarmed. I told them to go on shore immediately, quietly; or else, if they made any resistance, it would be worse for them. No one spoke, or moved. I had a cutlass in my hand, and I cut all the ropes of the rigging, to lower their sails. There were two or three of my own men, that followed me into the boat; I told them to haul the fails down: at the same time it was pretty dark. Just at this moment I perceived a man put his head between my feet, to throw me overboard; that was one of the people of the smugglers. They were all sitting down, and we were standing up. It was very suddenly. Though I had a cutlass in my hand, I had not time to make use of it. I stooped to lay hold of the man whose head was between my feet; upon which one of the people of the smugglers struck me down with a bludgeon. The boat was so low, and nothing to lay hold of, to prevent me from going over, I did not expect to escape. The mark of it is here; and the man who had his head between my legs shoved me; and with that, and the assistance of the blow, I went over back wards into the water. At last I got upon my feet in the water, and caught hold of the boat's gunnel; and as I got my head above water, I received another blow on the cheek, which swelled very much. I found myself very much stunned by the first blow. I then recovered my footing pretty well, and I kept the cutlass over my head, which was bruised by the bludgeons; for we afterwards secured several of the bludgeons, which were square, like a piece of wood cut out of the rough: there were some for one hand, and some for two; which were of course very dangerous weapons. With one of those bludgeons I had my blows. In point of fact, several blows were aimed at me. I received two very severe blows: I kept a great many off my head with my cutlass: the steel bars of the cutlass were knocked down flat on my hand. It was not a common cutlass; it was a better one, that had very strong steel bars. After this, the affray became general in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100086"/>boat, between my people and the people of the smugglers.</p>
               <p>How did it end, at last? - The man that threw me over, was thrown over by one of my men immediately after: they say it was the prisoner; I do not know him. We at last threw all the smugglers overboard; we then took possession of the boat. When my own people were taking me out of the boat, I received another blow on the breast with a stone. The water was then above my middle, as I stood in the water, and they threw stones from the shore; a great many showers of very large stones. I might be eight or ten yards from the shore. The blow I received was a very large one: my wrist was black, I dare say, for three months; I had not the proper use of it for two months. At last we possessed ourselves of the boat: we found in it one or two and twenty anchors of brandy, I do not recollect which; they contained about nine gallons and a half, or ten gallons. That was the first duty I ever did.</p>
               <p>Were they slung? - Yes; there were ropes tied round them for convenience, to carry them away, or whip them on horseback: that is usual in the smuggling trade; not very common in fair trade; there is no such casks used in fair trade. I tasted the spirits; it was foreign brandy.</p>
               <p>You was a stranger at Plymouth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was not acquainted with the smugglers? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Prisoner's Council. This was between one and two in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>No later in the year than April? - No.</p>
               <p>It was last April? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I was a seaman on board the British King excise cutter, on the 4th of April. I was one of the five men that manned the captain's boat in Falmouth Harbour. We saw this smuggling boat, and waited for it; we gave chace to it, and hailed her: we told them we were the excise-boat, and desired them to haul the fails down. They made no reply at first; we hailed them again: one of them made a kind of answer, just to say they would, or something of that; but they never did, till they run the boat on shore; then we run the boat along side of it; Captain Stewart and I came along side of her. When we came on board, we saw the liquors: I believe there were ten men. We boarded her, and ordered all the sail down: they never once hauled the sails down; but one

               <p>Are you sure he was the person that stooped down and threw the captain overboard? - Yes, I am sure of it; and when they hove Captain Stewart overboard, a man came forward in the boat with both his hands to a large stick, and struck him over the forehead; and another, with a large stick, (they had all large sticks) as big as my arm, in the hurry I was knocked down into the boat, and had some blows over my arm: my arm was swelled up; I thought it was broke, it was so swelled. I had some blows after I was down. I lost my senses; I saw nobody came to my assistance; I thought the smugglers would have killed me. We three, only, jumped on board. One

               <p>Could you see who were the persons that threw the stones? - Not in particular: but, by the quickness, they all threw stones; all the smugglers stood on the beach and hove stones.

               <p>On the 24th of September, I was employed on the hop duty for the Excise; I was stationed at Vinehall, near Battle, Sussex. On the 24th of September, about seven, I saw the prisoner in company with a person of the name of Cain, and a boy, with five horses loaded with spirits; they came through Vinehall; they were about four gallon casks; there were three on each, three horses, and five each on the two led horses each, they were slung across; I applied to Mr. Pudsey, the officer; we pursued them on the road; we thought it was the most likely to meet with them; Pudsey and me, and another, pursued them: Pudsey was the established officer of the Excise; we came to the place called Berwash Weald, which we thought a likely road for them to take; we had not been there some few minutes, before we saw some people stand in the road, at a little distance; we came up with the prisoner and his companions; upon sight of us, they immediately rode away, and left their two led horses, with five tubs each, and by some means, drove off four more: they rode off with the other two horses; the prisoner was certainly one of the persons; I knew him by name before, but not by sight; I am positive he was one of them; Mr. Pudsey, the other officer, pursued them, and I stepped back to take charge of what was left in the road; they might be gone four or five minutes, and they returned with one horse, and one cask more; then for the better taking the things they were down in the road; we took the horses and goods to the stable in Berwash Weald, to the stable of the publick-house called the Weald; we had not been there more than ten or twelve minutes before the prisoner and the other men appeared in sight, about twenty roods from the Weald, and sat on their horses, and used very harsh language, and swore that we should not take it away; at last, the person that was along with the prisoner, called to Mr. Pudsey by his name, to know if he would give him any thing to drink, and he told him if he came back and behaved himself quietly he would give him a glass; they came back within a few roods of the house, and we gave the other man a glass of geneva and some beer; he was there, so that we had an opportunity of observing them; after we were coming away with the things, they began to use very violent means; they concluded, when we were coming out of the stable, to join together, and not suffer us to take them away; they swore they would be true to each other, and not suffer us to take it away; the other person that is not in custody, said, let us stand true to each other, and not suffer them to take it away; the prisoner consented to it, and I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100089"/>there were hands shook to the bargain, but I cannot say I saw that; then they both rode into the yard immediately before the door; they kept the door, and swore we should not come out with the horses nor the goods, and kept us, I suppose, for the space of an hour; and after, as we were standing at the door, desiring them to keep themselves quiet, they struck at the doorway, and broke off the top.</p>
               <p>Who did they appear to strike at? - At us, it appeared to be; they swore they would beat our brains out, and kept beating and aiming blows, which fell on the door; they were at that time on horseback; Mr. Pudsey and us advised with each other; I thought it prudent to get more assistance; I went out of the back-door; there were two doors in the stable; I went the back way to Berwash town; no officer was at home; the landlord came, and I desired the constable to come; and when we came back it was very quiet; the prisoner, I found, was shot; I found Mr. Pudsey and the prisoner; the prisoner's hand was very much in blood, and bound up with something, that I suppose, they had found in the house; the goods were then in the stable.</p>
               <p>Did you hear in the presence of the prisoner, what had happened while you was gone? - I cannot say I did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer of Excise at Battle; I had information the 24th of September last, of five horses loaded with tubs of about four gallons each, of brandy, rum, or geneva; I looked upon it to be prohibited goods; I went in pursuit with Mr. Venis, in order to meet with them; at about nine in the morning, we came to Berwash Weald, and went across the country to meet them; I went to the publick-house, and called for one pot of beer; the landlord is here; we did not stop there but a few minutes; there were two people going in the road; I said we will go forward; we went forward; when we had got a very little distance from the Weald, I saw the prisoner and another, and a boy, all standing still on the road: we made what haste we could to come up with the smugglers; they seeing us come after them, made what haste they could away, and left two horses, with five tubs upon each of them; I put them into the possession of Mr. Venis, and we went on after them; there were four tubs more thrown off from their horses, and further, we came up with a horse and a lad upon it; the lad jumped off and ran away; I did not see them drop them; the prisoner and the other person were half a mile on the road, as hard as they could gallop; I could see them at a distance; I thought it was prudent to return back with what we had seized; we took it to Berwash, to put the horses and goods into the stable, in order to load these tubs, that we might convey them to Battle; we had not been there long, before the prisoner and another came back, with clubs in their hands, the knobs of them as large as my hand, and the other a large walking-stick, like a large long whip-stick, with a head to it; they had no tubs with them when they came, they seemed to be angry a little or so; but, however, one of them got off his horse, as we had tapped one of the tubs, in order to prove the seizure, (which is a very good way, and I always will when I can;) one of them said (that was the other man), he said he would have a soak; he went out again; we did not apprehend any danger as for rescuing them; we got the horses, thinking to come away immediately; one horse was at the door with five tubs upon him; Venis was on horse-back, I was telling him to bring the tubs along, when the other man levelled the large club at my head; I was not apprehensive of any danger; the other had been an officer; says he, take care, upon which I turned my head, and escaped it; then from that, there were some words, and they seemed to be very angry, and I thought it was likely to be a piece of work; and the prisoner said, if the other had half the heart he had, they would not have rode for it at first;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100090"/>and he said something, I could not tell what, but immediately after that, he d - d his heart and his limbs, that they would stand true to each other, and take the goods from us.</p>

               <p>Court. Which of them did that? - I saw both of them shake hands to each other; they bound themselves as true as man could do with words and oaths, in taking the goods from us as soon as they could; the people got round, I think twenty or thirty in all; I said to Venis, the best way is, to get the horse into the stable again, as they seem to raise upon us; he had that horse into the stable; upon that they both rode up; the boy rode up to the door; it was opened, and I stood with a pistol in my hand, desiring them to keep off, or actually I would fire upon them; then I reasoned with them, told, them of the impropriety of their conduct, and the consequence that would follow probably, if they did rescue the goods; I told them if they did, it would be the worst job they ever did in their lives, and they should not if I could prevent it; they had large sticks, and they came up to the door, and the prisoner put his stick under the door; whether he meant to hurt me or not, I cannot say; I caught hold of his stick, and we pulled it away from him; they still continued their attacks, riding up close to the door; then they said they would have a grey horse, and have him turned out; then I told them I could not, nor would not; after that, the other person that was with them, opened his breast, and d - d me, and bid me shoot; I sent Venis to Berwash Weald to procure assistance; the prisoner and the other still kept on, they would have the horse; I pointed my pistol, and turned to shoot at them several times; it took no impression upon them; then we shut the door, thinking they would disperse; we set a person against it, and pressed against it, that they should not break it open; we pulled another stick from them, which is larger then commonly people ride with; the other that is not in custody, went to put up his stick; they got larger sticks, and came back and made a second attack at the door; the prisoner was so daring, he came and opened his mouth, and d - d me, and bade me fire into his mouth; they continued their offence for some time; this continued for two hours and more.</p>
               <p>What number of men were there around you? - I can say twenty with safety; but there were some women and children, I did not count them, and others that seemed to assist; they attempted very much to break the door open; I still threatened that I would fire if they did not desist and go about their business; and reasoned with them as well as I could, and the consequence of it. The prisoner said there is a back door, and he swore he would be in at the back door: me and the other officer were against that door, holding it very fast. I stepped up close to the door, and he was some little way off; I says to him, my friend, keep off, or I will fire my pistol; and he came forward; I walked backward. The back door was open, and he was coming in resolute; I said to him, if you do come any further, by God I will fire; with that I cocked my pistol, and the pistol did go off: there was a man hung in his head a little; I loaded my pistol directly. No others approached.</p>
               <p>Where did you wound this man? - In the left hand; the ball went through his wrist, and broke a button on his breast, which providentially did not enter his body, or else it would have killed him. When I opened the door, they were all fled: his accomplice said, I would shoot you through the body, if I had a pistol, I sent to the landlord before that, to get a peace officer.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner is the man that was with the goods? - I am quite confident and positive that he is the man that I saw with the goods; I am quite confident he is the man that opened his mouth, and desired me to fire. After that they were pretty quiet and peaceable; the prisoner came and said, Mr. Pudsey, you have killed me; I cannot do you any hurt, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100091"/>hope I shall die in peace. I said, I hope I have not killed you, but if you are killed, I hope you will die in peace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You received no blow from these people? - I received no blow.</p>
               <p>You was very safe in the stable, and they all round? - I was not safe.</p>
               <p>The goods were in the stable at the same time, and never removed by any body? - I would not suffer them to come in.</p>
               <p>You meant to stay some time at this place? - We were going away, and they drove us back into the stable.</p>
               <p>How long might this poor man be confined by the shot through his arm? - I really cannot say how long; I never saw him from that time till now.</p>
               <p>He never has had the use of his arm since? - No, nor never will, I am afraid.</p>
               <p>He had not attempted to strike you? - He had attempted, by pushing a stick under the door; the door, I believe, at that time, was open.</p>
               <p>He could not hurt you: then he had done nothing before he pushed the stick under the door? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. When the man came to the back-door, you say he had a stick in his hand? - He had. I bade him go again and again; he kept advancing all the time towards me, till I fired at him.</p>
