               <p>Matthews. I am a watchman. As I was in Stepney church-yard, the prisoner came by with a bag on his back; I said a good morning to you (this was about a quarter before two o'clock, on the 26th of last month); I asked him what he had got, he said nothing but cloaths; I saw part of the fowls heads and legs hang out, and heard the hens make a noise; I said they are comical cloaths to talk; I took hold of him, and took the fowls and him to the watch house; there were seven hens and a cock, and a ripping chissel in the bag (produced in court). Then he said a man gave him the fowls at Mile-end; I asked him who that friend of his was; he said he did not know him; he fell down on his knees, and begged I would let him go.</p>

            . About half an hour after seven o'clock on that Wednesday night, Leach and I went to the prosecutors window; he broke the window, and took out a piece of white cloth, it measured 16 yards and a half; he gave it to me, and I went away with it, and in the mean time he took out two more pieces, and brought them to me; then he went and fetched another piece. I went to his house, then we went and took all the cloth down to Mrs. Nursey's shop; we offered to sell it her at 9 d. a yard, she would not buy it; we sold her a little bit that was cut off from a piece for 13 d. 1/2, then we went home to Leach's house, and staid there all night; the next morning Merrit took the cloth, and sold it to a Jew for 18 d. a yard; we had 1 l. 17 s. for it, and drank two or three pots of beer together.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Merrit?</p>
               <p>Blackmore. He is one of our gang; he has been tried two or three times; but he was not with us when we took the cloth.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Nursey. The evidence, and a person like the prisoner Leach, came to my shop, they offered me this small piece of cloth; (produced in court.) It was then wet and dirty; I then took it to be flannel; I bought it of them; after that they produced more, I refused buying any of it; I then suspected it was not honestly come by, and was sorry I had bought this piece.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Look at this cloth.</p>

I went up way, and meet the prisoner coming down I said, What are you at there? He said, No arm; he wanted a taylor. I took him by coat, and we came down. I said we have no tylors here. He opened his coat, and said I have not robbed you of any thing. I said I intend to see that, and he should not go till I was satisfied. He said I should not hinder him. I called assistance, and took him backwards. I then went up stairs, and missed seven guineas, and the other things mentioned in the indictment. I came down, and put my hand to his waistcoat pocket; then he took the spoons and ladle out of his coat pocket, and laid them on the table. I said I missed seven guineas. He took some money out and laid it on the table; some of the people counted it, and there were but six. I said there must be more; he then took out more, which when counted wanted 6 d. we found the 6 d. upon the stairs afterwards, which I suppose dropt out of the papers. They were in silver and small gold, ready for change.</p>

We took him into the back room; then Mr. Free went up stairs and came down again, and said he had been robbed of seven pounds, seven shillings, three spoons, and a silver ladle; then the prisoner took the spoons, ladle and money, out of his pocket.</p>

I think it was on Tuesday, March the 4th, the prisoner came into my shop, there was a glazier putting in a pane of glass in the door; the prisoner stood in the shop near an hour. I asked him what he wanted; he said he would tell me presently. After that I asked him again if he wanted any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290009"/> particular; he said no. After some time he took out this watch, (produced and deposed to by prosecutrix) and said he wanted three guineas and a half upon it. I said, is it your own; he said no, it is Mr. Burton's, a plumber in the Strand. I took it in and after he was gone, I looked out and saw him standing with some paviours near Mr. Burton's door, which gave me to believe he had told me the truth. On the Thursday in the evening I received a bill from Sir John Fielding. describing the watch; then I went to Mr. Burton, and asked him if he sent a man with such a watch to me; he said no. I said, is there such a young man lives with you; he said there was a young man lived with him, but he was gone out, and when he came in he would send for me. After that I was sent for, but neither I or my wife could be certain to him. We went to Sir John Fielding's to know where the watch was lost from; about ten minutes after came Mr. Burton's young man, who said he had found out where Mrs. Hall lives, and he would go with me to see if he was the person. When we came there, she said she had a suspicion of one Allison that had lodged there; we went and found him working in his business. The prisoner said he was very sorry, and hoped I would be favourable in my evidence.</p>

We heard no more of him till the Saturday, then a man came and told me where he was; then I went and took him; I had missed 23 guineas out of my pocket that night, and when we took him he had 10 guineas, a 5 s. 3 d. piece.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290011"/> and two or three shillings upon him; he confessed it was my property, and that he had taken the money and things, but the man that he confessed it to is gone to the Indies.

            . I am servant to Mr. Caley; I was by when these goods (produced in court) were found in the prisoner's box; the key was produced in the house, I think by her fellow-servant; these were Mrs. Caley's property.</p>

               <p>Hawkesworth. She came on the 18th of February, between seven and eight, to buy some blond lacc. I shewed her a box, and she bought about as much as came to 1 s. by noon, after she was gone, we missed a card of blond lace; I was very sure I had not shewed any lace to any body but her, and was resolved to lay wait for her the next time she came; and on the Monday morning, the 23d of February, she came again much about the same time. to buy some white ribbon; I shewed her some, and observed every parcel that lay in the drawer; the piece of white was in the corner next to her; it was missing. I charged her, and she was committed to the Poultry Compter; I went and confronted her with all these goods, after we had searched her box, and shewed her them; she confessed to all, and said she took them all in the shop; she did not say when, but we believe she took them from time to time; she has been an old customer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether they were taken away before or after Mrs. Caley's death?</p>
               <p>Hawkesworth. That I cannot say.</p>

            . The prisoner came to my master's on the 18th of February; I missed a card of blond lace after she was gone. She came again on the 23d for a little white ribbon; I saw her take a piece of white silk ribbon out of the box, and put it into her pocket. I let her go out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290012"/> the shop; then I brought her back, and took it from her. Then I charged her with the card of lace; she owned she had it at home, and said if I would go along with her, she would give it to me again. I acquainted my master with it, and she was sent to the Compter. The lace was found in her box with the other things.</p>

               <p>I leave it to the mercy of the court; I am guilty of taking the lace and nothing else.</p>

            . I am a constable. About eight o'clock in the morning, on the 28th of February, I saw the boy at the bar offer several to sell in Lower Thames-street; immediately I was called by a gentleman to detect him; I went and asked him how he came by them: he first said his mother trusted him to sell them; after that he said his mother was dead, and he found them in a dust-hole in Marybone street; I knowing there was no dust-hole there, cross questioned him again; then he told me he and three more broke open a shop in the Hay-market, and they trusted him to sell them in Rosemary-lane, and meet them in St. James's Park to share the money, I took him before Mr. Alderman Cokayne; the Alderman desired me to find out the owner if I could, as I lived that way. I began at Charing-cross, and was soon directed to Mr. Wingfield, by the mark on a hat, it being his mark. I went to his house; he knew the hat, and owned it as soon as he saw it.

He said, what money was in it; I said there were two guineas, five half guineas, and one nine-shilling piece, wrapped in a piece of paper, in a leather bag twisted round. He held up a bag, and said, can you swear to this: said I, let me look at the top of it, and I'll tell you: he shewed me the top; I said that was it; then he delivered it, with the money and paper in it, as I had said.</p>

            . I took Harris as he stuck in the prosecutor's window; his face was in the shop. He had been in; there were the marks of his feet in the shop, and the glass was pushed in; he was with his back downwards; he was cut, and bleeding very much. The other prisoner is a watchman; he and the boy Harris were in company about two hours before, and two other boys with them; they went into a public-house and called for beer; the woman was afraid to draw them beer. Hencher said, what are you afraid of, do you think I will bring any bad people here; then she drawed them some beer: after that Harris pulled out some money, seemingly to me to distribute among them; the woman was frighted, and begged we would not leave her while they were in the house, her husband not being within. About one o'clock the two prisoners went out of the house and returned again; Harris came in first and sat a little time; then Hencher came in; then there was some whispering; then they went out again. After that I went out, and saw Harris in the plight I mentioned in the prosecutor's window. We got a candle; there lay his hat under the side of the window. After I took him out, we asked him how he came to do such a thing. He said, Hencher broke the place open, and told him he knew there were a number of shoes in the shop, and if he got them he would take them to his watch-box, and there they would be safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by when Hencher was taken?</p>
               <p>Elson. I was. He said he knew nothing of it; he was in the alehouse before I went in again; he had not returned from crying the hour one above ten minutes, when I brought Harris into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide is the window where Harris was in?</p>
               <p>Elson. I take it to be about ten inches and a half one way, and twelve the other. It was part of an old sash turned sideways; it was the upper pane that was broke; the shoes were lying on the outside, one in Harris's hat, and the other by the side of it. Harris owned it to be his hat.</p>

            . I am going into the 15th year of my age. I was sitting at the One Tun, in came Hencher; he said to Harris, if his master was gone to bed he might stay in his watch-house all night. We asked if there were room for us all; there were Harris, I, and another. He said there were; we all crowded into his box; it being a rainy night we got a pot of purl. Hencher said he knew of a good shop to break into, and wanted Harris to get into it. Harris shook his head, but said nothing to it. Hencher said he would go round his beat and come again to us; he said there were a good many boots and shoes in it; he went out, and we with him; we went into an alehouse and had two pots of purl; then Harris and he went out to cry the beat. I heard Harris cry it. Then they came in; and afterwards Harris went out and Hencher staid in; soon after that Harris was brought in bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. What does, Harris do for a livelihood?</p>
               <p>Fisher. He rides horses about; he used to come to the One Tun alehouse at the corner of Field-lane. I heard him say he got twelve shillings once by knocking the lobb.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Fisher. That is breaking open a place.</p>

            . On the 26th of March I lost a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of sheepskin breeches. (The indictment is wrong, I did not lose velvet breeches.) I found my things again at Mr. Master's, a pawnbroker, about three hours after they were taken. My apprentice had seen the prisoner go in there with a bundle; he came and told me.

               <p>Mr. Masters. The prisoner brought a coat, waistcoat, and a pair of leather breeches, and pledged them to me the 26th of March; the prosecutor came and owned them, and desired me to stop him if he came again. He came again in about three hours after for more money, and I stopt him. I asked him how he came to take his master's things; he said he did it in order to keep it up; that is, I suppose, to keep up his frolick. He was very drunk.</p>

            . Going by the prosecutor's shop, I saw two lads run out of the shop; I called, and Mr. Thompson came out; he missed the cannisters. We went down the street, he one way and I the other; I met the prisoner; I clapped my hand upon him and said, I believe you are one of the lads that robbed Mr. Thompson of some tea. I felt about him, and found the cannister under his coat; Mr. Thompson came and took it of me.

               <p>Toler. I am not sure of that. When I stopped him, and told him he was one of the lads that robbed Mr. Thompson, he said it was two boys that are gone that way, pointing; I looked, but saw no boys.</p>

The prisoner came house last Tuesday, between one and two o'clock he said another gentleman was coming to him; there was only one gentleman in the room where he was. I saw him come in, and saw him have the tankard. I went up stairs; my wife sent immediately up to me, to let me know the man was run away with the tankard. I came down and sent my man after him, but he could not meet with him. I went to Goldsmith's-hall and got hand-bills out, and about seven o'clock Mr. Benbrook came and let me know he had my tankard. The prisoner left this coat behind him in a handkerchief (produced in court). I never saw the prisoner in my life before that time, but I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I live in Tothill street, Westminster; the prisoner brought this tankard to me last Tuesday, about five o'clock in the afternoon; he wanted to pledge it for five guineas; I looked at it, and asked him several questions: he said he had had it about seven months, and that it was left him as a legacy by an uncle at the back of Barnet church. I said his account was not satisfactory<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290017"/> to me; if he was agreeable that I should enquire farther, I would lend him money upon it. I went home with him to where he lived; there I had such a character of him from a person that I was satisfied: then he wanted six guineas, saying he was going down on board a ship. After he was gone I received a warning from Goldsmith's-hall, giving an account of it; then I went to Sir

            . I am a clerk to the treasurers of the Navy, employed to pay seamen's wages at Portsmouth. On Tuesday the 17th of February, I was in the Pay-office; the prisoner came in and applied to Mr. Hill, desiring to know if the other seamen of the Modeste were paid or not. Mr. Hill asked her if she had any authority, any will or power from her husband; she said she had none. Then he said he could give her no intelligence; then she began to cry, and said she lived with one Mr. Field, a salesman in Thames-street, and was employed in making of bags for him. I wanted to know if she could prove herself the widow; she said she was well known to one Mr. Everden that lived there. Then he let lier know what was due to Walker, as we concluded her to be the widow; she asked what steps she must take; I told her she must get her marriage certificate, and take out an administration at the Commons, and swear the wages were under 40 l. I taking her to be an ignorant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290020"/> woman, wrote it down for her. She asked me if it was necessary for her to come again to Protsmouth to receive; I told her she might receive the wages in London, but cautioned her to employ such that were of reputation, and if she was not the real widow to be careful, for it would be of bad consequence; she went away very thankful. After that I found a letter, in looking over forae papers from an agent in London, giving an account to take care, for there was another letter of attorney taken out in Doctor's Commons. I then wrote to the gentlemen I had recommended her to, to tell them there was such a fraud as I apprehended. I sent to Mr. Everden, who said Mr. Walker was something related to him; he said he believed Walker had left a widow, whom he apprehended was in Portsmouth, but he had not seen her. We found the prisoner was wife to a cook of a ship, and this cook had received half a year's pay, to enable his wife to go to London to take out the letters of administration to

I asked the cook if the prisoner was his wife; he said she was. I asked Mr. Everden if he knew her, and if she was Walker's wife; I think he said she was the widow of his grandson, that was Walker. I then asked the prisoner how she came to tell me such a story, that she lived in London. I observed this paper in her hand; (the forged certificate produced) by looking on the back of it I was convinced she had been at the Navy-office.

I asked her which was the first marriage; she said her's was; then I told her the other was void. I asked her where she was married; she said at Rochester. In the course of the conversation she laid this certificate on my desk; I thought it looked like a writ; I asked what it was; she told me it was a certificate of her marriage. Upon looking it over, from the diction, and spelling, and what I saw upon it. I said this is a forgery; no clergyman could ever write such a certificate as this. She said no, it was not; I turned away to one Everden that was with her, that pretended to be a relation; I told her if she would go to the pay-office, they would look it over. She went out of the house; I took great care to follow her at a distance; as she went on one side the house, (as I thought:) I went on the other; I went on to the pay-office, and staid there four or five minutes; she never came; after that we went to see for her, but could not find her; then I went on board the ship, and found Peck the husband; he said she was gone away; I sent people after her, they went on the road, and I had word brought me they had secured her. They brought her, according to my order, to Mr. Hughes, at the pay-office; there she said she got this certificate made in London by a man; then she said, she never had been married to

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. The day before Easter Monday at night, my house was made very secure; we went to bed at twelve o'clock. I ordered my maid to get up very early in the morning; she did, and came very abruptly to my door and said, madam, we are broke open, for the bureau is broke; I started up out of my sleep and jumped out of bed, and down stairs I went, and found the bureau was out open and the lock forced, and the bureau risted; we found a place where they had endeavoured to get in, which was a glass door that comes into the garden; but it being a double door, they could not get in there; they had thrown up all the sashes in the parlour, and strove much to get in there, by loosening some of the hinges, but cou ld not get in there; they took off one bar of a window in the garden, and got through. I had a very strong look upon the laundry or dairy-door, they had broke that entirely off; after they had done that, I apprehend they took several things in the kitchen, some of my servant maids silver buckles, and other things; they broke a lock in the parlour, and forced a bolt, and broke my husband's bureau, they broke two or three locks; they broke another lock, and took out a ewer not silver it was French plate; they took three tops to castors, a silver milk-pot, four silver spoons, a silver pepper-box, a silver candlestick gilt with gold. There was a stick found at the bottom of the stairs, which was not there when we went to bed.</p>

The prisoner at the bar and another person came to my house on the 31st of January, between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290026"/> two and three in the morning; they knock'd at the door, and insisted upon coming in; I said, I let nobody in at that time of the night, but if you'll go quietly to bed I'll let you in; they said they would; I let them in; they insisted upon having something; they drank two bottles of wine and went to bed. In the morning M'Donnell ordered coffee for breakfast; when that was over they rang the bell, I answered; M'Donnell asked me if I would give him change; he took his pocketbook out and gave me this draft (holding it in his hand.)</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Hinton Brown and Co. this draft was brought to me by a waiter; I suspected it to be a false draft; he said he brought it from the Turk's Head bagnio; I applied to Mr. Brown, he said it was not a good one.</p>

             I have known the prisoner ten or eleven years, he is by trade a hatter. He told me in September last, he was going into business with a gentleman lately come from the West-Indies, who was to find money and he judgment. In two or three days after that, he called upon me in order to ask me a question in regard to a woman; he said he was going into the city, he desired me to take a walk with him; we went to a house in Cheapside. When we came there he went to the bar, and asked if any body had enquired for him; we sat down, and presently Mr. Brown came in. He said the gentleman had been there but was gone; the prisoner said he was sorry for that: Brown gave M'Donnel a draft; I had the curiosity to look at it, it had a banker's cheque, and was for 50 l. drawn upon Mess. Brown and son, Lombard-street, signed T. Haydon, (he looks at the draft) it was very much like this, but I cannot swear to it; this was about the Thursday after the 16th of December. He gave him this note in order to buy goods: they talked about their business. Brown told me he had a will of a relation that died in the East-Indies, and had left him 4000 l. He desired me to go to the Sword-blade coffee-house; I did, but he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

            . I am sixteen years old. Mr. Lacy came one market-day, and put his horse up at the King's Head in Smithfield, where I live; he saw me tie him up in the stable; I did not take his bridle and saddle off. Then Mr. Lacy went into the market; my master sent me of an errand; when I came back, Mr. Lacy came and called for his horse and he was gone; it was a chesnut coloured horse.</p>

            . I keep a public-house at Stourton in Norfolk. I was in my yard; I heard a horse rush out at my gate; I stood a little while to hear what could be the meaning of it; this was between seven and eight at night, on the 27th of October: presently I heard a footman and a horseman come out at the same gate; they made towards Bury. They made a full stop, and came both right back again up into the field. I thought they were after no good; I went and told a neighbour there were some men after the horse; he, his father, and brother, and I, pursued them into the field; there we took the two prisoners at the bar; Hale had a bridle in his hand, Smith had a halter which he dropped down by the side of the horse he was upon, which the prosecutor owns. I asked him to dismount, he said he would not: I said to the boy that was on the other side, have a care; for what, said Smith, I have no fire-arms. We took them before the Justice the next day, and they were committed to Ipswich goal, the horse was delivered into the constable's hands, who took care of him till Mr. Lacy came. The horse was brought to my house, there he saw and swore to him.</p>

             Being told there were some people in the field after my horses, I made after them. Hale came running down in a great hurry. I said, halloo; he made no answer; I gave him a little nap on his crown and knocked him down; he got up and came at me; I got the fall of him, and when he was down I catch'd hold of a bridle he had in his hand, but I found he was too strong for me; then I called out for help, we secured him, and took him to the public-house; (the bridle produced) Smith was on horseback; he came up out of the turnips the moment I had caught Hale; we took him, and the next day we took them to the Justice, and they were both committed to Ipswich goal.</p>
               <p>Smith's defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Smithfield, I there asked the prosecutor for a job: he desired the boy to deliver the horse to me, for me to ride him about the market. I rode him about; there came a one-eyed man, and told me where my mare was that I had lost; he said she was down in Norfolk; I rode away directly on Mr. Lacy's horse to see after her; there was no mare. Coming back I met Hale; I thought I saw my mare in a field, I sent him down; he came to me and said there is never a one. I said I saw one over the hedge; he said do you go. I went down to see, and they came and took us.</p>

I said he had better go about his business, for I would not be robbed; I had a cane in my right hand, but he being too near me I could not strike him with it. I took him a blow with my left hand on the right shoulder, and drove him from me; then I struck him two blows with my cane, which drove him into the middle of the street; he recovered himself, and took to his heels and ran away. I called out, Watch, stop thief; he ran down into the King's-road, and down Gray's-inn-lane; I followed him. We imagined he had got into the field and gave the pursuit over, but coming back, in the King's-road, two watchmen had got him. He fell on his knees and begged I would forgive him, saying he did not intend to hurt me, the pistol not being charged; I said that would be a circumstance in his favour; he told me he threw it down into an area; upon searching it was found, and not charged. He confessed the fact, and said he was very sorry. He had a painted nose on, which was afterwards found in his pocket.</p>

             the evidence, and put a pistol into the coach, and said stop; he put it to my breast (I think it was a pistol, he says it was not;) he then went and stopped the horses, and then came to the coach again. I said, we are all poor people, we have nothing for you; the deceased said to the coachman, go along, we will not be robbed by them. Immediately one of them put a pistol to his head, and blowed his head to pieces; it was so dark I could not tell which it was. I turned about and saw two men at the other side the coach; I jumped out, and Ryan knocked me down directly; I went to get up upon my knees, and he knocked me down again; I went to get up a third time, he knocked me down again; after I got up there came a couple of gentleman, I said, don't go any farther, there are highway men robbing the coach now; they took me to the White Horse. After that, when the coach came up, I was told Griffiths was shot dead; he sat upright in the coach; when we came to move him I saw he was dead. I went to see Johnson when he was in prison; he said he was the man that saved my life, for Ryan after he had killed the other, wanted to come back and kill me; and that Johnson said to him, no, you have killed enough; then Ryan said, I'll kill you directly.</p>

               <p>Mr. Underwood. We had been to see a man run in stiles; we were at the Red Lion at Holloway; it grew very dark and rained; we all four agreed to go home in a coach; we had not been set out above six or seven minutes but we were stopt; after that it drove a little way and then stopt again. The words were hardly out of the deceased's mouth, he saying he would not be robbed, before the pistol went off; we never opened the coach door; they went to open it, and down fell the deceased; then they came to the other side and robbed me. Gorman was the man that came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290029"/> into the coach, I know again him by his voice. They took my hat; I said, I hope you will be so kind as to give me my hat; Gorman said, who has the gentleman's hat, they gave it me. As soon as they had done, which was in about ten minutes, they said, here take your messmate into your coach, he is fast asleep. I took and hauled him into the coach, they assisting; and when we came to the White Horse we saw he was dead: his head was shot to pieces. I think I saw about four of the highwaymen. I think it was Gorman's voice that said, it does not signify to make any resistance, for there are twelve of us in the gang, and money we want. Then I said, if it is money you want take it, and do not use us ill. I cannot say I know any of them by their faces.</p>

            . It was proposed to go a robbing by Gorman; we were not acquainted with the road; we trusted to Brown, for that he knew the road. We went to one Fitzpatrick, an Irishman, at the Angel and Crown; we had three or four pots of beer there. Brown had a falling out with a man, and he pulled out a pistol and swore he would blow his brains out. Then we went on to another house and drank there; we talked about the man's running; I said if I had but 5 l. in the world I would lay it against him. After that we went out, Brown went up and stopped a post-chaise boy; but finding nobody in the chaise we let it go by, after Brown had taken 2 s. and a shirt from the boy; immediately came a coach, Brown went and stopped it; I went to the coach door and said, deliver your money; the coach did not stop, I went and laid hold of the horses reins, then I heard a pistol go off. I asked who fired the pistol, I thought the people in the coach had fired against me; then I saw Brown, Gorman, and another man helping the man into the coach; then they shut the door; then I asked again who fired the pistol; Gorman turned about and said he fired it; I upbraided him for firing it, fearing he should take the man's life; he swore by all that was good and great he would take my life if I spoke a word. We left them, and went into a house and shared the money which we took from them.</p>

On the Wednesday after she came to my house, about five doors from her mistress's, I saw an alteration. I said, what have you done, could you deliver yourself; she said she was delivered standing by the bedside, and the child dropped from her, and she took it and wrapt it up, and in the morning threw it down the vault.

            . I am a surgeon; I was called in to attend the Coroner. I opened the child, and threw the lungs in water and they swam, from whence I concluded the child had breathed. There was no marks of violence upon it. I observed the navel-string was broke quite close to the navel, so that there could no ligament possibly be made; so that it could not have lived past a minute or two, but must bleed to death; this might happen as she stood erect, and it is more likely to happen by a violent fit of coughing.</p>

We stopped the Newington stage, and robbed four gentlemen that were in it and a gentlewoman; we got five guineas in gold and some silver, a gold watch and a coat; Sweetman insisted on having the coat, and the gentlemen would not give it him, so Brown struck at him. We went home; Gorman had the watch: we put five halfpence in a hat and hussled for it, and he hussled four heads, so the watch remained in his possession.

            . On Sunday the 8th of March, I had been at St. Dunstan's church; I came out at the hither door, and saw the two prisoners, and two others less than they; the prosecutor came by with his coat unbottoned; they all four turned about; Mitchell was first and Anderson next; I saw Mitchell put his hand in the prosecutor's pocket, and take out a handkerchief; I tapp'd him on the shoulder, and told him what I had seen; he felt, and said, I have lost it sure enough; we seized the prisoners, the others made off; I had observed Anderson backwards and forwards with them several times, before the gentleman came by; he dropt a handkerchief just before I got him to St. Paul's church yard.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been drinking?</p>
               <p>Picket. I had.</p>

               <p>Picket. I certainly was struck down; I made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man ask you for your money?</p>
               <p>Picket. No, he took it when I was down, without asking; he took my gold watch, and mourning ring, five guineas and a half, and 14 or 15 s. in silver from me.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going my rounds on Friday night was three weeks, I found Mallett at the corner of a shop in Tyburn-road; I knowing him to be a thief, examined him if he had any tools about him to break houses; I found nothing but a knife, I let him go. Looking about, I found a hole bored with a centre-bit in the window-shutter; I desired the watchman to put his candle out. I went down the street, Mallett was on the other side; I went to him, and asked him if he would give me any thing to drink: he said he had no blunt, he had only thrums, that is a cant-word in their language for 3 d. He came over the way, I took him to the round-house; then I shewed him the shop that had the hole bored in it; after that this breast-wimble and centre-bit in it (produced in court) was found under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176704290039"/> the window, but he disowned knowing any thing of it. This girl Davis told me of two Jews that the prisoners were acquainted with, but they were not to be found. I went to take Stevens one day last week; he said, you are come too late, I knew of your coming. I searched for the whip but that was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Davis. What do you know concerning two Jews?</p>
               <p>Davis. There were two Jews that lived in Houndsditch. I was sent with a letter to them, to let them know Mr. Mallett was in prison, to desire they would let him have a trifle of money. I found only one of their wives; I let her know he was in goal, and her husband must let him have a trifle of money, or he would give an account of something that he would not like. I mentioned this to Mr. Hartley, and went with him and shew'd him the house.</p>
               <p>Mallett's defence.</p>
               <p>I met this Mr. Hartley, we talked about something; he took all the things out of my pocket; he asked me for my watch, I said I had none; he let me go, I went up as far as Oxford-market; then he came and called to me, I went to him; he told me I had been a glazing.</p>
               <p>Hartley. That in their language is house-breaking.</p>

               <p>I know no more of this affair than your Lordship; I don't know where this girl's lodgings are.</p>
               <p>Stevens's defence.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about it, I never was in the girl's room in my life; there came two or three people to me and asked me for the whip; they searched the house all over, and could find none; they said you may as well tell where it is, you have put it out of the way. They took me to a public-house, and wanted to get something out of me. They are some of Sir
