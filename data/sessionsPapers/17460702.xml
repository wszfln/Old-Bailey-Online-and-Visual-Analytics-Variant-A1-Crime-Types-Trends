            .) Where was you robb'd, and when?</p>
               <p>Crey. The 22 d of May last; my Father-in-Law desir'd me to go to Bow Fair to seek after his Children about Eleven o'Clock at Night; so we went to the Fair and saw nothing of them there; but heard they were stray'd upon the Common; in coming from thence we went into a Booth upon the Common and ask'd for the Children: On the Fields Side of the said Common, near Stepney, a Man pass'd me and bid me good Night; presently after another, and he bid me good Night also; I bid him good Night, and he wish'd me well home: It was Moonlight and I walk'd 'till I got under the Shade of the Trees, when a Man came behind me and snatch'd my Stick out of my Hand; he put a Pistol to my Breast and bid me stand and deliver; immediately another jump'd from behind the Stile and clapp'd his Pistol to my Breast also: They demanded my Money, threatning to blow my Brains one in Case of Refusal; I told them I had none, and begg'd they would not use me ill and I would give them what I had; with that one of them put his Hand into my Fob and took out my Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember which it was?</p>
               <p>Crey. I can't tell, my Lord, but he had a Frock and a Regimental Waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Q. What Watch was it?</p>
               <p>Crey. A Pinchheck Metal Watch with a Gold Dial-Plate and a Cornelian Seal set in Gold to it; they search'd my Pockets and took out a Couple of Handkerchiefs, one Silk and the other Linnen; they also took my Pocket-Book: One took out my Watch and another of them my Pocket-Book.</p>
               <p>Court . So they both of them were rifling of you?</p>
               <p>Crey. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know them?</p>
               <p>Crey . I can't say, my Lord, that I know them. I told them my Pocket-Book would be of no Service to them, and desir'd they would return it: They took the Silver Buckles out of my Shoes and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020003"/> Knead , and then bid me go over the Stile; they sent me towards Limehouse , which was a Mile out of the Way. There were three of them, but only two came up; I saw the other robbing my Father-in-Law.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your Father-in-Law's Name?</p>
               <p>Crey. His Name is Bitch .</p>
               <p>Q. What Business is your Father-in-Law.</p>
               <p>Crey. A Perukemaker, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go the Way they would have sent you?</p>
               <p>Crey. No, my Father desir'd I might go with him .</p>
               <p>Court. You say one bad on a Footman's Frock and a Regimental Waistcoat?</p>
               <p>Crey. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the other apparel'd?</p>
               <p>Crey . I could not see any thing of either of them for the Shade of the Trees; only the Man that pass'd me in the Moon-shine, he that stopp'd me first, who had on a Footman's Frock, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what kind of Pistols they were?</p>
               <p>Crey. I took them to be Holster Pistols ; I could not distinctly see them as they had them in their Hands. I took the Men to be Troopers.</p>

               <p>Birch .

I saw two Men stop my Son and head all that was said; my Son said to them, Gentlemen , don't use me ill, I have nothing valuable about me but my Watch, Shoe-Buckles and Knee-Buckles .</p>
               <p>Q. How far was you from him?</p>

            .) What do you know in relation to this Matter?</p>
               <p>Barns. My Lord, I keep a Goldsmith's Shop upon Ludgate-Hill; there came a young Woman to me to weigh some Buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Barns. The 23d of May.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those Buckles?</p>
               <p>Barns. They were two Pair of Shoe-Buckles and Knee-Buckles; they were brought by a Servant, who said said she came from her Mistress in Fleet-Lane to know the Value of them; I look'd upon them and weigh'd them, and as I had a Warning from the Goldsmiths Company to stop two Pair of Shoe-Buckles and a Pair of Knee-Buckles , and these Things answering the Description in the warning, I told the Maid I would go along with her; I took the Warning in my Pocket, and call'd upon one Mr. Johnson, a Constable, to go with me; and desir'd him not to go directly into the House, but stay a little; so I went in and there were two or three Women and a Man there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Barns. In Fleet-Lane. When I came into the House I enquir'd who the Buckles belong'd to; the Woman of the House said they were a Man's who had left them there; I ask'd when he would return, and she said she was not certain as to the Time of his Return : I desir'd to know whether it would be a Week or a Fortnight, and enquir'd who the Gentleman was that sat by her; she said it was her Brother ; so with that I pull'd this Warning out of my Pocket and read it; as soon as ever I had done she got up and went into a Place backward and I follow'd her; a Soldier was sitting in a Chair there and I ask'd him if they were his Buckles; he said yes, and that he bought them in Covent-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Man either of these?</p>
               <p>Barns. Yes, Humphrys one of the Prisoners at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Then those were the two Pair of Buckles, and the Knee-Buckles.</p>
               <p>Barns. Yes, my Lord, and he said he had bought them at Covent-Garden, and gave Half a Guinea for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean Half a Guinea for all the Buckles?</p>
               <p>Barns. Yes, for all of them. Then I told the Constable he must carry him before my Lord Mayor, and we went there, but my Lord was not within; then I ask'd for the Beadle of Goldsmith's-Hall , to give Information to the Gentleman that gave this Warning out, &amp;c.</p>

            (to Johnson, the Constable) What do you know of this Affair?</p>
               <p>Johnson. Mr. Barns call'd upon me on Friday the 23d of May; I went with him to the House in Fleet-Lane; I stood at the Door at first, that no Body might go out of the House; after Mr. Barns had some Talk with the Woman, I went in; the Woman, she seem'd to be in some Confusion: I said good Woman, these Buckles have been stolen and if you don't bring the Person that owns them we must charge you. With that she went backward, and beckon'd with her Hand for Mr. Barns and I to follow her; when we came backward, there sat Humphry's, one of the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What Cloaths had he on?</p>
               <p>Johnson. It seem'd to be the Cloaths he has on now, tho' I won't be sure, but I know his Face.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you follow'd the Woman and there you found this Man.</p>
               <p>Johnson. Yes my Lord. I said there had been a Robbery committed and these Buckles answer'd the Description of the Advertisement, and I said I was fearful he was the Thief. He said he had the Foul Disease upon him, that his Sister gave him Half a Guinea yesterday and he bought these Buckles with it; I said if he could give me no better Account of it I should take him Prisoner before my Lord Mayor; so I took him to the Compter as my Lord Mayor was not within; the next Morning I went to him again and I ask'd him about the Buckles, then he said he bought them on Friday, and before he said he bought them on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Bray. One of the Tongs of the Buckles was broke which they took from Mr. Crey. Then, when they had robb'd the Gentleman, they came to me, and ask'd me whether I had look'd upon his Shoe-buckles and Knee-Buckles, which I had not; for after I had knock'd this Gentleman down into the Ditch, he took out an Instrument, and said, I might have that if it would be of any Service; I told him it would be of no Use of me, he might keep it and be d - d.</p>

               <p>Gardner. No, my Lord, I was out of Town that Day , but the Prisoner said he watch'd my Wife into the Parlour; then he, with one Cutosh , did it, who was concern'd with him in the Robbery. The Prisoner own'd to me, that when my Wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020007"/> was in the Parlour, they took an Opportunity to press down the Glass, but they could not get the Watch out readily. Then they went and got a Nail and crook'd it, and with that they haul'd the Watch out, and he whipt it into the others Bosom. They could not get their Hand in, but with a crooked Nail haul'd it out, and, as I said before, deliver'd it into the other Boy's Bosom; they then cross'd the Way through Aldgate, and turn'd down Crutched-Fryers , and upon Tower-Hill; there the Boy gave this the Watch again, and he put it into his Fob or Breeches, and they went to a Jew's in Rag-Fair to sell the Watch, but he was not at home. They went then to Rice Jones's Wife in Long-Lane, West-Smithfield, who keeps a Chandler's Shop, and sells Small Beer, and they sold it for Two Guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Watch worth?</p>
               <p>Gardner . Seventeen Guineas, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what Age this Boy is?</p>
               <p>Gardner. He said he was 14 Years of Age. He came the second Time, and said he saw a fine Thing the Ladies use, but my Wife missing the Watch, took Care of the Glass; he said he came to get the Thing that the Ladies put in their Ears, or another Watch; that is what he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by this Boy?</p>
               <p>Gardner. I advertis'd my Watch Five Guineas Reward: There were two Men that make it their Business to take up these Boys, they with the Constable brought him to my Shop; they said they took him from between a Couple of Whores.</p>

Then they went to Long Lane in Smithfield, to Rice Jones's, where the Woman gave him Two Guineas for it. They gave Six-pence to a Person to carry it out to enquire whether it was Gold or Metal, and they said it was Metal. He said there was a preety Thing in the Glass, which were Bar-Ring, that he wanted, if not another Watch .</p>

             , (the Prisoner) had packed up a Bag of Cotton, 30 or 40 Pounds Weight. I came home the Friday Evening; I had been receiving some Money, and I sent him for Acceptance of a Note ; he brought me a Draught upon Alderman Hankey. The next Morning my Sister said, What Cotton was that John carried out to Iron Gate? I said I sold no Cotton: I look'd at him, and said, John, What is the Matter of this? he said, Sir, Don't be frighten'd and uneasy, for you shall know the Truth of it. My Brother said, John, I am afraid you are a Rogue : Indeed, we were extremely frighten'd at the Thing. He went out as if he was going to make Water, and took to his Heels, and away he went, and I heard no more of him; both my Brother and I saw him go, but our Surprize was so great, we had not Power to seize him, or call after him; he was a Man we had a very good Opinion of. With this I went to Iron Gate , to the Sign of the City of Bristol: I ask'd the Gentlewoman of the House, who is a Woman of good Character and Fortune, about him; she said he had Lodged in her House frequently. I ask'd her if she knew of any Cotton; she said he had brought something or another, and that he should say that Cotton was exceeding dear, and that little Parcel of Cotton was worth three or four Pounds. The next Thing I did, I sent to a Relation's of his in Burr-Street, in St. Katherine's , and while we were at this House together, talking of this Affair, the Prisoner came in: As soon as he came in, the Woman of the House shew'd him up Stairs, and said, John, I hear a sad Character of you. When he came up, I said John , how is this Thing? You have committed a Robbery here. At first, my Lord, he deny'd it; his Relation prevail'd upon him, and I together, to confess the Fact: I said the Thing will be better for you, don't be desperate, but confess the Truth. He told me, if I would have Mercy upon him, or something to that Purpose, he would tell me the whole Affair: He told me that he did bag up the Cotton in the Afternoon, and he had brought it to that very House, and that he would get me my Cotton again. He went out with his Relation and a Friend of mine, in order to bring it again. I said to his Relation, what must I do in a Thing of this Nature? I don't know how to act in it: Will you be Security that this Man will appear on Monday or Tuesday, in order to go before the Justice, or what is necessary? and let me see him the Beginning of the Week: Indeed, the Relation said, 'tis so tender a Thing, if you had ask'd me to have been Security for a Thousand Pound, I should have gave it for him, but as these Things appear , I will have nothing to do with it. My Lord, I have known the Man many Years; he has been a Man in Trade for himself, and worth a Thousand Pounds. In my Surprize I could not tell what to do with him: I took him over Tower-Hill, with a Design to carry him to my House, and desir'd he would be very candid with me, and tell me the whole Thing; he then said, I sold 24 lb. of your Cotton to Mr. Scarsbrook.</p>

I was in a Back Parlour even with the Shop, and there came a Woman into the Shop; there were some Ladies with me; one of them said, Mrs. Cumbridge , there is a Woman in your Shop: I went into the Shop and shew'd her something, but saw she had a Bundle in her Lap; she wanted some printed Linnen; I ask'd her what she had in her Lap; she said, what is that to you, 'tis none of your's : I said it was Cloth, and I was determin'd to look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no body in the Shop?</p>
               <p>Cumbridge . No, my Lord, I took the Piece of Cloth out of her Apron, whic h Cloth was twenty-two Yards; I look'd at it immediately , and knew it to be mine, because that very Morning I mark'd twenty of them with my own Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she so easily by it?</p>
               <p>Cumbridge. There lay a Quantity of them upon the Counter , which I had mark'd that very Morning .</p>
               <p>Q. Was all of them bundled up in that Manner?</p>
               <p>Cumbridge. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to it?</p>
               <p>Cumbridge . I shew'd her the rest with the same Mark .</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say.</p>
               <p>Cumbridge . She prmended the Child she had, about five Years old, pick'd it off the Ground.</p>

               <p>Q. You lost all these Things; do you know who took them?</p>
               <p>Pollen. I tax'd every other Servant; I thought I had great Reason to suspect the Cook: About a Months afterwards I discharg'd two Servants upon her Account. The Way we first miss'd them was this; Mr. Pollen wanted his black Coat; the Person that went up to the Press for it could not find it, and upon Search, my Joseph , that was in the same Place , was not there; we sent out to Monmouth-street to the Taylor; he made Enquiry n the same Street , and traced the Matter out: When the Person that bought the Coat of her saw her, he knew her again; she then told me the Person she had pawn'd the Joseph to; we found several Things in her Box, and this Handkerchief I found upon her Neck, which I am positive of.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a Mark upon it?</p>
               <p>Pollen. No, my Lord; but 'tis my own Work, and I know it.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020011"/>Marsh . Nothing more than that this Lad brought these Chains to me to sell; I told him they were of no Manner of Value to me but for old Iron.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Marsh. He said, will you buy these Chains; I was indifferent about it; they were worth no more to me than old Iron. He stood for a Penny a Pound; I said they were worth that and more to those that want them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a Blacksmith ?</p>
               <p>Marsh. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you bought them, and how many Chains are there?</p>
               <p>Marsh . Four Chains.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray , where do you live, Friend?</p>
               <p>Marsh . In Oxford Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, Did you know that Boy?</p>
               <p>Marsh . No, Sir; I have seen him before; I believe he don't live far from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what Occasion have you seen him before?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I had bought Part of a Grate of him which I was assur'd was his Father's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine him about these Things too?</p>
               <p>Marsh. I did ask him a Question or two, but not very strict.</p>
               <p>Court. I believe not. A mighty little Boy to deal in old Iron! 'Tis pretty odd for you to give three Farthings a Pound for these Chains for old Iron; in my Opinion you are more guilty than the Boy. The Jury desires to know what you would have a Pound for a Chain.</p>
               <p>Marsh. I don't make any such.</p>
               <p>Court . 'Tis such as you that incourage such little Thefts, in the Receiving of Stolen Goods.</p>

               <p>Jarvice . I am Watchman at the End of Flower-de-luce-Court in Fleet-Street. A Quarter of an Hour after Eleven, this Davis and a little Boy along with him, one Saunders, wanted a little Pit of Candle, I told them if they wanted Candle there was a Tallow-Chandler's hard by; some Time after this, I saw this Boy, the Prisoner, run as hard as he could; he was hardly gone but Mr. Camden came down and said he was robb'd, and ask'd me whether I saw any Body; but he was gone off; and I am sure that is the Boy that ran away.</p>

               <p>Box. On the 14th of June I had been hard at Work in the Morning, and in the Afternoon went to drink a Pot of Beer or two: When I went home I call'd my Wife three or four Times; but she being big with Child, and heavy to sleep, did not hear me, so I sat down on my own Bench at the Door and fell asleep; I can't say how long I slept, but during that Time I lost my Hat, Handkerchief, and the Shoe and Buckle from my Right Foot; but on her endeavouring to take the Buckle from my Left Foot I awak'd and caught her on the other Side of the Way, with my Shoe and Buckle in her Hand. I call'd the Watch directly, who came and carry'd her to the Watch-House, where we had not been above half an Hour before a Watchman that went out to seek for my Hat brought it in and put it upon the Shelf; about Two or Three o'Clock in the Morning they lock'd her up in the Watch-House, from whence she escap'd and took my Hat with her, and I saw no more of that or my Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you laid hold of her?</p>
               <p>Box. She said, I would have you take care what you do.</p>

I said I was afraid I had got into a bad House and desir'd to know what I had to pay. The old Woman told me Half a Crown; but thinking that too much, I said I would not pay it, and they swore I should not go out of the House 'till I had done so, threatning to strip me: The Women laid hold of me, (at which Time I had Half a Guinea and two new Shillings in my Pocket) and a Fellow pretended to call the Watch; but I got out and Yet a Mark upon the Door at the Corner of the House, I cut a Notch in the Timber and three Crosses on the Door.</p>

               <p>Candy. The young Woman had hold of me, but the old Woman took the Money out of my Pocket.</p>

               <p>Council. May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am Council against the unfortunate Prisoner at the Bar; the Indictment is grounded on an Act of Parliament wherein there are several Clauses; for Instance, if any Person shall unlawfully cut down or destroy Trees, set fire to any Barn, House, &amp;c. or shall willfully shoot at any Person, in any dwelling House or other Place, he shall be guilty of Felony: The clause we go upon is for willfully shooting at a Person. It may be necessary to shew for what Reason the Prisoner went to the House of Mr. Lewis, the Prosecutor, who is a <rs id="t17460702-15-viclabel60" type="occupation">Wheelwright</rs>

Mills knowing a Friend of Mr. Lewis's, with whom he had some Dealings, went to his House, and seeing a large Parcel of Wood, says, some of this wood grew in my Ground, I have a great Quantity coming to Town. Mills ask'd Lewis whether he was acquainted with Mr. Higgs, he said yes, and that he had had some Dealings with him; says he, I have more Timber coming up, and talk'd likewise of Sheep and Lambs coming up to Smithfield Market, though none were brought. This was to give him a Colour for Credit, and upon this he desir'd Mr. Lewis to go with him to one Mr. Jewel, and told him he should be much oblig'd to him to give a Note of Hand for 12 l. 12 s. 3 d. he expected to have receiv'd this Money the Friday following; but there were no such Persons as Mills or Nichols to be found: so, Gentlemen, upon this they made Enquiry, and after some time thought fit to go to this Place, Bassildon in Berkshire ; they went first to Mr. Higgs, where they got a particular Information of Mills; however he had Intelligence that Lewis was coming to his House. This is mention'd to shew that he willfully shot, and that he knew the Person, by Expressions or Words to this Effect: By G - d, Lewis, I'll shoot you; and he had no sooner spoke those words than he fir'd a Musket at him; but the Prosecutor hearing him say he would shoot him, fell down, so I suppose he miss'd his Aim: On finding the Man get up again, and endeavouring to run away, to shew him Malice, he said, G - d d - n him he is not dead, bring the Blunderbuss that I may blow his Brain, out; but it happily fell out that he escap'd. It may seem extraordinary that this Thing should end dormant so long; but Mills was backward and forward , and could not be apprehended sooner, so that the Prosecution could not be brought on before.</p>

             .) When was this?</p>
               <p>Lewis. The 9th of October, in 1743, the Prisoner came into our Yard, and said these are brave Felleys, I have a great Quantity of them. Mr. Nicholls was very handsomly dress'd, had a Silver Pair of Spurs, &amp;c. Says Mills, Master Lewis, do you know Mr. Higgs, I was recommended by him to you? They also wanted Lodgings, and I should have been glad to have lain out of my own Bed for them (with a View of buying a good Bargain;) but my wife was not willing; so I got them a Lodging elsewhere. Please you, my Lord, Mills and Nichollas had some Money of me; after this I went down to see if the Barges were come up; and when I came to speak to Mr. Higgs, I ask'd him how he could defraud me in the Manner he had done, and began to tell him the Story? He swore about Mills, and said, what has he been dealing in London again? When we went down to Bassildon he went with us to this Mill's House, which is near a Common; when I got to the Door Mills saw me, and said d - n you I'll shoot you, and levell'd a Piece at me.</p>
               <p>Q. What Distance was you from him when he said he would shoot you?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It might be about twenty Yards.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say after that?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He call'd for the Blunderbuss, and said he would blow my Brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was loaded with any thing?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I can't say whether it was loaded with Ball or Shot, it whistled by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to any Justice of Peace against this Man?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What Justice did you apply to?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I can't tell the Justice's Name.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Lewis. At Straitly . I shew'd him the forged Note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take your Information? Did you complain of his Shooting? Did you desire the Justice to grant you a Warrant against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Lewis . The Justice did not care to do any Thing with him, he is such a bad Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020015"/>Q. Did you make Complaints to the Justice of this Matter, and desire a Warrant?</p>
               <p>Lewis . I shew'd him how he trick'd me. He he said they were very vile Fellows, and that they were not safe in lying in their Beds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you request a Warrant from the Justice, and desire him to take your Information?</p>
               <p>Lewis . I went to the Justice at Straitly for Advice.</p>
               <p>Court. That was for the Cheat, and not for shooting at you; did you tell him in what Manner you had been shot at?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes , my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to exhibit this Indictment against him now ?</p>
               <p>Lewis. My Lord, for shooting at me, when I went down to endeavour to get my Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever endeavour to find him out?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes. But I never could find him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to take him up for the Cheat , or shooting?</p>
               <p>Lewis. For the Shooting, please you my Lord. And when we came away he said, Ah

               <p>Corbut. No, it was in her own House. She and I came up from a Ship together; and she persuaded me to lie with her that Night.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took the One and twenty shillings away?</p>
               <p>Corbut. Because I had this Money in a green Purse in my Pocket, that laid by the Bedside.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you been acquainted with her long?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Young. Yes, Sir, I know her as well as I know myself.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020019"/>Young. For a Shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask whose Plates they were?</p>
               <p>Young. No, my Lord, I knew her to be an honest Woman; I never heard a bad Character of her in my Life.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you done with the Plates?</p>
               <p>Young. When I heard Mrs. Backhouse was pursuing of her for a Silver Spoon, I look'd upon the Plates , and they have Mrs. Backhouse's Name, in Furnival's Inn, upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. If that was wrote upon the Plates, you should have looked upon them.</p>
               <p>Young . Yes, my Lord, I should.</p>
               <p>Court. I think 'tis a very odd Thing you should take such Things without looking upon the Name. Would you give Money upon them without opening ?</p>
               <p>Young . Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court . Suppose they had been Pantiles, or any Thing ?</p>
               <p>Q Did she leave the Cloth too.</p>
               <p>Young. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never open them?</p>
               <p>Young. I never open'd them.</p>
               <p>Court. 'Tis a very uncautious Way of acting; this is to encourage such Things.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you carry them home?</p>
               <p>Young. I believe it was the 19th of June, the Constable has them.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020023"/>Biles. They demanded my Money, and I told them I had none; they clapt three Pistols to my Head, and said, if I spoke another Word they would blow my Brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do?</p>
               <p>Biles. Then they took my Silver Buckles out of my Shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they throw you down?</p>
               <p>Biles. They never struck me, I stood all the Time; they took out one of my Knee-Buckles, and the other they made me take out myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these Buckles made of?</p>
               <p>Biles. Silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any thing else?</p>
               <p>Biles. Yes, a Silver Lac'd Hat, and a Pair of Leather Breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was these Breeches on?</p>
               <p>Biles. They were on my Body, and they made me take them off and give to them.</p>
               <p>Q. What else?</p>
               <p>Biles. Four Cambrick Stocks, a Silver Clasp, a Pair of white Cotton Stocking, two Linnen Handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. When they had taken all these Things from you, what did they do?</p>
               <p>Biles. They bid me go about my Business.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that all? You say there were three Persons that did this Injury to you; do you know any Thing of them?</p>
               <p>Biles. No, I can't say I know them, it was a dark Night.</p>
               <p>Court. So, this is all you can say in relation to this Fact?</p>
               <p>Biles. Yes, this is all; who committed it I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any of your Things?</p>
               <p>Biles. No, none of the Things.</p>
               <p>Q. When these People robb'd you, what Way did they go?</p>
               <p>Biles. I went home to my Master's towards London; I left them in the Place, I did not look back .</p>

               <p>Petit. I took the Watch out of my Pocket and clapp'd it into my Breast; but they saw it and said they would have it; and they rifled my Pockets.</p>

               <p>Nightingale. About the 27th of May; we look'd but could not find them, so we went back to Tothill-Fields Bridewell to get Bray to shew us where the Pieces were, which he did, and we took them out of a Ditch.</p>

            . My Lord, the Case is, in short, this: Upon the 14th of June last, one Mr. Griffith sent a Bank Note to Mr. Twiss, to be exchang'd for Silver; Mr. Smith, the Defendant, receiv'd it; I believe every Body knows there has been a considerable Loss of Bank Notes; Mrs. Twiss being afraid she should be impos'd upon, compar'd it with the Notes in the Advertisement, and therefore was willing to change it. The Prisoner was sitting in a little Room of the Publick House, and desir'd Mrs. Twiss to let him have a Look at it, which she did, and he return'd it again. As she was going away with it, he (the Prisoner) desir'd she would favour him with another Sight of it; being in a Hurry Mrs. Twiss leaves the Note in the Prisoner's Hands. The Prisoner had with him a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020031"/> little Girl, about eight or nine Years of Age; and while Mrs. Twiss was counting up the Change, he took the Opportunity to go away with the Note, Mrs. Twiss's Back being towards him; but missing the Prisoner, she told her Husband of it, upon which this Man was immediately pursu'd; they follow'd him to his Lodgings, at one Mrs. Jones's ; when they came there he was at the Vault; for some Time he offer'd to go before a Justice of Peace, or deposit the Value in Mrs Twiss's Hand: There was one there passes for his Wife; she desir'd there might be no Noise about the Note, for it should be produced: She said, Nay, it may be among the Child's Playthings, for she is exceeding fond of Paper. There was one Mr. Clark and Laurence call'd to their Assistance, as a sort of Guard; yet he run out of the House, and went into Hare-Street, Piccadilly; there he stay'd for some Time: From thence he made his Escape, got out at the Back-Door, into a Gentleman's Airy, where he was taken and carry'd to the Watch-house. The Bank Note was not found upon him, nor had he any Money about him at that Time. The next Night Mrs. Jones, his Landlady gave the Note to Mr. Twiss.</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have open'd the Case, and will call my Witnesses in order to prove it. I shall not attempt to do any thing by way of Exaggeration against the Prisoner; but if we prove him guilty we hope you will find him so.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. May it please your Lordship, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I submit it whether, according to his own Opening, 'tis not a Breach of Trust.</p>

And as he sat there, by and by, Mr. Griffith, a Master Taylor in Gerrard Street, sent a Bank Note (by

            , his Apprentice) and desir'd I would give him Change for it to pay his Men. The Advertiser lay upon the Table in the little Room; I stepp'd into the little Room, and said, I will look if this Note is not one of those advertis'd. When I had look'd at it, the Prisoner said, Pray let me compare the Note and the Paper together; which I did, my Lord, and stood by to receive it back again: He return'd it to me again, and in a Moment after he had done it, he said, Pray indulge me a second Time, and let me compare the the Names. The Boy stood by me, my Lord, that wanted the Change, and said, My Master is in Haste for Change; so I went to the Box, directly facing the Room; the Boy sat facing the Door, and I had my Back to it: The Gentlewoman that was in the Room came out, and, as she past, clapp'd me on the Shoulder, and said, Take Care of your Note. My Husband was then come into the Room, and was backwards and forwards, and ask'd me how much Change Mr. Griffith wanted; I said, Twenty Pounds; he said, I know that, but did he want Gold or Silver; but the Boy that I gave the Change to saw the Man go out. When I had done I went to the Bar, and said to my Husband, Have you got the Note? he said, No; then said I, Run after the Man that lodges at Jones's, for he has got it.</p>
               <p>Q. And how long was this after you gave him the Note the second Time ?</p>
               <p>Twiss. When I had given him the Change, which was only nine Pounds in Silver, and the rest in Gold, and when I went to the Bar it was gone; it might be three or four Minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing further?</p>
               <p>Twiss. No more than that I went to his Lodgings, to Mrs. Jones; when we came, they said he was at the Vault ; he went through the Passage into the Vault; so I said to my Husband, Pray fetch him out, he will make away with the Note: When he came out he said, What is it you want? I said, I come for the Note; he said he had return'd it; I said, that he did the first Time, but not the second. The Woman said she would examine the Girl, for she was exceeding fond of Papers; she said, may be she had it among her Playthings.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this Woman?</p>
               <p>Twiss. The Woman he lives with, one Mrs. Chaff, sometimes goes for his Wife; they began to quarrel before us; he said, this is what you have brought me to, &amp;c. for she said, if it was not found she would answer for it. He said we had no proper Officers, and could not detain him; then .

               <p>Wood. Yes, it was the 14th of June, being Saturday .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner come into the House?</p>
               <p>Wood. I was in the Room when the Prisoner came in and sat down, and I thought I had as much Right to sit there as he, and I kept my Place. I was there when this Note came to be exchang'd. Mrs. Twiss took up the Paper and brought the Note in her Hand; the Prisoner desir'd to see the Note, and she gave it him into his Hand, and he gave it her again: As she turn'd her Back he desir'd he might be indulg'd with the Sight of it once more; which she did, and gave it him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return it again?</p>
               <p>Wood. He did not. I got up and went away; as I went into the publick Room I desir'd Mrs. Twiss to take care of her Note.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, how came you to bid her take care of her Note?</p>
               <p>Wood. I can't say I lik'd the Person.</p>
               <p>Q. So he was perusing the Note when you went away?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner at the Bar before?</p>

               <p>Wood. When he receiv'd it the second Time he held it up to the Window, and said it was possible to cancel it; that he thought it possible to put out

               <p>Richard Hall. On Saturday the 14th of June I call'd to see Mrs. Twiss, being old Acquaintance. I went into the Publick Room; she said there was an Acquaintance of mine, Mrs. Wood; she shew'd me into the little Room behind the Bar. While I was there, there came a Bank Note to be exchang'd. There lay the News Paper on the Table before the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of you know him?</p>
               <p>Hall. I never saw him in my Life before. When the Note came, said Mrs. Twiss, I will look and see if 'tis one of those that are advertis'd. The Prisoner being very officious, he was desirous to see it: The Person for the Change being in Ha, she desir'd it of him again; he return'd it, but he desir'd just to be indulged with another Look again . He held the News Paper in one Hand, and the Note in the other; I can't say how long at that Time . Mrs. Wood went away, but I remain'd in the Room . I was the last, I did not see him deliver the Note again to Mrs. Twiss.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mrs. Twiss ?</p>
               <p>Hall. Mrs. Twiss was in the Publick Room giving the Change .</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was No-body in the Bar-Room but you and the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hall. No; there was a little Child came in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. What happen'd after that Time? Was he perusing it ?</p>
               <p>Hall. The Prisoner soon went away: I was the last in the Room, and he must take it away, for there was nothing left in the Room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might be the Time that you was in the Room after he went off.</p>
               <p>Hall. I went away directly after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mrs. Twiss?</p>
               <p>Hall. Mrs. Twiss was in the publick Drinking Room, and had not finish'd giving the Change.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow him?</p>
               <p>Hall. I stay'd in the Room; it might be two Minutes after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the Child was in the Room when he was comparing this Note? Was she there the second Time? Do you know, in the first Place, whether the Child was, or was not, in the Room?</p>
               <p>Hall. I can't be positive of that.</p>
               <p>Court. But the last Time you saw the Note it was in his Hand?</p>
               <p>Hall. In his Hand, my Lord, and it might be two or three Minutes, or thereabouts, before he went away.</p>

               <p>Webb. On Saturday Night, the 14th of June, I carried a Bank Note to Mrs. Twiss, to give me Change: She was in the Bar Room, and the Prisoner at the same Time; she took the News Paper, and look'd at it. I turn'd into the common Room, and left her and the Prisoner there: A little after I came to her again, and told her I was in Haste, and she left the Prisoner in the Room and Bank Note, and came to a little Box in the Bar-Room to give me Change; the mean while I saw the Prisoner go out.</p>

            ) Will you give my Lord and the Jury an Account of what you know of it?</p>
               <p>Clark. On Saturday the 14th of June I was sent for by Mr. Twiss in a great Hurry, for what, I did not know 'till I came into the House; said he, I beg you will go to Mrs. Jones's, and assist my Wife in taking a Man that has robb'd me of a Bank Note. When I went to Jones's, they were all in Darkness; I asked for a Light, but it was refus'd me by the Landlady Mrs. Jones; she refus'd me several Times. There was a Woman that has gone for the Prisoner's Wife; she came, and, in a soothing Way, said, Mr. Clark, I beg to speak to you: I said, Madam, I doubt there is no Good if you are concern'd in it; she desir'd me to be quiet; she said, if the Note was lost, she would lay down an equal Sum 'till it was found.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that in the Presence of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Clark. The Prisoner was in the Room, but I had not seen him; by and by he made his Escape backward. I had some Suspicion when I heard she was concern'd in it, that it was him; so he made his Escape into the Work Shop, which was very dark. I went into the Work Shop, and grovel'd about for him; I believe I was in the Shop the best Part of ten Minutes: At last I found something stir'd, for he had Opportunity of seeing me; he rises up, and I pinion'd him after this Manner, and carried him so into the House; he said I had no Authority to detain him, and used me with a great deal of Insolence. I was conscious I was got into very bad Hands; I sent for Mr. Twiss, but he did not come so readily as I could wish. Then he made a Push into the Street, and swore he would do us a Mischief, me in particular, if I dar'd to presume to follow him. When we came to the first Corner, he made a Push to get away; we followed him into Hare-Street, Piccadilly, there he went into the House of one Miller; I left Laurence to watch him; there he was a considerable while. Mr. Twiss went to St. Anne's Watch-house, and I went to St. James's Watch-house; these are the People here that took him.</p>

I was in Bed, my Lord, about Twelve o'Clock, and my Servant up two Pairs of Stairs heard a Man in my Garden, that there was a strange Man had made his Escape to the back Part of my House . I got up as soon as I could put on my Night-Gown , and that Gentleman (Mr. Fenton) and Mr. Laurence had got Hold of him in my Area. I went to the Watch-house with him, and I appear'd before Sir Thomas to support the Charge. Mrs. Twiss made Use of my Name coming to her Husband, in Relation to this Bank Note. This Woman they call Mrs. Chass , came to my House the next Day, to let me know that she believed the Note was found; upon which I said I am glad of it, that they might not lose their Money. Upon her assuring me this, I went to Mrs. Twiss, and enquired for her Husband; she told me her Husband was at Westminster; I told her I desired that he would not advertise the Bank Note, but come to me the next Day. The next Day Mrs. Jones came to me, and said she had the Note, and said also she was frightened out of her Wits about it, and she wanted to part with it; well, said I, you must carry it to the Person that owns it.</p>

               <p>Twiss. Mr. Dowdell inform'd me that Mrs. Jones had the Note, and I might have it; so I went to Col. De Veil to know whether I should take the Note again; he was for my taking of it, but to take somebody with me to attest it; so I had the Note of Mrs. Jones.</p>

I went in with a Child, my Lord, into this House; she says in the Room she was in, she has only select Company: I was never in the House before; the Door was open, it seem'd to me to be an open Publick Room. My Lord Scarborough's Servant was there, and talking something of the late Lord Scarborough, and indifferent Matters, this Mrs. Twiss comes out of the Bar; there was a Step or two to come down to this Place: She brings a Bank Note in her Hand, and said I am going to change it; she wanted to know if it was Loyd, or Floyd, in the Advertisement, but it was not the same

            . Then said she 'tis a good Note; I thought my Lord she meant whether it was a real Bank Note. Pray indulge me with it, I said; then I told her she was very safe in changing of it: I return'd it again, my Lord, and I knew no more of it afterwards; she says she took up the Advertiser. When I had the Advertisement in my Hand, and a little Child playing at my Knee, she comes to me to know whether that Note was advertis'd; she mentions that it was but two Minutes that I staid after she left me and went to change the Notes; pray ask her how many Minutes she was upon her Examination; that's nearer than 14 Days ago; she does not know what a Minute is: I was there three Quarters of an Hour after. Did I not speak to my Lord Scarborough's Servant, if he came there again of an Evening, I would drink with him? I treated him, did not let him pay any Thing, and that pretty Lady too I treated. Now, my Lord, if I was not last in the Room, which I take to be the Publick Tap, if I was not the last in the Room, he must be the last; then I could not have spoke to him upon the Bench going out. Give me Leave to trouble you with the next. The first Evidence, Mrs. Twiss, speaks of the Gentlewoman where I lodge, whereas she knows no more where I lodge than your Lordship; where she says I lodge, I have the Woman here present to know, whether I ever lay in the House where this unhappy Accident happen'd. Now, my Lord, she swears so absolutely that I took it away, but it was before Sir Thomas, who has a very beautiful Way of Empire in his own Territories. Did she not send to the Taylor, the Owner and Proprietor of this Note, to know whether the Boy had taken this Note along with him and the Money; that I hope your Lordship will ask. Now as to this wooden this Mrs. W my Lord. I made an As with that she to with the following Week: See whether she will deny that; I hope she is not up to de this honourable Court; I have they are own Cloaths. My Lord, she had an ill Opinion of me; how can so fine a Lady have an ill Opinion of that charming fine Fellow, told me I was at that Time .</p>
               <p>This Bar, my Lord, is like the Pulpir of a Church adjoining to the Wall; how then could I go behind the Room? 'Tis a publick Room, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wood likewise says, my Lord, that Mrs. Twiss came in and took up the Advertiser, when I had it in my Hand all the Time.</p>
               <p>Now, my Lord, here is a Boy that says he saw me: I was remote from his immediate seeing of me, because there was a Partition to prevent it, and I sat with my Elbow on the Table, with the Advertiser in my Hand: That Boy pretends he saw me; I believe he never saw me, for he had been gone Three Quarters of an Hour before I left the Place.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this Box?</p>
               <p>Jones. I had the Box out of the Child's Hand: Before this, we had threaten'd to take her before Justice De Veil.</p>
               <p>Q. Who us'd this Back Parlour ?</p>
               <p>Jones. On Mrs. Chaff; I left it to her .</p>
               <p>Court. And in that Appartment the Box was: What Size Box was it?</p>
               <p>Jones. A little Snuff-Box.</p>
               <p>[ The Box was produced in Court.]</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you when this was? When was this?</p>
               <p>Jones. The Monday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the Child with this Box before?</p>
               <p>Jones. Not before the Note was lost.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw the Box that the Child had, with the Note in it.</p>
               <p>Jones. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you discern it was a Bank Note in this little Box?</p>
               <p>Jones. I knew it by the Fineness of the Paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Child sold it up, and lay it in the Box so smooth?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't tell .</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver the Note to?</p>
               <p>Jones. Sir, I went to ask Advice, then deliver'd it to Mr. Twiss .</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the Room with the Child when you took the Bank Note?</p>
               <p>Jones. There was Mrs. Chaff , another Gentlewoman, and the Child.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecutor. Mrs. Jones, pray explain an Expression you had of Searching their Appartments: Did you examine the Child before the Prisoner was accused of the Note?</p>
               <p>Jones. When the Child was with some other Children she was crying for a Note that she had lost .</p>
               <p>Council. Then all the Time the Confusion was, the Child was looking for a Bank Note of 20 l. Did you not hear the Prisoner charg'd with it? Did he think the Child had got it? Did you hear the Child was suspected? Was the Child examin'd then? I think the Box this Note was in, was smaller than what is produced. Pray how did the Note lay in the Box?</p>
               <p>Jones. It was folded up in the Box.</p>
               <p>Council. As soon as you saw it folded up, you knew it was a Bank Note : Pray how came you to take Notice of a Bit of Paper in a Box first?</p>
               <p>Jones. There was good Reason when the Note was search'd for .</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, as to finding the Note, I hope you will indulge me: This Child, and another, were in the Coach-Yard. At the Time of my Accusation, my little Child was searching about the Dunghill, and looking for the Bank Note she had lost with a Picture upon it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury; I would submit it, whether a Person without any Colour of Frand or Pretence, but with the Will of the Party, can be said to have stolen the Note, or have taken it by Robbery; wherever a Person has once a legal Possession, it could not be consider'd as a Felony, as in the Case of Watte .</p>
               <p>It was answer'd, the Waite's Case was different from this; that was the Case of East-India Bonds ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020036"/> and he was entrusted by the Company; he had the Custody of the Bonds, and upon the Evidence it did appear, that he embezzled these Bonds in his Custody; and the Opinion of the Court in that Case was, that it was a Felony; and there is a Law made since that to make it a Felony.</p>

               <p>Bowden . No, my Lord, none that I saw; he had a Scythe upon his Shoulder and a Bundle in his Hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you overtook this Man and the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bowden. Just beyond the Seventeen-Mile Stone at Watford .</p>

               <p>Bowden. On a Wednesday, the 11th of June .</p>
               <p>Q. What more ha ve you to say ?</p>
               <p>Bowden. When I came up, my Man said, now you may talk with my Master about your Lambs yourself; so Crips, pull'd off his Hat to me, and said, How do you do Master Bowden? I said , I do not know you; said he, I understand you sell Lambs at London; I wish I had known it, I would have brought a Lot of Lambs for you to have sold for me. He told me he liv'd at Aston-Cliston ; I said that was a pretty Way; but he said my Lambs are not kept at Aston-Clifton, they are at Chosberg ; that Keeping was short and the Butcher could take but few at a Time, and he wanted to sell them all together. He said, I have a good Mind to leave my Scythe and Bundle at your House; I am a pretty good Walker, and if I can get away at Two or Three o'Clock I can bring them; and away he went, so I never saw any more of him. I went to Hempstead Market on Thursday. I ask'd my Wife whether she had seen the Man with the Lambs; I said, I wish it is not a bad Thing. On Friday Morning I was at Smithfield; about Ten o'Clock Mr. Dell came to me; he said to me, don't your Man Peter drive for you now? I said yes; he ask'd if any Body else drove Lambs for me; I said, there is a Man come through Edgworth Turnpike, and had no Money; but said he was bringing twenty Lambs to sell at Smithfield Market for me. I said to Mr. Dell, be so good as to go into the Alehouse and I'll take Care of him; but he never brought the Lambs at all: I said, we will go back to see if we can't find these Lambs. We came to - Bridge; the Man said he saw a Fellow pelting them along with Stones, about Six o'Clock, very dirty and much tir'd. I told Mr. Dell we would ride up towards Hendon, where we heard nothing of them; but found them at last in the Road in Hendon Parish: When me met with them no Body was with them; but discovering they were his Lambs we drove them home.</p>

Bruce came to me and said, d - n you don't look at me, let me have your Money; I said, Gentlemen I will, don't use me ill, I am but a poor Post-Boy. They haul'd me out of the Chaise, and seeing the Irish Mail, said they would not meddle with that; but they took my Wig and Handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Q. What else?</p>
               <p>Smith. They rifled my Pockets, and said, let us take his Breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do then?</p>
               <p>Smith . They took 8 s. 10 d. from me. I saw a Gentleman coming towards Barnet, and immediately three or four of them went off to meet him, and several Blows pass'd. They all ran off from me but one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the Gentleman from you?</p>
               <p>Smith. About twenty Yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Gentleman?</p>
               <p>Smith . Yes, he keeps the Cock Inn at Oney, his Name is Knight . While they had him down one of them came to me and said, G - d d - n you go along; another damn'd me and said I should not go: So I said, Gentlemen, you need not be afraid of me, I won't betray you; with that they said, go along, my Lad, as fast as you can; so I drove up the Hill as hard as ever I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Gentleman all this while?</p>
               <p>Smith. Upon his Back, they knock'd him down. When I came to the Top of the Hill I met a Waggon, or Cart, and said, Master, for God's sake don't go down, there are Thieves at the Bottom of the Hill, you will certainly be robb'd. When I came to the Crown I saw a Light; I jump'd out of my Chaise and went into the House. They ask'd who was there. I said, Gentlemen, pray go down, I believe there is a Gentleman murder'd at the Bottom of the Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Smith. At the Crown at Kicks-End ; one

My Lord, we examin'd their Pockets, and found several Letters directed to Persons in London, recommending them to Business, and a Horn which had a small Quantity of Powder; after we had done that, the Post-Boy came into the Cage. I said to the Boy, be careful what you do, look among them and see if any of these Men have robb'd you; then the Boy went directly into the Middle of them as they were in the Cage, and said to Bruce, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020038"/> Prisoner, you are the Man: Says Bruce, I did not rob you.

               <p>Council. I am Council in this Cause for the Crown; the Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted of High Treason, for counterfeiting the current Coin of these Realms; it is unnecessary for me to tell you, Gentleman, that it becomes the Prerogative of the Crown to take Care of the Coin of the Kingdom; it will be needless to mention to you the Inconveniency and Injury that must accrue by these counterfeit Pieces, as Shillings and Half Crowns, which generally fall hard among the poorer Sort of People: The single Question will be, whether the Prisoner at the Bar has been guilty of the present Offence or not; and, Gentleman, as she stands indicted for actual coining, I shall candidly admit we have no Evidence present at the Time of Coining; I don't apprehend it is necessary; because Persons going to commit an Offence of so high a Nature, will hardly call Witnesses at the Time when they commit the Offence; I shall only relate the Circumstances, Gentleman, and when I have open'd the Nature of our Evidence there will appear Reason to believe that the Prisoner at the Bar has been guilty of the Offence for which she is indicted: The cause of our Suspicion was upon this Occasion; she went to a Person that sold Straw and Leghorn Hats, I think the Agreement was for 18d. after that Agreement had been made she gave Half a Crown for the Payment of this Hat; that Half Crown was a counterfeit one; on finding this out she was immediately carried before a Magistrate, I believe our present Lord Mayor, and for that was committed; that giving Occasion a little to enquire into her Life and Conversation; she has acknowledg'd, as I am told, and I have to prove, that she has been guilty of these Sorts of Offences for 25 Years past; but that is not the Case for which she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174607020039"/> is indicted, but for actual coining, Gentlemen; as for that Half Crown which she has utter'd she may possibly be to answer for on another Occasion, tho' that may be a material Circumstance to convict her of the Offence she is now charg'd with. The Solicitor for the Crown, who is concern'd for the Mint, and whose Duty it is to bring all Persons who have committed Offences of this Kind to Justice, being inform'd that if he went to the Prisoner's Lodgings he would not only find a great Quantity of counterfeit Money, but the Tools by which the said Money was counterfeited, and was likewise directed to turn up a board at the Foot of her Bed, where the said Tools were conceal'd; accordingly he went to the Place as directed in the Information that had been given him, and taking up the Board found there a good Number, above thirty Shillings actually coin'd and counterfeited , and this Half Crown; the Reason I mention the Half Crown is, that it exactly tallied and was certainly struck in the same Mold with that which was put off by the Prisoner at the Bar, therefore that will be some Circumstance to induce you to believe that the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person that coin'd them. We will call our Witnesses to shew that this Woman was first committed for vending this Half Crown; and her Confession shews that she has long been concern'd in Practices of this Nature.</p>

               <p>North. I will. On the 5th or 6th Day of May I receiv'd a Letter by the Penny-Post without any Name, that inform'd me that if I went to Mrs. Wood's Lodgings, at Mr.

               <p>Q. What Metal do you call it?</p>
               <p>North. Grain Tin, the better Sort: These Shillings were wrapt up in a separate Paper, in the Condition they are now, which we take to be finish'd.</p>
