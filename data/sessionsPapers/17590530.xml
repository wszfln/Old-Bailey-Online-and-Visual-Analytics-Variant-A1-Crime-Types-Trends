               <p>Q. How was it broke?</p>
               <p>Mayne. I believe it was cut with a key-hole saw into part of the frame-work, by which means there was a hole to put in a hand to draw the bolt back. We miss'd a large boiler or pot, a kettle, a bell-metal pot, a stew-pan, and a copper sauce-pan.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that cellar communicate with the dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Mayne. It does; it is under the house, and a door opens up into the house above.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to suspect the prisoner at the bar in taking the things you mention'd ?</p>
               <p>Mayne. I went the next day to justice Fielding, and gave him three shillings to advertise it. After it was advertised came two men and ask'd me to describe the things lost; which when I had done, they said they had found part of them. They told me where to go to see them. I went next morning accordingly to justice Palmer, there I found part of the goods and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with taking the goods?</p>
               <p>Mayne. I did, but he would not own it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Mayne. I think. I have seen him go by my door before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see that the door that opens into the street was fast?</p>
               <p>Turner. I fastened that door myself, before it was dark, and went down again after 10 to see if it was fast, and found it so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these things that were lost?</p>
               <p>Turner. They were all in the cellar at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first know of the door being broke open?</p>
               <p>Turner. About 6 the next morning. A man that lay in the house got up first, and found it broke open, and he came and call'd me. I came down and found it so.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it broke?</p>
               <p>Turner. It seem'd as if a gimblet had been bor'd in it in two places, and then the wood cut out, and the bolt was pushed back. After I saw the door open, then I looked about and missed the things directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss?</p>
               <p>Turner. I missed a large pot, a bell-metal pot, a kettle, a sauce-pan, and a stew-pan.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Townsend. I am a cordwainer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you stop the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Townsend. At my father's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your father?</p>
               <p>Townsend. He is a cordwainer. The prisoner had sold my father some skins, which we suspected afterwards to have been stolen, so I had been about to look for him; but he came again to sell these things to my father, and I stopp'd him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your father live?</p>
               <p>Townsend. He lives in Kingsland Road, Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes it, your father being a Shoemaker, to deal in such things as these?</p>
               <p>Townsend. He deals in a small brokery way. I told the prisoner he should give an account how he came by these things; and also the other things he brought before. He told me these things where his own, and he insisted upon it to be let go. I charg'd an officer with him, and the next day I saw an advertisement describing the things.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at these things produc'd.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This sauce-pan has a piece in the inside of it, by which I know it. The stewpan has no mark upon it, but I believe it to be mine; mine was of this size. The kettle I am certain is mine; it has been tinn'd, and here is part of the tin remains on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are no other kettles tinned besides your's?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw one so large as this that was tinn'd.</p>
               <p>Q. to A. Turner. Look at these goods.</p>
               <p>Turner. The stew-pan and sauce-pan I know very well to be the prosecutor's. The saucepan has a remarkable piece on it; and as to the kettle, I am very sure that is his also. I described it before I saw it, and said it had been tinn'd, and part of the tin was now to be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. to Townsend. Do you know what the prisoner deals in?</p>
               <p>Townsend. He goes about and deals in old cloaths, as he says, and in this sort of ware, and bits of brass, or brass cocks, and the like. I have seen him about half a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Q. He pretends not to understand English very well, did he speak English when you stopp'd him?</p>

            . About 3 o'clock, on a Sunday morning in May. I saw the coach of the prosecutor move, and she window up, as it stood in my master's yard, in Bishopsgate-street. I saw the prisoner come out of the coach with the cloth under his arm, and a hammer in his hand. I took him by his collar when he was come from the coach about 20 yards.</p>

               <p>I went down the yard thinking it was a thorough-fair, I saw a woman come out of a coach with that bundle, and a man after her; then came two men and laid hold of me, and dragged me down to the ground, and charged me with taking it.</p>
               <p>More. There was nobody in the yard but the prisoner and I at the time; and when I took hold of him he begged for mercy, and called out murder.</p>

He quitted my service about three years ago last February, and went into the navy, and has been at sea 'till within six or seven months. He had not served his time out, and for his wages included, and other accounts, he owed me about 70 l. About the 14th of April last he call'd upon me to make me satisfaction, and gave me this bill of exchange, producing one; it is for 100 l. this was at a Coffee-house. I went home, and gave him a bank note of 30 l. by way of change. I sent my apprentice at the same time to Mr Honywood, to know if it would be paid when due. My young man returned, and said, they told him it was not a good bill; so I sent for a constable and he was committed. I then desired him to return me my bank note, this was at Burton's Coffee-house, Cheapside, he return'd me my note.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say upon that?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He said, he did not intend to defraud me; he was obliged to go down to Portsmouth, being Purser of a man of war. He had been in town some time, endeavouring to get a sum of money due to him in the navy, to the amount of 300 l. and upwards, and that he was disappointed, and that he had wrote that bill for fourteen days, on purpose to get the sum of 30 l. to take him down to Portsmouth.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300006"/> He intended when he got there, to get leave to return to London, where he was certain of receiving the money before this bill became due, and he intended to come to me and take up that bill, and pay me the whole 100 l. He had arose by his merit from a secretary's clerk, to be purser to the Fortune Sloop. I had reason to believe he had money due from the Navy-office, he has since paid me my 70 l. and I know not, but if I had not sent about the bill, he might have returned according to what he declared, and have paid me my money before the note had become due. I cannot say, that I believe he intended to defraud me of that money. He was five years with me, and was extream diligent, and was as good a servant as ever lived, 'till he took a fancy to the seas, then he was restless and uneasy. I have heard Admiral

               <p>Hutcherson. I have went with him, and staid at the door 'till he has came out, and he has told me that he had sold it; I know he told me he had received two shillings for work, of this man, and he has 2 s. due to him still.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of the brass be that he took away?</p>
               <p>Hutcherson. About 4 s. and 6 d.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 24th of April, my master came into the shop where I and the evidence work; he said he would turn the prisoner out of doors, and then said to the evidence, he would give him a new suit of cloaths, and some other things, if he would swear against him. I am an apprentice to my master, and have been eighteen months: master said he had nothing to alledge against the prisoner, he always gave Wyre a good character. My master and mistress have often said, there was not a viler rogue ever lived than Hutcherson.</p>

            . I never was in Mr Wilberham's house in my life, 'till I went and told him of this thing. The prisoner work'd in my house, for fifteen or sixteen months, for Mr Wilberham, he had a wallet hung up behind his loom. My husband in looking for a buckle that was missing, he came to me and said, he saw five bobbins in the wallet. I went to make this man's bed, I felt in the wallet, and found it of a great weight, I took out one bobbin. On the next day, my son, the prisoner, and others, went out in the evening; then I bolted the street-door, and went and took down this wallet, and in a napkin were twenty bobbins of silk, some white, some orange, and some pale yellow. I compared the mark of the bobbins, with that mark of those that hung upon his work. After that, I let it pass on 'till the twenty-fifth of February, then my husband and I were alone; I put my hand in the wallet, and found two bobbins that came between the Monday and Thursday, this is it, producing one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at this?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my property, he never used to take such colour of me to work.</p>
               <p>Hays. I do not know, that there was a day, but I put my hand under it to see if it was taken away, and it was taken away the first Friday in Lent; there were twenty-two in the whole, and twelve skains of yarn. I know nothing what became of the other bobbins.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I talk'd with Walker, but he denied it, and so he did before my Lord-Mayor. Twenty or thirty of these bobbins weigh about a pound.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to acquaint him with it before the 15th of May?</p>
               <p>Hays. I was cautious of either hanging or transporting of him; so I let the prosecutor know by another person, and Mr Wilberham insisted on knowing who told him. Then he said it was from me. He having a good opinion of him could hardly believe it. After that, the prisoner was pleased to say, My husband was jealous of him, upon which account we made that report.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Hays. No; only he had said he could have me whenever he pleased, but he did not like me.</p>

After some time Wynt came down in her shift, and left her stockings and shoes in the room, and ask'd for More, and they went away together.

The prisoner happen'd to meet with me near Kensington on the 12th of May. I ask'd him the road to Amersham in Buckinghamshire. He said he would put me in my way. We went in at the White Horse near Shepherd's Bush. I intended to give him part of a quart of Beer; but I gave him part of six or seven quarts. He said he would get me a bed at a house that he would direct me to. On the road he wanted me to give him 3 d. I told him I would not. Then we got a little wroth with one another, and wrestled among the nettles.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>Ross. About a mile and half from Shepherd's Bush. This was betwixt six and seven o'clock. Then I saw him so quarrelsome I was going to give him 6 d. to be quit of his company. When I was taking my purse out of my pocket I turn'd a little about. He snatch'd the purse out of my hand and ran away. He fell down. After that I happen'd to fall down. He got up and went through a gap of the hedge and ran away. I went back to the White Horse, and told the people what had happen'd, and some men desir'd me to stay 'till they came back. They went. One of them came back and told me they had taken him. Then they brought him back, and he was brought to Hammersmith and sent to the cage. The next day he was carried before justice Beaver. I had in my purse half a guinea in gold, and 1 s. 6 d. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you put in fear?</p>
               <p>Ross. I can't say I was. I was a little in liquor, but knew what I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you to deliver your money?</p>

               <p>When I first saw the prosecutor, I was going from Chelsea to Kensington, about half an hour after two o'clock, in the afternoon; he desir'd I would show him the way to Buckinghamshire; he was going to Amersham. I said, I will put you into the road; then he said he would treat me; we came to an ale-house, call'd the London Apprentice; there he treated me with a pot of beer, and after that another; then I took him through Kensington to the road; then we went on to the white horse; there he call'd for six or seven full pots of beer, and was very drunk; then I went to part with him at the door; he wanted me to go with him a little farther. After we parted, he went back, and said I robb'd him; he was much in liquor, and fell down in the dirt, and daub'd his cloaths.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar and another woman came into my master's shop on the 3 d of May. She said she wanted to be fitted for a pair of shoes. I desired her to walk backwards, because we keep our womens shoes there. I tried one pair on, they seemed to fit her very well. She complained they were too long, so I tried on another pair. She said the same of them. While I was looking for another pair, I happen'd to turn my head round,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300014"/> and saw her take a pair of shoes and put them under her cleak. Then I said we have none will fit you. She ask'd when she must come again, I said in two or three days. Then I call'd my young master. As she was going out of the shop I tapp'd her on the shoulder, and said, Mistress, you have got a pair of shoes. She said she had not. I brought her into the middle of the shop, and said, I desire you will give them to me. Then she pull'd them out from under her cloak.</p>

            , in Bridgewater-Gardens, Mr Molineux being out of town, Mrs Molineux desir'd me to go along with her to the Mansion-house, to get a search-warrant from my Lord Mayor; after which I and one of the deputy's servants, went in order to search the apartments in Mr Warren's house, belonging to the prisoner Lloyd. I found nothing in his chamber; but I found a padlock on a garret door. I ask'd whose room that was. Lloyd said, it was his room. I desir'd to look in it; he pull'd out a key and let me in. We search'd. It was a kind of a a lumber-room; there we found the things mentioned in the indictment, which I took an account of before his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention them.</p>
               <p>Chantrell. There were an iron chafing-dish, an iron stove-grate, one iron fender, one box iron, two pair of heaters, five gimlets, three papers of files, about a thousand of nails; an iron hand-vice, a parcel of brass rings, two knots of jack-line, two knots of pack-thread, and one ring of wire, part iron, and part brass. I ask'd him how he came by these things. He said, he had bought part of them of an Ironmonger in Barbican, and part of them at an Ironmonger's in Colman-street, and part in Morefields, and could bring the people of whom he bought them. I told him, I hop'd he would bring them along with him. Then I dispatch'd a constable that was with us to go and take the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Chantrell. He was a hired servant in Mr Molineux's house, in the capacity of a porter. Then the two prisoners at the bar were brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300015"/> to the Mansion-house, before Sir Crisp Gascoyne and Mr Alderman Rawlinson; Hoskins acknowledg'd that he had stole all these things, at divers times; and that they were his master's property; and that he did it at Lloyd's infrigation: Sir Crisp ask'd him, if Lloyd gave him a valuable price for them; he said, some times he would give him six-pence; sometimes a shilling; and was very frequent in treating him with beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Lloyd present at this time?</p>
               <p>Chantrell. He was; and the goods were there also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr Molineux's servant swear to any of the goods?</p>
               <p>Chantrell. He swore particularly to the iron chafing-dish; there was their own shop-mark upon it; and another servant was there, and he swore to the nails and gimblets, to be Mr Molineux's property, to the best of his knowledge: after that, Lloyd did acknowledge he had purchas'd the chasing dish and nails of Hoskins. Sir Crisp ask'd what he gave for them? He said 6 d. and two full pots of beer. Then Sir Crisp ask'd the servant, What these things were worth? He said, they stood his master in upwards of 4 s. Then Lloyd was order'd to withdraw, and Hoskins was examin'd. Hoskins acknowledg'd, he had carry'd

Then Sir Crisp committed one to the Poultry-Counter; and the other to Wood-street Counter.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say before he open'd the door?</p>

            . I was sent for to the Mansion-house this day fortnight, when the two prisoners at the bar were under examination before Sir Crisp Gascoyne and Mr Alderman Rawlinson. I was ask'd if I knew any thing of them goods; I look'd over them, and found there were nothing mark'd by me, only one thousand of nails, and one single gimblet: the gimblets are commonly put in bundles of straw, a dozen in a bundle; I heard Hoskins own the taking of every thing; and that they were the property of my master Deputy Molineux.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear him say what he gave for them?</p>

I rent a house in Bridgewater-gardens;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300016"/> Lloyd lodg'd in my house; the prisoner Hoskins us'd to come and stand in the street, over-against the window where Lloyd lodg'd, and would call, (hollow, Lloyd) then the other would come down immediately and let him in; they would go up, and when they came down, Lloyd would say, Tom, when will you come again? I want such and such a thing; once he named a set of cannisters; said Hoskins, I cannot tell when I can come again, but as soon as possible I can, I will. The next time he came, he repeated the same, hollow, Lloyd, Lloyd at that time was very busy, having a carpenter making a bedstead in his room; he did not hear the first call.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Warren. I remember, the second time was on the nineteenth of March last; between the hours of eight and nine at night; Hoskins open'd my street-door and went up stairs; and staid a little while; then they both came down into my yard; there Hoskins took out a lock, from two sheets of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a lock was it?</p>
               <p>Warren. It was a large street-door lock; he gave it to Lloyd; they tried it, to see whether the key went free or not; Hoskins said, you must go to a Smith; he will do it for you, for a pot of beer; there were two keys to it. Lloyd said, God bless you, my prince; Hoskins said, for the world, do not let the Carpenter see this lock: no, said the other, I'll take care he shall not see it; but when will you come again, my prince? They took their leave of one another; and parted; Lloyd carried the lock and put it openly in the garret, in a washing tub.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Warren. My wife and I went up stairs afterwards to satisfy ourselves in it; and there we saw it lying, with the two keys: Lloyd us'd generally to say; my prince, when will you come again? God bless you; I wish you a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there at the time of searching?</p>
               <p>Warren. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that lock found in the garret?</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see it when he carried it out?</p>

            . I am wife to the last witness; I have very often seen Hoskins come with something to Lloyd, in a sack; but what, I do not know; he us'd to call at the window, hollow, Lloyd; Lloyd us'd to come down, and oblige him to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the day did he usually come?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. Always in the evening, or in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. For how long time has he made a practice in coming to Lloyd?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. He has come too-and-again to him, for upwards of ten months: he came one Sunday morning between four and five; and call'd at the window, as before; and we were all in bed; his usual time in the morning, was about five, or betwixt four and five; and on evenings, he us'd to come at nine, ten, or eleven o'clock; I remember that Sunday morning, which was in February, I got up and open'd my door a-jar; I saw a ring of iron wire, with some brass wire, on the inside; he carried in into Lloyd's room, and left it there; Lloyd came out again, and let him out at the door, and told him he wanted some brass rings; and ask'd him if he had any in his master's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of rings?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. They were to put upon curtains: Hoskins told him, there were some in his master's shop, and he would bring him some; Lloyd said, when? he said, he could not tell; he ask'd him to come on the Wednesday and Saturday night; he said he could not, because he had his master's shop to clean out; but would come as soon as he could: I once saw the shape of a round fender, in a bag, on Hoskins's back; which he carried through the entry up stairs to Lloyd; and always when he came, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300017"/> used to make him punch or give him drams or fetch strong beer for him; Hoskin's was always very fearful of seeing me, he used to slide out and hang down his head.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he has given him punch and such liquors you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. I have seen him fetch punch and strong beer when Hoskins has come on nights, and have seen punch on his table afterwards; and heard Lloyd say he should stay and drink a little tiff with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in the room at such a time?</p>
               <p>H. Warren. No: but the door has been ajar, and I have look'd in.</p>
               <p>Hoskins's defence.</p>
               <p>This man first inticed me, by getting me in liquor; I'll do myself justice, I have taken many a thousand pounds for my master, and never mole a mistake in my life.</p>

I bought a chafing-dish of him; I told him I had no more money in my pocket but a shilling, and I paid him seven-pence half-penny towards the reckoning; and said, I'll pay you the remainder the next time I see you; I paid for every thing time after time.</p>

            . About two months or nine weeks ago, or thereabouts, the two prisoners, Guest, Mason, and I, met at the London Factory, and went to the house the prosecutor has mentioned, and broke it open with a chissel and pinchers, which we carried with us; and we took out four or five chairs with cane bottoms and backs to them, a stove, a fender, a pair of tongs, and a wooden shovel, and some crockery ware.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them?</p>
               <p>Child. We carried them to my house on Clerkenwell-Green, and there we sold them to he other prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Child. I believe part of the money was paid to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this was it that you was taken up?</p>
               <p>Child I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you taken up?</p>
               <p>Child. I was taken up a little beyond Stafford.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be taken up there?</p>

               <p>Child. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Henfield ever received any goods of you before this?</p>
               <p>Child. Yes; he knew a great many things were stolen that he receiv'd, and had talk'd with me about things we had stole several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry them at night or in the day?</p>
               <p>Child. We kept them in my cellar 'till they were sold, and they went altogether by day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Henfield know of your going off?</p>
               <p>Child. He did; he was one that advised me to go off about Stepney church affair.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to make this information against these people, and many others?</p>
               <p>Child. Because I was question'd about it; I was advis'd what to say; and how to go on, if I should be ask'd about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Henfield advise you to do?</p>
               <p>Child. He advis'd me to deny it, if I should be charg'd with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was you examin'd before, in Stafford-shire?</p>
               <p>Child. I was examin'd before Mr Boothby.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any account there, of the taking these goods?</p>
               <p>Child. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not?</p>
               <p>Child. Because they bid me to deny every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge Henfield there?</p>
               <p>Child. I did; I said he was the man that bought the goods; but I cannot say whether I mention'd it or not; if I did, I have forgot it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of a bill of sale made for these goods, to a person that was distraining at your house?</p>
               <p>Child. No, I do not; I remember Henfield offer'd me thirty-seven pounds, before I went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Hemsworth, and another person, coming after you, in order to take you and Guest, at a house in Field-lane?</p>
               <p>Child. No, I never came to Field-lane; it was to Clerkenwell; Hemsworth came himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come to you for?</p>
               <p>Child. He came to me, and said; whatever you do, get off; for if you do not, we shall come into bad bread; for they have found the lead; and if you get off, they will make it up cass.</p>

            . I was sent for by the evidence Child, to fetch Mr Henfield, or any other broker, to buy his goods: I being acquainted with Mr Henfield, went and fech'd him; and he bought the goods of Mr Child; and they remain'd at Child's house, from the twenty-seventh of March, 'till Easter-Monday: in that time, Mrs Child was to have had the goods again, in order to let the rooms out in ready-furnish'd lodgings: but when Mr Child was taken at Stafford, and in goal, he sent for her to come down, and also to bring some money: Henfield had paid 6 l. and was to give fourteen; she wanted the money, and was forc'd to part with the goods; so he paid her the remainder.</p>

            . Yes, I did; that was on Easter-Monday, at night; the goods were fetch'd away that same day; he advis'd Henfield and me, and said, he would put us in a way that we should act with safety: for his having paid the woman part of the money before, for the goods, he paid the rest of the money on the Wednesday or Thursday afterwards; but the Justice order'd him not to pay her; I imagin'd he thought he had bought them safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Henfield know that Child was a thief?</p>
               <p>Tasker. No, I do not know that he did; there was a report of some mahogany being stole, and sold; that was the reason that Henfield ask'd advice of the justice.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Who sent you to bring Henfield to buy the goods?</p>
               <p>Tasker. Child himself did.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did Child follow?</p>
               <p>Tasker. In Field-lane, he follow'd the business of a Broker; but these goods were his own houshold-furniture.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the goods distrain'd for rent?</p>
               <p>Tasker. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom?</p>
               <p>Tasker. By Whitton, in the house of Child.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Child, when his goods were distrain'd ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. He was then in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the sending for Henfield to buy these goods, before or after the distraining?</p>
               <p>Tasker. It was before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know one Mr Blake?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I do; he was landlord of the house where he then lived; he collected rents f Mr Cheslyn: I believe Child had been in the house about three weeks or a month before this happen'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was due for rent ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. There were 2 l. due for rent: Mr Henfield paid it to Mr Blake; there was an order to pay the rent, before the goods could be taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the money paid?</p>
               <p>Tasker. To the best of my knowledge, was on Easter-Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any particular order to keep it a secret?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I was to go to Mr Henfield, or any body else: I said, as Mr Henfield is one of your acquaintance, he might come to you; which he did, and took an inventory of the things; and there were two receipts given by them both to Henfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Both who?</p>
               <p>Tasker. From Guest and Child; each had one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Child any earnest?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I believe he had a shilling earnest; and Guest's goods were fetch'd away the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did Guest sell?</p>
               <p>Tasker. His goods in his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. From what you saw, did it appear to you that Henfield was buying goods, that he knew to be stolen?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300023"/>Tasker. No, I did not think he did; because he had ask'd Child if the goods were honestly come by? and he said they were: Child came to me on a Saturday night, and said he dare not go home; for he and Guest had bought some lead, and he was afraid it was stolen; and that the Plumber's man had seen a man with a paper in his hand; and they suspected something, and went away instead of going to a publick house where they were going: and then it was that he sent for Henfield to sell his goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell Henfield that ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. He did, he told him the same story he told me; I thought he had bought the lead as he had said.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say Guest and he bought it of?</p>
               <p>Tasker. He said, they bought it of two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you the Plumber's man advis'd him to run away?</p>
               <p>Tasker. No, he did not; he said Guest and he had been asking about for the two men; and if they could not find them, they must be tried themselves.</p>
               <p>Guest's Defence.</p>

               <p>I know nothing of these goods, no more than your Lordship does.</p>
               <p>Mason's defence.</p>
               <p>I had no manner of concern in it; neither was I ever seen in Child's company, any where whatsoever: I ask'd him before the justice, wherever I was in his company; he could name no house; at last he named a little house in Holy-Well-lane; but I never was in that house with him.</p>

             to buy Child's and Guest's goods, to a publick house in Whitechapel; there sat Child and Guest: said Child, I am going to sea: What is the matter, said I? said he, I have bought some lead of two men that are rope-makers, and I am afraid it is stolen: I said, I wonder you will meddle with lead; said he, we have been hunting about after them, and cannot find them: I ask'd him who he sold it to? he said, to a Plumber in Bishopsgate-street; and they were going in at a publick house to drink, at the next door; and they saw a man with a piece of paper in his hand, and they went away, and would not go into the house: that is all I know of the matter.

               <p>Woodhouse Coker. I lost some deal boards, and some inch and half wainscot boards, betwixt sixty and seventy boards of them, from out of my timber-yard, on the back of Wood's Close, St James Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with any of them again?</p>
               <p>Coker. I found nine whole, and half a dozen short pieces of the wainscot ones, at the prisoner Willoby's.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know against the other two prisoners?</p>
               <p>Coker. I know nothing more against them, more than what I have heard from Child the evidence; only I have Guest's receipt for them to Willoby. Mr Fielding sent for me, to know of me, whether I had lost some wainscot boards. I had miss'd them about a month before. The justice told me the case which he had had from Child, and desir'd me to go to Willoby's. I went, and his workmen were at work upon my boards. I ask'd him where he had them boards; he said, he bought them of one

               <p>Coker. I never heard him say he did.</p>
               <p>Guest. I sign'd that receipt.</p>
               <p>Coker. We brought Willoby before justice Fielding, and he bound me over to prosecute. I went to the person that I bought my wainscot of; he went with me to see them: he was as clear as could be that they were my boards.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks had they upon them?</p>
               <p>Coker. They had R H</p>
               <p>Q. Where about in Willoby's yard did you find them?</p>
               <p>Coker. They lay backwards in his warehouse. There were no other boards when I went first but my own; and when I went to fetch them away in the evening, he had been and bought a parcel of such sort, and put them amongst mine, and put me to some difficulty to find them, they being six feet inch and half boards; and they were plaining their boards over; and put me to destance to know which was my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he plain them ?</p>
               <p>Coker. All mine had red marks on them, done by the merchant in Holland. Willoby came at ten at night, and brought a man along with him, and said, he could make greater discovery with regard to the loss of my things.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men had he at work?</p>
               <p>Coker. He had three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. Mention the words he said, as near as you can recollect.</p>
               <p>Coker. He came to my door, and said, he would be glad to speak to me; and said, I can make some discovery with respect to your yard being robb'd. I said, go to justice Fielding, for I have nothing to say. In the receipt which he told me, he himself wrote, he says, received of Moses Willoby 3 l. 8 s. for wainscot and deal boards.</p>
               <p>W. Terrett. I went to Willoby's house, to see if these boards appear'd to be the property of the prosecutor. I examin'd them, and they appear'd most clearly to have been my property. I can't take upon me to say, they are the very boards that I sold him. I know I sold him such, and I have great reason to think they are the same.</p>

               <p>Q. How many did you take away?</p>
               <p>Child. We took away upwards of sixty.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day or night?</p>
               <p>Child. At night.</p>
               <p>Q. At how many times?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300026"/>Child. In two nights; one night we had done about four in the morning, the other time about two.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry them to?</p>
               <p>Child. To an old house; after that they were sold to Mr Willoby, and carried to his house in a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you carry them to the old house?</p>
               <p>Child. On our backs.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that old house?</p>
               <p>Child. It is on Clerkenwell-Green.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Willoby first see them?</p>
               <p>Child. He first saw them in that old house; then it was uninhabited.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Willoby know how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Child. I can't remember that he did; but he knew how we came by several parcels that we had sold him before.</p>

               <p>Child. No; I am not.</p>

               <p>Child. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said before Willoby, from whence they were taken ?</p>
               <p>Child. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had he had of you before?</p>
               <p>Child. He had had deals of us before.</p>
               <p>Q. What were these wainscot boards sold to him for?</p>
               <p>Child. For three pounds odd money: Mr Guest gave the receipt for the money.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutors. Did Willoby say where he bought these boards?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He said he bought them in an empty house, and pretended to find it, but went up one way and down another, and would not find it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the day were they carried to Willoby's house?</p>
               <p>Child. It was by day-light in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Guest's Defence.</p>
               <p>These boards were three weeks in Child's own yard before I laid my finger on them: I believe he had four or five cart loads in his yard: he said, he did not know what to do with them, he believed they would be wet, and was afraid they would be spoiled; and he said, let me put them into your old house in Cow-cross, and I'll pay half the rent. I was going to dinner, I carried one load; they were all carried there into the old house by day-light; after that he came to my house in Bartholomew Close and said, his mind was changed, I wish you would sell them for me, and I'll satisfy you for your trouble; I went to Shoreditch and brought Mr Henfield up; I ask'd, and Mr Henfield bid; I look'd to Child and Child look'd angry at me, saying, he would not let them go for that money; but wish'd I would go to Mr Willoby, for I do not like to deal with that rogue, he said, meaning Henfield, Willoby will give you more than he will. I went on Willoby, and told him there were a few wainscot boards in such a place; he said, he would come and look at them; I do not think he came in two or three days. At last he called at my house; I bargain'd with him for them likewise; I hired a cart in Smithfield, and took them to his house in open day-light; there were forty of them all but one; he paid me for them; there were twenty-six wainscot, and thirteen or fourteen deal; he gave me three pounds eight shillings for them, which was about the honest market-price; I brought the money to my own house, and paid it down to Child, and he gave me two shillings for my trouble; Child and Hill a Carpenter, carried them to that house; Hill lives on Saffron-Hill; Child has been a rogue all his life-time; he is a thief and a robber, all the world can tell that; he told me he had a very large estate in the Isle of Wight; I would have gone through fire and water to have serv'd him. If any man in court can give me a bad name let him speak it boldly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300027"/>Mason's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know no more of it than the child unborn; I never was concerned with Child, or ever seen in his company.</p>
               <p>Willoby's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have sufficient evidence to prove I never bought them in hugger-mugger, but afterwards put them in publick view; they lay about a month in the open yard, close up to the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What are these boards worth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave two shillings and one penny a piece for them: I lost between sixty and seventy; Mr Willoby produced this receipt, and said, he bought a great parcel of deal boards of Guest; I ask'd him how he could think them honestly come by out of an empty house, of a poor journeyman frame maker; I ask'd him also, whether he had such a receipt from every timber yard where he dealt; he made me no sort of answer, but said, he did not like it at the time he bought them; and he believed Guest was a rogue, or something like it.</p>

            . I have work'd for Mr Willoby about ten months; he has about five journeymen; I remember the wainscot was brought in about two o'clock at noon in an open cart, and placed on each side the gate, not a yard from the street, and we did not work up any or remove them 'till about a month or two or better after; we had no order to conceal them, nor no such attempts made; we work'd up some of them, and removed them into the dry place, fearing the wet.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Willoby?</p>
               <p>Plowman. I have known him about two years; he always bore a good character; he carries on business publick as other people do, and has a great trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at work when Mr Coker came to see the boards ?</p>
               <p>Plowman. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they lie then?</p>
               <p>Plowman. Some were working up, and some were lying by.</p>

               <p>Plowman. I did.</p>

               <p>Plowman. In the same manner as before, when he came first.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there none mixed among them?</p>
               <p>Plowman. No, there were not, I am very sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Are you sure there had been an alteration betwixt the first and second time of your seeing them there?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There had; some of them were moved from where I first saw them, and other boards of the same sort put amongst them, and the men plaining them over; Willoby said, they were boards that he bought of a man in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Plowman. There were none at all mix'd with them; Mr Coker said, they should not be touch'd, and they were not touch'd nor stirr'd 'till he came again; but when he found we were planing the other boards, he said, you rogues you ought to be taken up for plaining my boards, all these boards are mine; when the others had been come in not above two hours.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They were plaining their own boards, and mixed some of them with mine in order to puzzle me, and make me swear to some that were not my own.</p>

            . I am a Plumber: on the twenty-third of March last, I was sent for to the shop of Mrs Smith in Bishopsgate-street; by order of Mr Alderman Cokayne; he told me Stepney Church had been robb'd; and desir'd me to look at that lead, and give him my opinion of it: I saw it, and said, it certainly came from off a flat place; I measur'd and weigh'd it; there was eleven-hundred, one quarter, and eleven pounds of it; twenty-eight pieces in all. Then I went to the Church and measur'd there; and took a remarkable piece to compare; I found it of the same thickness with that on the Church; there was one spike in it, and holes where four had been; I found where it was taken from, and observed the spike in the lead exactly fitted to a hole in the timber; and the four holes answered to four holes in the rasters; I compared one of the small nails, that I took out of Mrs Smith's shop, with one remaining on the Church, and they answered exactly in size, shape, and demension; I observ'd a spike-nail remaining on the Church, which had not been drawn when the lead was taken up; it tallied with the lead when we came to put it on, as well as two indentures could; there was no room to doubt, but that the lead came from that place.</p>

               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that lead?</p>
               <p>Walker. If it had been brought and offer'd to me, and honestly came by; I should have given 13 s. per hundred for it, as old lead to melt down; I had given more than that, at that time.</p>
               <p>Counsel. We have now prov'd the lead found in Mrs Smith's house, was the lead taken from off the church at Stepney: we will next mention a circumstance of finding tools and mussatees on the Church; and the prisoners meeting.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr Hammel. What did you find on the Church?</p>
               <p>Hammel. I found this rope hanging on the Church, (producing one) and this knife upon the Church; ( producing a case knife, which had the blade doubled back, proper for cutting; or as by a drawing, will plough a gutter in ) I found also this mitten (producing a knit glove ); these I found the next morning after it was robb'd.</p>

             came to me about a week before it was taken off, and desired me to take a walk with him to Stepney, saying, he had seen something that he thought would answer; we went there to a publick house, and drank pretty freely of twopenny and beer, about two hundred yards from the church. I was not agreeable to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was mentioned?</p>
               <p>Child. It was to take the lead from the church. We left a shilling to bind us to come again, and take a dinner; so to take a better view of the place the first fine day. They would not get a dinner for us if we had not left that. In two or three days after we went again?</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you?</p>
               <p>Child. Guest, and his two women; that is, his wife, and another woman; she lives in his house, and is big with child by him. There was also my wife and Mrs Gillingham; she is a Broker's wife on Clerkenwell-Green. We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300030"/> had a dinner there. The women did not know our business; they went only for pleasure.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for dinner?</p>
               <p>Child. We had some pork. After we went into the church-yard all of us; we walk'd round, and took a view of the church: when we came at the back-part of the church Guest toss'd up a stone upon the church, and said, he wanted to know whether the lead was found; which Mrs Gillingham took notice of, and got some wind of it. In a day or two after that, all sides were agreed. Guest lived in my neighbourhood, within about three or four hundred yards of me; Henfield and Mason lived at a distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever talk'd to either of them about taking this lead?</p>
               <p>Child. Yes; it was talk'd of, and agreed to by all. I met Guest and Mason at Henfield's house. Henfield was there also. There was only the maid-servant at home besides; but she heard nothing of what we talk'd about.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account of the conversation.</p>
               <p>Child. We appointed to meet in Stepney church-yard, and fix'd upon the time, which, I think, was the next night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were to meet?</p>
               <p>Child. Guest, Henfield, a servant of Mrs Smith's, Mason, and me; but Henfield was not to come 'till three o'clock in the morning, and we were to be there by between nine and ten at night. We were to get a ladder, and get upon the church, and get as much lead as we could 'till it came to grow light; and Henfield was to come to us by three in the morning, to help us as much as possible in carrying it away, it being a hard job. We had agreed this at Henfield's house, to carry and bury it in a dunghill (about a quarter of a mile from the church,) 'till such time as we could get it away to Mrs Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you had any conversation with Mrs Smith about it at that time?</p>
               <p>Child. No; I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of Mrs Smith's servant?</p>
               <p>Child. I do not know. Guest and I went there together first, and I got a ladder. Mason and Mrs Smith's servant came at the time. We set the ladder, and

            , Mrs Smith's servant, and I, went upon the church, Mason stay'd below to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the ladder ?</p>
               <p>Child. I got it at a new building. We had this knife, that is here produc'd, and another knife, a pair of pincers, and a chissel. This knife that is here was made by Mrs Smith's servant; but it did not do well, so we throw'd it by.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought the other knife, chissel, and pincers.</p>
               <p>Child. Guest did. I had another knife in my pocket, which I used.</p>
               <p>Q. How much lead do you think you took away?</p>
               <p>Child. I did not think it to be so much as it prov'd to be: I took it to be about a thousand weight.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you let it down.</p>
               <p>Child. There was but one piece tried to be let down by that rope; all the other pieces where toss'd down; it was soft ground, and the fall made no great noise. Guest had on a pair of mittens; that is, knit gloves, and a pair of green mussatees.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this mitten here produc'd.</p>
               <p>Child. He takes it in his hand. This is one of Guest's, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these green mussatees. He takes them in his hand.</p>
               <p>Child. These are the same he had on.</p>
               <p>Mr Darking. I found this odd mitten, and these mussatees, on the top of the church, the day after it was robb'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Henfield as good as his word.</p>
               <p>Child. He was. He came about three in the morning. We had then just got the lead down, and begun to carry it away to the dunghill; and Henfield assisted us in carrying it away, where we covered it over.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Child. It was star-light; we had no lanthorn; we had finished when the people were going a milking, about four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the lead lie in the dunghill ?</p>
               <p>Child. It lay there two days and one night.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you all come home?</p>
               <p>Child. We all parted as soon as we came into the road, and went to our homes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the next meeting?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300031"/>Child. That was at Henfield's house, the same day, in the afternoon Guest and I call'd there; (Mason was not there ) Guest and I went to the dunghill, to see that it was cover'd safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was I the taking it away from the dunghill ?</p>
               <p>Child. Guest and I got a cart in Old-street; and we went and fetch'd it into Bishopsgate-street to Mrs Smith's.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the ladder afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Child. We took that away, and carried it within about twenty yards from the place where we had it; and some people were coming down the road, so we laid it down and left it there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was the lead carried to Mrs Smith's ?</p>
               <p>Child. We got there about seven in the morning with it. She paid me for it, and I gave her a receipt. The money she gave me was five 27 s. pieces. The receipt was for 6 l. 15. and I carried the money to Henfield, as was agreed upon before, and there it was divided by him. He made the charges out, and when they were paid we had about 24 s. each; that is, Henfield, Guest, Mrs Smith's servant, Mason, and me. I had 6 s. 6 d. to pay for the horses and the cart, and the rest was all spent, 8 s. 6 d. I believe. The rope we tied to an iron bar in the window of the church to get down by, and the last person that came down could not untie that, so we left it hanging: that was

            . The ladder was not high enough to get upon the top of the church, we put it upon a grave-stone, and got upon the lower part of the church, and from thence to the upper part. We drew up the ladder after us.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the first time you were examined before Mr Fielding you did not say, that Henfield and Mrs Smith's servant went out in the afternoon, the day before the lead was sold, to show you where the lead was hid.</p>
               <p>Child. I was ordered what to say. I would never have told the truth; I would sooner have died, had I not been told by Henfield's brother, they were striving every way to throw it upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Plumber's man one in the consultation about going?</p>
               <p>Child. He was one in the consulting of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your ever give any account that you bought this lead of some rope-makers.</p>
               <p>Child. No; we did agree if it should be blow'd to say so.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you divide the money?</p>
               <p>Child. I can't say the day: I think it was on a Friday. It was the same day that we brought it to Mrs Smith's.</p>
               <p>Mr Hammel. I remember Henfield's being apprehended; I can't tell the day of the month, I think he was before Child was brought from the country, and Mason's son was apprehended instead of the father, we at that time did not know there were two Masons father and son; when we came before Justice Fielding, young Mason declared his innocence, (he and Henfield were brought there together) the Justice was going to commit young Mason for farther examination; Henfield desired to be heard, saying he had something to say by himself; when the room was cleared of the common people, Henfield said, they had taken the wrong person; let it turn how it will, the suddle ought to lie on the right horse, for that it was not young Mason, but

            , the father of him. I and two others that are here were by and heard this. We endeavoured directly to get the father, and he was taken and brought in about a couple of hours. After he came into the room I went up to Henfield, and thank'd him, for leading us out of the mistake. I ask'd him, if he could say any more; he said he could, and he would, and seem'd willing then; but the next morning he would not say any thing.</p>

            . I live upon Saffron-Hill; I am a Weaver; I dined with Guest and Child, on the twelfth of February, at the sign of the Cherry-Tree at Stepney, on the Green; it was agreed upon before to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in company?</p>
               <p>Taskr. There was Guest's landlord, I think his name is Ashbourn; Guest and his wife, Mrs Gillingham, myself, Child and his wife, and another woman that belong'd to Guest; she was big with child by him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for dinner ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. We had pork, part boil'd, and part roasted; after dinner, we took a walk into the church-yard; in walking round among the tombs, Guest threw up a stone upon the church; I heard him say, let us see if the lead is found; or words to that effect; there came a person out and said, Don't throw up stones to break the windows, for you will not be willing to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mason?</p>
               <p>Tasker. I never saw him, 'till I saw him in Westminster Gate-house; I have heard Child speak of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation between Child and you in March.</p>
               <p>Tasker. I was in bed, he came to me on the twenty-fourth of March, between eleven and twelve at night: I said, what makes you be here at this time of night ? he said, because I dare not go home; I said, what is the reason of that? he said, there was some lead that he and Guest had bought the day before, and he imagin'd it was stolen: I ask'd him how he came to know it was stolen? he said, the Plumber came and said, Mr Child, was there not two shillings betwixt my wife and you, about the lead? he ask'd him to go and drink together at the next house, and he would go before and call for the beer? and he imagin'd they had an officer in the publick house to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he say this was ?</p>
               <p>Tasker. He said it was in Bi shopsgate-street; he said he saw a man at the door with a paper in his hand; and they set off, one, one way, and the other the other way, and would not go into the house: he told me he bought the lead of two men that appear'd to be Rope-makers; for they had hemp about their cloaths.</p>
               <p>Guest's Defence.</p>
               <p>I'll tell the whole truth; I was at work at Child's house; I cannot tell the day of the month; as I was going away, about three in the afternoon; said he, I wish you would go along with me to-morrow morning; I have bought some lead as far off as Stepney, and I shall want a hand to help to get it home: said I, I will go with you with all my heart: said he, we may as well step to Old-street, to see if we can get a horse and cart; I believe I must have two horses: when he came there; said the man, so you may, but you must pay more money; said Child, I shall not stick for trifles; said he, I shall want them between two and three to-morrow morning; and if I shall not want them at that time, I'll send this man to forbid it: he call'd me at three the next morning out of my bed; and said, it was half an hour past two; I got up, we went to Old-street; and it was a quarter past three before we had the horses and cart ready: we went to a dunghill in Whitechapel; and got the lead; he told me he had it from an old house belonging to a decay'd gentleman in Stepney; and that it was carried there by two Rope-makers for him; we were seen by some Bricklayers that were going to work; we loaded it and carried it to Bishopsgate-street; and he gave me three shillings for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Henfields's Defence.</p>
               <p>I beg you would ask Child what time of the day it was, that he declar'd he paid me and others?</p>
               <p>Child, to the question. I cannot tell the day of the month; it was on the same day that we brought the lead to Mrs Smith's, in the afternoon; I deliver'd the money to Henfield as I went by with the cart about eight o'clock; ( the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300033"/> lead was sold about seven); and it was not divided 'till the afternoon on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. from Henfield. What time did you meet in the afternoon?</p>
               <p>Child. I cannot justly say; it was betwixt one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this receipt?</p>
               <p>Child. Yes; this is the receipt ( he takes it in his hand) that I gave Mrs Smith: It is read to this purport.</p>

            . I have known Henfield six years: I had a suit in the Marshalsea-Court, which was tried on the 23d of March, being a Friday, he was at my trial there; he went over there, I believe about nine o'clock, and staid in my company 'till ten at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>
               <p>Sibery. I live in Shoreditch: I keep a house there, and am a Butcher; we din'd at the Bull in the Borough after the trial was over.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you dine?</p>
               <p>Sibery. It may be between four and five when we had din'd; then we went to a house over against my house, and he never was out of our company for a quarter of an hour together, 'till ten: he is a very honest endeavouring man; I have bought and sold to him, and never found a farthing amiss; I went also to Mason's house that morning, and desired him to come to my trial; he went with me and din'd with me, and staid with us 'till past dinner-time; he bears a very good character.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said he had the trial with one Davis; that Davis was plaintiff; that it was occasioned by his indulging Davis at Hicks's-Hall for robbing him, and that bill was not found; so Davis brought that against him; that Mr Wilson was his attorney, and Mr Taylor Davis's; that neither Mason nor Henfield were examined on the trial; that he got his cause, and Davis got out of court and ran away.

            . I belong to the Discount-Office at the Bank, and have done for four years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the manner of discounting bills at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Rogers. They bring a list of bills, and put the sums and names of the persons upon them, then we carry them into the parlour to the gentlemen to look over them. Then they are carried to the committee and left, and when they approve of them they ring for us. The committee in waiting determine whether they are good bills or not. If they do not like them they refuse them, and we deliver them back again. Mr Tittley us'd to keep cash at the Bank, and used to bring bills.</p>
               <p>Q. What cash had he there on the 3d of October?</p>
               <p>Rogers. He had 27 l. 7 s. 9 d. before he brought thirteen bills. These bills were for 1669 l. 11 s. 7 d. produc'd. Here is my figure on the back of them. It is usual after the bills are ordered, to sign them; then to write them in a book called the Day-Book; then it is wrote upon Mr Tittley's account. Credit was given for it. He draw'd off from that 1600 l. by a write off.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain that.</p>
               <p>Rogers. That is, an order to write off. Wrote off from my bank-book 1600 l. that is wrote into his book, and he has Bank-notes, or what he pleases for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this write off paid?</p>
               <p>Rogers. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any other transaction between the Bank and Mr Tittley?</p>
               <p>Rogers. After that we discounted 'till the 3d of November, then there was only 3 l. 16 s. 4 d. remaining; that has not been drawn off yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the balance between him and the Bank?</p>
               <p>Rogers. That 3 l. 16 s. 4 d. is the balance. Some of the bills that he discounted were paid, and some were not. I believe the four last were not paid. The bill in question, that has not been paid back to the Bank; that is, the Bank has not received the value for it.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, he had been eleven years last April at the Bank. That he knew Mr Tittley near as long as he had been there. That he was a warehouseman and merchant. He had taken him to be a man of great credit. He look'd upon him to be very industrious, but not worth much money. That he had discounted from the 3d of Oct. to the 14th of Nov. 14325 l. That they have had bills drawn upon Tittley by the name Jo. Archer, that had been paid, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175905300035"/> the amount of 740 l. That they were brought by Mr Tittley, but don't know to whom payable.</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Chitty. I am one of the Directors of the Bank. I was one of the committee on the 3d of Oct. 58. This bill in question was brought in by our officer, for our allowance or disallowance; and it was allow'd to be discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. What are your rules you go by; and what do you rely upon for your security ?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Chitty. We expect the drawer, the person upon whom drawn, and the accepter, should be good men.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known there had been no such person existing as Jo. Archer to this bill, would you have allowed it?</p>
               <p>Mr Alderman Chitty. No, not upon any consideration; we should not allow of any bill with a fictitious drawer, if there had been ever so many indorsers.</p>
               <p>Q. to Booth. Do you know what is become of Mr Tittley's bill-book ?</p>
               <p>Booth. Here it is. In this are enter'd the bills he received out of the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the bill in question entered there?</p>
               <p>Booth. It is kept regular. I have examined about the 26th of Sept. 58. to the 10th of Oct. and cannot find it. He drew 1600 l. out of the Bank on the 3d of Oct.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr Tittley and the prisoner acquainted together?</p>
               <p>Booth. They were.</p>

            . I am secretary at the Bank. I was ordered to send this bill in question to Sunderland in a letter, after Mr Tittley had failed, that the money might be received of the drawer Jo. Archer, not doubting but there was such a person. I sent the letter to Mr Harris a merchant there. I have this answer, dated Dec. 9th. 58. wherein he mentions he has made diligent inquiry for Jo. Archer, and is very well satisfied there is no such person there.

I was a little merry, having had two or three pots of beer that day; she took hold of me by the arm, and took me into the house where she lived; and another woman took me by the collar: I saw the prisoner was getting my watch; I laid fast hold on her cloaths; and she got a knife, and cut her cloaths; and left me a handful of cloaths, and nothing else; and went away directly.</p>

               <p>Cook's Defence.</p>
               <p>This woman, meaning Goldsmith, has been backwards and forwards at my house for this year and half past. She went by the name of Mrs Phillips. She used to say her husband had an income of 200 a year. She frequently used to pretend she was going to market, and would come in, and sit sometimes a quarter of an hour. One time, I remember, she told me, her husband belong'd to the War-Office. At that time she appear'd to be big-bellied: that was about a year and half ago. She came on the 1st of May in the morning. I was busy with a customer in the shop. I desir'd her to walk into the parlour. She sell a telling my wife she had a relation died in the country about 15 miles off, and she had left her a two-quart tankard, a pint mug, a half pint mug, and other things; and she had left a nephew of her's a thousand pounds; but he was extravagant, and she was afraid he would run through it. She told me, her aunt's name was Bennet. She said, that tankard was not altogether so useful for her, she would depose of it; and that her husband bid her to lay the money out in what manner she pleased. She said she could do no less than have a mourning-ring for her aunt; and gave me the letters that were upon the tankard to put upon it. She bought a plain gold ring, and half a dozen tea-spoons. On the Wednesday morning came a Warning from Goldsmith's-Hall; it surpriz'd me, describing a 2 quart tankard; but when I found the letters did not answer with the letters in the Warning, I concluded that could not be the tankard mentioned in the Warning. And one thing is very remarkable on the tankard, all 3 large capital ***, not mentioned in the Warning. Besides, the Warning says, the handle bent, the lid crack'd, the bottom much bruised. The bottom of this was very smooth, as a new tankard. I had it in my house about a fortnight before I broke it to pieces. I gave 5 s. per ounce for it. It is the usual way all silversmiths do before they melt, they cut the silver into small pieces.</p>
               <p>He had many witnesses to his character; but the jury said, they were well satisfied as to his innocency, without calling any.</p>
