I am in the service of Mr. Hailstone, a draper, in Marylebone-street; I was formerly in the employ of Mr. Cur<lb/>lewis from the latter end of January, 1839, to the first week in March. The prisoner was not in Mr. Curlewis's service in February, 1839, not in the way of business, as regards the tailoring—I do not remember Mr. Cox coming to Curlewis's.</p>

I know Mr. Cox—I lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about the latter end of January or February, 1839—it was the 2nd of February, I believe—Gurdon was in my employment at that time, as a sort of clerk and manag<lb/>ing man—he used to collect my accounts out of doors, and whatever I had to do—he was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards occasionally to my place of business—I believe he had an occupation at a Water-proof<lb/>ing Company in the Strand at the same time—he divided his time between me and the Company—I should say I had the most of his time—on my lending Mr. Cox the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I called Gurdon in and told him to notice my giving Mr. Cox the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I lent Mr. Cox—I gave a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I am quite certain of that—Gurdon came forward at my desire, and saw me give it to Mr. Cox—at the time I gave it, I begged Mr. Cox to return it to me as soon as possible, and he said he would do so—I lent him the money on his own account, to him himself, and not to Captain Henningsen—Way was my clerk at that time—I am not positive whether he was there—I delivered the money to Mr. Cox in a little room separated from the room of business—Gurdon came into the room when I called him—any one in the outer room could hear me call—I was in the habit of doing it—at that time Captain Henningsen was in my debt—he did not apply to me at that time to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or pay 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him—I should not have done so if he had—he had no claim on me at that time, not for a farthing; he owes me some hundreds—Hindmarsh was not in my service at that time—he came about the latter end of February, or beginning of March—Gurdon has gone to Mr. Cox with messages from me—I am satisfied Mr. Cox must have been acquainted with Gurdon's person, because he has come on business to my house when Gurdon was there—he had opportunities of seeing Cox, and Cox seeing him—Pinn was in my service then—he has now left—I have known him, to the best of ray recollection, I should think, two years, or perhaps not so long—I have, unfortunately for myself, had opportunities of judging of his conduct and character—from what I know of him, I certainly would not believe him on his oath—I discharged him for stealing—I have known Gurdon since the latter end of 1837—I had the best of characters of him from a Captain Birt, as excellent a cha<lb/>racter as one man could give another, and he deserved it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and carry on business at St. Dunstan's-hill. The prisoner was in my employment last year—on the 4th of Septem<lb/>ber last I sent him with a cart to Clark and Roe's, in Arthur-street West, London-bridge—he came to me in the evening, and gave an account to my foreman of twenty-three packages taken out and delivered for Clark and Roe; and next morning he gave me the same account; and from some little discrepancy in his money account he absconded—he had taken the horse and cart out about nine o'clock in the morning to ply, and never returned, leaving two days' wages due to him—he left the horse and cart in the street opposite the Custom-house—I saw it there—he did not tell me he did not intend to return—I saw him again on Friday, the 31st of July, this year, in Kingsland-road—I followed him till I met a policeman,</p>

               <p>and said to the policeman, "I charge this man with felony"—the prisoner then said, "I did not steal your chest of tea"—I had said nothing about tea, I could hardly identify him, as he was in a different garb to when in my employ, but I have no doubt now that he is the man—since he left me I have paid Clark and Roe the value of the chest of tea, by a running ac<lb/>count of more than treble the value—I have debited myself to the amount of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is the general custom of the trade to be responsible for the value of the goods which carmen have to deliver.</p>

Oliver, Baldock, a box, and two small boxes—I directed him to deliver them at the Horse-shoe, Goswell-street—that made three packages to be delivered there, a chest of congou, a box of twankey, and two caddies containing tea, which were corded together—he was to book them as three packages—I agreed with him as to the number of packages before he took them away—he said there were twenty-three after counting them, distinctly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a packer and calenderer, in partnership with Mr. Pellatt. This cheque belonged to an estate to which I was assignee—the prisoner was employed in our warehouse for about two years—I got this cheque from Mr. Brand, clerk to Messrs. Masterman—it was drawn by me on Messrs. Masterman and Co., but had never been made use of—it was filled up in mistake, and left in a drawer in, my iron safe, always un<lb/>der lock and key—I suppose I lost it from there about the 22nd of July—in consequence of having lost it, and seeing it again, an officer was sent for, and we went and searched the prisoner's lodgings—a key was found in his pocket, which would open a desk in which the key of the iron safe was kept—but that would not open the drawer in which this cheque was—that must have been picked—how the cheque was taken from that drawer I cannot tell.</p>

I saw M'Carthy come out, and then the prisoner—after they were both out I saw the prisoner open something, which I believe to be a knife—I went up to him and advised him to go away, and put the knife away—he said he would not, that if any of them came near him he would use it—the pro<lb/>secutor was coming towards him—I placed my right-hand against his chest to stop him, and the prisoner made a thrust and stabbed me in the hand—I went out from the crowd, and heard a cry of "He has got a knife, he has stabbed the man"—I did not see M'Carthy hurt—I went away directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at the University College Hospital. M'Carthy was brought there on the night of the 1st of August, with a stab on the left side, in the region of the heart, about four inches deep, but in a slanting direction—he was kept in the hospital during the night, and went away at his own request next morning—the wound as it was not dan<lb/>gerous—the slanting prevented it—if it had penetrated directly straight it would have killed him—I should have thought it had been a larger instru<lb/>ment than this knife that inflicted the wound; but if the knife were drawn out not exactly straight, that might enlarge the wound, so as to make it appear to be inflicted by a larger knife—the wound in the flesh was three or four times as large as the hole in the jacket and shirt—the aperture in the shirt is such as this knife would make.</p>

M'Donald was my errand-boy for six or eight months—I have missed some brass cocks—about half-past six o'clock, on the 22nd of July, I went into the counting-house, and observed a metal cock lying down in one corner, knowing it should not be there, I requested the prisoner to sweep the counting-house out, which was his business, he did so, while I walked up and down the front shop—I then found the cock moved from one corner and hid behind an old almanack board—nobody had been there but him—I set him to mind the front-shop while I went up stairs—I returned in about five minutes, and then missed the cock—I called M'Donald to me, and he said he had not seen it—I told him it was gone, and nobody could have taken it but him, and requested he would show me what he had done with it—he then showed me that he had put it in a part of the shop where the shutters are kept—he stooped down, took it up, gave it to me, and fell down on his knees, and begged my forgiveness—I left him in charge of my clerk, and fetched a policeman—in consequence of in<lb/>quiry which I made my attention was drawn to a marine-store shop in Queen-street, Seven Dials, kept by the prisoner Mancer—I went there with Ashman, the constable, and saw him find a brass cock of mine—M'Donald said, in the presence of Mancer, "That is the cock I sold him last night for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Mancer said, "I never saw him before in my life."</p>

On the 15th of July, a piece of salt beef was missed—this is it—I was called from another shop to accompany the policeman to High-street, on suspicion of the prisoner stealing a piece of beef which had been found among his clothes—the prisoner said it was the first time, and he hoped we would look over it.</p>

In consequence of instructions, I watched near the prosecutor's premises, in Long-acre, on the 4th of August, about nine o'clock in the morning—I saw Townsend come out of the back premises—I was in Cross-lane, leading to Long-acre, in plain clothes—Townsend went down the street, and into Great Wild-street, Lit<lb/>tle Wild-street, and, at the corner of Duke-street, he put one of his feet into the John of Gaunt public-house—he looked round, then came out, and went on to Lincoln's Inn-fields, and stood against a lamp-post—I passed him, and put myself into a house, where I had permission to watch him through the window—he remained there about a quarter of an hour, anxiously looking for some person coming in the direction of Holborn—after that time I saw Gardener, walking in a great hurry towards Towns-end, from the direction of Holborn—Townsend then left the lamp-post and met him—after walking a few yards towards where I was standing, I saw Townsend put his hand into his pocket, and take out one of these pieces of leather, and give it to Gardener, who put it into his pocket—Townsend then took out this other piece, and gave this to Gardener—I went out, and took them both—I said I was an officer, and should take them both to Mr. Pearce's—they refused to go, and Townsend said he was sent to Mr. Bur<lb/>rows, his master's solicitor—I said he must go back to Mr. Pearce's first—he then said he was in business for himself, and that this was his property—I said I should take them both back—Townsend then struck me three violent blows on my head, and knocked me down—I then lost my hold, but I jumped up, and took Gardener by the collar again—Townsend had run away, but I seized Gardener so suddenly that he could not get away—I took hold of the piece of leather which Gardener had in his hand, but he refused to let me have it—I took him to Mr. Pearce, and on our way he said I must be either mad or drunk, and he was doing it by way of trade—on our arrival at Mr. Pearce's, I took the leather from his hand, and put my hand in his pocket, and took out this other piece—he was then taken to Bow-street—I then went back to the prosecutor's, and took Townsend—Gar<lb/>dener</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Inland department, in the General Post-office, London; the prisoner was a clerk in the same office. On the morning of the 4th of August I and the prisoner were in the same office, separating the town and country and foreign letters, which had arrived that morning—about five minutes after six o'clock, I saw the pri<lb/>soner take a small letter in his hand—I happened to look towards him, whether he saw me I cannot tell, but he threw it under the foreign box, which is raised about six inches above the table—there was only one row of letters before him then—one of the men then laid two more rows before him, and then he pushed those letters towards the foreign box, which con<lb/>cealed the small letter from my view—he threw a larger one over the small one—he pushed the three rows of letters towards the two letters I have mentioned, having put the large letter over the small one—there is five or six inches between the box and the surface of the table—about twenty minutes after seven o'clock I saw him put his hand under the foreign box, by the side of the three rows of letters, and after fumbling about, he withdrew his hand closed, and appeared to convey something into his pocket—he left the table directly, left that part of the office, and went into another part of his division—I then removed the three rows of letters which I have mentioned, and found the large letter, but the small letter was gone—I reported it to Mr. Holgate, the President of the Inland Office—this is the letter, to the best of my opinion—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I did not see the address, but it was a letter of this size.</p>

On the 4th of August I received a communication from Mr. Holgate, and saw the prisoner, on his return from the water-closet, about three minutes after Mr. Holgate had spoken to me—I saw him coming from the water-closet—I asked him where he had been—he said, "To the water-closet"—I could tell by his speech that he had nothing in his mouth at that time—I then asked why he left his duty, and said, "Just come With me"—I took him into an inner private room, which I went to through the Inland-office, and across a passage about six feet long—the passage is darkish—when we got to the private room I beckoned to the officer (Tyrrell) to retire, but he did not observe me, and I went into the room—the prisoner followed me in—he had walked by my side in the passage—I then asked him under what pretence he had left his duty, and observing him chewing some paper in his mouth, I said, "What have you in your mouth? take it out"—he made no reply—Tyrrell came up—I told him to take it out of hit mouth, which he did, and it was the letter, which has been produced, addressed to Smith, Payne, and Smith—it was in the state, it is in now, the seal broken, and without any contents—here is the mark of teeth on it—I asked him how he came by it—he said he did not know—I asked him again, and said, "You know perfectly well you should not have had this letter"—he made no answer—the letter should have gone out for delivery about nine o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Pelham-street, Brick-lane. On the 6th of July, I was at Highbury with my wife and two children—my daughter Es<lb/>ther was one of them—she would have been six years old next November—we were returning home from the Woodbine Cottage, about half-past eight o'clock—it was light—my wife had Esther in her hand, and I had another child behind her—I heard a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> coming along on this side of High<lb/>bury Barn Tavern—the road there is wide enough for two carriages—my wife and child were walking in the pathway, at the edge—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came close by the side of me as I was walking on the footpath—it was driving very fast indeed—the wheel caught the child's clothes and threw her down, and I saw both wheels pass over her—there was no other carriage in the way at the time—there was plenty of room for him to have gone without coming near the child—on the child being run over, I looked at it and said, "The child is dead"—I did not try to stop the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I called to it, but the driver drove on—I cannot tell whether he heard me—I called loud—he did not look back—I ran after him, and called out, "Stop, you have killed the child"—after calling repeatedly, "You have killed the child," he looked back—I was then running with my umbrella in my hand—he did not stop at all—he went out of my sight—I am not able to say the prisoner was the person—the child died in two or three minutes—the wheel went over the head as well as the body.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coach-master, and live in New-court, Holborn. On Monday, the 13th of July, I was in Lucas-place, St. Pancras, about two o'clock—as I passed a house, a woman, in the ground-floor room, beckoned me, and called me in—I went into the room to her, and, as soon as I got in, they demanded something to drink—I was there about five minutes—I refused to give her any thing, and wanted to come out of the house, but the door was closed—they would not let me come out of the room—there was another female in the room with her—they said I was not going out in that sort of manner, without I was going to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> something to drink, and told me to send for it there—the other girl said, "I will go and get half-a-pint, if you will send for it," but I would not—I went to pull open the door, but it was closed—I cannot tell whether it was flour or lime that was first thrown at me—a woman who was in the room then threw something in my face—it was not that woman who invited me in, but an old woman—the other woman had not said any thing to her before that—I had said I would send for nothing, but if they would come up to the corner I would not mind paying for something, but she said, "Send for it here"—I was in the act of pulling the door open when something was thrown into my face—the prisoner was the woman who did it—it burnt my face all over, and I have lost the sight of my right eye, and the other is so affected I can scarcely see at a distance—it burnt my linen and clothes—I had nothing to do with the woman in the room—it blinded me directly.</p>

I saw the prosecutor that evening—he had an incised wound over the left eye, about an inch in length—a small artery was divided, and he bled pro<lb/>fusely—it was about half an inch deep, and an inch long, or rather more—he would not remain in the hospital that night—he came next morning, and was very ill indeed—he was obliged to come into the hospital—he would have been in danger if he had continued out, but coming in averted the danger—if inflammation had followed it would have been very dangerous—he was twelve or thirteen days in the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Rumsey, and live in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoners were in his employ—I gave information to the policeman on Sunday evening, having suspicion of the prisoners for a fortnight before, to stop the cart as it was going out—about half-past six o'clock on Monday morning, the 13th of July, they stopped the cart as it was leaving our yard, and I gave the prisoners into custody for stealing fifty-two neats' feet, which are bullocks' feet—on our road to the station-house Burnett said, "Master Tarling has brought me into a pretty mess, he has completely ruined me for life"—after my return from the station-house I searched the soaking tank where the feet were placed on the Saturday—I had seen them safe on Saturday afternoon, about four o'clock—neither of the prisoners had any business with them—I believe the feet which were produced by the policeman to be those I saw on Saturday, and I missed them from the tank, but there were a great many others in the tank—I am certain some portion was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Joseph Walker, of High Holborn—the prisoner was in his service. On the evening of the 16th of July I carried a board to the prisoner's lodging, and asked him what I was to do with it, as the brass was stripped off it—Mr. Walker had dis<lb/>charged him previous to that—he then said he had sold the brass, and if I would meet him next evening, he would get it me if he possibly could—I met him next evening—he said he could not get it—he said I should find the rest of the brass in the cellar—I went down into Mr. Walker's cellar directly I returned, and found some brass where he told me I should find it—it was the property of Mr. Walker.</p>

                  </hi>. In July last I was butter to the Earl of Kinnoull, at No. 58, Green-street, Grosvenor-square, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. The prisoner was the under butler—his Lord<lb/>ship was leaving town in July—previous to his leaving it was customary to examine all the plate before it was sent to the banker's—a small portion of the plate was left behind in the house, kept in a small iron chest—on the 14th of July I told the prisoner to put all the plate out as usual, that it might be examined before it was sent to the banker's—next morning I went into the pantry—the plate was in the strong closet—the prisoner was in the pantry—I did not find the plate put out, but found one chest packed and another partly packed—I said, "I desired you to put the plate out that I might examine it before any part was put away"—he said, there was bags belonging to what was put away, and he thought it much better to put it in the chest out of the way—I asked him the contents of the chest, and as he named them I wrote them down in a memorandum book—it was the chest No. 1, which was already packed—he lifted the trays out of the chest—I saw the large things, and there was a number of small things, which I took his word that they were there as he named them—he locked that chest down, and we went on packing the other chest—I said, "Now we will put all the plate out in the pantry before any more is put away, we will have it out and examine it,—it was done—I examined it and missed the snuffer-tray—I asked him where it was—he said he would tell me after a short time—I then went on, and missed a lemon-dish and two strainers—I asked him where they were—he said he would tell me after a bit—these articles were replaced by the prisoner the same evening—I found the remainder of the plate correct as far as I examined—about twelve o'clock the same night I went into the pantry, and opened the chest No. 1, which had been packed by him—I examined them by the list he had given me, and found four salt-cellars missing, and six ladles—I examined the other chest, and found it right—next morning I went into the pantry—the prisoner came in afterwards—I told him I had a claret cork to put away, and asked him what chest we should put it into—he said, "No. 1 chest"—when this chest was opened, I said, "I did not examine the contents of this chest, it would be more satisfactory to myself, and also to you, that we should examine it"—I told him to take all the things out—I asked him if the things were in that chest according to the list, and read it down to him three times over, and he said it was correct—I then said it would be more satisfactory to examine them—they were taken out, and four salts and six ladles were missing—I asked him where the salts</p>

               <p>were—he said he had pawned them—when we missed the ladles I asked where they were—he said he had pawned them also—I told him they must he forthcoming, as the chest would leave the house at nine o'clock to go to the banker's—this was about half-past seven o'clock in the morning—he said if I would allow him an hour they should be forthcoming—I said, "Now we had much better examine the contents of the iron chest," of which he kept the key—I did so, and asked him the contents of the chest—he laid six tea-spoons and two salt-spoons down before me, and said, "That is all"—I had a list of what ought to be in it, which I received in February from his Lordship—it was quite right then—I missed twelve table-forks, six table-spoons, and six dessert forks—I asked where they were—he said he had pawned them—I told him all the plate missed must be forth-coming by nine o'clock—he said it would if I would allow him an hour, they should be produced—I consented, and he was going away to fetch it—I said, "Stop, John"—Mr. Dudfield, (who is groom of the chamber to his Lordship) went with him—they returned shortly, and the pri<lb/>soner produced one table-fork, and nine duplicates—I told him the plate must be forthcoming, for the chest must leave by nine o'clock—he said he had not the money to get them—I asked him whether he could not borrow it—he said he could not—he went away with intent to borrow it, and returned, and said he could not—I gave directions for him to be watched—he went to the pantry—I gave Mr. Dudfield a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to fetch some things out, and gave him three duplicates for the four salts and six ladles—he went and brought them—I sent him that the plate might go away at nine o'clock—this was about eight—I left the prisoner in the pantry, and while I was gone up to his Lordship's room to inform him, the prisoner went away without my permission—he was brought back by a publican, about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

I was in his service fifteen years last July—the pri<lb/>soner was under-butler—the plate was counted out by my directions, and part of it was under my examination—after the counting of the plate, in consequence of something that occurred, I went up to Lord Kin<lb/>noull to make some communication to him—I left the prisoner below—when I came back I found him gone—he was brought back by a publican named Graham, in the evening about half-past seven—I had called his atten<lb/>tion to articles missing in the plate—the prisoner said nothing to me about a saucepan—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—this is Lord Kinnoull's property—it is upwards of two years since I had seen it—I last saw it at Duplin Castle, Perth<lb/>shire—it was used in Lady Kinnoull's room—it came down stairs in a general way to be cleaned—the prisoner was at Duplin Castle, and fol<lb/>lowed the family to England two years last April—this is worth under 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the natural course of things this would come to England.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in High-street, Great Garden-street, Whitechapel—I did live in the same house with the prisoner. On the 9th of July, about twelve o'clock in the day, I went up into her room, with Maria Morris, and asked her for a box of clothes which she had of mine—she said I should not have them—she was lying on the bed at the time—the things were in the room, and I took them away, and took them down stairs to the next house—about half-an-hour after I came up again, but she was not at home—about half-past three or four o'clock I went up again, and asked her for an apron, which she had on, of mine—she refused to give it me, and I untied it—it fell off—Morris took it up, and ran down stairs with it—the prisoner took the poker and threw it after her—she then went to lie down on the bed again, and told me to go out of the room—I said I would not go out unless she gave me the things she had belonging to me—there were other things there belonging to me, which she had on at the time—she said she should not give them to me, she thought what I had had of her would very well pay me—I said, "Very well, I will go"—she said, "If you do not go out directly I will stab you"—she hit me, and I struck her again—she then took up a knife, and stabbed at my face—I put up my arm to defend my face, and my arm was cut from the wrist to the elbow—I went down stairs into the next passage, and there I fell down, and fainted away—I went to Mr. Little, a surgeon, in Leman-street.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence, written.</hi>) "Six weeks ago, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, Mary Ann Clewly, during my absence, broke open my door, and took out her box and clothes. She went away; she returned about half an hour afterwards, I had then got home, and was much sur<lb/>prised to find my door broke open. I had got an apron of her's on, which she came to fetch; I refused her to give it till she explained why she broke my door open, and took her things away, while I was out. She would not give me time to untie the apron, but tore it off, and gave it to a woman she bad brought with her, who took it and ran down stairs with it. She then struck me a violent blow on the eye, and severely scratched my face and tore my gown all to pieces. I did not return her blows, as she is a strong powerful woman. She then became calm, as I told her several times to go out of my room; my little boy came in and asked me for a piece of bread and butter, I took up the loaf and knife to cut him some, she turned round, as I thought, to go out of the room, instead of that she made an aim at me again. I held up my right arm to prevent the blow, and she struck her arm on the knife. I was so frightened I let the loaf and knife fall on the floor. She went down stairs then, I followed her down to see if she had hurt her arm much; when I found she had cut her arm I was ex<lb/>ceedingly sorry, as I only held up my arm to prevent her striking my face again. The Sunday prior to the quarrel, this woman, a total stranger to me, came and asked me to let her leave her box, and stay with me in the day-time, which I did, not knowing she was given to drink or of so vio<lb/>lent a temper. I was never accounted a bad temper or quarrelsome dispo<lb/>sition. This being my first offence, I trust you will be pleased to take my situation into consideration."</p>

On the 15th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing in the shop—I received information, and looked at a rack which was just in<lb/>side the door, and observed we had lost a parcel containing about 3000 yards of braid, which I had seen safe about ten minutes before—I have never seen it since.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 15th of July, about half-past six o'clock, I was going up Bunhill-row—I saw the three prisoners standing near Mr. Robinson's shop—I came down again in about ten minutes afterwards, and saw the three prisoners all running as fast as they could—it was then about twenty minutes before seven o'clock—Parry was running first, Fowler second, and Tucker the third, with a paper parcel under his arm—I pointed them out to the officer the next day.</p>

HORRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What kind of tobacco is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Shag—it is quite common—I came home from church a little before one o'clock—I did not see the prisoner about eight o'clock in the morning, he was gone before I came down stairs—I never saw him till I returned from church—I breakfasted about nine o'clock—he was lying down drunk at six o'clock in the evening—I think he had had part of a pot of beer with some friends—I have no garden—my bar-maid's name is Elizabeth, I can not tell her surname—I believe a person was at my house last night, inquiring the name of my bar-maid—I cannot tell when she was engaged, it is about three months—I cannot tell whether she has ever received any letters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know where the prisoner was between one and six o'clock in the evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The greater part of the time on the settle asleep—I can<lb/>not say how early in the morning he was drunk—my bar was closed, if not locked, during church time—it is locked up with shutters at night—there are two doors to it, which are opened in the day—there are sliding shutters in two grooves, they form a passage—the shutters are sixteen or eighteen inches from the ceiling—there is an entrance from the bar-parlour to the bar—I lock the outer door of the bar, and take the key up stairs—there were no marks of violence on these shutters or doors—I kept three ser<lb/>vants, altogether, the house-maid and bar-maid—this is the canister, it was quite full when I found it—I cannot tell what strength the gin in the canister was—the strong gin we buy is 22 degrees under proof—then we sweeten it—we are not obliged to put the strength of it on the cask.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not this gin some degrees beyond the strength you usually sell</p>

               <p>your gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is not below it—I cannot undertake to swear that it is the same strength as any gin I sold that Sunday—we have gin of different strength, according to the price—I sell British gin and hollands—we have it at 22 degrees, and the cordial gin at 17 degrees—this is the same strength as the cordial gin I sold on that Sunday—I can only go by the taste—I had a man in my house named Sale, but he is gone away—he applied to me for a bed, and I would not let him sleep there—I do not know whe<lb/>ther it was Sunday night or not, but he was never in the house afterwards, he was not in the house when the prisoner came home drunk—it was most likely after this discovery that I told Sale he should not sleep there—he never slept in the room after Saturday night—I never saw him again till after the prisoner was in custody—I never saw him on the Sunday—I said he should not sleep there, because I thought probably there might be some<lb/>thing wrong with Sale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you drink out of your stock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not suppose I sent out for what I drank—I have not taken account of what I and my family drank.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But allowing for what you took, you have missed gin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I desired Sale not to come there any more.</p>

On the 1st of July, about five o'clock, I saw the two prisoners going down Ratcliff-highway—Morgan was carrying a parcel in front of him—I looked at him, and followed him down to a marine-store shop at the corner of Chigwell-hill, kept by Bar<lb/>nard—I looked through the window, and saw the two prisoners in front of the counter, and the lead lying on the counter—I went and asked the prisoners where they got it from—both said, "I brought it from my own home"—I asked if they objected to go to the station-house—they said, "No"—we went, and in going along, they said they bought the lead of a man two years ago, who was gone to Van Diemen's-land—this weighs 10 lbs. 8 oz.—I afterwards went to Fleur-de-lis-court, and fitted the lead to the roof—it corresponds exactly.</p>

On the morning of the 16th of August I was in Edgeware-road about seven o'clock—I saw Bull go to the stable of No. 1, Canterbury-villas, with an empty bag under his arm—I saw Sayers come out of the stable, and look round—he saw me, and went round a corner directly—I continued on the watch, and saw Bull come out with something in a bag on his shoulder—I am sure it was empty when he took it in—I asked him what he had got—he said, "Oh, you can look, I have been to feed the nags"—it was two pecks of oats—I said, "I saw you go to No. 1, Canterbury-villas, and you came out with this"—he then said, "Yes, I have been to borrow it of the coachman"—I took him to the station-house, and went to the stable, where I saw Sayers—I told him he was in my custody for taking oats, which Bull had carried away—he said he had taken none away that morning—he afterwards said a man had been to leave half a bushel of corn, which Bull had called for—I have brought a sample of the oats from the bin in the stable, and they correspond with what Bull was carrying.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in Charles-street, Manches<lb/>ter-square—I went to the prisoner on the 22nd of June—I had often seen him before, but had not seen him then for perhaps a week—I did not order any bricks of him on the 22nd, but I saw some on his wharf, and asked him if he dealt in bricks—he said he dealt in any thing—I asked what</p>

               <p>he wanted for those bricks—he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a thousand—I asked him if they were delivered or fetched for that—he said delivered, I said very well, and told him I would take ten thousand if I had room to put them—he asked me if he should send me in five hundred that morning—I said, "No"—I did not tell him that I wanted bricks in a hurry and could not send as far as Boyle's field for them, nor any thing of the kind—I did not mention any place—he had been employed by me to fetch rubbish frequently—on the next day, the 23rd, I ordered him to send some carts for my rubbish, but I did not order any bricks—I cannot say, whether he sent any thing with the carts that day as I did not see them—I did not receive any bricks—nor have any been delivered on my premises at any time—there are five hundred bricks or more for what I know, deposited adjoining my premises, but not on them—they are put against a public house wall—they are marked with a crown I believe—I had not ordered any bricks to be sent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a refiner and foreign money-changer, in princes-street, Soho. On Monday, the 6th of July, a man of the name of Davies came to me, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—he produced this note for 1000 francs, and wished it changed—I requited a name and address, and got one—I had received information from the pro<lb/>secutor that a robbery of French notes had been committed—I refused to give him the money, but proposed to send to the house to which he had given the address—Davies then said it was not his name and address, but the name and address of the man who sent him—he said his name was Da<lb/>vies, a publican in the neighbourhood—I declined to part with the note—he said he should send the man who owned it—I said, "Very well," and he left the shop—he came back in about an hour, and the prisoner with him—Davies said, "This is the man who owns the note"—the prisoner did not say any thing—he neither denied nor owned that he was the person—he heard what Davies said—the prisoner then said, "I shall have no ob<lb/>jection to go with you to Berners-street"—I had told Davies, the hour be<lb/>fore, that I had had information of the robbery having been committed on a gentleman living in Berners-street—Davies, on that, asked me if I would give him a written acknowledgment that I had detained the note—I said, "Yes"—while I was writing it the officer entered, and they all went out together—I went before the Magistrate—Davies was admitted to bail, and did not come back.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am the wife of Charles John Aistrop, who keeps the King's Arms public-house, Gray's Inn-lane, in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn. On Friday evening, the 26th of June, I had been out, and when I came home I desired my niece to take my bonnet and shawl up stairs—I went up to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock that night—my bed-room is on the second floor, over the parlour—it was not locked—the room under mine is used as a parlour for the customers—when I got up I found my bonnet on the drawer, but no shawl there—I did not particularly look any further that night, but next morning I looked</p>

               <p>about more particularly, and missed from the drawers a pin-cushion, the shawl, and a garnet and pearl brooch, with one stone out—I looked into a large chest, which I do not often go to, and missed a large green silk dress, and cape, and a white crape shawl, and out of the drawer a pair of kerseymere small clothes, a waistcoat and two silk handkerchiefs—one shawl is worth three guineas—the value of all the articles is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at least—I gave information, and was shown some of the articles on the following Monday—I had seen the male prisoner several times at our house—he used to come two or three times a week—I saw him there that evening, about half-past seven o'clock, and a female with him—I saw him go out of the house about ten o'clock—there was a female waiting up stairs in the parlour for him—I passed the parlour as I went up stairs, and could see the female in it, but could not identify her.</p>

I think—here is an entry of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but that is a new bill—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the amount she owed me after the 28th of February. On the 15th of April there ought to have been credit given for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this entry of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is in his handwriting, showing the sum actually due from her, but more coals had then been had—I told him the draft of the agreement did not meet my views, and in consequence of the many defalcations I had found since it would not suit me—he said it did not agree with his habits to come so much to the counting-house, and he wanted something where he was more at liberty—I said on one occasion I should require him to continue in my service on certain conditions, and if it was not so I should prose<lb/>cute him—I do not think I told him that unless he entered into this agree<lb/>ment I would prosecute him—I should be afraid to swear I did not, but it is the impression on my mind—I entered the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week which I stopped out of his wages in my driblet book, which is here—I have not stopped more than 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—here is an entry of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 25th of July—I had forgotten that, but still the amount is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner object to your making this deduction as more than you were entitled to make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not—he never said that he had made a mistake with regard to Mrs. Draper's 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—up to the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> These deficiencies of account were always entered as errors, I be<lb/>lieve? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I had my thoughts on the subject—I did not write "Em<lb/>bezzle, embezze, embezzle," every week in the books—these entries are my handwriting—they are entries of monies which I charge the prisoner as being deficient with—the prisoner told me he had gone through this ac<lb/>count, and he has written "Paid" to a good many that he has not paid to me—he admitted that—these black figures are my writing, and these red ones also—the prisoner was not present when I put them, nor was I present when he made these memorandums in pencil—here is an entry of "Spencer 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., see his own list"—that he had entered it as 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and in a list which I had made out he charged himself with 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think I pointed out that error to him, and he said he had got the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had a list of 137 cases, where he admitted to me he had embezzled money—here is "Coffin 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

                  </hi>. I am an aeronaut, and live in the neighbourhood of Poland-street. On the 5th of August I was in No. 1, Upper John-street, Golden-square, about one o'clock—I taw both the prisoners there—soon after I got there I saw a wagon with a tilt over it come to the door—I was at the door of the house—several men were in the wagon—I saw the younger prisoner, and the elder prisoner was on the opposite side of the way—at that time all the goods that had been taken were removed, and the van come back for more, but none were taken—I had seen both the prisoners helping to unload the wagon in Poland-street—that was about half-past twelve o'clock—they were taking out a considerable num<lb/>ber of doors, windows, cupboards, wainscoting, and shutters—the walls of this house are very good—it wants repairing and pointing—there can be no pretence for taking the brick-work down—I should think the house is more valuable standing than to be taken down—I have had no conver<lb/>sation with the elder prisoner on the subject since this—several times before this happened I have had conversations with him—he knew as well as I did that the property did not belong to the Chadwick property (Mr. Fenelly, his adviser, knows it very well) he has several times said himself that it did not belong to the Chadwick property—I have heard him say so many times—it was a tilted wagon from which I saw the prisoners un<lb/>loading the things—I did not notice whether there was any name on it—I mustered up a number of men to prevent further dilapidations.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Mr. Wyatt, who had part of this house. I do not remember Mr. George being tenant of the house—on the 5th of Au<lb/>gust, my father was in Whitecross-street prison—I was at the house on Wed<lb/>nesday the 5th of August, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, the bell rang, my mother opened the door, and in came Chadwick the younger—I said to him, "What are you going to do? who are you?"—he said, "I will tell you all about it"—I ran directly to get my brother and all the friends I could—there was a tilted van—about two persons fought against me and my brother, but there were about a dozen and a half that took away the fire-grates, windows, partitions, and put them into the van—the partitions and windows were fixed, and formed part of the house—they severed them, and took them away—they cleared the way with crow-bars—they were damaged in taking down—the sashes had been removed from the first-floor up to the second before, and they carried them off—I saw two of the men fall through the window, and break them in the cart—they were all carousing together—I saw the elder prisoner at a public-house, and he came over the way—I cannot say whether he interfered in the removal of any of the things—he was a witness to it—he was standing opposite—he put his hand to his nose at our party—I was inside the house, and could not look at him—I had quite sufficient to do to keep my own head on my shoulders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he wave his hand to any body, or any thing of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he did not attempt to put his hand on me or any one else—he was quiet enough—I have had a little refreshment to-day—I am quite sober now—I have lived in this house six years altogether, full—there were other lodgers in the house besides our family—my father was a lodger—he paid rent for living there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Why, I dare say the last—why rent, you know, has been disputed for some time—I will swear he has paid rent for living there to my knowledge—I remember George living there when I was a boy, but not in the time my father took it—it is eight or nine years ago that I remember George living in it, when he kept a saddler's shop there—I cannot tell how long since he left it—it is more than five years—I dare say about seven, but excuse me, I do not know so much about it as my brothers do, because I have not been there—I have been in service—I was footman to the late Judge, Sir John Vaughan. The house was in a very bad state of repair latterly—it was not tenantable—I do not think it has been tenantable for the last three years—my father and mother lived in the attics—I have often</p>

               <p>seen Mr. Chadwick there—I cannot "ay how long it is ago that I first saw him there—it might be two or three years—he did not inquire of me whe<lb/>ther it had belonged to Sir Andrew Chadwick—I did not hear him inquire of ray father—I cannot tell whether my father has been very much engaged about Sir Andrew's property—my father was clerk of St. James's Church—I think he ceased to be so in 1823—he is here to-day, outside—I do not know that he very much interested himself about Sir Andrew's pro<lb/>perty—I never heard him tell the prisoner that the house belonged to Sir Andrew.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold chaser, and live in Wildermess<lb/>row. On the 1st of July I was a passenger in the <hi rend="italic">Princess Victoria</hi> steamer going to Gravesend—we got to Greenwich about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning—I observed a boat bringing passengers on board from Greenwich—it came on the Kent side of the steamer—on the Isle of Dog's side, at least the north side—I cannot say whether the boat was hooked to the steamer—one young lady came on board from the boat—I saw another young lady in the act of coming on board from the boat, but the steam boat went on, the paddle-wheel went round and filled the boat with water in an instant—I heard the words "Let go," and "Goon," almost together—"Let go" was said first—before the words "Let go" were said the boat appeared to me to be hooked to the steamer, though I cannot say whether it was—the second young lady was stepping on the ladder—she fell back into the boat—the boat was filled with water, and the waterman the boy, and the deceased were in it, besides the lady—the boat was un<lb/>hooked then—it floated some distance from us, although it was full of water—I then saw the deceased and his sister struggling in the water, although in the boat, and the deceased, I suppose, must have slipped over the boat, and sunk to rise no more—I cannot say whether I saw him in the water—I do not know who gave the command of "Let go," and "Go on"—the lady who did come on board was assisted by somebody on board she was almost pulled up the steps—I should think the boat floated thirty or forty yards from the steamer before I missed the deceased—I cannot exactly judge—there was a sailing-barge a-head of us, coming towards us—I</p>

               <p>should think she was thirty or forty yards from us—we had quite stopped—I am frequently on the water—I think the barge would have struck the steamer if we had not gone on—I did not see another steamer behind the barge.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are not acquainted with the mode of acting under certain emergencies on the water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know whether it was a wherry that came alongside—it was a larger boat than I often see on the Thames—it was a waterman's boat—the barge was coming down in a direction towards the side on which the boat was—we were near the north shore—the skiff was not capsized—there were five persons in the boat, one of whom came on board—the steamer had stopped before the boat came alongside, I am quite sure of that—I did not see any hook in any body's hands—the barge was sailing—she was coming up with the wind—we were going with the tide, and she was coming against it, I believe, I am not certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the barge <hi rend="italic">Mary,</hi> which was coming towards the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>—the tide waft with us—when nearly opposite Greenwich I saw the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> going on—I observed her stop, and saw a wherry go alongside—I did not see the lady get out—I saw the boat hooked to the steamer, but did not see her afterwards till she was sunk—the hooking was done by the steamer—the <hi rend="italic">Emerald</hi> steam-boat came up by the side of us, and hit us about the quarter-mast, and carried away our mizen-mast—she was coming up close behind us before the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> stopped, and at the time the boat was hooked on to the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> she struck us—we were about twenty yards from the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> at that time, inside, to the north—if the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> had not moved there was danger of our running against her, we should have hit her on the larboard quarter, and struck her—we were on the same side of the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> as the wherry—I do not think the boat would have been in danger from us, according to my judgment—we should have struck the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> further abaft than where the boat was—by her going on, that collision was avoided—we cleared every thing—I saw the lady and gentleman in the water.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the boat hooked on, or held on by a man en board the steamer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hooked on by a hook belonging to the steamer—ours is a seventy-ton barge, and was loaded with forty tons of loam—I think we should have struck the steamer abaft on her quarter, about half a boat's length from the boat—if I am deceived in my calculation, and we had struck the boat, it must have been crashed, and every body in it have been killed—the <hi rend="italic">Emerald</hi> striking us helped us round—we were about twenty feet from the stern of the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>—I could almost have reached her with a hook—I should think the steamer had been nearly a minute in motion at that time.</p>

               <p>sunk my boat in an instant, it filled her in an instant—the hook was let go—it unhooked itself, but the hook was fast when the steamer went on—we sunk even with the water's edge—I held fast to the boat—the boat did not sink to the bottom of the river—the lady and Mr. Whistler were washed out of the boat, and the gentleman was lost—the lady was saved—it was spring-tide, and blowing hard from the westward—we generally hold our hat up, or sometimes our hand, when we want to come on board—when we have got our passengers on board we say, "All right"—I had not done so in this case—I had two more to deliver—the gentleman and lady who were left in the boat rose up, but never came forward in the boat—when I found the boat sinking I told them to sit down—mine is a large boat—I have had 26cwt. of ballast in her, besides four grown people—the tide and wind were opposed to each other—in my judgment, the barge was about fifty or sixty yards from the steamer when it went on—if the steamer had not gone on I should have been safe, and my passengers too—we should not have been at all in danger from the barge that was coming—she might have struck the steam-boat on her quarter astern of my boat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How much astern of your boat would she have struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a boat's length, I cannot exactly say—it would not have been so little as half a boat's length—it was blowing what is called half a gale of wind—there was an Irish boat coming down the river, and one had passed before—they had created a swell—I did not think I was in an awkward situation when I went alongside the steamer, not till I was alongside, and then I saw it—I said to the passengers, "For God's sake, be as quick as you can, for the barge will be into us"—that was when the lady was getting out, when I came alongside at first—Captain Fairbairn as on the paddle-box—he was in a situation to see the boat—I did not hear him call to the man at the boat's head, "Let go"—I think the steamer went on to save herself from the barge striking her on the quarter—I did not see the mizen-mast of the barge go.</p>

Miller on the 10th of July, took me down to King-street, and gave Whitewood into my custody—I said, "Whitewood, I want you for having more wood in your cart than you ought to have"—he very civilly went back with me, and said he had six feet in his cart, that he had paid for five feet, and he was going to pay the boy for the other foot on the Saturday night, and he had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I asked him how it was, as he had so much money on him, that he had not paid for the other foot—he said he owed Odey 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he would pay the boy on Saturday night.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 2nd of August, I went into the Coach and Horses public-house, Lam<lb/>beth, and had two glasses of gin and water with another gentleman—I was returning home between half-past eleven and twelve o'clock, and was in High-street, on a parallel with Lambeth-walk—I was not affected with liquor when I went into the Coach and Horses—the prisoner was there while I was there—some of the company were talking about Ireland—one of them referred to me, and I jokingly replied, "I like Ireland," or "I like the boys, for I consider myself half an Irishman"—the prisoner ad<lb/>dressed himself to me, and called me a b——impostor, or something, and I said he was a dirty carpenter for swearing—I afterwards called for liquor, for the purpose of making peace, but the landlord refused to serve it, and I left the house instantly, at his request—after leaving I saw two persons opposite, and spoke to them—as I walked direct towards my own home, I heard a footstep by the side of me, and the prisoner, on the instant, struck me on the front of my head, and I fell—I had my hat on—I lost my senses—when I came a little to myself I was in a doctor's shop, but lost myself again after that, and found myself in bed at my lodging.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the last witness's daughter. I am a folder at a bookbinder's—I remember the last Saturday that we were at the lodging in Old-street—I did not go to work that day—I was at home—I was not able to go, as I was ill—I was at home the whole day—I saw the prisoner that morning about nine o'clock—she was in the passage walking from her room to ours—she was about her work—she is a willow bonnet-shape maker—I saw her at work for a few minutes in her own room—I saw her in my mother's room between one and two o'clock—I cannot say that I saw her from nine till between one and two—I did not see her dressing for going out any where—she had no dress—I mean she had no change—she appeared in a poor miserable state—I cannot tell what she came into our room for between one and two—I saw her in the even<lb/>ing between seven and eight—she was then ill, and sitting by our window—she did not then present any appearance of change in her dress, or as if she had been out—I did not see her with money or in any change of cir<lb/>cumstances after that time—she went to bed that night earlier than usual, and had a very poor supper.</p>
