                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> All I can say is that the book I bought was bought some time before 17th October, and I am only guided to that fact by the entry in this book—I knew the prisoner to be a reviewer and an author—it is not an uncommon thing for leading men when they have done with books to sell them—during the time I have known the prisoner he has been in the habit of buying and selling books at our place—I am a very small book buyer in the law department—I was here in another case last Session—I bought about thirty books, all odd volumes (<hi rend="italic">See</hi> "Reg <hi rend="italic">v</hi> Westall, "p.287)—I have a branch business in the Strand, managed by my partner; they buy odd volumes there also—I did not notice that there had been a book label inside at the time I bought the book—I have had a good many dealings in the six months since October—the conversation between me and the prisoner was in December, four months ago—it does not appear in writing from whom I bought this odd volume; I do not keep any book of that kind—in point of fact, save and except a question of memory, I have nothing to refer to as to whom I bought the book of—I took no memorandum of the conversation when the prisoner called on me—I think my boy was there—the prisoner was very indignant, but he did not deny selling it to me—he did not mention Stevens &amp; Sons, I did; he may have said "I have received an extraordinary letter from Messrs. Stevens," I don't know—he did not say what had become of it; he did not produce any letter—I have no doubt he asked me what the name of the book was; I do not remember what he said—he did not say that he had mislaid the letter, and wanted to know what the name of the book was—he said that he had called about a letter he had received from Stevens &amp; Sons, and asked me what the name of the book was—he had not the letter in his hand—I told him that the name was "Sickel's Reports, "2nd volume—it was then that he said to me "Where is the book 1"—I said that I had returned it—he said "You</p>

                  </hi>. I am librarian to the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple—in October last Mr. Forsyth was the treasurer—in the ordinary course the books from Messrs. Stevens &amp; Sons would be collated and stamped, and put on the shelves—I was away, and did not return till 21st October—Mr. Pickering, the sub-librarian, would be there—I have seen the mode in which books are delivered from Stevens &amp; Sons; if it is a law book it is immediately collated and stamped—on 7th December Mr. Pickering received the bill produced, from Messrs. Stevens &amp; Sons for the deliveries up to that date, and called my attention to the entry in it of the 2nd Vol. of "Sickel's Reports"—I then went to the place where it would be kept, and it was not in the library—it is the rule that members attending there shall sign their names when they go in or when they go out—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the attendance-book—it shows that the prisoner was at the library on the 5th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th of October, and from that date his signature does not appear again till November 4th—I have looked through, and have not been able to find it—he was there on 7th December, and not afterwards—this letter, dated 17th December, is in the prisoner's writing—members of the Inn who use the library bring in their hats, coats, and bags; there is no restriction on what they bring in or what they take out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-librarian at the Inner Temple—Mr. Martin was absent in October, up to the 21st—I was there the whole of October—on 7th December I received this invoice, and pro<lb/>ceeded to examine it with the books which had been delivered; I found that they were all right, with the exception of "Sickel's Reports"—I find by my own writing that the "Maritime Oases" were delivered on October 11th, and the "Central Criminal Court Sessions Papers" on October 14th—none are entered on the 12th—here is no entry of the 2nd Vol. of "Sickel's Reports"—that is the only book missing—there were workmen employed at the library during October.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If the 2nd Vol of "Sickel's Reports" had been deli<lb/>vered on 12th October would it appear in this book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there would be an entry, "12th October, 2nd Vol.'Sickel's Reports, '" if it came to my hands, and there is no such entry—Stevens &amp; Sons would put the Arms of the Temple in it—that is the rule.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I opened the parcel I should collate it and stamp it—having found the book perfect it was my duty to put a red stamp on it—from the fact of their being no entry and no stamp, I can say that I never received it—I am sometimes a long way from the table; it is a long series of rooms—there is no knocking, anybody can come into the library and deliver things—anybody can come in and walk up stain, right into the library.</p>

               <p>previous to that I saw the deceased challenge him to fight—he then put his barge's head across, and went in and had a round or scuffle—they fell nearly together—the prisoner was uppermost—they were then out of my sight, as I was in a loaded barge and they were in empty barges, but directly Smith recovered himself he jumped up and kicked the prisoner in the lower part of his body—the prisoner sat down as if in great pain for a few minutes—the prisoner then came back to his barge's head, and the prisoner threw a tack at him—he threw it back again—I don't think that hurt either of them—Smith picked it up again, and threatened if he dared to come there what ho would do to him—the prisoner then picked up another similar piece of wood, and went over to Smith's barge—they had a scuffle, a sparring match, you might term it, and Smith struck the prisoner with this piece of wood in the side—they each had a piece of wood in their baud—the prisoner did not retaliate with his piece; be threw it down, and struck Smith with his fist—when Smith recovered himself again he still had this in his hand, and he was going to do something, aiming or going to strike the prisoner—the prisoner took hold of it and they had a scuffle for the possession of it, and on the impulse of the moment, just as the prisoner got hold of it, he struck him in that way, and that was the end of it—he did not throw it at him—he was clone to him—Smith was endeavouring to strike him with it, and the prisoner took hold of it—ho was in danger of being struck—he was struck once with it when it was in Smith's hand.</p>

I am publisher of the "Beehive" newspaper, 10, Bolt Court, Fleet Street—the office is one room on the ground floor—no person uses the office besides myself—Mr. King's office is on the other side of the passage—the prisoner his been employed at the "Beehive" about five years, to write wrappers for "Beehive "newspapers, and to sell the "Bee<lb/>hive" on Friday and Saturday, and do necessary work—he was the only clerk I had—there was no person in the office but the prisoner and mys el</p>

               <p>—previous to May last I had been in the habit of receiving orders on the Fleet Street post-office, and up to a certain period I sent the prisoner with them to get them cashed after I had signed them, and bring the cash to me—in consequence of something occurring I changed that arrangement—an order or two had been lost and cashed, and I requested the parties at the post-office not to pay any more of my orders through the window to any person, but to cash them through a bank crossed—that arrangement was made in May, 1872, and was continued up to the present day—from that time I have not entrusted the prisoner with any post-office orders to cash at Fleet Street—he had no authority to open my letters or to sign I my name—the office was fastened at night by Mr. King, who is later in the house than others; he shuts the door when he leaves and puts a padlock on it—the prisoner comes at 9 a.m., except on Friday, when he is supposed to be there at 5 o'clock, in order to publish the paper for the country—he ought to sort the letters and lay mine on the desk, and lay any others in the office—he never handed me Mr. Towers' letter Containing two post<lb/>office orders—I never received it—these signatures on the Fleet Street orders are not mine, nor is the form addressed to the postmaster in Fleet Street, to have substituted orders sent to 29, St. James's Walk, Clerkenwell—I know nothing of 29, St. James's Walk.</p>

Towers, "to the Lombard Street orders to be in the prisoner's writing—about 23rd or 26th February I heard from Mr. Broadhurst that the letters had miscarried, and we sent down to Birmingham, and Butler was placed in the office—Hard was with me on the 25th March.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are ten rooms in the house, but the prisoner was only in one room, which was the office of the "Beehive"—one door leads into the passage, and another into the court—there is a letter-box in both—the morning letters for the whole house are put into the outer door, and it is the prisoner's duty to sort them, but not to distribute them—he lays mine on my desk and keeps the others back, and the clerk from up stairs takes them—one person does not have the ten rooms up stairs—one gentle<lb/>man, Mr. Pratt, up stairs, had his letters delivered with mine in the morn<lb/>ing—they were not very numerous—I inhabit the other rooms for my editorial work—Mr. King's letters go into his own private box—I very rarely open the box myself, unless I am going away by an early train—King is an advertising agent—Pratt is a gentleman, and is part proprietor of the "Christian World, "and chairman and director of several companies—he lives at Brighton and seldom comes before 11 o'clock—I go there at 9.15 or 9.30—I am sometimes in the country on my own business—I am not fond of other people's business—my opinion is beyond all doubt that these documents are in the prisoner's writing, but in a feigned hand.</p>

Towers, "to the Lombard Street orders, are also in the prisoner's writing, I should say there is very little deviation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The writing resembles the prisoner's ordinary natural writing—I come at 10 a.m., and on Saturdays from 6 o'clock to 7—I have borrowed the prisoner's key to let myself in, but not this year or last—it is twelve months since I worked there at night—I never get there now till 10 on Saturdays, or any other days—Mr. Pratt is a publisher and part pro<lb/>prietor of papers—he used to assist Mr. Potter in the publication of the "Beehive"—he has been dead three weeks—there is a letter-box in every door of the house—the door is opened at 9, and if the postman comes and the door is open, he brings the letters up stairs—nobody sleeps on the pre<lb/>mises—there is no housekeeper.</p>

               <p>I was in the service of Mr. Auckinvole, who trades under the firm of Johnson and Fairie, and has business premises at Glasgow, Bradford, and 19, Old Change—I am employed as salesman at 19, Old Change—he is a yarn merchant—I have been in his service twelve months—we occupied the first floor—the prisoner Prout had an office there as well, on the second floor—he was there before I was—I have known him about six years—on 30th December I had in coburgs, cords, alpacas, and flannels for the purpose of selling—the coburgs, cords, and alpacas were worth 435<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the flannels 118<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 30th December a person named Stevens called on me, and wanted to see ray Bradford goods; before that he had placed two or three memo<lb/>randa in my letter-box, saying that he wanted to see me; they were generally put in at the time I went to dinner—I showed him the goods—Prout was present and assisted me in showing them—I asked him who he was repre<lb/>senting, and Stevens said he was the buyer for Paul Henwood, of Lime Street, and their shipping office was at 154, Leadenhall Street—Prout wrote that on a piece of paper at the time he was leaving—Stevens looked at the goods, and I told him my price for them—after I had shown him the different numbers, he offered me a farthing a yard less to clear the lot—I told him that I could not do so until I had communicated with my people in Brad<lb/>ford, and then Prout reminded me of a letter I had had from them to say that I could take a farthing a yard less, which I had forgotten at the time—he wrote on a piece of paper "Do you recollect the letter?"—I don't know what has become of that—I destroyed it with my letters—I read the memorandum, and I then remembered I had received a letter to that effect—I had previously shown that letter to Prout—I then told Stevens that he could have the goods; that applied to the coburgs, cords, and alpacas—after that, as he was going out, I asked him if he was a buyer of flannels—he said he could buy them if the price was right—I showed him the flannels and Prout assisted me—he said he would let me know the next day, he could not agree to take them then—he came the next morning and said he would take them—I asked him then for a reference, and he referred me to Cook, Sons, &amp; Co., and told me he could give me several if I wanted them—that was a reference for Paul Henwood—he rather laughed at the idea of my asking him for a reference—I told him I should not send the goods until I had a reference—the reference was very good—on the following day Stevens came in again and told me how he wished them to be packed, and asked when I could get them ready—I asked him how long he could give me, and he said "Till 4 o'clock"—Prout was there—I asked Stevens if he would give me till 4.30, as I could not get them done, and Prout offered to assist me in packing them—I said I would try and get them in by then—Prout did not come to assist me at the time until nearly 4 o'olook or a little after, so I was behind in getting them ready—I had been packing them up in the meantime—Prout assisted me when he came—Stevens came again about 5 o'clock or 5.30; the goods were not all packed by that time—he asked me why I had not sent them—I told him I was unable to get them ready, and that I could not get them ready till 6 o'clock—he left and came in again in about a quarter of an hour—Prout and I had continued packing—it was then nearly 6 o'clock—I told him I could not promise them till the next morning, as the waggons were busy to go north and south of London for their regular customers—Stevens said he must have them that night—I told him I could not do impossibilities, if I could not get a waggon of course I could not deliver them—he looked at his watch and said it was just 6, and one of</p>

               <p>Paul Henwood's waggons would be in Leadenhall Street, as they had three or four waggons of their own—I referred to Prout, and asked him what he thought of it, and he said it would be a very good idea if he wanted them that evening, as he could not have them without—Stevens went away, and came back with a man and a waggon a little after 6—we had finished the packing then—Clegg was the carman of the van—Stevens came up with the man and said "Those are the goods, take them down and put them in the van"—Prout was there then and his brother-in-law—the carman took the first lot down, and Prout followed him with some more—his brother-in<lb/>law took some down as well—I was going to take them, but Prout sug<lb/>gested that the man should keep in the waggon; they would take them down and I should get them ready for them to take—Prout and his brother<lb/>in-law carried the goods down—the carman, after the first time, remained down stairs—I delivered the goods in that way—after they had taken two or three loads down I asked Prout to ask Stevens whether there was any occasion for them to be signed for, as I had a book for that purpose—when he came up again for some more goods he said Stevens said there was no occasion, as it was Paul Henwood's own van and carman—that satisfied me as I had had a good reference—the goods were all delivered in that way—Prout and his brother-in-law took about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes to take them down—Stevens was at the tail end of the van and the carman was stowing the goods away—I did not make put any invoice as the goods came from Bradford; I sent my list of what I had sold, and it would come up from Bradford—after the goods were carried down, Prout and his brother-in-law remained in my room a few minutes and then left. Stevens went with the waggon—I afterwards saw the whole of the goods at Burton's sale rooms at the Broadway, Ludgate Hill, on the 15th January—they are the same goods—before that, on the 5th or 6th, I wrote a letter to 154, Leadenhall Street, the address which was given as the shipping office—I addressed it to Stevens—he said I should always find him there if I wanted to write—I did not get any answer, and I went there myself on the 16th—I found 154 was Deacon's Reading Rooms, and my letter was lying there unopened—I went to 12, Lime Street—I found that there were business premises there, but that they had never ordered the goods—I had not been in the habit of selling goods to shippers—Prout had suggested that I should go round amongst the shippers—I did not hear from Stevens how he came to me—two or three days after the goods had gone, Prout spoke to me about commission, as he had brought the man to me—I said, "You did not bring him, he came by himself, "that was all that was said—Prout and I used to live together in the same house of business, that is how I knew him—he used to sell some of my goods, and was very often in my place—he went down to Cornwall, and I received this letter from him on the 17th or 18th January—when I found the goods were wrong I had written to him—I said "You know as much about the goods as I do, you had better come up, "and this was his answer—"New Quay, Cornwall, Sunday. Dear John, I am astounded at the contents of your letter; will be, if possible, on Tuesday morning in London. I was required down to see my mother, who is ill and wants to make her will. Will be with you as soon as possible. By G—! if I had thought he was a swindler what would I have done with him! I should like to be with you now. Cheer up, I shall most likely find him out. I shall know him again when I see him; he was someone who understood the trade, by the way he handled</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187304070039"/>
               <p>and looked at the goods. I am sorry for you, yet you could not help it; I should have done the same if I was in your place. References first-class, what more was there wanted? If I get the will made to-morrow, I will be with you on Tuesday. Cheer up all you can." I know Prout's writing very well, and have seen him write—this invoice of Hall &amp; Co. is in his writing—I should not have parted with my goods unless I had thought it was a true story about Henwood, and the shipping office, and all about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. I had sold goods for Prout on several occasions, and I had sold him goods for my employers—the last amount was over 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have sold him goods for the last four or five months—he has had credit and he has paid—the last payment was in January, after this affair—I never received the money—it was sent down to Bradford—I think it was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he is still indebted about 170<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods sold to him—he was in the habit of coming to my office nearly every day—he has never assisted me in packing before—my goods have generally come from the manufacturers to the wholesale houses and have not been delivered at my office at all—he had no opportunity before this of assisting me in packing—he used to take my goods out and sell them, and he had 2 1/2 per cent, for what he sold—he has not sold a great deal; to the amount of some hundreds, I dare say—the commission would come from Bradford to him, not through me—no doubt that would be taken off his account—he was in the office when Stevens first came—we had just come in from din<lb/>ner—we generally went to dine together—I had never seen Stevens before, and as far as I could judge Prout had not—he remained about half-an<lb/>hour the first time—Prout was present all the time, and we talked the matter over after Stevens left—I had the reference to Cook's the next morning—I had the name Paul Henwood—I know now it is a well known name in the trade, but I did not know it then—Prout did not remain long after Stevens left—I don't think I saw him again that day—it was on the first occasion he wrote something on a piece of paper and handed to me—a reduction of a farthing a yard is a very common thing to clear a large quantity—Prout came to the office the next morning for a short time, in the usual way—Stevens did not come the next day, but on the 1st January—he came early in the morning—Prout was there; he came in afterwards—he merely said "Good morning" to Stevens—they did not seem to be acquainted—it was on that day the goods were loaded in the way I have told you—I say that this invoice is in Prout's writing—the "January" I believe to be his—the other part is disguised, but I believe it to be his writing—the figures are like his figures—I can't point out any other resemblance to his writing except in the top part and the figures—the word "January" is more like his style of writing—the figures are joined together in his usual way of making them, but there is nothing particular about that—I was given into custody on this charge at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Stephen Baker, a carman, of 263, Hoxton Street—on the evening of the 1st January, between 5 and 6, somebody came and hired a van—he saw my master—he said he wanted a covered van to move some goods from Old Change—I had a covered van, with two horses—I went to 19, Old Change—I don't know who the man was—he rode beside me—when we got there I went up stairs to the first floor with him—there were some goods and three or four men there—I went down to the van again, and Prout and another man brought the goods down and I packed them in the van—the man who hired the van told me to drive to the Amherst Road, Hackney, and then he would show me where to go—when we got there he pointed out a private house, five or six doors from the Fairlie Hotel, and said "Go there and leave the goods, "and he went away—he said he had had a few words with a gentleman who was there, and he did not wish to see him—as I was driving to the house Prout met me in his shirt sleeves and said "Follow me"—I knew him again as the man who had brought down the goods at Old Change—he led the way and I drove the van into the back gates of the Fairlie Hotel into the yard—he said I was to unload there—he and three or four others assisted to unload—some of the goods were taken into the house and some were left in the yard—Prout asked me how much there was to pay for the hire of the van—I said "10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as agreed"—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my master and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for myself—it was a heavy load—after I was paid I drove home—after a short time, from what I heard, I gave a description of the men to Spittle, the officer—I am quite sure Prout is the man who paid me, and one of the two who brought the goods down—I have an idea that. Chapman helped to unload—I believe he was there.</p>

On 11th January this matter was put into my hands, and on the 15th I found that the geods were deposited at Burton's, Ludgate Hill—in consequence of what Mr. Burton said, Chapman was sent for—he has a basement room in Chiswell Street—his name is up there—he is described there as an agent to a coal merchant—there were a few wine bottles and empty cases in the room—I remained at Burton's some time, and Chapman came there—I asked him from whom he had received the goods he brought to Mr. Burton's—he said "I bought them of a man named Hall"—I asked dim what he paid for them—he said 450<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them and two bales which he had not received—I asked him how he paid for them—he looked at Mr. Burton and said "With your cheques"—he had previously shown me this invoice—I asked Mr. Burton to let me see the cheques—he produced three cheques, one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and another for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., all dated 8th January—seeing the receipt to the invoice was dated the 7th, I remarked to Chapman, "Why, these cheques are dated the 8th, and your invoice is the 7th of January"—he said "I have paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account on the 7th, and the rest on the following day"—a day or two after I saw him at his place of business, 2, Chiswell Street, and I asked him to let me see the book containing the entries of this transaction—he showed me this book, and an entry of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to <hi rend="italic">C.</hi> Hall and Co. on the 7th January—I said "This is for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only"—he said "Oh, there is 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dis<lb/>count"—he pointed out an entry lower down, under the head of Thursday, January 8th, Messrs.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner.</hi>) I have pleaded guilty to this charge of stealing 600 ostrich feathers from Messrs. Blundell &amp; Son, my employers—I was with them about twelve months—I first began to take these ostrich feathers about last August—I know the prisoner Green, she carries on business at Granada-Terrace, Commercial Road, as an ostrich feather manufacturer—after having inquired of Mr. Watson, I went to the prisoners' place with ten ostrich feathers; I believe I saw her; I offered them for sale—she asked if they were my own, I said they were; she asked whether it was all right, I said "Yes"—she said she would buy them of me—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187304070048"/>
               <p>she did not ask me how I got them, she simply asked if they were my own; she gave 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—she asked me how much they were; she gave me half what I asked—she said "What do you want for them?"—I told her I wanted 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; she said she could not give so much for them, they were not worth it, she could not give more than 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I consented to take that and she gave it me—she asked if I should have any more; I said "No"—I then left—I went there again about a fortnight afterwards, and took her some more feathers, I don't recollect how many; she did not seem at all surprised at seeing me again—I told her I had some more feathers for sale, and I offered them to her at a price—I don't recollect how much, she did not pay me near what I asked; I sold them to her—she told me, on one or two occasions, that whenever I had any others she would be most happy to buy them—I went, then, about a dozen times altogether between August and March, I sold her some on each occasion; I sold her 500 or 600 altogether, between August and March; she gave me about one-fifth of the value—I repeatedly went there in a cab; on one occasion she asked me not to have the cab driven up to the door, because she did not like it—on the first occasion she said they were not fresh feathers, and I owned that—she asked me for my address, and I wrote down an address; it was not my true one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was on the first occasion—I gave "Johnson, Nelson Square, Peckham"—that was a lie; I did not wish her to know where I really, came from—I did not wish her to know I was a thief—I don't recollect telling her I had come from New York—I would not swear I did not—she told me the feathers were damaged—I don't recollect telling her they were damaged by sea-water on my coming from New York—I will not swear I did not—I believe it is very common for sailors to bring ostrich feathers from abroad, and sell them in small parcels—I generally saw her daughter in the shop—the first time I went must have been earlier than December, it might not be so early as August—I did not go anywhere else—I did not sell feathers to anybody else—I went to Mr. Watson; he is a feather-dealer—I asked him if he would buy those feathers—he said he was not accustomed to buy these sort of things—Mr. Watson lives in John Street, Sidney Square, Commercial Road, that is very close to Mrs. Green's—I told him they were my own property—that was a lie—I was dressed respectably, as I am now—I took ten the first time—I can't recollect the greatest number of feathers I took to Mrs. Green at one time; at a rough guess it should say about seventy—I used to take them out of the warehouse, taking care that nobody should see me; I took them from the general stock—I used to put them in different parts of my person, sometimes in my hat, sometimes in my pocket, and some<lb/>times about my body, in my waistcoat—that would not improve the feathers, it would take the curl out of them; that would in one respect destroy their value, but not particularly, not to the extent of a shilling each, not more than sixpence; some of them would require to be cleaned and recurled, they were always in the same condition—I am 19 years old—I have been a thief since last August; I have been a liar on these occasions—I should say I sold her about 600 feathers—I have heard my master say he has lost 600; that is what I am charged with—every one I took I sold to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Blundell and Co., of 35, St. Paul's Churchyard—Burchett was in our employ—we have missed ostrich feathers from our stock, we began to miss them about twelve months since—on 15th March he was taken into custody, and he made a communication about Mrs. Green—in consequence of that a search warrant was obtained at the Thames Police Court, and I went with Potts and another officer to Green's house; we saw the daughter first, and saw the prisoner a few minutes afterwards—Potts asked her if she had been buying some feathers of a young man, describing Burchett—she at first hesitated and considered, and then she said she thought she had, once or twice; it is impossible for me to detail all she said—one of the statements was that she bought them of a young man who said they were damaged in coming from New York; another was that she had his name and address—she said she had only bought one or two lots; I don't think she named the numbers in the lots—I stayed in the shop while the officers went up stairs, they brought down a box containing between 200 and 300 feathers—I had some doubt about them and sent for Mr. Watson—there must have been 2,000 feathers in the house altogether, about 600 of those were similar to those we had lost—they were not damaged at all; some of them were not in very good condition, not in a saleable condition, it would require a slight outlay before they were fit for sale; they could be recurled for about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece would make them saleable again—we missed 179 feathers from one particular line—I found 117 at Mrs. Green's, identical in appearance with those—she men<lb/>tioned twenty or twenty-one feathers that she had bought a fortnight or three weeks previously—she said she thought she had given about 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them; they cost us about 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sent for Mr. Watson because I have no practical knowledge of feathers myself, and I wanted someone conversant with the trade—when I say they are our property, I am speaking in a great measure from his opinion—I should have been able to give a decided opinion if I had compared them with those I had in the warehouse—I don't know whether Mr. Watson buys his feathers of Mr. Gougenheim; very likely he does—Mr. Gougenheim is a large merchant—the prisoner appeared very ill when I spoke to her—Burchett had stated in a general way that he had sold them considerably under their value—it was from her that I first learnt the price she had given him.</p>

Blundell in February—I had my atten<lb/>tion particularly called to 21—the whole line they were taken from cost me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a feather—that was what I paid for them—14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would not be anything like a fair price for them—they appeared as if they had been</p>

               <p>through some process to take the curl out—the stems had been cut, but by what process I am not able to state—they might be worth about 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less per feather—I don't know whether the 117 feathers were the average of the line, but the line of 648 feathers cost me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I sold them to Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The cost of cleaning would be 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hundred to me, and the curling about the same—I buy of Mr. Gougenheim and several others—I did not see some of Mr. Gougenheim's invoices at Green's—I heard of them—I have ascertained that she has bought feathers of Mr. Gougenheim since this occurrence—I have not ascertained that she bought some of the very same parcel that I did, the same class of goods—Burchett came to me and offered me four or five feathers, and said "Can you purchase these? they art my sister's"—I said "No, I don't purchase feathers from any one, only in large parcels"—he said "Can you tell me where I can Bell them?" I said "I should think any respectable milliner in the Commercial Road would buy them, such as Mrs. Sheils, Mr. Young, or Mrs. Green;" I think I referred him to four—he said "I will go and see"—I have not been to Mrs. Sheil's or Mr. Young's since.</p>

On 17th March I went with a search warrant to Green's house, with Mr. Ridley and Holliday, another officer—I saw the prisoner's daughter, and inquired for Mrs. Green—she said she was up stairs—I asked the prisoner if she had bought any ostrich feathers of a young man named Burchett, describing the prisoner—she said "No!"—I said "Do you remember a circumstance occurring, that he drove up in a cab on one occasion, and your requesting him not to do so again, because you did not like anyone to come up in a cab?"—she said "No!"—after a little hesitation she said she remembered buying some once or twice—I asked her when the last time was that she bought any—she said "About a fortnight or three weeks last Thursday or Friday"—I asked how many he brought, and what she gave for them—she said he brought about twenty or twenty-one, and she gave 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she could not say which—she had not mentioned any others before that—I told her I should search her place; I believed she had more feathers than that, and I pro<lb/>ceeded to search her place—after searching a portion of the shop, she said to her daughter, "Annie, they are up stairs in a box!"—I and the daughter went up stairs into the front room, first floor, a bedroom—I found a box containing a large quantity of feathers, and among them I found these, which Mr. Watson identified as a portion of those he had sold—I think over 200—the daughter pointed the box out to me—it was a paper box, wrapped up in a handkerchief—I took possession of the feathers that were identified, and left, as the prisoner seemed ill—she was making a lot of statements all the time we were there, an hour and three-quarters; she was talk ing all the time, and making different statements about the young man com ing there and saying they were damaged by sea water; that she did not think he was so wicked as to steal the things, and so on—next morning I went there again—I told her she would have to go to the station, as she was charged with receiving these feathers and others—she then said "I do remember the young man coming in a cab, and I told him not to come up"—I asked her if she had any books or invoices, and one was produced, I think, of November, 1872, and one of January, this year—those were all—I asked if she had any books—she said No, she never kept any looks—she said she had asked the young man for his address, and he gave</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the prosecutors in this case, and carry on business as wine merchants at 9, Mincing Lane—I have known the prisoner as a dealer in casks for some time—on 13th March I received some information from Mr. Putley, a cooper, of St. Mary-at-Hill, and I sent a clerk round to see if the cask was ours he sent about—on Monday, 17th, I asked the prisoner where he got the cask from—I said "Where did you get that octave from that you sold to Mr. Putley on Thursday?"—he said "I bought it of Martin"—he is one of our servants—I sent for Martin, and I said "Did you sell the new octave to Mr. Gillingham?"—he said "No, I never sold any to him"—the prisoner said "You did sell it me, and I promised you 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—I asked him when he bought it: he said "At the same time as I bought two other casks from Harris—he is our bead cellar<lb/>man—I asked him which way he took it up, "Did you take it through the flaps or through the staircase?"—he said "Through the staircase"—casks are never taken out that way—Osborne, the police officer, Harris, and Martin were present—I asked the prisoner where he got the previous octave from—he said "Martin sold me that also"—Harris had sold him two casks on the previous Thursday—that I knew—I saw the new octave at Mr. Putley's, with our brand on both heads—we never sell new casks—we have given no one authority to sell a new cask—Martin had not authority to sell a cask of any kind—he was under cellarman—they were generally sold by myself—the value of the cask was about 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave the prisoner in charge—anyone could come through the staircase and take that away through the building, without the men seeing it.</p>

I assist my father, who is a cooper, at 40, St. Mary-at<lb/>Hill—I have known the prisoner for some time as a dealer in casks—on 13th March the prisoner brought three casks to me; there was a port pipe, a port quarter cask, old casks, and the third was a new octave—we do not ordinarily buy new casks—it had Ronaldson's brand on—I asked him where he got it—he said it had been one sent in and not used—I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I had bought one of the same kind on 6th March—I sent round our clerk to ask if it was all right—the value of a new cask would be 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

In consequence of information I followed the prisoner, about 11.30 on the morning of 17th March, from the French Horn, a public-house in Crutched Friars, to the prosecutor's premises—I told him that I was a police officer, and Mr. Ronaldson asked him how he accounted for an octave he had sold to Mr. Putley on the Thursday—he said he had bought it of Mr. Ronaldson's men, and had given 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—the prisoner pointed out Martin as the man—I repeated what he had said, and Martin said "I never sold him any cask"—the prisoner said "Yes, you did, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and I will tell you something that will bring it to your recollection; I paid you 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it at the French Horn"—Martin said "I never sold you any in your life"—Mr. Ronaldson said "How about the one you sold about a month ago?"—the prisoner said "I bought that of him also," alluding to Martin—he then gave Gillingham into custody—on the way to the station he said "I did not pay him the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because Mr. Putley had net paid me; I could only give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—Martin denied every<lb/>thing that the prisoner said.</p>

I keep the Gordon Arms, 262, High Holborn—on Saturday night, 8th March, about 11.30, the two prisoners came into my house with two other men—after they had been there some time they began knocking one another's hats off, and scuffling about—I ordered the barman, Spence, to turn them out—I got over the bar to assist him; the two prisoners were then standing pretty close together—Dwyer had got a mark on his nose, and he said "This is a fine thing for me to go to work on Monday"—I said "You must <hi rend="italic">go</hi> out"—one of them kicked me on the leg, and I felt a jerk at my waistcoat pocket, where my watch was—I turned round, and said "I have got such a kick on the leg from one of them, and my watch is gone"—I went to Field, and said "You have got my watch"—he said "I have not"—some of them screamed out that the barman was being killed outside, and I went round to the door to go out—Dwyer was outside then, and Field was inside—two policemen came in and took Field—I saw his hand go, and I said "There goes my watch"—it was thrown on to the floor, and someone picked it up—I gave him into custody—I believe the policeman picked up the bow of the watch afterwards.</p>

I am agent to the Solicitor for the Mint—on the evening of 7th March last, about 6.30, I went with several other officers to the Fox beer-house, Southampton Street, Camberwell—we entered by the back door, and went up stairs—Sergeant Kenwood pushed open the door, and we found twelve or thirteen men in the room—a scuffle immediately ensued—I saw the prisoner throw something from his right hand out of the window, which was open about 8 inches—at that time he was seized by Kenwood, and I saw him take from his left hand three counterfeit half<lb/>crowns and two florins, which he handed to me—the prisoner resisted very violently—several pieces of counterfeit coin dropped under the window, which were picked up by Inspector Bryant, and handed to me—after the prisoner was secured I looked round, and saw a man named Harris (<hi rend="italic">see next case</hi>) stoop behind the door, and place behind his heels some counterfeit coin, which I called Bryant's attention to; he picked them up, and gave them to me—Kenwood afterwards went out on the lead flats, where the coin was thrown out of the window, and produced to me six counterfeit If<lb/>crowns—I then went out on the landing, and placed myself in an unoccupied room—the prisoner Johnson, who has pleaded guilty, came up the stairs, looked into the room, and no doubt saw the officers, and was turning back—I said "Walk in, Joe"—he said he did not want to go in—I said "I want that you shall," and I pushed him into Bryant's arms, and I saw him take from his side coat pocket a paper packet, which he handed to me—I opened it, and it contained thirty counterfeit half-crowns, wrapped in ten<lb/>piece packets, with paper lapped between them in the usual way, and 120 counterfeit florins, wrapped up in a similar way—I produce the whole of the coin.</p>

                  </hi> I am a linendraper of the Old Kent Road—the prosecu<lb/>trix' brother is in my employment—about 18th December, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How long have you known my neice, Mr. Carr? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The letter stated:</hi>—"20, New North Road, Hoxton. Tuesday, 12 a.m., 17th December, 1872. Dear Sir,—I find I have done you much injustice in writing to you upon the treatment of your assistants; it appears they were wanton falsehoods, therefore, I feel sorry, and apologise for paying attention to such false statements emanating from Mr. B. Roper. With regard to the other unpleasants, they are unfortunately too true. Miss Roper, sister of your assistant, is, I fear, leading an abandoned life of im<lb/>morality somewhere in your neighbourhood. I often see her about town, but can't find her address, with a view of reclaiming her from such a course, which I am anxious to do, as she is my own sister's daughter. Her family are anxious about her and have written from Bury to me to find her out. Now, Mr. B. Roper knows where his sister is, but will not inform me you would indeed be doing a good act if you could procure by some means the address of that young creature, in order that I may take measures to send her home to her parents immediately and thus relieve their distress and anxiety. The poor father, who is an excellent and good man, would, like myself, esteem it a lasting favour if you can aid us in this matter and at once furnish me with her whereabouts.—I am, yours faithfully, Henry Pearson."</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and life with some Mends at Tennison Street, York Road, Lambeth—my parents live at Bury St. Edmunds; I came to town about two and a half years ago—I have been in toll employment since I have been in London—there is no pretence for saying that I have been leading a life of abandoned immorality—the letters produced art in the prisoners writing—he is my mother's brother—since I was at Bury St. Edmunds he has been bound over to keep the peace—he got me discharged from Spiers &amp; Pond's—it is not the fact that my parents have been seeking me and do not know where to find me—I have been in constant communi<lb/>cation with them.</p>

Hall, when I was behind the bar for Spiers &amp; Pond—he came up to the Horse Show—I have never received apples, eggs, game, fowls, and pigeons from Mr. Palmer—I never received a hamper; only from my father—Spiers &amp; Pond appointed me to the Blackfriars Station, and I went there on 14th June—they afterwards sent me to Swanley, as lady, manageress—I was there from the latter part of June until November, and the reason for my leaving was that you had written letters to them against my character—I was never at the Half Moon, in the Borough, with Mr. Palmer, nor at a theatre with him in the evening—I never went to your lodgings for the purpose of creating a disturbance; I wanted to ask you what object you had in getting me discharged.</p>

I am a poulterer, of 158, Old Kent Road—on the morning of 1st March I was alarmed by a policeman about 1 o'clock—I had gone to bed about 11 o'clock, and had shut my shop up safely as usual—I went down stairs and saw policeman No.70 struggling with a man named Lun, who has been convicted at the Kingston Assizes—he brought him into the shop—they were both overcome by struggling—another policeman came up on hearing the rattle—an attempt had been made to break the door in, the panels of which were smashed—three window shutters were out of their places, and the bar had been wrenched down—thay had succeeded in getting access to the shop and were trying to take a fowl—I found a fowl with its neck pulled off—they could not get it through.</p>
