Butt came to me and asked me if I was down to the queer, that meaned counterfeit money; Butt then asked me if I knew the process of rolling and cutting; I told him I had heard soldiers in the Warwickshire militia talk of it; Cope sat on the opposite side, he must have heard the conversation, because he came and offered me drink afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Had Butt ever told you for what use he applied this cutting engine - A. Not till I was carrying part of it in my hands, he then said it was part of a cutting engine for cutting bobs and tanners; a shilling they call bob, and a sixpence, tanner; I removed these things into <placeName id="t18101031-1-crimeloc4">Checquer-alley</placeName>

               <p>Q. How do you know that Cope was to finish them - A. Because I have heard Cope say he should bring him plates, and then asked him when he should have the goods back again, and sometimes he has given directions where to go and get plates, and then he asked Butts when he should have the goods back again.</p>
               <p>Q. When Cope got any of these blanks back again, what was Cope to do with them - A. I never saw him finish them; I heard Cope say he wanted them very bad to finish.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Cope give any plates to Butt - A. I do not recollect that ever I did. After Butt had cut out the blanks from the plates, he smoothed the edges at the lathe by a file, and I have seen

             count the blanks, clap them in scores, and give them to Cope at the City of Chester.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose - A. I expect, to finish, because he in general furnished people with counterfeit money. I never heard him say any thing about finishing but once, that was at the City of Chester public-house; Cope shewed me some sixpences, they were very rough, he told me they had been finished by a young man that he had learned; he wanted me to have some of his goods to put off. I recollect that he has told Butts that he wanted his blanks to finish, to execute an order that he had to send in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you were afterwards taken up - A. Yes, on the 25th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Now from that period of March, which you have been speaking of, down to the 25th of June, have you had frequent opportunity of seeing that which you have described - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards became acquainted with Mr. Powell, assistant to the solicitor of the mint - A. I did. I wrote to the secretary of state, I gave Mr. Powell intelligence, and acted under his directions. I was taken at London, and conveyed under an escort; from the 25th of June I was in the Savoy as a deserter, till the 25th of July. On the 25th of July I went into the country, I gave some information when I was at Guildford.</p>
               <p>Q. About the 10th or 12th of August did you see the prisoners - A. I saw Butt at his own house in Checquer-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. After you came to town did you as any of those times that you went to Butt's house, see him do any thing - A. Yes, I did, I saw him cutting at the engine, and rounding the edges of the blanks, which he had cut out by the engine, and I have seen him give them to Cope, as I expected, to finish.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see

(I never saw Cope at the house in Checquer alley) Cope seemed very glad to see me; I asked Cope if he would let me have any white ones to go on, that is, to pass them off in circulation; Cope said he would, but he had not served his customers, he could not give them to me till he had served his customers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep any memorandum of what you did from day to day by order of Mr. Powell - A. Yes. On the 17th of August I met Sarah Slater, at the City of Chester in Bunhill-row; I asked her for the goods which I had ordered; she said that she was very sorry that Joe had not been able to do any work, that she herself had been very hard to work. On the 22nd of August I went to Butt's house, and to the City of Chester; I kept up my acquaintance with them till that day.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Worship-street office. On Wednesday the 22nd of August, I went with Vickrey, Bishop, and my son, Joshua Armstrong, to No. 19, Peter-street, Saffron-hill, that house is kept by Mr. Quin, a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went there did you find either of the prisoners there - A. No; we went up to the garret door, put our feet to the door, and shoved it open, having a search warrant; we had information of Mrs. Quin, that a man and a woman lived in the garret; when we got into that garret there were some drawers, and out of these drawers these counterfeit shillings were taken by Vickrey and given to me; I was standing close by Vickrey, eight sixpences, and I believe, seven shillings. In the same drawer was this sissel, and these bits of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Sissel is the remains of the plate, after the blanks have been cut out - A. Yes. After I had possession of them things I left Mason in the house with Mrs. Quin below, to apprehend any person that might come to that garret; afterwards I went with the other officers to Butt's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing else found in these lodgings - A. I cannot say. I went with Bishop, Vickrey, and my son, to Butt's house, No. 4, Checquer-alley, Bunhill-row; we went in at the door, and Mrs. Walton was just in the passage, Butts and

             were in a side room on the ground, we secured them instantly. In a moment my son came down stairs, he had run up. We told them our business. I took the two men and Mrs. Walton up in the garret, and the first thing that I saw was this cutting instrument, fixed as it is now, with a cutter in it that fits the size of a counterfeit sixpence, it was matched to it, and another cutter laying by the side. These are all the counterfeit money found by me at Cope's; this is one of the finished sixpences I found at Copes, it corresponds with the engine found at Butt's. At Butts's this piece of metal was laying by the side of the cutter.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what they did in that room - A. No, I never went up to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever perceive any smell there - A. Yes, but I took that smell to be from the slaughterhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you smelled any thing like it since - A. No, I have not noticed it since.</p>

               <p>Q. to Vickrey. Was it in that house where that woman lived that you went - A. It was; she was below stairs; I went into the front garret of that house in a drawer in a small chest of drawers in that room the money which Armstrong produced was found; I saw the money and desired him to take it out, and them pieces of silver that he produced was in the same drawer, and also the Sissell; there were a number of cloths in the tub wet, they appeared as if they had been just washed; I examined the cloths, they appeared such cloths as have been always found where I have been in the habit of finding counterfeit money, they are stained green in different shades. There was a table in the room, it was not brought away at that time; I have examined that table, there is a green colour upon it, and in the crevise of the table there was some white stuff. which I have no doubt was cream of tartar, and the green stains I have no doubt were produced by aquafortis acting on the metal, and the corner of the table appears to be worn away, as if by being rubbed with sand paper.</p>

Butt gave the key of the drawer in which that quantity was found; here is a blank of a sixpence which was cut by me in the presence of the prisoners, by order of the magistrate; it exactly corresponds with the others. There was a quantity of sand paper, sissel, and other things found in the house; there was a lathe that works by the foot that is for the purpose of rounding the edges with a file after they are cut out by the engine.</p>

            . Q. Do you know the two prisoners at the bar - A. Yes, very well. I was in the habit of frequently seeing them between the months of March and August. I have heard Cope complain that he has not had his blanks to finish, I have frequently seen blanks given to him to be finished, they required colouring; colouring gives them the appearance of silver. I saw him on the 22d of August, and I saw him on the Saturday night, his hands were of a green cast. I also know Mrs. Slater, she lived with Cope as his wife, and I have heard her complain of Butts not letting her have blanks to go on with; and that she was obliged to work harder sometimes than others. I saw her on that Saturday afternoon in Banner-street, and at the City of Chester, her hands were in the same state as his</p>

            . On the 22d of August, I went to the lodgings of Cope, at Mrs. Quin's house with Mason, Vickrey and my son. I went to the front garret they were not at home, the door was locked, and finding nobody answered, we clapped our feet against it and opened it. I saw Vickrey take some money out of the drawer; he delivered it to me. This is one sixpence that was in paper that was given me by Vickrey, I have kept ever since. I am sure that is one that was found at Cope's, this is the one that I tried with the cutter, I searched him when he was apprehended, I found nothing but good money on him. We took them up at the corner of the Lying-in-hospital, Old-street-road, then I took them home to that room, and took them in there with Mrs. Quin, she called them by the name of Williams.</p>

In a chest of drawers I found the money which I gave to Armstrong in a tub in the same room, was a number of cloths stained green, I have no doubt they had been used to clean the money; I have no doubt it was aquafortis, and on the floor were a number of filings; in the same room was a table, and on it the same sort of green marks as the cloths; in a crevise of the table there was some white stuff; I took my knife and took some out and tasted it, I have no doubt<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310006"/>it was cream of tartar, there is some silver, and them plates were found in the room. The aquafortis and cream of tartar are to bring the silver upon the surface of the metal, the colour is produced by the application of them things; I have apprehended persons of of this description before, and I have found the same sort of things. I was in company with the officers at the time they apprehended Cope; Slater parted from Cope; and went the other side of the way; I brought her back; she put her hands behind her against the wall, I took from her this bag, here are stains of green which I have no doubt were produced by her wet hands; this bag contains two hundred and thirteen counterfeit sixpences, they have all been coloured; there may be an exception of one that is not fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that sixpence at Cope's - A. It is impossible to say I found it; I can only say what money I found I gave to Armstrong.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the same person - A. Yes. Then I accused him of stealing the mare; I said that mare is my property, he said he was very sorry for it, then he jumped off the horse he was riding and let my mare go, and ran away directly, leaving the horse and mare both loose in the street. I pursued him and cried stop thief, in running he fell down, and a person of the name of Wheeler laid hold of him; Mr. Wheeler asked me what was the matter, I said he had been stealing horses; the prisoner said he was no thief; I said if they brought him back to where the horse was I thought it was in my power to prove him a thief; Mr. Wheeler brought him back to where the horses were in the Curtain-road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean that they were loose in the Curtain-road - A. Yes; then Mr. Wheeler told me if I had any thing to say to the man I must take him myself; I directly collared the prisoner, I took the prisoner to a public-house next to the office, there he was delivered over to Wilson.</p>

They went down the yard, and returned in about five minutes; they then said, as we kept carts we might send for them, and asked for a pen and ink. I gave them the pen and ink.

I did not like him holding me by the shoulder; I thrust myself out of his hands, and I saw the prisoner at the bar go out with a truss under his arm; I holloed out stop thief, he had got about a dozen yards from the door and then dropped the truss.

On the 5th or 6th of February, four men came up the yard, and asked whether the Exeter waggon went from there. I and Underhill were in the yard at the time. We made answer, yes, the Exeter went from there. They went away and returned in five minutes; they said, they had got some things to go. I asked if we should send the cart for them; they said, they kept carts, they would send them. They went down again, and immediately came up, and said, as we kept carts we should send for them, they came in the warehouse, and told Underhill to put it down where to send for them, I was kneeling by the desk at the time. When Underhill was taking the direction down two of them had got their hands tight on my head, because I should not turn my head round; and another had got hold of Underhill by the head. The other man was walking up and down the warehouse. The prisoner took up the truss, and ran out of the door. I saw the prisoner run past the window with the truss. I immediately ran out of the door, and sang out, stop thief; the prisoner ran down Watling-street, the man that is here stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him stopped - A. No, I did not, he dropped the truss about ten yards from the door, he was brought back in about five or ten minutes; I am sure he is the man, I could tell him by the face, he came up two or three times.</p>

After they had been up the yard about a minute or two, I heard some person cry out stop thief. As I was going from the corner up to the gateway again they came out; this man was one; some went one way and some the other, this man went down Watling-street; I followed him, he turned into Bow-lane; as he got half way up Bow-lane, towards Cheapside, he was stopped. I never lost sight of him any farther than when he turned the corner of Bow-lane, and then I was not above the distance of ten yards from him. I am sure he is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, I became acquainted with him about the beginning of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. I do not know what he was particularly, I became acquainted with him at the Crispin public house in Grub-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him often after your first acquaintance with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times do you think you saw him from the first of March to the end of June - A. A great many times, twenty times or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Now these several meetings what did you meet about - A. I used to go after the hours of my work up to the City of Chester, in Bunhill-row. I am a shoemaker. I saw Cope there, he in general was talking about counterfeit money; I was determined to get into his confidence as far as lay in my power. I understood that he was a finisher of counterfeit money. He told me that he finished it and disposed of it, he received the blank in a rough state, and he finished them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the time that I have been speaking of, did you ever see him with any counterfeit money - A. Yes, I have more than once; I have seen him with half a dozen sixpences and sometimes more.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310011"/>Q. I believe in the month of June, about the 25th you were taken up as a deserter - A. I was, and I was put in prison; I was afterwards sent under an escort to Portsmouth; I wrote to the Secretary of State at Guildford, and at Portsmouth; I afterwards came up to town, went to Mr. Powell, and acted udder his directions.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you came to town did you see Cope again - A. I saw him on the 10th of August, at the City of Chester, Bunhill-row. On Saturday the 11th, I saw him at the Key public house, Fleet-market. I went with him from the Key, public house, to a public house in Clement's-lane. I asked him whether he had got any spangles, meaning counterfeit seven shilling pieces; he advised me not to have any, but confine myself to work with bobs and tanners.</p>

               <p>Q. What are bobs - A. Bobs are counterfeit shillings, and tanners are counterfeit sixpences. He said, he would let me have some the beginning of the week. I saw him on Tuesday, the 14th of August, at <placeName id="t18101031-6-crimeloc30">Ben Johnson's head, Westmoreland-buildings, Aldersgate-street</placeName>

I asked him if he had any thing about him and if he would let me have any thing; he said, yes, he had got a few tanners about him; he produced me six counterfeit sixpences; he said, I should have them for a shilling, I afterwards gave them to Mr. Sewell, a clerk to the Solicitor of the Mint, the next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I did not hear you say what situation of life you have been in - A. I work at shoemaking, and I had been on the recruiting service, I had my pay from the regiment. When I ran sway from the regiment, I maintained myself by shoe-making, from the beginning of March, till the 25th of June, I lived upon my work. My Colonel knew where I was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive pay at that time - A. I had not settled with the regiment, I did not receive pay.</p>
               <p>Q. We heard something of your being under an escort, were you taken in custody for any offence as a deserter - A. When I was taken in custody I was at Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going to when you were under that escort - A. I was going to Portsmouth, my regiment was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever make any charge against that wretched man, or any body else, till after you were taken up and on your journey to Portsmouth - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote a letter to the Secretary of State, giving a great deal of patriotic information, did not you give the information in hopes of not being punished as a deserter - A. I knew my Colonel would not hurt me, what I had done I thought it my duty; I wrote to the Secretary of State about the 10th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that time you have been an active agent to assist the Solicitor of the Mint - A. I have done all that lay in my power, you may depend upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you whether that was done merely to assist the Solicitor of the Mint or to save yourself - A. To assist the Solicitor of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not after you wrote that letter to the Secretary of State that you were set at liberty - A. After my writing that letter I was set at liberty, but not through that medium.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to him about some spangles, where did you learn about spangles - A. From the Warwickshire militia; he advised me to deal in bobs and tanners; I bought six tanners of the prisoner for a shilling.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 22d of August I went to Mrs. Quin's house. I went up stairs with the officer, Vickrey, Bishop, my son, and Mason; when we came to the front garret the door was shut, it was locked I believe; we, without trying it, put our feet against it, and sent it open, there was nobody in that garret; there was a chest of drawers in the garret, Vickrey took out this counterfeit shilling and sixpence, and gave them into my hands; I have had them ever since, and this sissel.</p>
               <p>Q. What is sissel - A. It is the remainder of plates from whence the blanks are cut out for shillings and sixpences. At night I was at the apprehending of Cope in Old-street-road; he was there, and a woman, and two or three men, and the landlord of the City of Chester public house in Bunhill-row; he ran away, we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310012"/>apprehended him just at the end of St. Luke's lunatic-hospital; I searched Cope, he had nothing on him, but good money; I then told him I should take him to his lodgings, No. 19, Peter-street, Saffron-hill; he said he had none there; I told him I had been there and should take him there; I had left Mason there the whole day to wait. I then took him with the other officers, and Mrs. Quin said, this is Mr. Williams; I then took Mrs. Quin and the officers up stairs that she might shew us before them the room he lived in, and where we found them goods.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a considerable time after the man was supposed to sell the counterfeit money, was it not ten days after the man was supposed to purchase the money - A. According to the evidence it was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search any part of the room - A. I searched the chest of drawers, I found a number of counterfeit shillings and sixpences, and three pieces of metal, a quantity of sissel, and a quantity of wet rags. I have no doubt the rags had been used with aquafortis, they had green stains upon them, they had been used for the purpose of colouring; I have been an officer eleven years; I have seen the same sort of rags a number of times before, they were at that time quite wet, and at that time they smelled of aquafortis. We saw a table there, one corner of the table had been very much worn away, apparently by a file; in a crevise in the middle there was something white; I took some of it out with my knife, and tasted it, I have no doubt it was cream of tartar. The cream of tartar and aquafortis, and other things, are used to produce the colour of silver.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Chandler, a salesman, in Newgate-market. On the morning of the 11th of September, when I came to Newgate-market, I saw the sow hanging on the meat-hooks, the prisoner was walking backwards and forwards, I asked him who that sow belonged to, he said it belonged to him, he asked me to chop it down, I told him it would fetch more to sell it whole, he gave me three-pence for chopping it down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday night Mr. Banks, the Blacksmith, told me he should have a job for me to go as far as the turnpike, Battle-bridge, he would pay me for the trouble; I met him there about six o'clock, he gave me the pigs to drive home, I drove them home, he received them, he asked my father to kill the fat sow, he did, and I took it to Newgate-market, I booked it in my own name, I was to deliver the money to him, and he would pay me he said for my trouble.</p>

Mrs. Bickers sleeps in the house, she is the mistress of the house. On Friday the 19th of October my shop was shut up at four o'clock in the afternoon. I fastened my shop door with a padlock outside of the door, and another lock inside of the door, and the windows were shut on the ground floor, there were no fastenings to them, only the windows pulled down. On Sunday morning, a quarter before three, the watchman called me, I found the padlock was broken off, and the other lock forced; I missed two pair of boots and a pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you miss other things besides them - A. That I do not know. I went to Bow-street, they shewed me the things on Monday morning, I said they were mine, I had seen the two pair of boots and the pair of shoes in my shop on the Friday afternoon at four o'clock, when I shut up my shop, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman called you on the Sunday morning you came down and saw your padlock broken off - A. Yes, and these shoes and boots I missed directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else - A. Yes, I think I missed more shoes, these were new shoes and the boots were second hand, the shoes I bought at a sale.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of the prisoners - A. I know Bent very well, I have often seen him. On last Sunday week, Bent and Street came into my house about eight o'clock in the morning and ordered breakfast at nine, they brought in a bundle but who had it I cannot say, they both had it before them and spread it out on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310014"/>the table in the tap-room, there were boots and shoes, and a coat or two, but what else I cannot say, they offered them for sale to different people that were in the taproom, to me and all; I bought two pair of boots, and a pair of shoes, the boots were old and the shoes partly new, they are regimental shoes, I believe I gave them six shillings for the lot.</p>
               <p>Q. You ought to be scrupulous of buying without asking them how they came by them - A. I had no idea of their coming by them dishonestly.</p>
               <p>Q. Why if they had bought them they could not sell them for six shillings - A. No, but I did not know but some gentleman gave them to them, I was busy, I told my wife to give six shillings for them, and she took them up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the shoes and boots again - A. Yes, the officers came in about nine, they apprehended the prisoners there, and I delivered up the boots and shoes to the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoners give you the money back - A. Yes, Street gave me three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What, they divided the money half and half did they - A. I suppose so, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoners gave no account how they came by them - A. Not any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Solomon come with the officers - A. He came himself, he took them away with him, he said there had been some things taken out of a house, I told him I had them, when he asked me if I had got any thing, and then the officers took away the things.</p>
               <p>Bent. Did I offer them to you for sale - A. I cannot say which of you offered them. I believe they had two old coats and some more shoes.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoners on Sunday morning, the 21st of October; I received information that there were some men offering some wearing apparel at a public-house about eight o'clock in the morning, I went there with Adkins between eight and nine, I found the two prisoners there sitting in the tap-room by themselves, I asked the landlord if he had bought any property that morning, he told me he had bought two pair of boots of the prisoners, and one pair of shoes, he produced them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see one of the two prisoners offer back part of the money - A. Yes, Street gave me three shillings, and he asked Bent for three shillings, he said, Mr. Bent, did you give it him, Bent made no answer, these are the boots and shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Solomon. Look at these shoes and boots carefully, and say whether these are your shoes and boots you had in your house, when you shut up your shop - A. These were all in my shop, I saw them in my shop on the Friday afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How late on the Saturday did you see your shop safe - A. On Saturday night at ten o'clock, and the padlock was entire I am sure of that; I had occasion to pass it, I am sure all was safe then.</p>
               <p>Bent's Defence. On Sunday morning I bought the boots and shoes of two men and a woman, at the corner of Coal-yard in Drury-lane, I gave them a crown for them, they asked me six shillings, and took a crown; the other prisoner came up to me and asked me what I was buying, I told him, he said he would go my halves, and he gave me half-a-crown.</p>

               <p>Street. It is not a dwelling-house that was broken open, and there is a witness in court can prove it not to be a dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Q. to Solomon. You sleep in the house - A. Yes, in the one pair of stairs room, and Mrs. Bickers sleeps in the house; there are two doors to the house, I enter at the same door they do, to go up stairs to my room; the shop door is in the street.</p>

            . I live facing Mr. Fielder's house. On the evening of the 15th of October last, I was at my window between six and seven o'clock; I saw three men walking to and again by Mr. Fielder's house, it was shut up; the lamps were lighted; I saw the men by the light of the lamps.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark - A. It was not a dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light of day remaining when you saw these men - A. Very little; it was getting dark; these men went away and came at different times, the party did.</p>
               <p>Q. How often may you have seen these men pass the door - A. I cannot exactly say; about half a dozen times. They came past and picked up something out of the kennel, one of them did, and throwed it at the kitchen window shutters; two of them came up and one went close to the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. What became of the third - A. I do not know; two of the men came up; one of the men went close to the door and the other, and the other staid behind; they parted again, and the same man who had gone close to the door came up again and went close to the door; he went away again. I went down to Mrs. Dobbings, that lives in my house, I desired her to put out her candle and look out of the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. What part of the house was the window that you was looking from - A. The two pair.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house that that Mrs. Greenwell lodges, opposite of Mr. Fielder's house.</p>

Yes; my candle had been alight above a quarter of an hour; Mrs. Greenwell desired me to put out the candle, I did; I got up and tore my curtain away, and locked through the window, I saw three men walking to and fro Mr. Fielder's door. I did not continue two minutes at my window before I went down stairs; I went to Mr. Brodie's the confectioners in Portland-road, next door to Mr. Fielder's.</p>
               <p>Q. You made some enquiries when you got there - did any body come in while you were there - A. Yes; one of the men that were standing at the corner of the street, he came into the shop, and bought a halfpenny bun.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you say in Mrs. Brodie's shop - A. About three minutes; then I went to Mr. Flatt's next door to Mr. Fielder's; I made some communication to Mr. Flatt. In consequence of what I told him he and I went to Mr. Fielder's door.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were at Mr. Fielder's door was it light or dark - A. It wanted about ten minutes to seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. What makes you say ten minutes to seven o'clock - A. That is the time it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any watch or clock - A. No, I had not. It was a little before seven when I went to Mr. Fielder's door.</p>
               <p>Q. Not speaking by any watch or clock - A. I know it was so by the time of the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the opinion you form from the darkness or light - A. From the darkness; the lamps were all lit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Now I will ask you whether, supposing the lamps had not been lighted, could you have distinguished the features of any person you met in the street - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Mr. Flatt went to Mr. Fielder' what did you do then - A. I knocked very loud at the door, three men rushed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knock more than once - A. I knocked a loud knock, and Mr. Flatt rung the bell before they rushed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut or open when you knocked at it - A. Shut; I am quite sure of that; three men rushed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe their opening the door - A. Yes, the same as if I was to take hold of the spring lock, and open it myself; I heard the door open. I hit the door such a knock, almost enough to break it open.</p>
               <p>COURT. So that if the door had been open when you knocked you must have perceived it open - A. Yes. There came three men out, the first man had got a bundle, I took it from him, he ran away, and another was behind him, he ran away, and the third, he went to run away, and Mr. Flatt laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw that did you - A. Yes. He got away from Mr. Flatt I believe, I did not see that; I afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310016"/>went to my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the door of the house when these men rushed out - A. Two men went and took care of the house. One of the men was Mr. Muffin, they went in of their own accord to take care of the house untill the maid came home.</p>

               <p>Q. You were busy this night I suppose - A. I was not very busy. It was Monday night, I sat sewing.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the reason you lighted the candle - A. Yes, it was too dark to see any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. It was too dark to see any thing, and that was the reason you had lighted the candle to enable you to see to sew - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By your age I should suppose your eye-sight is not very good - A. Yes, my eyes are pretty good.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen no clock, you only guess it was near seven o'clock - You say when you were in the street by the light you could not see the features of any persons face, any other person younger with a better eye-sight might.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say your eye-sight is pretty good - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You took hold of the bundle, and he ran away - A. Yes; he was the first that came out.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your reason for desiring her to put out her candle - A. I thought they had noticed me; my fire gave a great light, and I damped it. I did not wish to be observed by them; I did not go out to give any information.</p>
               <p>MR. FLATT. I am a cheesemonger living in Clipstone-street; I live next door to Mr. Fielder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness, Mrs. Dobbings coming to you on the evening of the 15th of October - A. Yes, very near seven.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your shop an open shop to the street - A. The shop and door is open to the street; the candles had been lighted in my shop about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information from Mrs. Dobbings did you go out - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out with her was there any remains of twy-light left - A. I did not perceive any; the lamps were all lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the lamps had been out do you think you could have discovered the face of any man that passed - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now where did you go when you went out with Mrs. Dobbing's - A. To Mr. Fielder's door; his door is up one step a large flag-stone; we went to the door; Mrs. Dobbings and me said to ourselves, is the maid at home? She knocked and rang the bell; she gave a loud knock and I rang sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the door was shut or open when Mrs. Dobbings knocked - A. It was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon Mrs. Dobbings knocking and you ringing, as you described, what happened - A. Three men came out almost instantly; one followed the other as fast as they could, one after the other; I heard the door open and three men came out; two men went off; I catched the third man as he came out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any thing taken from the first man - A. I cannot say I did, I was looking at the last man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any bundle with the first man - A. Yes, I did; I did not see what became of that bundle. I catched hold of the third man, he got away from me, I pursued him instantly, he took up Portland-street; Clipstone-street, runs into Portland-street, he took to the left of Portland-street, from Mr. Fielder's. I followed him from fifty to a hundred yards more or less, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person that came out of the house that you followed over out of your sight when you followed him - A. No, he ran and I followed him, he fell down a little way up in Portland-street; from the corner he fell, and I fell over him; I was close to his heels, I catched him by the collar and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now who is the man that you catched by the collar and secured - A. The prisoner at the bar,</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person assist you or go with you - A. There was a man came up at the first instant; I catched hold of him, his name is Robinson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing as you were pursuing - A. I holloed out, stop thief; Robinson and me took him back to Mr. Fielder's house, not into the house; we took him to the door, Mr. Unwin came up, Robinson, Unwin, and me took him to the watch-house.

            . Q. What are you - A. A carpenter and joiner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the night of the 15th of October - A. Very well, I was going up Clipstone-street. When I got opposite of Mr. Fielder's door, I saw Mr. Flatt, and the prisoner at the bar turning from the flag stones into the street. Mr. Flatt, holloed out, stop thief. I instantly run after the prisoner, and Mr. Flatt not being more than three yards distance from him, I saw the prisoner fall, and Mr. Flatt fell on him, I caught the prisoner by the collar before he arose from the ground, and while running before, the prisoner fell, I heard something fall upon the stones, it made a great sound; immediately the prisoner got up he dropped some skeleton keys, I heard him drop it at his heels. When I had got hold of his collar, they were picked up, before we stirred from the place; they were shewed me after they were picked up; I saw them picked up, and saw what they were at the time, they were skeleton keys, we returned to Mr. Fielder's door, and then we went to the watch-house. As we were going across Portland-place, the prisoner made a stop, he got his hand away from the person of the other side; he dropped another key, I saw the key lay on the stones before it was picked up and heard it fall. In Welbeck-street we were joined by the constable Howard, I delivered the prisoner up to him, he was taken to the watch-house and searched in my presence. I saw the constable take some more keys out of his pocket, and a phial of phosphorus, I believe was taken out of his hand, I did not see that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Perhaps you knew the prisoner in Portland-road - A. No; when I got to the watch-house I said, I had seen his face somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. In Portland-road could you see one man's face from the other - A. Yes, when I was laying hold of him, I could see his face the lamps were pretty well lit up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any more than these last two witnesses have mentioned - A. No, I observed nothing until I heard the cry of stop thief. I run out of my shop immediately, and when I came up, Mr. Flatt had hold of the prisoner, I saw his hand against his coat pocket when he was standing at Mr. Fielder's door, I said, he was pulling something out of his pocket and the moment I observed it and spoke there was something dropped, I picked it up it was this key; then I desired one of my men to lay hold of his arm to prevent him from putting his hand into his pocket, I walked by the side of him down to the watch-house. In going across Woburn-place, another key dropped, I heard it drop, a person picked it up and gave it me momently. I was going along, I heard Howard speak, I knew him and called Howard, he came I saw him searched by Howard, he took a bottle out of his hand some halfpence and silver, and I saw two bags taken out of his pocket with keys in them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember coming up to Flatt and Uwin - A. I joined them in Welbeck-street, I took hold of the prisoner and led him to the watch-house, I gave them strict charge not to let him put his hand into his pockets; I perceived him put his hand into his waistcoat pocket and take out this bottle of phosphorus, and out of the same pocket I took out these matches; I took the bottle out of his hand. In his left hand inside coat pocket, I took these six skeleton keys, they were in this bag they are keys for inside doors, I have unlocked several of Mr. Fielder's doors with them. In his outside coat pocket I found this bag and two more keys they are larger skeleton keys; I searched his breeches pocket, I found four dollars, five shillings in silver, and eight pennyworth of halfpence. I went the next morning and opened Mr. Fielder's door with one of these two keys that I took from his outside pocket, this is the key, it locked and unlocked it. I tried two of the small keys which unlocked the bed room doors. After he was secured in the watch-house, I went back with Vaughan this crow was found.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the house did you observe any place forced - A. I did. I believe they call it the book case in the parlour that apparently had been forced with a crow and likewise a store place in the kitchen where they keep soap that had been forced the same way, and in the two pair of stairs back room there was a chest of drawers attempted but not broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did different places in the house exhibit to you that persons had been there endeavouring to break the place open - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MRS. DOBBINGS. This is the bundle, it had been in my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Howell. Look at that bundle - A. I have looked over every one of the articles, there is six pincloths, two dresses, they are frocks and trowsers, two pair of trowsers besides, two frocks, seven children's shirts, seven pair of stockings of my mistress and master and children, three children's petticoats, five night caps, four bed gowns, three children's and one mistress's, four pocket handkerchiefs, one silk and the other cambric, and three towels; I cannot tell the value of them, and I lost three dollars, I do not know them.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the house yourself all that time - A. Yes. There was me and my wife. The seals laid in the shop window; one pane of glass was broken, it was cracked before; I never perceived it broken till five o'clock. It was only cracked in one place before; when I saw it broken there were two small pieces out; it was broken in two pieces, they were knocked in the inside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if it was done by force and violence, or as if it had fell out - A. It appeared as if done by violence.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the seals placed - A. Close to the windows; when the two pieces of glass were out any person might put their two fingers in and take the seals, they laid close to the glass, I had observed them there before.</p>
               <p>Q. They were set in gold, were they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of them five seals - A. I should imagine about seven or eight pounds. I missed them all at one time.</p>

            . On the 8th of October, about a quarter past three, I saw the prisoners in Holborn, they were all three together, I knew them very well; I suffered them to pass me; I immediately turned round, I observed Mann give a gold seal to the prisoner Smith; I immediately catched hold of Smith's arm.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of Holborn was this in - A. Nearly opposite of Turnstile. I could see him putting the seal into Smith's hand; they were all three walking abreast; I being behind, saw the seal; Mann put his hand sideways to Smith, Smith took it; I caught hold of Smith's hand, he at the first instant put his hand behind him, and when he found I was getting hold of his hand he threw it into the street; I observed the seal drop; I dragged the prisoner to the seal and picked it up; I looked at it and asked him where he got it, he said he bought it of a boy, and gave two-pence for it; I then took him to the office in Bow-street; I searched him, in his fob I found three other gold seals. He was detained. I made it known to my brother officers, they took Berry and Mann in about two hours in Holborn. This was on the 18th of October, about a quarter past three o'clock; I saw them about three or four doors from the prosecutor's, they were coming down Holborn in a direction, as if from his house, on the same side. I produce the seals. The fifth seal was not found.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are these four of the seals that you lost - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- LIMERICK. I am am an officer. I apprehended Mann and Berry in Holborn, a quarter after five; in consequence of information by 
               <persName id="t18101031-13-person224">Salmon</persName>
             I searched Mann, I found six shillings and six pence on him, and this knife; I searched the other prisoner and found four shillings and six-pence. When I had Mann and Berry going along to the office, Mann offered me five shillings if I would let him go. I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the name of Salmon, and that he had given you some information - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Smith. I told the officer that I found these things; will he swear that I said I bought it of a boy, and gave two pence for it.</p>
               <p>Salmon. He said he bought it of the other boy, that was his expression, for two-pence.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I was going down Holborn about half after three o'clock in the afternoon, on the 18th of October, I kicked a piece of paper on the edge of the curbstone, a seal fell out of it into the kennel; I immediately picked up the paper, then I went and picked up the seal. There were two papers; there were three seals in the papers, besides the one that fell in the kennel; I put the three into my fob pocket, and I was wiping this one that fell in the mud. As for these two prisoners I know nothing of them, upon my oath, they were never with me, I never saw him before with my eyes. This gentleman laid hold of me, and jolting my hand, he knocked the seal out of my hand that I was wiping of; he asked me where I got them, I told him I found them. He then took me to Bow-street. I am innocent; I never saw the shop in my life, neither were these boys walking abreast with me.</p>
               <p>Mann's Defence. I never saw this boy before in my life, until I was at the office.</p>
               <p>Berry's Defence. I know

                        targets="t18101031-14-defend227 t18101031-14-deflabel79"/> at the bar - A. I was down at the Admiralty; he was about the place; I asked him who he belonged to; he was close to my stall; I asked him to go of an errand for me; he went; I asked him if he had any parents, he told me he had a grandmother that lived in Holborn; he lived with his grandmother; I asked him what he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before you asked him to go of an errand for you - A. Yes. I asked him whether his grandmother would be uneasy if he went of an errand, he told me no; that his grandmother went out a charing, that she paid for his lodging, that she was a week sometimes before she came home, and that he ran of errands for any one for a little victuals; he had nobody to give him any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ him to go on errands for you - A. Yes, on that day; not to give him any wages; I gave him lodging for two or three nights; I took him to lodge with me on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue to lodge with you till the Thursday - A. Yes, and I employed him some way or other.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thursday morning what time did you leave your lodging to go to your stand - A. About eleven o'clock; the prisoner went with me, he helped me to carry some of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him his victuals - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you left this room of yours what had you left in it this morning belonging to you - A. I left three pound in my box; I had counted it the over-night, intending to go to market, but I did not; the box was locked, I took the key with me. The lock of the box was not broken open, it was the hinge that was undone; I had locked my room door and taken the key with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you did with the key of your room after you got to the stall - A. I left it on my stand; I usually placed it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner his victuals with you there that day - A. Yes, at the stand, near about two o'clock; he had not finished his dinner when he went away from my stand; he went away of his own accord. I was not advised of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When he went away did he say that he was going - A. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards before you went to your room - A. It may be about ten minutes after I missed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been absent from your stand when you missed him - A. About ten minutes after he was gone some suspicion struck me; I immediately went through Scotland-yard to my lodgings; it was within five minutes walk to my lodgings from my stand. When I got to my room I went to my door, it was locked the same as I left it; I looked through the window, I saw my box in the middle of the room, on the floor; I had left it underneath the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your key with you to unlock your room door - A. No; I had left it on the stand; the boy had that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you went to your room to see for the boy, you did not take the key with you - A. No, I went back to my stand to look for my key, I could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. You said you looked in the window, did you get in the window - A. Yes; after I got back from the stall the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. You said something about the hinges - A. No, not the hinges; the hasp was loose; two small nails were drawn from the hasp, by which means the box could be opened. I missed out of my box all the money I have mentioned; there were none left behind, and I missed two silk handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they good ones - A. Yes, pretty good ones. There were other things in the box, but he had not meddled with them; only a small window curtain that the money was tied up in, the curtain had money in it. I was coming out of the window again, there was a small pane of glass out, I looked down and saw the key on the floor; there was a basket there, it had dropped in a small-basket; it appeared to me to have been broken through the hole in the window into that basket; I then went into Holborn, to where he told me his grandmother lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he told you what part of Holborn - A. No, he had not. I found him about the middle of Holborn, it was then between four and five; he was then on the contrary side of the street; I crossed the street and laid hold of him, he did not see me; he had one of the handkerchiefs tied about his neck, and the other handkerchief he had a shirt in. As soon as I took hold of him he got away from me: he had the curtain, and some of the money in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw a handkerchief about his neck, and another handkerchief that he had, did you see the curtain at that time with something in it - A. Yes, he had it on his arm; when he got away from the gentleman he fell down, then I got hold of him again; I got him further on and then I saw Hancock the officer.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hatton Garden office.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see any thing of this boy - A. About four o'clock in the day, in Hatton Garden, I saw Mrs. Saunders and the boy, they were making for the office, he was delivered to me with this little curtain, containing penny pieces; I searched him on the spot; I took this silk handkerchief off his neck, and a quantity of penny pieces and halfpence in his breeches pocket; I took this silk handkerchief and shirt from him; he had bought the shirt somewhere, it seemed as if it had been laying in a shop window, by the flies being upon it. I found to the amount in halfpence of one shilling and seven-pence halfpence, and six shillings in his breeches pocket, a good and a bad sixpence, which the prosecutrix swore to before the magistrate, and a piece of paper, which she said was part of the paper which the silver was wrapped up in, in her box; the curtain was delivered up to me, in it was seven shillings and eleven-pence halfpenny in copper, the major part good, they have been in my custody ever since, and he confessed having done the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about his grandmother - A. No, nor he would not say where he lived before he went to this woman; he would not answer any question.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Look at the two silk handkerchiefs - A. This is the handkerchief that was taken off his neck, there is a mark of paint on it in the middle, I know it to be mine; I have had this handkerchief a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the handkerchief that contains the shirt - A. This other handkerchief is mine, there is a small hole torn with a pin; there is none of the money I can speak to except that sixpence, this I had by me a good while, it is a very bad one, with two or three little notches in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday night Mrs. Saunders had been out all night and got tipsey, she came home at night and had her pockets full of halfpence; she pulled her halfpence out of her pocket, and laid them on the table, and let me count them. She immediately felt in her pocket for the key of her box, she could not find the key of her box; she got a knife and wrenched the hasp of the box open; she pulled the halfpence out of the box and bid me count them: I counted them and there were only fifteen shillings; she said in the box there ought to be three pound; she said I had taken the rest all but fifteen shillings, and she said she would have me taken before the justice the next day; I told her I had no more; she searched me all over, and then we went to bed that night. Then the next day she took her stall out about eleven o'clock, she had been telling me she would get Mr. Hancock to take me up. About two o'clock we had our dinner at the stall, and then she began correcting and beating me, she would let me have no dinner hardly, then I said I would not do any thing without I had my dinner; she said I should have no more dinner, and if I did not do as I should do she would have me taken up, then I told her I had none of the money, I said there were only fifteen shillings in the box. Then she sent me home with a bundle that came from the washerwoman, she gave me key of the door, I unlocked the door and put the bundle in; I brought the key back to the stall, then she sent me home again with one of the fruit baskets; I took the fruit basket down in the cellar in Mr. Constable's house; she told me to bring some apples with me as I came back, and coming back I had the misfortune to let the apples down, then she said she would take me up for letting the apples down, then she went home and got the money that I had counted the over night out of the box.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with her then - A. I was left behind wiping the apples that I had let down. She went home and got the money in her pocket; after I had got all the apples up she said she meaned to take me to Worship-street, or some other place, and have me tried; then she and the woman at the next stall were going to to lock me up in the parlour untill she had got her stall away, and got her fruit in to take me to the office. I ran away from her, and she followed me into Holborn, about Leather-lane, she stopped me there, then she was taking me to Hatton Garden, down Leather-lane she met Mr. Hancock, and she gave Mr. Hancock the fifteen shillings in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that she produced the fifteen shillings in halfpence - A. Yes. Then Mr. Hancock searched me, Mr. Hancock found in my pocket six shillings and six-pence, the six shillings and sixpence was what I took in the course of the day time at the stall in fruit; she told Mr. Hancock that I had broken open the box and took the money; then they went to a public house, and there they sat and drank together for about half an hour, Mr. Hancock and the prosecutrix, and then I was locked up at the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mrs. Saunders, did any thing pass with the prisoner about your money - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him say that you came home on the Wednesday night tipsey - A. It was no such thing, no: he never saw me count my money, I opened my box; I unlocked it, I had they key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull any halfpence out of the box to count - A. Yes, but he was never within, I never let<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310021"/>him see the inside of my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull any halfpence out of the box to count - A. Yes, but he was never within; I never let him see the inside of my box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him on the Wednesday night of having taken any money - A. No, nor I never threatened him with taking him to the justice, I never threatened him with sending for Mr. Hancock; I never knew him, I had nothing at all to accuse him, I had missed nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you had missed or not you had not told him so - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When at dinner did you correct him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you refuse to let him have any more dinner - A. No, he left part of his dinner on the stall. I said nothing to him about having him taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him home with any bundle of any washerwoman - A. No, I have no washerwoman, nor did I give him the key of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him home with a fruit basket - A. No, nor was he to bring any apples; I never sent him home by himself; I never saw him again until I saw him in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you give Hancock the halfpence - A. He fell over some stones, and the curtain with the halfpence fell out of his hand, I picked them up and gave them to Mr. Hancock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take money for you at the stall - A. No, I never left him at the stall, he was only to run of a few errands. I am sure I had this money in my box on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call the value of these two handkerchiefs - A. About three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they worth twelve pence together - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Constable, what parish is your house in - A. St. Martin's in the fields.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the night was it when this happened - A. On Sunday the 16th of September, between five and six o'clock, I was in my master's private room two story high, I went into the room about two o'clock, I remained there till it was quite dark, I had been reading, I could not see to read any longer. I left the room. I went out and returned home about nine o'clock the same night, I went into the room, I perceived some ink on the papers which were in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. The ink was in your master's writing-desk - A. Yes; it was a square desk, the ink was locked up in it; I left it on the table, when I returned the writing desk was gone, and the portfolio; and the ink was spilt on the papers, and on the window, and on the wainscoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left the window down when you went away - A. Yes, and found it shut down when I went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Now which way must this have been gone - A. It must have been taken out of the window, because the ink was running on the window, and on the leads of the counting-house; the ink when I returned was fresh on the table, on the floor, and likewise on the wainscot and on the window.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you traced it through the outside of the window - A. Yes, the ink was fresh in every place.</p>
               <p>Q. This, you say, was about nine o'clock, was it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are Mr. Atkins servant, when he is in town does he live in this house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought it was a counting house in which he does not reside - A. Sometimes he does.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into this room in which this writing desk had been left, I ask you upon your oath, did not you leave the window a part up before you went down stairs - A. No, I was particular in not leaving the window open, because the wind blew my master's papers off the table; I did not leave the window open.</p>
               <p>Q. My lord asked you what time you left the room, you said you could not see to read - A. No, I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say if your sweetheart came to the window you would know his face - if any body came to the window that you knew, you would know your friend's face - A. No, not without he came close to the window.</p>
               <p>Q. But if he would come close to the window you would know his face - A. No, not my own sister. I was obliged to light a candle to get my tea by.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are sure you shut the window, because your master's papers were on the table - A. Yes, I am sure I shut it down.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went along with the last witness Brown; he took me into a house in Brackley-street where the prisoner and a woman was, when I saw the prisoner in bed, and his wife. I then went out and beckoned Mr. Alderman Atkins's son and another man in with me. When I saw the man was at home, there came in another officer. I searched the cupboard, and in the cupboard I found this desk, some part of it, and some part under the bed. I looked the room over and found the other things that Mr. Alderman Atkins's son said belonged to his father. This is the drawer, and this is the top and sides. I found this book; this is the lock of the desk, and two ivory pens; this is a little pocket-book, a ruler, and a wafer-stamp, these I found in different parts of the room. After I got all the things together, I handcuffed the prisoner and took him before the Lord mayor. I asked the prisoner to tell me who he had them of; he said, he wished he could.</p>
               <p>- HODGSON. I am an officer. I had information from

               <p>Q. Now in regard to this window, how high is it from the ground - A. It is only one story from the ground, and two from the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact, you had left your desk in this room - A. It is my private accompting-house, and my desk was there when I left the house. I lost the desk and a large portfolio of papers; they were both left on the table on Saturday evening, the lock of the portfolio is here, as also the key of it; the key is hung to this ring by a bit of string, It was a leather portfolio, I have had it many years, the plate was worn off it, I I am positive to it being the lock. I am perfectly satisfied that this is my desk; it was made in a particular manner, the front of the desk contained Tapp and Middleton's name, who made the desk, on a card; it was here, which was taken off, so that I am positive it is my desk. This book was in the drawer, it contained some private memorandums and labelled as such, and all the memorandums that were taken down in this book were taken out; it is ruled in the margin in this manner with some precision; I can have no doubt of it. These two pens; having written a great deal with them, and having had them a great number of years, I am very positive to their being mine. This little pocket-book I can identify; I used to carry it in my waistcoat pocket. This wafer-seal I can identify likewise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What is your partners' name - A. I have none at all. All these things were within this desk.</p>
               <p>Court. You say it is up one pair of stairs - A. My private accompting-house is up one pair of stairs, the back accompting-house comes close to the window; on the leads of the back accompting-house a person can throw the sash up, and they may enter at the top of the leads.</p>
               <p>Q. How high are the leads from the ground - A. Seven feet, and the top of the leads about ten. We traced it to the lamp-lighter's ladder, and we found the ink upon the lamp-lighter's ladders but who took it we could not tell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an innocent man. Brown has been twice convicted in this court.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 22nd of August I apprehended the prisoner in Old-street, I searched her, I discovered something in her hand, she put her back against the wall; I put my hands round her and took this bag from her, it contains two hundred and thirteen counterfeit sixpences; the bag has something green upon it; I have no doubt that is by her taking the bag in her hands after being wet with aquafortis.</p>

             is my partner. I lost eight yards of Hollands jean and a piece of wrapper, on the evening of the 8th of October, about a quarter before seven o'clock, I received information by some of our men. I went into the warehouse where the porter cleaned shoes, I saw this wrapper and jean.</p>

I came into the accompting house after that, the prisoner came in half past seven, he was in the shop a little while, and after that he went down into this warehouse and stopped there two or three minutes; he then went into the cutting-room, which is another part of the warehouse, four story high. While he was gone there I went down into this warehouse, and saw the jean and wrapper was removed, in consequence of that I was sure he was the thief. I then went for an officer, and had them in the accompting house, waiting till our men went at eight o'clock; the prisoner was going, he had got the door in his hand. I called him into the accompting-house, I told him I thought he had part of our property upon him; he denied it. When the officer was coming to search him he put his hand into his inside jacket pocket, he took the jean and wrapper out, he said he only wanted an apron. I asked him what he did with the jean, he made no answer. He had lived with me eleven days.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any article that was produced that you knew to be yours - A. Yes, a large blue muslin shawl. I found the shawl in Bishopgate-street, exactly opposite of where I took the coach; it was a silk shawl, I knew it belonged to me. I went with the officer to her lodgings in the City-road, the prisoner accompanied us. I there saw a gown of Mrs. Ballin's, and a pair of bracelets; she produced them herself, and some lace that she had taken the morning she absconded, and she said she had taken four children's caps that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else found upon her - A. A silk handkerchief of Mr. Ballin's was taken off her person, the fellow half of this handkerchief we found at the pawnbroker's.

            . I am an officer. On the 5th of October I was sent for by Mr. Ballin; I found the prisoner at his house, I called her of one side, and asked her a number of questions; she denied knowing any thing of the robbery. She said she had no lodgings since she left her master's place, Mr. Ballin's; she slept any where where she could. After some time a respectable gentlewoman knocked at the door and came into the room and asked Mr. Ballin if the woman that he took in the coach had robbed him. The prisoner was by the side of me, and within hearing. Mr. Ballin said she had; she said she thought so, she saw the prisoner through a handkerchief out of the coach-door, and she saw a coachman pick it up in Bishopgate-street, near the

She said that she did rob her mistress, and that she had concealed the property in the cellar until she could get it away. She then told me that she had put her pocket-book into the pocket of the coach-door that her master had brought her in, which contained all the duplicates that she had robbed her master of. Then she told me where she lodged. Mr. Ballin and I immediately went after the coach, where she had left the pocket-book. We found the coach in the Minories.

               <p>Mr. Ballin. I took the number of the coach; I am quite sure the coach I found in the Minories was the coach I brought the prisoner in; I found the key in her pocket.</p>
               <p>Coombes. Mr. Ballin opened the coach-door, stepped into the coach, and took the pocket-book out of the pocket of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into the pocket-book and see the contents of it - A. When we came back to Mr. Ballin's we did; she then picked out the duplicates and told where the property was pawned. I then went to her lodgings, and this gown was hanging in her bed-room; it is one of Mrs. Ballin's gowns. In searching a trunk in her room we found some lace, and different things that she said she had taken from Mrs. Ballin, caps, and a pair of bracelet snaps. Then we went to Mr. Matthews's in Wheeler-street, the prisoner went with us there also.</p>

               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Those persons who perform the duty of sorting the letters, have they a writen appointment, or whether they are appointed verbally - A. They are directed verbally by the inspector; they are hired by the appointment of the Post master general.</p>
               <p>Q. Those people that carry out letters are appointed by the post master general. Do you mean that the prisoner has a written appointment from the post master general. Confine yourself to the question I ask you who is the person that employs him, who gives him the direction to act - A. I was the person who gave him the direction that morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Is there any paper by which he is appointed by the post master - A. No such paper is directed to me, they are frequently appointed by personal application. I have no right to employ them without directions from the secretary.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he perform any particular duty, only the delivering letters at the water-side, or is he the general servant of the post office - A. It is his particular duty to deliver letters on board ships in the river Thames.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you had ordered him to carry letters within London in any of the twelve divisions - A. I should not have directed him to any other part of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose act is it to appropriate that - A. In consequence of previous instructions from the secretary I appropriate this duty to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you ever employ persons who are specially appointed upon special service to carry letters within London - A. We do, occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have your pleasure or have directions from the post master that a man is to be employed upon such particular service, how came he to be employed in delivering letters on board the ships - A. That was in consequence of his father having been a waterman, and he succeeded this business at his father's death.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose appointment. What had you to tell you that he was to deliver letters on board of the ships - A. I had verbal instructions from the secretary or a a written order which I do not know. He has been employed about two years. Besides delivering letters on board the ships he has occasionally delivered letters between there and London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he occasionally sorted letters - A. Yes, he does what we order him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. And he received pay during this time for carrying letters - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. You did not see him in the act of sorting that day assisting John - A. I do not recollect seeing him that day. On other days I have seen him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then sorting is part of his duty under your immediate order - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether he is a sorter or a deliver of letters is under your command - A. Yes, I could not remove him from delivering letters on board the ships because I had no other in his place.</p>
               <p>Q. But it rests with you to sort letters or to deliver - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. That day it was his function to deliver - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner remained in his lodgings or was he off - A. I do not know; I saw Simpson at night, he called me out of the house, and asked me if I would go with him; I told him no, he said he had a coach waiting.</p>
               <p>Q. And from that time you have seen nothing of him. A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You do not mean to be accurate whether it was two twenty's, or a forty pound note - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not with him on the 20th of August at the post office - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Attorney General. Look at these notes, and say whether they were of that description you see, there are four there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now neither of these is the last note you carried, because upon the last you have written your name, there are four there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look over them, I say, whether they are of the description<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310028"/>that you carried, as far as you can recollect - A. I only took three twenty's, there are four there.</p>
               <p>Q. You took one on the 20th, you took another two or three days afterwards - A. Yes, I did</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took, you said, either a forty or two twenty's - A. Yes; and then I took the other twenty, but I believe it was a single forty that I took</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to believe it was a forty - A. Because I recollect what I had in my hand, and seeing the clerk take it up as a forty.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given an account of this before - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now recollect yourself, and tell me whether you believe it was a forty pound note or two twenty's - A. I believe it was a forty pound.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always believed it was a forty pound - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do not let any advantage be taken, answer deliberately, answer correctly; do you believe it was a forty pound note for which you received that forty pound bank note - A. I believe it was one forty pound; I could not swear that it was a forty pound, I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said it was a forty before Mr. Parkins - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told Mr. Parkins before that it was a forty, now let me have that answer deliberately: do you repeat that you told Mr. Parkins that was a forty pound note, that you carried to Smith, Payne and Company - A. Yes; I told Mr. Parkins so at his house last Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand you to say, that last Monday you told Mr. Parkins at his house, that you carried to Smith, Payne and Company a note for forty pound, and received for that note a forty pound note - A. I am certain I told him that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say it was two twenty's - A. I might say it, but I was not certain whether it was a forty pound note or two twenty's. I might have told him it was two twentys, but I am not sure I told him it was two twenty's</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say you are sure you did not - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive any other forty pound note of Smith, Payne and Company - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you received the forty pound bank note; you either payed two twenty's or a forty pound note - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Look at these notes, the twenty's, you cannot swear to either of them - A. No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that the note marked C 978 that was paid on the 20th of August - A. It is; and a similar note, 625 C, on the 22nd of that month; it was paid on the 22nd of August.</p>
               <p>Q. 259 B and 693 A - A. They were paid on the 25th of August.</p>

               <p>Q. How were they paid - A. Another gentleman will prove that; I am able to say they were paid on the 25th of August, by posting the notes on the ledger, the notes came to me in the regular course of business in an interior office, as being received that day.</p>
               <p>Q. These two notes appear to have been paid together - A. They do, according to the manner they are posted; they follow each other. There is a possibility that they may not have been paid together, but they follow each other; I suppose them to be paid together.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember on the afternoon of the 25th of August; two twenty pound notes being paid - A. I remember a note or notes of Mansfield, Miller, and Company, being paid on the 25th of August. I remember a 40 l. bank note; it was paid on Mansfield, Miller, and Co. but whether it was a 40 l. or two 20 l. s, I cannot say. I merely put the account in the cash-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Sir, be so good as to look upon the back of one of these notes; you see 40 written upon one of them. A. Here is 40 l. written upon the back of the second note; it appears to be my writing; if the two notes came to me in the course of business. I should write the figure 40 l. on the back of the other; if it had, been a single note that I had paid, I should not have wrote any thing, but merely have put it on a file. Suppose twenty times twenty had come to me, I should have wrote 200 l.; that 40 l. wrote indicates that it was one transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the bank-note that you paid. - A. 3 m 88, 16th August, 1810.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say the marking of 40 l. shews that it was a transaction of 40 l. - A. It shews that I paid for it a 40 l. bank-note, and that it was one transaction. I have got the original entry made by myself. I paid a banknote, 40 l. 16th August, 1810. The bank note tallies in number and date exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner at the bar there and when - A. Yes, on the 8th and 9th of October last, he came there I believe on the 8th; I am not positive to the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember his giving you any directions on the 9th of October - A. On the 9th of October, between three and four in the afternoon, he gave me directions to take the check in question to the bankers for payment, he said to Sikes's and company in Mansion-house-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the amount of the check - A. One hundred and three pounds twelve shillings, and if I received large notes, I was then to go to the Bank and endorse them in my own name, or the name of Leech, and to get small notes, one's or two's. I accordingly went to the <rs id="t18101031-21-viclabel126" type="occupation">banker</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you get payment of it - A. No, I did not. I was then desired to wait till one of the gentlemen came out. On the gentleman's return he desired me to tell the person that gave me the check to come for the money himself. I then went home, leaving the check there. Before I had gone home Mr. Nalder the city marshal came up to me and asked are some questions about the prisoner; I went back to the White Horse, Mr. Nalder promised to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310030"/>meet me there; I happened to be there first; I then went up stairs to the prisoner and informed him of the message I had received from Messrs. Sikes's, which was, that he was to come to receive the money himself, upon which he answered, then I know what to do: I then came down stairs, leaving the prisoner up stairs; I found Mr. Nalder waiting down stairs, I conducted Mr. Nalder to the prisoner, and he immediately apprehended him. Then I accompanied Mr. Nalder and the prisoner to the Compter. In our way to the Compter the prisoner appeared to be quite ignorant of his situation, he seemed to be quite stupefied, he appeared to be insensible of the situation he was in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. He said that he knew what to do, did not be add that he received the check with some others of a traveller in the country - A. No, I did not hear him say that.</p>

I was; I found the prisoner there, I met him coming out of the room he slept in, No. 28, up two pair of stairs; I immediately took hold of him, and told him he must go with me; he asked me who I was, I immediately told him my name and the situation I held in the city; he then asked me what I wanted with him, I told him he must go to Mansion-house street with me; he almost immediately shammed to be extremely drunk.</p>

I desired Colton to take hold of his arm; we took him down stairs, and from thence put him into a coach, and conveyed him to the banking house. Colton went with me in the coach. Upon getting into the banking-house, I took him into a back room of Mr. Snaith's banking house and searched him; I found upon him three drafts, purporting to be drafts drawn upon Snaith and Co. all of them signed, Stokes and Hodgson, payable to different people, one for the sum of eighty-three pound twelve shillings, another seventy-eight pound twelve shillings and sixpence, another twenty-sixpound twelve shillings, and another draft not quite complete, in as much as the figures are not complete in the body of the draft. It is directed to Sikes and Co. purporting to be signed by Stokes and Hodgson.</p>

On the 16th of September, I came to London about noon, at two o'clock; I went to the Half-moon tavern, Grace-church-street. I left the tavern, probably, between ten and eleven; I had drank too much wine with my sea acquaintance. I saw the prisoner in Leadenhall-street, she urged me to accompany her, she said, to a respectable home.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know at all that you had any property about you when you left the tavern - A. I do know it, because one of these gentlemen, an East India officer, requested to see what money I had about me, I being far advanced in liquor; I told him two hundred pound. I had two hundred pound and three pound; there was one hundred pound note, two fiftys, they were in my pocket book; and three ones I had loose in my pocket.

               <p>Q. Did you stay there that night - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there and person in the room with you in which you staid - A. None whatever; until she went away the prisoner any myself were the only people.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in any company with females in the house - A. None, but the old woman of the house. When we asked for a bed-room the old woman was out; she came in; I told her I had two hundred pound about me; as a matter of precaution, I took out my pocket book and counted the notes over before the old woman; she saw me put up the notes again in the interior of my pocket book, and return it into the same pocket. After that the girl sat down on the left hand, I sat down in a chair; I felt myself sick; I was in a dozing state; I requested her to send for some oysters; and as I was dozing, I felt the prisoner feeling about me, she was sitting on my left hand, and my pocket book was in my left hand pocket. I felt myself very sick. The girl expressed a desire to go down stairs, for necessity, as I understood, for a minute, I supposed she would return again, and her remaining so long created suspicion; she did not come back to me at all. felt in my pocket, the two hundred pound<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310032"/>in notes were gone, and the loose notes were remaining. The old woman came in about two minutes afterwards, and asked where the girl was; I told her she was gone and the property also.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found the notes again - A. One of them for one hundred pound; I saw it in the hands of the Lord Mayor. It corresponded with the number of the note. I went to Down, Thornton, and Co. and got the number. I had them by a check of Mr. Gill.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this you saw the prisoner - A. In two or three days, I saw her at the Mansion-house.</p>

            . I live at No. 1, Still-alley, Houndsditch. I have known the young woman at the bar seven years, in the same way of life as described. On the 6th of October, between ten and eleven at night, I was out; when I came home, the last witness and prisoner were at my house, he appeared drunk when he spoke to me; he said, he wished for a bed for the night, but that bed, was not clean enough for him; the woman made answer, Mrs. Hill will put all on clean for you, if you wish to stop for the night. He said the young woman smelled of onions; he desired me to fetch any thing she liked to take the smell of the onions off; she chused brandy; he pulled out his pocket-book, the prisoner said, give me leave to open it, she pulled out silver to the amount of eleven shillings and sixpence; he ordered me to take the money and to get something the lady chused; she said, why was he to give me all the money, and she to have nothing for her trouble; he then said he had plenty of money; he had two hundred pound about him. The woman made an agreement with the gentleman for a pound note, she said so, and he too; she requested the money, he did not give the money, he said he despised the idea of being asked for the money on the over night. She then asked me whether I thought the gentleman would pay her in the morning, if she slept with him; he then pulled his pocket book out, I saw some money, they were all new notes; he turned up the notes; he said, old woman, there is an hundred pound note, one fifty, and I said three ones; I told him I could not read writing. The black part of the note, in which the sum is engraved, appeared to extend a good way in the note. He then ordered the bed to be made; I made it, they seemed to be comfortable together; he ordered her to take any thing she thought proper for supper; she ordered oysters and some porter I brought them in together; I had got the brandy and left them together, and went for the oysters, and I drank some brandy with them. When I returned with the oysters the prisoner was gone, she did not return all night. The prosecutor sat in the chair, he said, the prisoner had used him very well, she had got all; I insisted upon his shewing me the pocket-book, he did, the notes were all gone. The prosecutor staid in my house all night. I did not see the prisoner till she was before the Lord mayor.</p>

I followed him into the house he went to; I found him in the room of his brother. Leadbetter told him that he had come there for some soap; the room was dark, they seemed confused, they denied that there was any soap there at all. Then Leadbetter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310033"/>went to the desk and found the soap. Thomas Kelly said, he was very sorry, it was the first he had taken.</p>

               <p>Q. At whose expence is this prosecution carrying on - A. I do not know; I cannot pay it, I am quite certain I know the men</p>
               <p>- LLOYD. I am an engine maker, I work for Mr. Harland, in Fenchurch-street. On the 3rd of September last, I was passing by Bartholomew square, I was going to St. Martin le-grand, I heard a lady, within a few yards of me, scream violently; she said, stop thief. I turned round and saw the prisoner, Trueman, run away from her; at the time that I first saw the prisoner running, I might be the distance from the prisoner to the other side of the court. He was running towards Smithfield: he ran from Bartholomew-square to the corner of Hosier-lane. It was a dark place and no lamps lit; he observed two or three people coming up, I was close to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever out of your sight - A. Never. At the corner of Hosier-lane he saw two or three people coming up, he turned and went towards the George-inn. At the time that he was at the corner of Hosier-lane, he threw the watch down Hosier-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the George-inn - A. The George Inn is about the middle way in Smithfield. At the corner of Hosier-lane, he seemed to throw something out of his hand, and it seemed to me to be a watch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you think at the time that it was a watch - A. Yes. I pursued him exactly to the George Inn, he made a stop as if he had been shot. I immediately ran up against him, and collared him, and said, he was the person that committed the robbery; the prisoner, Trueman, said, he was not the person; I made answer, and said, he was. I took him in custody by the collar. When I had him five minutes in my custody, the lady came up, she said, that is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>COURT. You mean the young woman that gave her evidence - A. Yes. I then told him he must go with me into the public-house, the George Inn. I immediately took him into the George Inn, he went quietly with me.</p>

               <p>Q. When she accused him of being the person that robbed her, did he say any thing - A. He made no answer. When I got into the George, I took him by the side of the fire, I had hold of his collar, I had him about five minutes there; when the lady came in, and said, you are the man that robbed me; he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the young woman repeated it that he was the man - A. Yes. I still kept hold of him; in a few minutes, a person came in, and said, is the lady here, has she lost any thing; I said, yes; she said, I am here, I have lost my watch. He immediately made answer, make yourself easy, here is a person here that has got your watch; he produced the watch with half the chain, the chain was broke in two; half of the chain was hanging to the watch the other part was lost. They then said, they would find the rest, probably, if they took a candle and lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found - A. Yes, by a little girl, and it was produced; they might be the best part of half an hour gone. I insisted upon going for a constable; there were several people came up to me and said d - n your eyes, let him go, the lady has got her watch, what does she want more. I immediately said, I will not let him go until he was secured; then Finnagin came up and said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310035"/>will not deliver the watch up until I deliver it up to a magistrate, or into the officer's hands. Griffin, the constable, came and said, you will assist me to take him to the Poultry Compter. Griffin and I went to take him to the Poultry Compter. When we came to the corner of Hosier-lane, the prisoner said, what do you hold me by the collar for. I said, to make secure of you; and immediately I said the word he, the prisoner, kick'd my heels up, and slipped upon me, and the officer on the prisoner. There was a party pulled the officer away, and I held the prisoner by his legs. I arose up as soon as I could, and then I found one or two that came to my assistance; the prisoner did not effect his escape. I was no sooner up than I was knocked down on the same spot, and dragged twenty or thirty yards to the pens.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that by the prisoner - A. By the prisoner and fifteen or sixteen that there were in the gang. I then got up again, and dragged the prisoner towards Mr. Gent's, a public-house. I desired Mr. Gent to let me in; he said he would let no thieves be brought in there, and shut the door. I was then dragged into the pens. I had still hold of the prisoner. When I was standing at Mr. Gent's door, a party came up and said, d - n your eyes, cut his coat, and let him slip away. At that time I had hold of his coat and waistcoat; they cut his coat round and said, d - n your eyes, cut his bloody arm off and hamstring him. I let go then and fell down, and got hold of him by the thighs; they then immediately dragged me into the pens again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the constable still assisting you - A. Yes; and when I got up again which was in about ten minutes; I found one of the constable wrestling for a stick; I had still hold of him; the prisoner said to the constable, d - n your eyes, let go the stick; the constable said, I will not. When there was a cry of hamstring them, the constable gave a wrench and got the stick out of the prisoner's hands. I then began to drag the prisoner towards the folding gates of the George public-house; there were more collected together; then the number of the gang had increased, with knives drawn and sticks, and they said, throw him over. When I got to the gate, I heard a voice say, throw him backwards, or throw him over. When I turned round, I saw a man stand at a small wicket door; I then took and threw the prisoner's heels up, threw him in there, and fell upon him; somebody cried out, you will break my leg; I said never mind your leg, shut the door. I took him into the public-house, and Griffin the constable came in; I said you must have this man more secure if we take him another time. Griffin got a cord and tied his arms behind him. There was a person came up, and asked the prisoner to have a glass of ale; that person is not taken; I saw him from first to last attempting to rescue him; he said, where does your mother live; he told him; he said he would go and let his mother know; the landlord said, I will let your mother know. We got a coach, and four constables were procured; we got him into the coach, I never let him go, and when we got out of the yard they gave a great shout, and just as we got out of the yard, some one cried out, damn you, stick true, we will have him yet. The coach was brought within the great gate down to the lower part of the public-house; this took place after the coach go through the gates; we proceeded to about the middle of Smithfield; I had hold of the prisoner by the collar in the coach, the coach doors were forced open; I received four or five blows here between my neck and right shoulder by a stick; I then said to some of the constables, give me a stick that I might defend myself; he got it back again in half a minute; I held the coach door by the tassel; the coach stopped all of a sudden; I learned that they cut the reins; the coachman proceeded as far as Newgate-street; I told the coachman if he did not go on, we would blow his brains out; we had no fire-arms. When we got into Newgate-street, the coachman got off his box and went to ride his horses; when he went to ride his horses he found the traces were out; he drove about five yards; when the coach came down altogether; the main braces of the springs had been cut; the constables all then jumped out, excepting me and Griffin, and the prisoner, leaving the prisoner in my care and Griffin; in the course of six or seven minutes, Bray came up; he said, Oh, they have broke my arm; and I am cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Bray one of the persons who were assisting you in conveying the prisoner - A. Yes; immediately Griffin jumped out of the coach the prisoner and me were left alone; there were a number of coaches passed; they would not stop and take the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this gang about you - A. Yes, some of them who had been assisting us had gone off to the Poultry Compter; when they returned Stanton came with a brace of pistols. I still keeping hold of the prisoner, the prisoner began to cry, when Stanton came up to the coach-door. He had not been there above a minute; the man who had given, the prisoner a glass came up; I immediately said to Stanton, that is the man that attempted to rescue him; drive him away; Stanton immediately put a pistol to him and said, if he did not go away, he would blow his brains out. I handed the prisoner out of that coach into another, with two or three more officers with me. We were obliged to turn and take him into Giltspur-street Compter. The gang at that time had encreased to the amount of thirty; one of the knives they threw up against a tradesman's window in Newgate-street. It was about half past nine when we got to Giltspur-street Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the time that you left the George - A. About eight o'clock; it was about an hour and an half before we got him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is the man that ran from the prosecutrix to Hosier-lane - A. I am positive of it. When he had got hold of the officer's stick, he struck me, and said, d - n your eyes, let me go; he broke my nose, and gave me two black eyes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The first you heard was the cry of stop thief - A. The first I heard was a scream, and then stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the lamps lit - A. The day-light was sufficient to see the features of any man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Are you sure from the first to the last that he was the same person - A. Yes.</p>

I went with the person that came for me to the George, I found a number of people about the door, I asked where the prisoner was, Lloyd had him in custody, he had got hold of his collar; I told him I was an officer; I requested the name of the person that kept hold of the prisoner, and the lady that lost the watch, and the person that found the watch; they gave me their names; I told the prisoner if he would go quietly I would neither tie him nor handcuff him; the prisoner said he was innocent, he would go quietly; I told Lloyd to aid and assist me in taking the prisoner to the Compter. On my looking round the room I saw Bray near the door, I said, Bray, assist me with this prisoner; he gave me his assistance. We came out with the prisoner, and a great number of people after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were with the last witness Lloyd, you have heard the account that Lloyd has given of the attempt to rescue the prisoner, is that the truth - A. It is exactly the truth, but he has not mentioned when I was thrown across some hurdles. Here is the watch, here is the coat of the prisoner's that was cut, and here is one of the knives. This knife was knocked out of some persons hand, that were engaged in this affray I have every reason to believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How many knives do you suppose you saw drawn in the attempt to rescue this prisoner - A. Seven or eight drawn knives. This is the watch that I received from Finnagin, this is the side of the coat that Lloyd had hold of; it is Trueman's coat, they cut it, and he slipped out of it. We at last secured him, after undergoing this violence.</p>

            . I am a box-carrier to Bartholomew Hospital. The prosecutrix has been under my protection because of the gang coming about her house. I was in Bartholomew Hospital about half after six, I heard the cry of stop thief; I run; I saw the prisoner Trueman run; he was running, to go across Smithfield, I pursued him, and was very near to him when one of the gang knocked me down, just by Hosier-lane; when I was within two or three yards I was knocked down; I got up again; while I was down several of the gang tumbled over me, picked my pocket, and turned both of my pockets inside out. I went to the house where they dragged the prisoner, in the George. At the George a coach was sent for, I assisted Griffin in the first attempt to get him into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have heard the violence that Lloyd has described to endeavour so rescue this man - A. It is true, and it was me that was cut; I stated that my arm was broke; I received a violent blow on my arm by a stick while I was in the coach, and my fingers were cut by a knife.</p>
               <p>COURT. How many knives do you think you saw drawn - A. There were a great many, I cannot say how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there were so many as twenty - A. I dare say there was, and a great numbers of sticks, which appeared to be broken from the hurdles in Smithfield. On our coming to the Compter the prisoner Trueman, when he had got Griffin across the hurdles, he said d - n your eyes, hamstring the b - s. They had got Griffin across the hurdles, trying to wrench the stick out of his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there persons with knives drawn at the time - A. Yes; I knocked two of them down with the stick that I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the opportunity of seeing any person besides the prisoner Trueman - A. There were two of them had been patients in the hospital, but as soon as they saw me they withdrew.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you ever see those persons that drew their knives, do your best endeavours to have them taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did you see Holbrook that evening - A. I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day you were before the sitting aldermen - A. I was, I was outside of the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the other prisoner there - A. I do, he was standing among the concourse of people that came up with the prisoner; there were several in fustian jackets, I believe they were of the gang, and there was a nudge made at the elbow, one among the other, immediately one in a fustian jacket came up and asked if I was not the young man that was cut on the Sunday night; I said no, I was waiting for a letter for the hospital; I turned-round and immediately saw the young man that was assisting me on the Sunday evening, his name is Huggins; he said, that is the young man that struck me; Holbrook walked down Blackwell-hall, I followed him and took him by the collar, one of the officers came up immediately to my assistance, and brought him into the office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Holbrook made no resistance to you - A. None.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect being at the George in Smithfield on the night of the robbery - A. Yes, Jackson sent for me, I directly went, When I came there I found Trueman in custody, I saw Holbrook there, I am quite certain I saw him there; I received a violent blow from Holbrook; I was aiding and assisting the officer to get Trueman into the George Inn gateway, just before the coach was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a blow with a stick or with his fist - A. His fist.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given any sort of offence to Holbrook - A. None at all; I had hold of Trueman at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your attention was entirely taken up by holding of Trueman - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever been Holbrook before this night - A. Never before this night. I saw Holbrook very busy at Hosier-lane in trying to rescue Trueman away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310037"/>from the officers before he struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing more of Holbrook that night - A. Not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you were at Guildhall - A. Yes; I saw Holbrook there, he was standing in the crowd along with some more, there were six or seven together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether either of these persons he was standing with were any of the persons that were attempting to rescue Trueman - A. I cannot say, he was conversing with these persons; as soon as Mr. Bray saw him he said he believed that is the young man that attempted to rescue Trueman away; Bray said that to me; I knew him when he was pointed out by Bray directly; I have no doubt but he is the person: I am convinced that he was one of the persons; I had no doubt then.</p>

            . Q. You are an officer belonging to the city of London - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information this night you went to Smithfield - A. Yes, I did, a little after eight; I took a brace of pistols with me; I run as fast as I could towards Smithfield, when I got down Newgate-street, about half way, I saw a coach surrounded by a mob; when I got to the coach there were some that knew me, they said, stop him; I took no heed of that, I pulled out my pistols, I put them on the half cock; some one tried to stop me, I said, if any one of you try to stop me; I will blow your brains out; I got towards the coach door, they were fighting with sticks; they were striking at the coach with sticks, trying to rescue him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of knowing them that were around - A. No; when I got to the coach door there was one of them pointed out to me; I told him if he did not go away I would fire at him; I told them that were in the coach not to fear, I would lose my life before they should rescue him; they tried to shove me under the coach, I put my back against the coach and said, the first that comes I will shoot him.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the state of the coach when you came up at first - A. It was cut down, the body was hanging on the axle tree. I spoke to the coaches that came past, they would not take him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the traces of the horses cut - A. Yes, they could not go on any farther.</p>
               <p>COURT. And this in the very heart of the city - A. Yes, just by Warwick-lane. When I looked in the coach window I knew him, I said, it is you! When the coach came up that I got to stop, the prisoner said, I will come out with you; I got him into the coach. After we got him into Giltspur-street Compter Griffin said to me, there is a man that you turned away that gave him some ale, I should like to have that man, he is gone to his mother's. We went to this Trueman's mother that lives in Long-lane; I was on one side of the way and Griffin was going to knock at the door; it is very near the corner of the timber-yard; I was along with Huggins, Griffin was on the other side of the way, I saw three of them together, I saw a person exactly of the size of Holbrook; he was beating his his coat as if he had fell down in the dirt; he said d - n his eyes, if it had not been for that b - r at the Compter, we should have had him away.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs Jackson. Is that the watch that you were robbed of that evening - A. Yes, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long have you had it - A. About two months; there is Winfield inside of it, I bought it of Mr. Huggins.</p>
               <p>Court. It is Wakefield - A. It is Wakefield or Winfield; I am sure it is my watch, I gave two guineas for it.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the last day he was working with you at Chelmsford - A. The last day that he was on my premises was on Sunday morning the 23d of September. I was just come out of my garden to go to church, it was about half after ten. He had worked for me about six or seven weeks, and during the time he has been with me he has always behaved very civil, and worked hard.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was in the course of the same week that you received the news that he was taken up - A. I received a letter from him dated in prison; the first letter that I received from him he said that he hoped to be down in a few days; the second letter I received from him dated in prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the last day you saw him was Sunday the 23d of September - A. I am sure, because I received a letter from him on the Tuesday afterwards, saying he would soon be down; this is the letter, dated the 25th of September.</p>

When I received the letter, dated in prison, I looked into my book to see what was the last day I paid him the eight shillings; that was on the 23d; he worked with me till Saturday the 22d; I paid him part of his wages on the Saturday, and because I had no silver, I paid him the rest on the Sunday morning.</p>

That was the next Wednesday after I drove the prisoner to London.</p>
               <p>Q. When you so saw him before the sitting Alderman did you call to your mind any circumstance in the course of your journey, and so on, calling to your mind the conversation that passed on the coach which he related before the Alderman - A. It was dusk when he got on.</p>
               <p>Q. He related the conversation, which convinced you that he was the person - A. Yes, he related every word that was mentioned on the coach from the time he got on till he came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for him to mention that without his being the person you brought up - A. I think it is impossible. I took him up, about half after six o'clock, at the fourteen mile stone. I have no recollection of his person.</p>

Ann Harrowin had them to wash, she did not return them; I gave them her to wash on the latter end of September or the beginning of October; she was to return them in the course of a week; I applied to her for them, and she appointed a time that they should be ready, she said they were not in the house, but they were perfectly safe, and she sent the duplicates.</p>

            . I am a fruiterer in the City-road. On the 1st of September, in the morning about seven, I saw two baskets of peaches and nectarines exposed to sale in Spitalfields market, I asked Cracknell who they belonged to, he said, the person they belonged to was gone into the city, he believed the price was five shillings a basket, but he would not venture to sell them untill the owner came; during this time, Norris, the prisoner, came up and stood against the post close by, I knew him by sight perfectly well, I immediately went to purchase some other fruit, and turning round, I saw the prisoner with the two baskets of fruit on his arm; they were the same baskets; he was then nearly behind Cracknell's cart; I went up to him and asked him if they were for sale, he said no, he had just bought them. As I never saw him buy fruit before, it astonished me very much; I instantly went to Cracknell and informed him of it, we both concluded they were stolen, we did not think ourselves authorized to stop him. When the prosecutor came, I informed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A, He went behind a row of carts and disappeared.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been thirty five-years in Spitalfields market, and always got my bread in an honest way; I was in the market every morning afterwards, and was not taken untill a month afterwards.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Thursday evening, the 20th of September, the prisoner came into my shop, he asked to look at some silk handkerchiefs; I shewed him a great many, I told him the price of one he was looking at, was five shillings and sixpence; he said, it was higher than he could go to; he spoke English to me, I understood him very well. He fixed upon another, I told him four shillings; he said, he was a poor man; said, he should have it for three shillings and sixpence, what it cost me; after I had cut the handkerchief off, and he had agreed to give three shillings and sixpence, he offered me half a crown. I then told him that I thought he came in to steal not to buy, I bid him go out. I did not miss the handkerchiefs till the next morning; the constable brought it to my house; he asked me if I had lost any thing, and produced two silk handkerchiefs; they had my private mark, and they were the same I had shewn him.</p>

He wanted me to stay away from my duty to eat beef steaks and onions with him, he would pay all expences, I told him I could not do that. I went to the London Docks, and he went with me; I prevailed upon him to leave me, he did. When I had done my duty, I went to my landlady, and told her what had transpired, and in consequence of my landlady's advice, I went into the Three Crowns; I told the prosecutor of this.

I told the constable I suspected he had robbed me; the constable shewed his authority; the prisoner then put his hands into his pocket and pulled out a wicker bottle with a silver cap, a hair brush, two wooden snuff boxes, a small silver box, two pieces of soap, and two silk purses, the other articles were found at his lodgings. The prisoner asked me if I would grant him one favour, to permit him to go to Westminster-bridge and throw himself over, he wished to drown himself; I told him I could not comply with that request; we took him to the watchhouse.

            . I am a servant to Mr. Jarman; on the 11th of October my master sent me to Bishop Stortford in Hertfordshire, to look after the horse; I met Mr. Dalby, a horse dealer, between Sapworth and Bishop Stortford; the prisoner was in company with him. Mr. Dalby asked me how I came there; I told him we had lost the brown horse, and I was coming to speak to him, to see if I could find him. Mr. Dalby said, it was of no use my going any further; to turn back; the prisoner asked me whose horse it was; I said Mr. Jarman's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. Yes, he had lived some years near Newington. The prisoner said, you know me; I said yes, I know you. Mr. Dalby and I and the prisoner came a little way along the road as we expected; Mr. Dalby turned his head, the prisoner was gone; he had left his horse that he was riding before on the road; Mr. Dalby and I turned back towards the way the prisoner was gone; we proceeded into a field over a gate, where we supposed he had gone. Mr. Dalby found the prisoner in the field where he expected, a little way from the hedge, in the ditch; it was a bushy place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you he was endeavouring to conceal himself - A. Yes; Mr. Dalby called me; I went and assisted in bringing him down the field. He said, I have done the crime, and I must suffer for it; then we took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you see your master's horse - A. I saw the horse on the Saturday afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I never saw him before the 11th of October; on the 11th of October I saw the prisoner; I am sure it is the man. On the 10th of October I slept at Harlow town; on the 11th I saw the prisoner at Sapworth, about six o'clock in the morning; he was walking and leading a brown horse; about two hundred yards before I overtook him, he turned under a shed where there was a rack and manger, as if he was going to feed the horse. I said, my friend, are you going to the fair with this horse; he said yes; I said, where did you bring this horse from; he said Rumford, it is my brother's; his name is Cook, he keeps a few cows, and draws the milk about with this horse; he has lately gone blind, and is shy when the lamps are lit; he will not stand still, he runs back. I asked him to pull the horse from under the shed; he did; he asked fourteen guineas for the horse; I asked him to run the horse; I could not cough him; I thanked him for the look of the horse; I went on. The horse was sold at Bishop Stortford fair to Wright; before I saw the prisoner there he sold the horse to Wright, a man that I hired to take care of my horses; Wright tied the horse up with mine; a gentleman asked the price of the horse; I sold him to Mr. Gutheridge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Wright bought the horse for you, did not he - A. He bought him and paid for it; before I saw him I sold the horse to Mr. Gutheridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the last witness Redwood, coming to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the conversation pass that Redwood said - A. Yes; he was riding upon a mare then; after he had sold this horse he purchased a mare, and was riding upon that; I found the prisoner in the ditch among the bushes a Redwood has described; he left the horse in the road; I went into two or three fields before I found him. When Mr. Jarman saw the horse he claimed it; that is the horse that Wright bought, and I afterwards sold to Mr. Gutheridge. Mr. Jarman and I went down on the 11th, and Gutheridge gave it up.</p>

               <p>Q. What change did you get for the five pound note - A. Four one pound notes, fifteen shillings in silver, and a five shilling paper of halfpence I was coming home; I was within five or six doors of my master's house; the prisoner came up to me; he said, they think this is a bad note; he had a paper in his hand; it turned out to be a lottery bill; he said, I must give him the change again, and before I had time to speak, he snatched the four one pound notes and the halfpence out of my hand. I had the notes in my hand with my hand in my pocket. I had the fifteen shillings and the halfpence in the other hand; he took the notes and the paper of halfpence, and ran away directly.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had a paper in his hand - A. Yes; when he took the notes and the paper of halfpence he shoved the paper into my hand; then he run up Air-street. I looked at the paper; it turned out to be a lottery bill; I hollowed out stop thief several times; he was stopped by Mr. Friend. I am sure the prisoner is the man; I never lost sight of him; he was stopped in Air-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not observed him in the baker's shop, either in the shop or about the shop; had you - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LAWRENCE. I am a baker in Air-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that young man coming for change at your shop - A. Yes, on Saturday night the 6th of October; it was a five pound note I changed for him. I gave him four one pound notes, fifteen shillings in silver, and five shillings in copper. I did not see the prisoner in the shop or about the shop; there were four notes shewn to me afterwards, but whether they were the notes I cannot say.</p>

            . I am a dealer in household furniture. On the 20th of last month the prisoner came to me; he said he had some goods to dispose of. I went with him to No. 6, Off Alley, in the Strand, to look at them, he took me up to the attic story; he shewed me a number of houshold goods that he had to dispose of; I took an inventory of them: a field bedstead, three mahogany boards, some odd pieces, six deal ends, a portable desk, two mahogany pillars and claws, a mahogany two-leaved table, five mahogany chairs, and one arm ditto, a wainscot table with a drawer, eighteen locks and keys, ten table castors, a table latch, and a thousand brass nails; he asked me eleven pounds for them; I asked him if that was the price he meaned to sell them for; he said yes; I told him they were worth more money; if he would make an inventory of them and bring it over to me at one o'clock, I would buy them of him if I could; he came at half past twelve, and said he had made a grand mistake; he asked twenty pounds for them; I offered him nineteen pounds; he went across the court, came back again, and said I should have them for the nineteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q, Went across what court - A. Old Round Court in the Strand. He left me the key of the room where the goods were deposited, and I was to take them away on the Monday morning, and pay him for them. I suspected they were not come honestly by, I went to Mr. Sheppard, and he found out Mr. Cox; Mr. Cox came to me on the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Mr. Cox to the room where these goods were deposited - A. I went with Mr. Cox and Lack, an officer of Bow-street, to the place where he had shewn me the goods. We went to apprehend the prisoner. The goods were left in the care of the officer. I was there when he took part of them away after the prisoner was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any feather bed there, mattress and pillows - A. No, there was not, they were at No. 10,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310043"/>Charles-court.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never sold you them - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the value of the held bedstead - A. Two pound six shillings, the mahogany boards and pieces might be worth about four pound, the deal ends, half a crown each, the portable desk, two pound eight shillings, the tea tray, five shillings, the mahogany pillars and claws, a pound each, the two leafed table, a pound, the five mahogany chairs together with the arm shair, five guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the arm chair worth by itself - A. Thirty-six shillings, the wainscot table and claw five shillings; eighteen locks and keys, and ten claw castors, a guinea and a half, a thousand brass nails, about four shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go with the last witness to Off-alley - A. Yes, and Lack the officer; I went with them on the day he was apprehended to the house in Off-alley; Mr. Aker took me up into a garret, and shewed me some furniture that had been offered him for sale; and the whole of the furniture in that room was mine except one article that belonged to the landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it - A. It was part taken away and part taken to a room in St. Martin's-lane, part of it is here; this desk is part of it; I can swear to it being my property, it cost me forty-eight or forty-nine shillings, this is a reception table, this was in the same room, it cost me I think two guineas, I am sure it did not cost me less than two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the circumstances that enables you with certainty to say that desk is yours - A. From its general appearance it had been cleaned up by the prisoner while in my employ. I also examined my stock book after the prisoner was apprehended; I looked at my stock and saw it was missing, the reception table is particularly marked, it was rubbed by going in a cart to a gentleman, and the tea-board has my own private mark upon it; the knife tray is mine, the bottom part was made out of a slab, a slab is the outside board, and part of the slab remains. The other things were found at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. The things that were at Off-alley are the things that we are now enquiring about - When did you go to his lodgings - A. The same afternoon; they were in Charles-court very near Off-alley leading out of the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was his lodgings - A. I went to the master that he had lived with before. This pewter jug, a clothes horse, and a hearth-broom, was found there; the jug is worth four shillings, the clothes horse five shillings, and the hearth brush two shillings and sixpence; that is all we brought here, the magistrate did not think it necessary to bring the whole. We found numerous other articles at his lodging in Charles-court, a feather bed, bolster, and pillow; I have no hesitation of the tick being mine, there was no mark on the feather-bed, I had missed the article, a feather pillow, a bolster case, and a mattrass. The bed and mattras were wrapped round with two pieces of wrapper that I could speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. That might be, he might have your wrapper about some other persons bed - A. There were some carpets, there was a mark upon one, a remnant of Kidderminster carpet of five yards, a card table, I can positively speak to, there was my own writing upon it, and a number which I referred to my stock book, it cost me, I believe forty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the elbow chair - A. I did; that was in Off-alley; that was part of a set that I had not mark upon that; I found the set defective; I suppose that cost me forty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all these taken from your shop - A. They were taken from the former house that I inhabited in <placeName id="t18101031-36-crimeloc222">St. Martin's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I have known him three or four years, always as a lazy fellow about the Quays. On the 6th of October the prisoner was brought back to our Quay by Mr. Hockless, he said, Mr. Hall, this man has got something; I took from his bosom a bag of shot weighing twenty eight pound; he attempted to to make his escape, I prevented him and sent for a constable, he was taken to the Compter. We had a matt package of shot on the Quay. After I had taken the prisoner to the Compter, I examined the matt package, and found it had lost three bags, of which only one was found on the prisoner; the package had been cut.</p>
               <p>Q. That package was under the care of these gentlemen - A. Yes, they were answerable for it.</p>

             - A. They are cousins. On Friday the 28th of September the parcel was taken in and booked about half past-seven in the evening. I was at the top of the warehouse, I saw a man at the bottom with a parcel under his arm; I believe it to be the prisoner at the bar; I called out to him, he made no answer, but walked away; I sent the porter after him, I saw the porter pursue him, the prisoner, dropped the parcel in the gateway I did not see him do that, and while the porter was pursuing him at the end of Maiden-lane, I also ran, crying stop thief; he ran as far as Haberdashers's-hall; there came a cart, and then be doubled and ran towards Wood-street, I crossed over and stopped him; the porter came up and assisted me in taking him to the Compter; I there changed him with taking the parcel. The porter's name is James Porter, he is a constable, he has been in possession of the parcel ever since.</p>

            . I am a porter at the Castle Inn, and likewise a constable. On Friday evening, the 28th of September, I saw the prisoner come out of the warehouse, he had this parcel under his arm, he passed me; Mr. Webster came out and desired me to follow him, the prisoner was then half way down the gateway; I got within two yards of him, and then he dropped the parcel, I pursued him, he ran up Maiden-lane, to Haberdashers-hall; a town cart coming along he turned back towards Wood-street. I never lost sight of him. Webster was in pursuit of him at the same time, he stopped him in Maiden-lane, I brought him back to the accompting house and found the parcel in possession of my fellow servant, Edward Bailey.</p>

On the 23d of October, a quarter before nine, I took an opportunity of sending the prisoner out; I took part of a lump of sugar and broke it into pieces and put a mark upon it; I then concealed myself in the manufactory; about nine o'clock the prisoner came into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310046"/>manufactory, I saw him; he had not been there a few minutes before his fellow servant took the light to light a fire in the stove, which left the prisoner and me in the dark; on perceiving the light taken away he came to the place where the sugar was close by where I was concealed; he began striking the sugar, which occasioned a light being struck together in the dark; he took one piece and concealed it under some part of his dress; I went out; and went over to a public house, I told him my father wanted him; he came back with me, I charged him with having taken the sugar, he denied it. Coming back from the public-house, I observed his hands at his breeches waistband, I felt upon his breeches, he instantly cried for mercy; he then took a piece of sugar out of his breeches and threw it away with violence. I took the other piece out of his hand; the two places, by the size, I suppose, weighed two pounds, on both the pieces I found the mark I had put. This is the sugar, it is the same I marked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I plead to you for mercy, hoping you will grant it me, I never committed any crime before this, and what was the cause of my misfortune: I have five children, my wife was confined to a bed of sickness eight months past, in doing my duty to her I sold all the goods I had, and my clothes; at this time she is dead; I was in hopes she was likely to get better; but my misfortune broke her poor heart. I have lost one of the best and tenderest wives, and my children the most endearing mother in the world. I never before was guilty, not never will again, therefore, my lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I hope you will consider my distress, and show me all the favour in your power. I am bereaft of the comforts of this life, and shall forever he miserable on account of my crime. I ask pardon of your lordship, praying for mercy, and also praying for mercy of my prosecutor, hoping you will have mercy on my babes, who are destitute of food, likewise the loss of a tender mother, and the distress of a father, who stands accused before this honourable court, and begging forgiveness, that I may be restored to my distressed babes.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was it you lost the shilling and sixty penny-pieces - A. On the 13th of October, they were in my front shop; I had seen them in the shop the night before; the penny-pieces were in a five shilling paper on a shelf; I had missed some two days before, that made me mark them. On the preceding night I marked the outside paper with my initials, about ten o'clock at night; about six o'clock the next morning I concealed myself in the shop, in a few minutes there was a ring at the bell, the prisoner came down stairs and let in one of my journeymen; the man came in, crossed the yard, and went into the workshop; I heard the prisoner follow him across the shop at some distance, and presently returned and went to the till. I had left out twenty shillings in my till to give change; the key was in the till, she unlocked it, I heard the silver in the till rattle, and the paper of halfpence moved on the shelf; she went out of the shop, and I immediately followed her, I asked her what she had got there, she said, nothing. I looked in her hand, I saw a shilling and a paper of penny pieces; she said it was the first time, she hoped I would forgive her. The shilling was marked, and also the paper of penny-pieces. I have kept the shilling and the copper money ever since.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence; called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

I had last seen it on the 18th of September; he was turned out about six o'clock that evening; I know it of my own knowledge. On the following morning I missed him I sent my boy for him about seven o'clock, he was not to be found.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you usually turn him out upon this Common - A. Yes, on an evening, and fetch him up again in Summer time; he was an iron grey gelding with two broken knees about fourteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the prisoners - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see this gelding again - A. On the 15th of October I saw the gelding at Bath in Somersetshire, it was in the possession of the High Constable</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in custody then - A. No, they had been discharged they were taken up about an hour after I arrived at Bath, I swore to my horse at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the worth of this gelding - A. Five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310047"/>pound and upwards. The gelding now is at the New Inn in the Old Bailey, that is the gelding that I lost. I have not the smallest doubt of it being my horse.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners - A. Yes, they came on the 24th of September, they were both in company together, they had two horses with them at the time I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was one of them an iron-grey horse - A. I really do not know, I saw them with two horses; Luke Calverwell asked me if I could take them in to keep, he said their backs were bad, he wanted me to take them both in for a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand that they had been galled by the saddle - A. Yes; the other prisoner stood out in the road with the two horses, I told him I would take them in, he asked me what I would charge, I said my husband was not at home, he would not overcharge them; I asked him what name I should put these horses down in, they gave me the name of Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Creswell in hearing at this time - A. He was; Creswell then asked me where he was to take them to, I told him to go down the road to a large pair of blue gates, and I would send my servant to him, I called my servant and told him to take out the key and let these horses in.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the man again - A. On the 19th of October at the Magistrate's at Bath.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they under the accusation of having stolen the horses - A. Yes, they were waiting to have my evidence on the occasion. Mr. Giles was there, they were committed upon my evidence; I recollected the persons of both of them, and gave the same account as I have given now; Mr. Scuddimore came up to my house on the Thursday following Mr. Barret delivered up the horse to him.</p>

            . Look at the prisoners, do you know their persons - A. I do; I was servant to Mr. Barret at that time, I am quite sure of their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and them on the 24th of September - A. I went down and unlocked the gates by my mistress's order for the prisoner, there was only Creswell at the gate; I only saw Creswell, they went out at the back door, they went down the road; I received two horses from Creswell, and put them into my master's meadow, they were in my master's field from Monday the 24th of September, till the Thursday following, and then they were delivered to Mr. Scuddimore.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mrs. Barrett. When was the horse parted with to Mr. Scuddimere - A. On the Thursday following.</p>
               <p>Q. to Webb. What did Creswell say when you put these horses into the field - A. He said he was going to put these horses in the field for a week till their backs got better, their backs were very bad when I took them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the iron-grey horse in the stable in the Old Bailey - A. Yes; that is one of the horses that I took in of Creswell. I saw the horse when Mr. Scuddimore had it in his possession; I then knew that it was one of the horses that Creswell brought to me. I saw it on the Thursday afternoon, the prisoners were then in custody on suspicion of having stolen them. I recollected Creswell's person then; I told the same story before the magistrate as I have now; the prisoners were then discharged, there was nobody could identify the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the horse that is now in the stable in the Old Bailey; the same horse that you saw at Bath when they were under suspicion of having stolen the horses - A. Yes, it is an iron-grey horse, with two broken knees near fourteen hands high.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the horse when they were taken up the second time - A. I saw the horse, I swore to the horse, and to Creswell's person.</p>
               <p>Creswell's Defence. I was going to the pit with my horses on Monday morning of Kingsdown fair. I met a man with these two horses, the man asked me whether I had any place to keep them for three or four day, or whether I could tell him of any place, I said very likely he might have it at Mr. Barret's, at the butchers, or at the Cross Keys; the man said he would satisfy me very well if I would put them in one of the places, and keeping them three or four days, or a week; he went and fetched three or four pots of beer for us, at a public house; about a mile and a half from Bath, he said he wanted to go to Bristol for something particular, he said he would satisfy me for it. I did not want any more than the three pots of beer, the man paid for the beer, and I had these horses to put into the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this person - A. I cannot tell, he was a stranger to me; he left me, and said he was going to Bristol; I never saw the man before nor since Calverwell was with me.</p>
               <p>Calverwell's Defence the same.</p>

I told him that was too soon, this was on Monday morning; I did not go into his bed-room till the Tuesday; I observed the lack of the chest had been forced; I missed two coats worth thirty shillings, a pair of pantaloons worth five shillings a neck handkerchief one shilling, two waistcoats four or five shillings, and a new hat that was worth a guinea. The hat was in the room where the prisoner slept, and all the other articles were in the chest; on Tuesday the 16th, in company with the officer, I found the prisoner at the gate of the London docks, I charged him with taking these things, he made a strong resistance, and tried to escape, we prevented him, he said he was very sorry, he would go on board a man of war; I found my new hat on his head, and my pantaloons, and one of my white waistcoats, and the coats he said he had sold to Moses.</p>

I searched Donnavan, I found no tippet in her pocket, I took her to the watchhouse and came back and searched the other, I found four one pound notes. I asked Donnavan why she did not deliver up the tippet; she said, would the gentleman forgive her if she delivered up the tippet; I said, I would see; she said, first she must go down and speak to the woman below; she went to Johnson, Johnson said, you are an old thief, and if you turn nose I will turn upon you for the gold ring; then Donnavan denied any knowledge of the tippet.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed - A. A quarter past twelve. On the 19th of October, I made the doors and windows fast. I was alarmed at a quarter before one, by the wrenching a small folding door under my shop window, these folding doors lead into the shop. I got out of bed and went to the shop door, in the mean while they took the second wrench, which made a great noise, they then staid five or ten minutes, in the mean while I unfastened the shop door, they returned again, one said to the other put your crow in here; I went to open the door at the time, I found that I had got a wire fixed to the shop door, which led to two bells, I could not open the door to get out, nor I could not shut the door without making a noise, in the mean while they broke the door open; one said to the other, there is somebody coming this side of the way; they went away for about five minutes, in the mean while I shifted the wire at the door, they came again, they immediately put their hands inside of the door, which they had broken open; they moved something in the inside which rang a bell, one said to the other, d - n it, there is a bell! They immediately went away, they were gone for fifteen or twenty minutes, they came again and walked several times past the door, they found no noise nor light, nor any thing stirring; they came and pushed against the private door of the house, the contrary side to which they had broken open, at last, they gave the door which they had broken open, a pat with the hand; one of them stepped back again, and began at the door again. I immediately went out, and he was bent down to the door with his hands on the door, and his back towards me, I had a watchman's rattle in one hand and an iron bar in the other; I sprang the rattle; I could have knocked him down, I did not like to do it. When I sprang the rattle he run away, I ran after him and kept very near him; he ran over the way to Whitecross-street, and ran round a man who was standing there, several times; he said to this man, whom he dogged round several times, give that man a d - nd good thump of the head, that was me; he dogged round the man once or twice afterwards, and I kept on springing my rattle; presently a watchman came up and catched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him - A. No. I could have hit him several times with the iron that I had in my hand, and I could have catched him several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done to your shop - A. They broke it open but took nothing away.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was stooping in the way that you have described, what was he doing - A. He had got his hand on the top of the doors, the door opens on the outside, he must have removed something to have rung the bell.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I would wish to know whether at the examination, he did not state there were two bolts - A.

I searched the prisoner's box in July at Mrs. Gutheridges, in Bithnal-green, I found a duplicate; I went to Morris, in the Minories, and saw the pellise which Mr. Grant claimed. I searched after the prisoner, on the 9th of October, I saw her coming out of Mrs. Gutheridges door; I then took her up into the room where the box was, I asked her if she lodged in the room; she said; yes, and the box was hers, and she afterwards said, she pawned it.</p>

               <p>Q. On the evening of Tuesday last, did the prisoners call at your shop - A. I understood as such; I was called down, I found the prisoners in my shop. Just before I went up stairs, I observed a parcel of twelve pair of silk stockings, I tucked the invoice in the parcel; I was going out to a lady with them, but I thought I would take tea first; when I came down stairs I spoke to the prisoners; they said my young man was serving them; I supposed that was true; which was not. I was serving a customer, I heard one of the prisoner's say she would give threepence less than the price asked; I said, we were not in the habit of doing that, I could wait upon them and shew them articles of a lower description. They went to the door, looked at some mitts, saying they would call again and look at the flannel. I looked in the chair and missed the stockings; I jumped over the counter, and found the invoice that I had tucked in the stockings, all over dirt. I went after the prisoners and overtook them within ten or twelve doors from my house; I saw one of them at a mercer's shop, which was well lighted up, tearing something up, apparently they were looking at the writing on the paper and tearing it up. I said to the prisoner Payne, you have got a dozing pair of stockings of mine, you must come back; Payne said, they had not, they would not come back. She had the stockings; I pushed one into Mr. Thelwall's shop, and I had got the other by the arm; a gentleman touched me, he stooped down, and said, this is what dropped from this woman, giving me the stockings in my hand, the gentleman went away immediately. These are the paper of stockings, they are mine; they had tore the paper at one end. With difficulty I got them back to my shop; Payne said, how come you to do such a thing; I suppose you must have taken it up with the child; Oh, says Jones, I do<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310051"/>not care for him; they did not find them upon us.</p>

            . I am patrol of St. Sepulchre's. On the 2d of October last, a quarter before seven at night, I saw the prisoner in West-street, West Smithfield; I saw one of his hands close to him; I said, what have you got here; he said, copper, I have brought it from my masters, in Long-lane; I told him he did not get it by his master's leave; he then offered me the copper to let him go. I took him to the watch-house, he then said he found it laying outside of the gates of Mr. Shears's manufactory, Fleet-market. This is the piece of copper.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in his house on the 29th of September, in the evening - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any part of his house broken that evening - A. Yes, the shop window. On my passing the window in the street, between six and seven o'clock, I perceived the window was cut, but not out; from the appearance of the putty; an instrument had been put into it, about the size of the top of a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time it was so open as to pull any thing through - A. No; it induced me to tell my brother of it. And afterwards I went to an officer, who, with me, patroled the street for half an hour to watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body come to the window after that - A. I saw three boys come to the window, they passed backward and forward three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner and say whether he was one of the <rs id="t18101031-57-deflabel356" type="occupation">boy</rs>

                        targets="t18101031-57-defend682 t18101031-57-deflabel356"/>s - A. It was so dark I could not tell whether he was one; at that time I could not distinguish his features by the day-light that was left; one of the boys was the same size as the prisoner, whether he was I cannot say. In passing backwards and forward, I saw one of them, in appearance, as if he had struck the glass, and then walked on a little way, I suppose they thought some one was near them. They walked on a little way and returned to the window; three or four times after they had done that. I know no more until I saw the prisoner in the hands of the officer; I saw the boys run from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they running away from the window at the time that you saw the prisoner in the officer's custody - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You came up to the officer that had hold of the prisoner - A. Yes. The piece of handkerchiefs that were tied in the window when I came up to it, had been drawn partly through the window, hanging only by the string; the window had been broken, and the piece of handkerchief had very nearly been got out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that piece of handkerchiefs - A. Three pound; the piece contained seven handkerchiefs, we gave sixty-five shillings for it; we had it three weeks or a month in the shop. The string was cut and afterwards the handkerchiefs, and the lad was taken in our shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is the lad that the officer took at the window - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner, had the daylight out of doors sufficiently gone for you not to be able to distinguish the features of a man - A. It was dark out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you watch the prisoner and two others - A. Yes; I perceived them walk up to the window, backwards and forwards, two or three times, after that as I was coming down again, I observed two together, one of them had got hold of something. I laid hold of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310052"/>him, he had got this piece of handkerchief drawn out of the window, about as much as that. When I first came up and saw the window, I observed, that they had broken it, and the next time I came up they had broke it bigger.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any other person have broke that window to get these goods through, but those three boys - A. There might be somebody else, but I did not see any body else, I was watching for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that you laid hold of, that had the handkerchief in his hand - A. The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. It was partly through the window and partly in the shop - A. Yes. I searched the prisoner, he had no instrument about him, the other two ran away; I examined the window, the putty had been removed and the glass torn out; I took the prisoner into the house; Mr. Newberry brought the handkerchiefs in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Newberry. This was one of the pieces of handkerchiefs that we had on sale at my brother's shop.</p>

            . On the morning of the 31st of August, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went to his lodgings, his priest was with him, I staid below; I saw him half an hour before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon his death did any thing take place between you and Fitzjames or you and Toulonne in the hearing of Fitzjames - A. There was a French gentlemen there, he desired to have the keys, I desired he might not, but that Toulonne might keep them, as she was always entrusted with them, this gentleman said he would have them; I said, he should not, he said he would break the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after you sent for Mr. Legou and the will was found - A. Yes; it was in a bureau, in a kind of of secretary; Mr. Legou looked for the value that he had left in the will; I knew that he had property, I did not know how much, I knew also that he was in possession of a gold snuff box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Fitzjames present when Mr. Legou opened the bureau - A. Yes; upon searching the secretary, the snuff box was not in it, nor the gold coin; I asked for it, it was not forthcoming; Fitzjames said my being there was very impertinent, who could send for me, she was sent for to interpret to Madam Toulonne, because she could not talk English; some time after that I requested her to quit the place, she said she had as much right to stay there as any body; she would not go; she sat herself down and dared any body to remove her, and talked of sending for an officer. Mr. Legou read the will and the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe afterwards at the police office you saw the coin produced and the snuff box - A. I did, I knew that snuff box.</p>

               <p>MR. LEGOU. I am an artist, residing in Foley-street; I knew Mr. Chevillard. On the morning of his death I was sent for, I went and arrived there by twelve, I found Mrs. Percy there, I found the will and this paper. (The paper read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing passed in your presence respecting Phillipine Fitzjames - A. Mrs. Fitzjames said she did not understand people coming to take the property by pretending to be executors; the will had been read in her presence, upon which I observed I was sorry to hear such an expression after what she had seen, that she had heard the will read, and ought to be satisfied, and desired her to leave the room in the name of Mrs. Percy; she answered, that she knew what the laws of England were, she would remain in possession of the apartment, and would not suffer any of the property to be taken away; she asked me if I was a lawyer, I said it was nothing to her what I was. She repeated that she would not leave the room, put her fists upon her hips, said, you touch me if you dare; I replied, God forbid that I should come near you; I desired her again in the name of Mrs. Percy to leave the room; she got up, said she would not be turned out of the room, she would go of her own accord.</p>

            . Q. Did you attend the late Mr. Chevillard at the time of his death - A. Yes; Fitzjames was with me to help the deceased up and down in his bed; she was with me when he died.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the night before he died did Fitzjames propose to you to do any thing - A. Yes; Fitzjames observed to me that Mr. Chevillard might have made a will, he said he would not forget her; she proposed to me to open the secretaire, in hopes of finding something; I opened the drawer, we both searched the drawer and found a pocket-book; Fitzjames said the will must be here, she wanted to take the pocketbook out of my hand, Fitzjames told me to open the little drawer of the secretaire; I replied I never opened it, I did not know the key; she took the keys and opened the drawer herself, and seeing the paper, observed, that must be the paper; I said do not touch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310053"/>it. Fitzjames then put it into its place, and took out the money in the box, which was covered round with paper, observing, this was the person that had no money. She took gold Spanish pieces, and I observed there were four silver pieces likewise. When Mrs. Fitzjames took the gold snuff box, containing the gold, she said she must see what was in it; we found a gold stock buckle and a silver buckle, which I took from Fitzjames and put it in my pocket; Fitzjames had the money, she took it from me. I took one of the pieces and said, what is this; Fitzjames said, Spanish pieces; we counted the guineas ten by ten and put them on the table; I observed Fitzjames put in her pocket, I said what are you doing; she said never mind, count away, I know the number I have got, there is about fifty; I would not count any more; I put the remainder in the bag and tied them up myself. This was about twelve or one o'clock at night; I observed that if Mr. Chevillard was to get up, the money ought to be in its place; she said, never mind, you can tell him any thing; in the course of the morning Fitzjames went home and when she returned I asked her to give me the money which she had taken; Fitzjames said, I told you I had but fifty, I counted them, there were sixty-five or seventy-five, as near as I can recollect, she left them at home to please her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the snuff box and the rest of the money - A. I hid them in the next room. A few days afterwards I was sent for to Mrs. Fitzjames, I saw the husband and wife; Fitzjames told me that he wanted twenty-five guineas more to finish the building of his house; I said I shall not let you have a farthing more; he said, if you are afraid to keep the money bring it to me, do not you say any thing about it, if you do I will fix the whole blame upon you and ruin you.</p>
               <p>Q. After this was Fitzjames taken up - A. Yes, and Mr. Fitzjames was looking for me, he said he had nothing in his possession, and the best thing I could do to save myself, was to let him have the property; I after this took the gold snuff box and the gold that was tied up in the bag to his house. When I went the first time he, Fitzjames, was not at home; I hid them in the grate of the copper, I afterwards saw him and told him where the gold and snuff-box was, and the four silver pieces that I had forgot to put with the gold I gave to Fitzjames, saying, now you have got all the property, and I have washed my hands of it; Fitzjames said he would not keep the property in his house, as they were searching, he would hide it in the garden under a barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the money and snuff box at the police-office - A. Yes, and my intention was to restore it.</p>

On the 28th of September I went to search Fitzjames's house, No. 3, Hampton-street, Somerstown; I searched that part of the house they occupied, I discovered this purse twenty-five guineas and a doubloon; I took her in custody; she was violent, she would not let me if she could have helped it. I took the man in custody on the 7th of October he took me to the back of the workhouse wall of St. Pancras; we went to the extremity of the wall, and just by the battlement of the wall, I stooped down and picked up a gold snuff box, with the contents, as you have it there, a stock buckle, a pair of sleeve buttons, a seal, four doubloons, twenty guineas, and two half guineas; Lavender at the same time went to a place by his direction and took out a purse with one hundred and four guineas, and three half guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you known him before - A. Yes, six or eight weeks; I asked him if he was at work, he told me he was not, nor had not been at work all that week: he asked me if I would give him any thing to drink, I told him yes, and went into the Dundee Arms, I told him to have what he liked and I would pay for it; he made choice of a glass of rum, I told him I drank no spirits except it was mixed, and then he said he would have a glass of rum and water; we came out, I was wishing him a good evening, he said he would turn back with me and go no further that way he was going. We came up Whitechapel, he took me into a back place of a public house, and there we had a pint of beer, as we were coming out he called a man out that was in there.</p>
               <p>Q. You were joined by another man, were you - A. Yes; and he said that poor man had not drank a drop of any thing that day, would I give him a pint of beer, accordingly we went into another public house, and I gave him a pint of beer, and then he would come to see me part of my way home. We walked from the side of Whitechapel where the butchers have their stalls, and coming to Somerset-street, I cut across to go down Petticoat-lane to go to Bunhill Row. I had three dollars in my pocket, I stopped to hinder them from making a noise, I stopped in the street, I took the three dollars out of my pocket and the pound note, and was rolling the dollars up in the one pound note, the prisoner came up and struck me on the side, in <placeName id="t18101031-60-crimeloc372">Whitechapel</placeName>

I was perfectly sober when I met him, I had nothing to drink before I met him, and then I had a glass of rum and water, at the second public house I had a pot of porter, and at the third a pint.</p>

They have told me so, but I never said it, if I did I never meaned it, I told them I did not say so, I never meant it, because that is the man that knocked me down in Whitechapel, I never did say it, nor meaned it, I said I got the prisoner at the Seven Stars. I slept in the watch-house all night, they would not let me go because I was no house-keeper. They offered me five pound last Saturday.</p>

               <p>"watchman take charge of this man, he has robbed me of a pound note and three dollars;" I took the prisoner to the watch-house. In the watch-house the prosecutor stated that he was robbed of his money between Somerset-street and Petticoat-lane, and when he was at the Seven Stars he heard the servant maid say, the prisoner came in and had three dollars and a pound note.</p>

F. the initials of my name; he was taken to the office, he said he found the Minenet seeds in his apartments, the other seeds he denied knowing how they came there; I brought the man whom he slept with, he then said, the other man was innocent, and that he had collected the seeds together a little at a time where he went to work, and in cleaning out my warehouse.</p>

            . I am a seedsman in Holborn. On the 8th of October this man came to my house, he said he had some seeds to sell, I agreed so give him five shillings a pound for the Minenet seed; I had some suspicion that he had come improper by it; I desired my young man to weigh it, he came and told me there was eight pound of it; I told him to tell the person to leave his name and address and call the next morning, he left his name, Smith, gardener, Paddington. I called at Messrs. Fisher and Clarkson to make enquiry, they said, there was a man of that name worked for them. I saw the Minenet seed at Mr. Fisher's, I have no doubt that the seed the prisoner brought to me, is of the same bulk.</p>

               <p>Q. On the morning of the 15th of August, about nine o'clock, were you at home - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were inside of the house at the same time information were given you, which is the substance of this charge - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your wife at home - A. I do not know how<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310057"/>that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any handkerchiefs inside of your shop window - A. I am sure I had, it was our constant practice of dressing that window with handkerchiefs exhibited for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the fact of your house being broke open between nine and ten that morning - A. I knew my window was cut after some person came in and gave information that the window had been broken. One of my young men came and told me that my window was cut; when I came forward I found the window cut, and a piece of glass laying inside, on the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed the window that morning before you had information that it was broke - A. On Monday the 13th of August the window was cut, and on the Tuesday I had it mended, and the putty being new they found no difficulty in pushing the glass of oneside, and on the Wednesday morning it was cut again between nine and ten o'clock. It was whole in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you perceived the window had been cut and the glass removed do you know whether any of your goods had been drawn out or removed by that means - A. I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any of your goods removed - A. None, whatever. The way the handkerchiefs were put in the window was as them books are, one up against another, till the window was full, I dare say there were a hundred poundsworth of handkerchiefs in the window. In the morning at that time I could not miss ten pound worth of handkerchiefs. I never recollect buying a piece of handkerchiefs that cost me less than two guineas prime cost for seven handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. They are charged for stealing fourteen handkerchiefs - A. That is by the witness Bates, I know no more.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods in this indictment were your goods and your partners - A. Yes.</p>

            . Q. Were you near Mr. Middleton's and Jones's the haberdashers - A. Yes, I work for Mr. Lee, Field-lane, Holborn, he is a shoe-maker. On the 15th of August, a quarter before nine in the morning, I was going to my work, and at the end of Chancery-lane I saw Francis, I had just passed Mr. Jones's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before - A. Yes; he had Turvy in his company; I never saw Turvy before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they appear to be in company together to act together - A. Yes; I saw Francis and the other both go up to the window, I watched them both; I then saw Francis pull something out of his waistcoat pocket, and break the window with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do it so as to make much noise - A. No, he did it pretty quiet. Then they walked up to the dial of St. Dunstan's both together; I then saw them come back, Francis put his hand into the same window, he had broke; I then saw him pull out one piece of handkerchiefs and then pull out another, he put them in his bosom, the other was by him at the time; they both walked up Chancery-lane, I saw no more of them; I went home and informed my master of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go into the shop and inform the people of it - A. No, I was rather late that morning with my work, my master blowed me up, I told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to lay hold of these man, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell Mr. Middleton or any of them of it - A. I told my master of it first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appear before the sitting Alderman when they were under examination - A. Yes, they were taken up on that very day, at six o'clock. On Thursday I appeared before the alderman, where they were under examination and repeated this story.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the handkerchiefs which they took away was never found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Francis. Q. I wish to ask him why he did not apprehend me if he saw me - A. Knowing him to be such a desperate character I thought he might do me an injury. I knew where to find him any hour in the day.</p>
               <p>Francis. I think there were plenty of gentleman in the street for him to take me without hurting him.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did they turn from - A. Somewhere about the church, they appeared to be making up towards the window again, they then saw a person within taking the goods away, they walked on toward Temple-bar, and I saw no more of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that these are the two persons that were in Fleet-street - A. I am. I returned to the Temple-gate again, a person came over and gave me information, I directed my attention towards the shop; I saw Francis pass the window, Turvy halted behind, he might be ten yards from him, and the moment Turvy passed I saw a lady with her hand taking the handkerchiefs from the window that was broke.</p>

            . I apprehended the two prisoners at the bar. After the information I received from Bates I went to Mr. Jones's instantly, I examined the square of glass, I found some instrument had pushed in the pane six inches by four, the piece of glass lay inside; when I went I was the whole day after the prisoners, I found them at the top of Drury-lane, St. Giles's, about a quarter after six in the evening; they were standing together. I caught hold of Francis, and an assistant that I got from Bow-street caught hold of Turvy: Francis turned round and said, halloa, what is this? I told him, for Fleet-street; he said to Turvy, making use of an oath, have we been in Fleet-street to-day? I know nothing about it. I looked up a turning, saw a place of safety; I searched them, upon Turvy I found this small knife, the edges appears to have been rubbed off with a file, it appears to be an instrument for the purpose, I have seen such an instrument found off persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310058"/>on a similar charge; I found another of the same sort on Francis, I had the misfortune to break it; I took them to Bow-street.

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday morning I received an information I went to Mrs. Matthews, Wine-office-court, Fleet-street, I found the piece of woollen cloth in the parlour, it is about sixteen yards. The prisoner Fussell lived there as a servant; I pulled the paper off the cloth; Fussell was called up to me; I asked her how she came by this cloth; she said she was sitting at her mistress's gate, on the Sunday night, and two men brought it for her to take care of it, they would call again for it; I told her if she took in such an article of two men, she must know something what they were; she said she did not. I went down in the kitchen and searched it, and between the ticking of the bed and the sacking of the bedstead I found this bunch of keys, she told me she found these keys in the court. I told her it was of no use telling me that she did not know these two men, she must go along with me to the Compter; after waiting a little while I told her if she would tell me who the men were I would not lock her up before she went before the Lord Mayor, and if the two men did leave it, it would discharge her. I waited near half an hour, and at last she said, my sister gave it me. I did not ask her any more questions; I took her to the public-house in the Poultry Compter, I did not lock her up, I left her in the parlour while I went to her sister at Mr. Bowerbank's, at the back of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. You found Shearman at Mr. Bowerbank's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from Fussell that she meaned Shearman when she talked of her sister - A. Yes I went into Mr. Bowerbank's accompting-house, I took these keys with me, and enquired after the servant; nothing transpired with these keys; Fussell said afterwards her sister gave her these keys, because Mr. Bowerbank's housekeeper was a suspicious woman. I went up stairs, Shearman was called to me, I told her I found the cloth at her sisters, she denied any knowledge of the cloth.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this cloth deposited on the Sunday - A. Close to the door of the warehouse, that warehouse was locked up, there was no cloth outside of the warehouse to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see these keys that Stanton produced - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Stanton. I applied them with Mr. Bowerbank, there were none of them fitted.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the cloth was in some paper - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffiths. Did you know the cloth by the paper - A. Yes, These numbers agree with our books, we missed that number.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss that number before Stanton gave you that information - A. No. When Stanton gave the information we looked for No. 2, and missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bowerbank. Is that such cloth that you had in your possession - A. This is the cloth that we had in our warehouse from the package, and the manner of making up; there are two letters, G and H, that the manufacturer put on the cloth, and the mark of the package, No. 9630 wove into the cloth, and likewise upon the paper outside, that we may easily refer to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty that you had not sold that cloth - A. Certainly not, and the property in that warehouse was the property of myself and partner.</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you whether you sold any to either of them women - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What it the worth of that cloth - A. About sixteen or eighteen pound.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you look to your stock to see if any such piece was deficient - A. Immediately, and found it deficient.</p>

               <p>Sherman was not put on her defence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Bowerbank. Can you say at what time it was taken - A. No, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long you had this piece of cloth - A. Three or four months I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that Fussell visited your house to see her sister - A. No; I might have seen her, I should not know her if I saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. to Griffiths. Can you say when this piece was lost - A. No.</p>

I missed a great quantity of lamp heads and burners; Everson was taken up for this, in consequence of his information we apprehended Spicer. On the 24th of October, in the evening, I went to Spicer's lodgings, No. 2, Turvill-court, Bethnal-green, there I found a lamp head and two glass burners, the head I knew to be mine. Spicer was not at home, we took Spicer at the back of the Mansion-house after he had done lighting the lamps. He was with us when the lamp head was found; he said, he knew nothing about it. The boy was taken up on the same day; I told him he should not be hurted if he spoke the truth, if we could help it. I cannot speak to the burner; the lamp heads are like my stock, I only speak to this one.</p>

I am an officer in the Thames police; I was off the Isle of Dogs in a Thames police boat, on the 8th of October I saw the prisoner very busy at the head of a cask, I pulled round and went on board the craft, but before I could get on board it was removed from the head of the cask. When I went on board I saw this mat, there was thirty-five pound weight of tallow in it: the mat was spread under the head of the cask, I asked them how it came there, they denied any knowledge of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there - A. Two lightermen pulling the punt up with two oars, the other two men were present.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he removed it - A. The mat lay by the side of the cask, and as he pulled the tallow out of it fell on the matt. He had left the cask when he saw me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. This is a thing that often happens in a voyage that a cask tumbles down and the head falls off - Very often; but he was in the same barge.</p>

As we were rowing in Greenwich reach, we observed the prisoner in a punt, he was tearing a piece of hoop off a lining that confines these heads, he hove the piece overboard; we observed that he rowed round and boarded the craft, we observed, that he left the cask and sit down, this matt was spread under the head of the cask with the tallow in it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was a barge belonging to Mr. Hay - A. Yes; as soon as he saw us going on board he got up and rowed. On examining the cask, on the tallow there were the marks of the fingers where he pulled the tallow out. I went forward and accused them of it, they all denied it. I told Batt that I saw him at the cask, he said no, look at his hands they are not greasy: I felt his hands, they were perfectly greasy, very much so.</p>

            . On the 17th of October, near four o'clock, I was down St. John-street, I observed three or four pieces of flannel lying in the middle of the pavement, and at the same time a man running with a large roll of flannel under his arm: he ran from the door with the flannel, turned down Great Sutton-street, the prisoner was then on the opposite side of the way, watching, he followed at a distance nearly parallel with myself. In Great Sutton-st. they got the head of me near a hundred yards; at the further corner of Great Sutton-street the prisoner received the flannels of the man who took it, we continued running down Old-street, the man who took it then remained behind. I followed in my gig until we came to the turnpike in Old Road; I left my gig at the gate, and pursued him on foot, he not being aware that I was following of him, he turned down Whitecross-street, and ran through an immense quantity of alleys which that part of the town consists of, until he came to Bunhill row, I then lost sight of him at the corner of a court, he turned down Bunhill Row; I waited there some time to see if I could get any traces of him. I returned to Mr. Hewitt, he went with me to the office in Hatton Garden, and I went in search of the prisoner with Hancock the officer; and after searching for him, we met the prisoner in Whitecross-street, without the flannel, I pointed him out to Hancock, he took him in custody. The prisoner in running through the courts took his apron off, and wound it round the flannel: he did that in the act of running, he did not stop to do it.</p>

            . I am a silversmith; on Wednesday the 19th of September, between three and four in the afternoon, a young man came into Mr. Gordon's shop, he informed me that there were two suspicious people walking about our window, whom he said he knew very well belonged to a gang in Drury-lane; he desired me to come to the door and he shewed me them; they were in the church yard near our house, and they were both talking together; I mentioned it to my master, he desired me to watch them; I had not been out long before they came out of the church yard, and went down St. Martin's-lane, they turned up St. Martin's lane into the Strand. When they came to Church-court, they both went up together; after they had gone half way up the court they separated; Jones came down first and Walter's followed. They went about a dozen doors along the Strand, they went up Hewitt's-court, and turned round at the top of the court. I thinking they were going to my master's house again, I turned up Church Court; between these two courts, at the top, there is Mrs. Gardley's, a broker's shop; I went and informed my master. When I came back to the top of Church-court, I met Walter's with the carpet under his arm; Walter's passed me with the carpet and Jones followed after him into the Strand. I watched then into a court that goes into Hungerford-street, and there Walter's gave the carpet to Jones, and Jones put it on his shoulder. I went to Mrs. Gardleys and asked her whether she had missed any such thing; she said, she had. I came across the church yard; I met Watson, he came with me down St. Martin's-lane to Charing-cross; when we got there I met the two prisoners, Jones had got the carpet on his shoulder; I saw Brooker, he seized Jones, and Watson, Walters; I took the carpet.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in company with Sinden - A. I got in company with him about half past three in the afternoon; we went to a friend's house in Newton-street, we left there about half past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Sinden sober - A. Yes, and I was sober; the first woman that spoke to us was Smith, she persuaded Sinden to go with her; she said she would get a woman for me; so we went together. I went with Sarah Howard, I left the prisoner Smith with Sinden; I went into another room with Howard; I did not see Thompson until I went out of Howard's room, then she was standing against Smith's door; when I went in Smith's room and found Sinden's pocket turned inside out.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Howard leave you in the room a-bed - A. No; I was undressed ready to go to bed; she went down to get something to drink; I thought I heard two women go down stairs by their petticoats touching the stairs, I did not hear their voices. Howard did not return until she came with the watchman to shew him who had been robbed. As soon as I went to Sinden to ask him where his money was, Thompson went down stairs. Howard in the watchhouse, said she knew Smith had the money about her, Smith and Thompson was in hearing, Smith made no answer.</p>

            . I am a watchhouse keeper. These women were brought to the watchhouse by the watchman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310062"/>they were fighting in consequence of not dividing the money they had robbed the man of in Cross-lane, that was the charge he gave; the prisoner, Howard, then addressed the constable of the night and me, she said, Smith had robbed the man, she would not divide the spoil and she would have her share of it, the man was at Smith's apartment, and if I would send the watchman with her she would take him to the man that had been robbed; I ordered the watchman to go with her, he brought Sinden and Howell with him to the watchhouse; Sinden pointed out Smith as the woman that was with him. Smith and Thompson were both searched carefully, no note or dollar was found on them, only a shilling and a few halfpence. Howard insisted Smith had it, or she had fenced it, as she termed it. I searched her again, I only found a few halfpence on her.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I am quite innocent. I met this man in Holborn, he had got his friend with him and another woman, he took us in to drink, he had no more than two pence halfpenny about him, he said he would get money in the morning; his friend was to sleep with the woman in the adjoining room. I went down stairs to get a candle. I met Thompson, she said she would shew me where to get one. Howard came down, got me into Eagle-street watchhouse, she said I had robbed the man; I was let out and afterwards taken to St. Giles's watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Howard's Defence. When I was taken I was very much in liquor, I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. I had been out to a day's work; coming home I went up stairs, I met with that young woman, she asked me if I would go with her and buy a candle; we had not been out five minutes before this woman came and tore her clothes.</p>

I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner from the information of the prosecutor, he also gave me a copy of a duplicate he had sent to him, I told the prisoner what I took her up for, she cried very much; I took the prisoner at her lodgings, she lives with an old woman that she called mother: it is not her mother, she has brought her up from an infant; I really believe it is the old woman's persuasions that has brought her into it.</p>

On the 29th of Oct. the prisoner came in and called for a bason of soup, the other waiter brought him the soup; he had a silver spoon to eat the soup with. Before he had done eating the soup, I looked at him, I perceived he had been at our house before, I communicated it to the other witness and desired him to watch him; he supped the soup very slow; the prisoner left the house and the spoon was gone; I ran out of doors, I saw him running, I called out stop thief, he threw the spoon on the pavement; I laid hold of the prisoner and charged him with having stolen the spoon: I went after the spoon, a woman gave me the spoon, this is the spoon, I know it to be my master's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Courtney. Q. Were you at this hotel - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the spoon - A. Eight or ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to the coffee-house. I called for a bason of gravy soup, and paid the waiter for it soon after he brought it, not this waiter. There was another person at the lower end of the table, and when I had done eating the soup, I removed from the table to another table nearer the window to read the paper, leaving the bason and the spoon. When I quitted the room, there was one waiter standing about the center of the coffee-room, the other waiter I met on my descending the stairs; the person was a perfect stranger to me, sitting at the same table. I ate the soup. He left the room as soon as I left the room. I went towards Grafton-street. I heard the noise of stop thief, but could not distinguish from whence the sound proceeded, but supposing it came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310063"/>from King-street; I walked briskly up Hayes's-court to see what was the occasion of the call, the waiter came up, seized me by the collar, and said I had taken away the spoon; I was taken back to the coffee-house where I saw the master of the house, by hearing what I said he was disposed to let me depart, but was prevented by some gentlemen in the room; shortly after a woman came into the coffee-room and brought in a spoon, but whether that was the spoon that I was eating with I am totally ignorant. I solemnly declare I am innocent of the charge.</p>

On the 23d of October these tools were at home in my chest on that evening: on opening my chest I found they were gone; my chest was in my bed room. There were some bricklayers in the house repairing it. The next morning I went to the pawnbrokers, they told me they had taken a sash saw in of an old gentleman; the prisoner lodged in my house, he sold the duplicate, and the saw was taken out afterwards by Cairns, an old Iron shop man. I went to Cairns and saw my saw hanging up in the window for sale, and another of my saws; I told him I had lost more tools, he brought them out and shewed me them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Peacock. On the 26th of September, between seven and eight in the evening, I was going with my truck down to <placeName id="t18101031-84-crimeloc517">Ratcliffe Highway</placeName>

The prisoner came up and said you are heavy loaded, he asked me if he should push behind, I told him I did not mind; then he said he supposed my mistress would not mind giving him a shilling, if she was a good natured woman; I said no, she would not; I dragged it, and he pushed behind; I looked behind and the rope was cut; I had a boy behind, I went on to the Commercial-road, then he sent the boy for a penny-worth of damsons a great way off; I missed the prisoner pushing behind, I found I had lost a side of bacon; I pursued after the prisoner, and found him with the bacon in his arms, he was going to rest himself. I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>

On the 21st of September, having suspicion of the prisoner Glynn, I arose early in the morning to watch him, I saw him go into the stable, he soon afterwards brought out a bag with something in it, put it upon a cart that was loaded with potatoes ready to come to town; he then went into the stable, brought a truss of hay out and put it on, also he went into the stable again, brought something under his arm, which turned out to be part of a truss of hay, it was covered with his great coat, he put that on also, he then put his horses into the cart; I then came down stairs and saw the prisoner go on with the cart; I followed the cart to the public house called the Coach and Horses, about thirty yards from my house, he stopped there and was joined by the prisoner Moore. They then proceeded up the road to the King Alfred public-house, the prisoner took the truss of hay and put it to Moore to receive it; Moore turned up the gateway of the King Alfred public-house, I pursued him and took Moore with the hay pitched down before him; I followed my cart and apprehended Glynn opposite of the watchhouse, I delivered him in the care of the constable; upon searching the cart I found this bag, the one I saw him put into the cart in my premises, it contains pease and beans; the peas are a foreign production, the beans I do not mean to swear to, the peas being of various sorts would not do for any other purpose than hogs; I bought twenty quarters, upon comparing them with the bulk I can swear to them, there are Prussian blues among them. I did not lose sight of the hay from the time it was taken from my house, untill I saw it delivered to Moore.</p>

In consequence of something that passed on the 27th of September I procured a search warrant, I and the constable and Mr. Dawson went to his lodgings, his wife was at home, he was at his work; we opened the door; went up stairs, the door up stairs was padlocked, which the constable broke open. In the room I found the sieve, the cloths and a bag of seed, with my wife's hand-writing; I went down in the cellar, I found the two forks there, they are marked in my own names the shears I lost six years ago.</p>

When I went in the room the two officers were looking over some papers, Sir Edward was nearer the drawer than the officers. I put my hand in the drawer and turning over some rags I found the seal. Sir Edward told me to be careful in searching the drawer.</p>

            . Q. You have a house at Brompton, called Sion-hall - A. Yes, I have had it since May last.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that seal, is it yours - A. Yes. On the 2d of August, I knew it to be in the closet of the room where the cloth was, at Sion-hall, it was deposited in a box with tinkets in it.</p>

               <p>Q. You were not at Sion-hall on the 2d of August - A. The house was three months in repair, and at this time there was only a servant man and maid there.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there a servant maid there on the 2d of August - A. There was; I wish to be correct, I am not vindicative against the prisoner, by no means, whether she was in the house I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not tell us your motive, nobody has imputed it to you - A. She had the care of the house, but whether she was there about two o'clock I cannot say; the maid servant came there about June and had the care of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. You were not there on the 2d of August - A. Not to reside; I had been there about nine o'clock in the morning; I had been in company with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310068"/>the prisoner in the morning, I parted with him at Ludgate-hill, he was to go about some other business. I directed him to do; instead of executing my commands he returned back to Sion-hall about one or two o'clock, I did not see him there.</p>
               <p>Q. We understand from your servant, the blackman, that he went there about two o'clock, whether the seal was there, you do not know, because you were not there. Where was the cloth - A. On the first turning upon the landing, on the lobby of the hall, upon the right, the seal was deposited in that room where the cloths were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Sir Edward, you will excuse me for asking you, has your family any creation - A. Since the year 1600; I came to the title about ten years ago, I succeeded Sir

               <p>Q. No other business within this twelvemonth - A. About February last, I sat up in the banking concern, in Alfred-place, Bedford-square, was the pay and receiving house, and the bank was in Castle Carey, in Somerset, it did not succeed in business.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the Fleet - A. I have, more than two months. I commenced the woollen trade about the 16th of July.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you become connected with him in business - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you partners - A. I did not conceive that he was a partner, he was employed by me to sell for five per cent, under my approbation.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was concerned with you in the woollen cloth trade when you lost this seal - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose before you lost the seal there was a dispute between him and you on money concerns - A. Not a shilling due to him, he was to obtain the goods and sell them under my approbation to the amount of my acceptance.</p>
               <p>Q. These acceptances are all paid are they not - A. No. They are not; I have offered to pay for the amount of the cloths that were in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take out the search warrant for the woollen goods and the other articles on the 4th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. The woollen goods is not in your indictment - A. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the woollen goods - A. Fifteen hundred pound.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the indictment you put in the seal, value thirty shillings, and you do not put in the woollen goods of fifteen hundred pound. The clothiers have not been paid, have they - A. No, they are not; they have claimed the goods.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take a constable to the police office instead of making your complaint in a regular way - A. Because I understood I could take him in custody for felony, accordingly I went for a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think that you could not go to Hatton-garden office and obtain a warrant without taking a constable; why did not you go to Marlborough-street office, that was nearer to you. Upon your oath were not you standing close by Wood, the officer, at the time that he searched the drawer in which the seal was found - A. I know he searched a drawer, I do not know whether that is the drawer or no.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no distinction of rank and birth here, those who shuffle in answering will be committed. Were not you standing close by the drawer at the time that Wood searched the drawer - A. I was standing in the middle of the room while the drawer was searched all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were not you standing close by Wood at the time he searched the drawer - A. I am satisfied I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. I will give you no permission to prevaricate, there is a plain question, I expect a plain answer. At the time Wood was searching the drawer for the seal, and when the seal was afterwards found were not you close by him - A. I know I stood in the room, upon my life, I do not know that I stood by the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a plain question, and if you expect to be believed you must give a plain answer. Upon your oath were not you close by the officer, Wood, at the time he was searching the drawer - A. I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how dare you to say that you did not know upon your oath, after the officer had searched that drawer and had not found any thing, were you close by the drawers still - A. Yes, I was, but he was between me and the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had the seal in your possession you had the power to put it in, you were near enough to put it in - A. Yes, if I was the base villain to do that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your son - A. He came with me.</p>

I felt the handkerchief drawing out of my pocket, he had got two thirds of the handkerchief out of my pocket. It is a silk handkerchief. When he found he was discovered by my asking him what he was about; he ran, and I immediately pursued him, and cried stop thief; in the wide part of Fleet-street, before you come to St. Dunstan's church, he turned back again, I caught hold of him; I never lost sight of him, nor was he ever ten yards from me. When I got hold of him I charged him with attempting to pick my pocket.</p>

If they had any message to leave they would deliver it to the companionship when they came; this was on Sunday night. May the 13th, they then were preparing for Monday morning paper. The prisoners said to Beckett and Burn, that they had been to their masters for the advance of wages of one halfpenny per hour, and hoped Mr. Walters' then would do the same, if they did they would retrieve their character, if not; they would alway be looked upon as rats, as they always had been; they said there would be a general meeting on the Tuesday evening, and they should hear something more of them, and then they sent out for half a pint of gin: it was brought into the workshop, it was drank; the prisoners paid for it, and then they got talking to

             about working the newspaper in the Old Bailey at the old price; they asked him if he did not work for Mr. Westall, that works at the Morning Post; he answered, yes, he did, he did not know any thing about working under price; he had his full price for it; accordingly the Times men sent out for another half pint of gin, our people paid for it, and these men went away. On the next morning all Mr. Walter's men gave warning, all the companionship, because Mr. Walter would not grant a halfpenny an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they leave him - A. No. Mr. Bradbey, one of the prisoners, came down the same morning to see if they had given warning. They all went into a public-house together, and that evening they gave a fortnight's warning.</p>
               <p>Q. They worked through that fortnight, did they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Walters give the halfpenny per hour advance - A. Not to old hands. They left him on the 27th or 28th, when the fortnight expired, they staid away, and never returned any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being at Guildhall, in the magistrate's room any time - A. Yes; once before the sitting alderman, it is two years ago; Mr. Wade, a printer in Holliday-yard, my landlord sent me there because I took two pound of iron out of his cellar; I was in distress and out of place; my father lived in the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. You were discharged by the alderman directly - A. No, I was sent to Bridewell to be chastized.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you did not tell Mr. Walters of this - A. No. If I had searched the printer's characters, as they have mine, some of them would have been in Botany Bay before this time. Few printers bear a good character.</p>
               <p>MR. WALTER, JUNIOR. Q. You are, I believe, engaged in printing a paper - A. Yes, the Times.</p>

Some one of them had repeatedly applied to ask Mr. Walter's for an advance of wages for their work, it was two or three weeks prior to their giving notice to quit; I conveyed the notice of these men. When they gave notice finally to quit there was only seven men present; when they all parted the other two I saw coming from the premises, afterwards I asked if they gave notice, they said, yes. Delaney, who is employed as overseer, came to me on the Monday morning, he told me the men had all given notice to quit: I went up to these men, they had done their work, they were together; I asked him who answered for the whole, no single one chosed to answer, they answered individually, they said they would quit Mr. Walters' service without the rise of the price of a halfpenny per hour; that is what they said was the cause of their discontent, the dispute only remained on one part of the work, that was a part of their work they expected a rise of their wages; I told them it was extremely wrong, they placed themselves in an aukward predictment; I observed that they were paid very handsomely for what they did, which was the fact; I used to pay them their weekly wages. I repeatedly warned them. They quitted according to their notice on the fourteenth day.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I can ask you what were these mens earnings a week in Mr. Walters's service - A. They were all pressmen; upon the average I should conceive between three and four pound a week, and sometimes upwards of four pound.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you paying your pressmen for work - A. Sixpence for two hundred and fifty sheets, if they worked the small size, or, as the pressmen call it, the hour: that what they call the hour is performed in twenty-five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the defendants at any time make any application to you for an increase of wages - A. Not to me directly, nor in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they, any one, or all of them leave your work - A. They all left my work on the 28th of May; I believe there had been notice, I believe given to the publisher of the paper, that they would leave on such a day, I understood on that day they left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this occasion you any inconveniency of the paper - A. A very great inconveniency</p>
               <p>Q. After they had finished the publication in the morning of the 28th of May about ten or eleven o'clock, at what time should you have wanted them for the paper to go to press in the ordinary course - A. About five or six o'clock. They all left me; the compositors had quitted me two days previous to the pressmen, at least; some of them staid; the pressmen all went on the same day, Westray, Simpson, and Wentworth, they went on the 29th, the day after the pressmen went.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they had given you any notice to quit - A. I received their notice through Westray; nine of the compositors had given warning on the 12th of May, the pressmen had given warning on the 10th. Westray said he was solicited by the companionship to whom he belonged, to enquire whether I intended to raise their wages; this was on the 14th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the parties among those that are indicted that formed the companionship to which Westray belonged - A. Simpson and Wentworth are two, there were six in the companionship, but only three indicted. I told them that; I could give no answer whatever, however, I told him afterwards I had no objection, if eighteen pence a week upon their former wages, these were compositors, and the compositors are paid by the week; he stated that he would communicate it to the rest of the companionship. On the following morning he stated that he had communicated it to the men of his companionship, he said they were not satisfied with that answer, and therefore he was authorized to give warning for them all. I thought he was not disposed to go; however, a few days afterwards, on my addressing himself particularly, he said he must go along with the other men, and he did so go.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a boy of the name of Abrey - A. Yes, he is a fly boy, he has not worked for me four months; I sent him into the country to keep him out of the way of my men, by the advice of persons who knew better than myself</p>
               <p>Q. I need hardly ask you whether the striking of these men put you to any inconveniency - A. To an extraordinary inconveniency, I could obtain no others a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney; I am Counsel for all the compositors. What are the names of the proprietors of the Times, are they (excepting your father) a brother-in-law, and a sister, Mr. Cartlon and Mrs. Rate, do they appear as partners to the world - A. No; they have in proportion to their share, they are equally interested with my father and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. It is carried on for their benefit as well as yours - A. Certainly so; my father and myself print the paper alone, and make a charge to the firm, they certainly pay for a part of the printing, we make a weekly charge for printing the paper, and the profits of the paper are divided between the whole firm.</p>
               <p>Q. You have made use of the term companionship, I believe there is nothing illegal in the term - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Westray was the foreman of his companionship - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the regular course of things, he was the medium from whom you should expect to receive warning - A. I should judge so.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Crow of another companionship, from whom you thought to receive warning for the other men. - A. It was so.</p>

               <p>Q. Westray came to you and told you that he was desired by the men of his companionship to request that you would rise their wages - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave no positive answer - A. No; I told him it was undetermined what price we should give to the duplicate men.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, what should be given to the principal men were undetermined - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a meeting of the masters this year upon the occasion - A. There was three or four meetings: we had a committee, it lasted about a fortnight or three weeks. I stated to Westray, that I thought it was a threat on their part.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Westray tell you he had no thought of leaving you that way - A. He did; it certainly was thought he rather wished to stay than otherways, he wished to know how he was to act, he was to call on me the next morning, I then told him I should take their warning, and if they meaned to go they might go. Westray came about ten days after they had left, he said if I discharged the apprentices he would get me men. In the companionship, of which Westry was foreman, the wages were thirty shillings a week for five hours labour: from twelve to five.</p>

            . I am employed by Mr. Walters as publisher of the Times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on the 14th of May, or about that time the pressmen making any application to you, and what nature. - A. Prior to the time stated, Hurley, Gee, Howlett, Scott, Clifton, Warwick, Burn, Pasquin, and Kidd, they applied to me to speak to Mr. Walter, for some advance for their work which was one halfpenny per hour, I did, Mr. Walter was willing to accede the halfpenny on one part of the work, but refused to the other; after their first application they continued working about two or three weeks, but on the 14th of May after they were off their work, I received a message sent down stairs to me from the overseer of the press, his name is Delany, in consequence of which I went to the men. I put a question, who answered for the whole, none chose to answer for the whole, they were all perfectly silent, there were only seven up stairs, Hurley, Gee, Howlett, Scott, Clifton, Warwick, and Burn.</p>
               <p>COURT. Point out the persons - A. They are all present but Warwick, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Warwick was again called and came in Court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Warwick must stand by.</p>
               <p>Street. There were seven of them there, they said they would answer individually, and they did, Pasquin and Kidd I met as I came out of the door, I requested them to remain, observing they were well paid, and begged of them to consider it, that they had pledged themselves to consider of it, and that they had placed themselves in an aukward situation; I believe it was Hurley observed that he did not conceive there was any thing wrong in their proceedings, or something to that effect. When I met Pasquln and Kidd, as I was coming out of the door, I asked them if they gave warning as well as the others, they said yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any calculation of the wages these men earned - A. About three pound fifteen shillings a week a man, independent of extra work. I have more than once remonstrated with them not to leave their work.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp When a person means to quit a printer, is fourteen days the usual warning - A. It is, and in my situation I should receive it through the overseer, the overseer has the warnings of the men communicated to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And then his duty is to communicate it to you - A. I should consider it so, and then it is communicated to the master.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given an account that the pressmen's weekly wages are three pound fifteen shillings, what would the advance of an halfpenny per hour be upon the master, upon an average a week - A. Six shillings. I have known eight men to have had divided between them thirty-four pounds a week. Mr. Baker's would give the advance on the larger paper, on the smaller he would not.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard of these men not working of a Saturday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181010310071"/>night, but on the other days there work is a greater part of the night - A. One part of the work is fifteen or sixteen hours, and the other part ten or eleven; the persons that do the heavy work on one night, do light work the other, and so alternatively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. And when there is a pressure of business must not they work eighteen or twenty hours - A. Yes, most part of the night.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the wages that the compositors were earning previous to the 14th of May - A. I am, they were earning two guineas; they work from two o'clock in the after noon till two in the morning.</p>

               <p>Court. We cannot hear that. In consequence of what Brockett came about did you converse with these defendants - A. I did not. The whole of the defendants, Woolley, Mackenzie, Craig, Chapman, Simpson, and the others, with the exception of Westray, all gave warning on the 14th of May, each one for himself, they came altogether, and successively gave warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give you a reason for the notice to quit - A. No, none of them; I could not help expressing my regret; I said, I was sorry that they were about to go, I was loth to part with them; I said, the measure was precipitate and rash; I cannot say that they made any answer, I wished them to wait for the masters. They all went away on the 26th and the office was left without a man. Mr. Flint was kind enough to offer assistance through his men and apprentices. None of the defendants returned to Mr. Walter's work before the indictment was preferred.</p>

Yes; in May last, Howlett came with Hurley to me, I was working at the press, they said I had applied to Mr. Baldwin for work; I said, I had not; they told me there was a resolution passed, that no man should take a newsman's situation in any of the papers for six months to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where that resolution passed - A. At the house where the society is held, the Coach and Horses, Water-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any reason why that resolution was passed - A. Upon the account of the advance being made by the men of one half penny per hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that advance been granted by the masters - A. By part, it was resisted by Mr. Walters and others. Howlett or Hurley requested me to attend at Mr. Merrits, the Coach and Horses, Water-lane, on Whitmonday. I went to the Coach and Horses, Howlett, Scott, Gee, Clifton, Warwick, and Burn, were there; Howlett wished to have two men impressed, and knowing that I knew a press master, they wished me to introduce them to him; these two men were Fitzgerald and Miller, they were then working for Mr. Walter: Howlett said, he was fully convinced that Fitzgerald and Miller had not the advance that the other man demanded, the other men all agreed to it I accompanied them to the press master, who is a relation of mine; Howlett, Gee, Warwick, and Clifton, Warwick was put on shore at Billingsgate, Howlett, Clifton, Gee, and myself, only went to the press master; I saw my relation, they gave the necessary information, that Fitzgerald and Miller were both deserters from the navy. Mr. Fare, the press master, said, he would come and take them; after some more conversation between the parties, he was given to understand the house was in the city of London; of course, he could not act in the city, that prevented their being impressed; he made no other objection and we came away. Howlett said; provided a warrant could be obtained of the Lord Mayor, and the press gang brought in the night, would answer their purpose; they wanted to stop Mr. Walter's publication of the newspaper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know from any of the defendants at the bar, whether there were any allowance for the Times men, as a compensation for leaving Mr. Walter's employ - A. They received a pound a week-per man, I saw it paid by the landlord, John Moult, at the Coach and Horses; I saw four or five pound paid to six men.</p>

I did, more than once; I believe they struck on the Monday, on on the Sunday I saw Howlett, I asked him to return to his master's service; he made a scoff, and said, I could not get any one else to work it, we must keep the old hands, we could get no others to work; the next man I saw was Hurley, I said, well my lad, do you mean to stop, Mr. Walter is fond of some of you, but them that cannot do their work he does not mean to keep; he said, if you do not keep us all you shall not keep one, this was after they gave notice, but before they left. When Mr. Walter's was out of town. Hurley came to my house, said he had been ill treated by the companionship; he asked me to employ him at the risk of my own situation; I did; Mr. Street came and said I did not do right; I gave him some money, and told him I would give him some more at my house, I believed him to have been led away by the rest.</p>

               <p>Q. For what purpose were these meetings held - A. For the advance of wages, I know of no other purpose; I sooner than lose my situation should have been satisfied with the price given, but I must say, I should have given the preference to an advance; I did not say so to the men, I thought so in my own mind.
