               <p>Wm Monksfield. I am servant to Mr. Everett. On the 7th of March, about three o'clock, I was in the warehouse at the desk, which is just behind the door. The door was open, and the cloth stood in a corner, so that the door prevented my seeing the cloth. I heard a foot come in and go out again, but did not see the person. I went out at the door, and then saw the prisoner with a piece of superfine crimson under his arm, about half a dozen yards from the door. I called and asked him what business he had with that cloth. He immediately turned round, and, seeing me, dropt the cloth, and ran. I called to a gentleman to stop him, which he did, and brought him to the warehouse door. I took up the cloth and brought it in. (Produced and deposed to.) He was near out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Whether there was not a man came into the warehouse before?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050003"/>Monksfield. There was a man came in, and asked for one Mr. Switt. I told him I knew no such person, and he turned and went out again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>That man asked me if I would earn a shilling. I was willing to earn it. He desired me to carry that piece of cloth to Bishopsgate-street, and delivered it to me, and said he would be there as soon as I. I took it under my arm, and when the gentleman called stop thief, I was afrighted, and throwed it down. I went along with him willingly, and the gentleman that delivered the cloth to me went another way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Monksfield. How long before you saw the prisoner with the cloth was it that the other man came into the warehouse?</p>
               <p>Monksfield. That man came into the warehouse I believe about ten minutes before I saw the prisoner.</p>

He said, Give me your money. I said, Do not use me ill, and I will give you my money. I gave him I believe between six and eight shillings in silver. He took my watch out of my pocket himself. It had a seal set in gold, and a black ribban to it. Then he left me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. It was moonlight, but there was a lamp just behind me. I am certain the prisoner is the man. I gave several gentlemen the descriptions of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of any other words?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. He said, Make haste. When he went off, he went up an alley by a Romish chapel; I believe it is. I went down Virginia-street, and met some gentlemen in the center of it. I said, Gentlemen, I have been robbed Said one of them, I have been robbed of four shillings and a watch. I was at the taking of the prisoner at New Ragfair on the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. I saw it again at the Justice's: the seal and a silver cap were taken off. Mr. Tyrawley sent me word he believed he had my watch. I had before told him I had been robbed of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. How could you know me in the dark with other clothes on?</p>
               <p>Hodgkin. I had described his face, as being wide on his cheek bones, and a thin, meager face downwards.</p>

            . On the Saturday morning Mr. Hodgkin came to my house; I not being at home, he came again in the afternoon. He said, He knew I was a man of spirit, and desired I would go with him, and help to take a man that had robbed him of his watch and six or seven shillings, and nine guineas; saying, He had heard where the man was. He described the man, and his clothes he had on when he robbed him. He said he had on a blue surtout coat with a cape on it, a red waistcoat, his own hair, and a black neckcloth about his neck: his face very broad over the upper part, but very thin downwards. I went with him into several houses till ten at night, but could see nothing of him. On the Sunday morning it was my turn to find a minister for Wapping church. When I was in church, a person brought me word they knew where to find the highwayman. I went out to Mr. Hodgkin and asked him if he had any arms. He fetched a pair of pistols. I loaded one, and, I believe he did the other. We had heard the prisoner was a very desperate fellow, and always went with his hand in his pocket armed. We went to a house in a little court in Parrot-Alley; we lifted up the latch, and the door opened. The watchman pointed to me, as much as to say he was in such a room. I set my shoulder to the room door, and forced it open. I had my pistol in my left hand, and this instrument in my right. (Producing an instrument made of lignumvita, something in the nature of a stail, the handle about ten or twelve inches long. The other about eight, loaded with lead on the inside, fastened together with a strong silk cord.) This I made to carry in my pocket to defend myself against the cole-heavers. There was the prisoner sitting by the fire. I went up to him, and said, If you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050004"/> stir, I'll blow your brains out. Mr. Hodgkin came up, and said, This is the man. The watchmen searched him. I saw two silver watches taken from him, but none of them were Mr. Hodgkin's.</p>

               <p>Lacon. I tried it with my hand, and found it fast. I burst it open with my shoulder. We found some pistol-bullets in the house, and a blue surtout coat lying in a chest, which the prosecutor said was the coat the prisoner had on when he robbed him.</p>

            . I live in Wapping. I was headbrough. On the 19th of March, in the morning, the beadle came to me at the church, and told me I must come to take a highwayman. I went with Mr. Hodgkin and others to this house joining to Parrot-Alley, in East Smithfield. I knew the man by the description Mr. Hodgkin had given of him. Mr. Lacon put the pistol to his breast, and said, He was a dead man if he moved. I took hold of one arm, and the beadle searched him for firearms; he found a watch upon him, and I found another in his right hand pocket. The watch that I found is claimed by Mr. Wood, who, upon hearing the man was taken, came to my house with his pocket-book, in which were the marks of his watch. It appeared to be his. We found some bullets in a chest in the room.</p>

Mr. Lacon and I went with Mr. Hodgkin to help to take him, but could not find him. The next morning I was told, as I was going to church, that a watchman had seen the thief go into a house where we were informed he lodged. I went and told Mr. Hodgkin; then we went to the house, and found the prisoner and a woman sitting by the fire. Mr. Lacon held a pistol, and ordered him to surrender. Then we searched him. I took a watch out of his pocket ( Produced in court); it belongs to a person in Newgate-street. I found ten leaden bullets in a box in the same room. (Produced in court.)</p>

               <p>Tyrawley. The prisoner was twice in my shop; the first thing he brought was a gold shank of a seal. He asked me whether it was gold, saying, he bought it for fifteen shillings at Portsmouth, and was afraid he had been cheated. I got a light, and took off the impression of the seal. I did not stop it, but told him if he would carry it to a gentleman, he would tell him whether it was gold or not (thinking to direct him to Mr. Hodgkin). He went away, and soon after coming again, he said he had sold the seal, and offered this watch to sale; then I stopped it. He went away. I sent my boy after him, who saw him go into a public house. Then I sent for Mr. Hodgkin, and showed him the impression of the seal; he said it was his, and he described the watch. The next day the prisoner was taken. (The impression of the seal produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is from my seal. It is my family coat of arms.</p>
               <p>Q. to Tyrawley. How was the prisoner dressed when he came to you?</p>
               <p>Tyrawley. He had on a red waistcoat, and a blue surtout coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was the same man?</p>

Then I'turned her away again, having no suspicion of her dishonesty. About three months, ago a person came to me, and said, I had been greatly wronged by this Smith. I asked the person where she lived; she said with the prisoner. Said I, Have you had any quarrel with her? She said, Yes. Then I said, Go about your business. Some time after that another came and said the same. I bid her go about her business. After that I had some reason to believe she had not been honest. I went and got a search-warrant, and found a great many of my things, more than I have laid in the indictment; to the amount of 3 or 4 l. I am a turner by trade.

I took him up, and in consequence of this, I found goods at several pawnbrokers. I found a remnant of shaloon at Mr. Marshalls's; and at Mr. Andrews's I found two remnants of scarlet hair shag, two remnants of Pompadour cloth, and a remnant of orange coloured shaloon; at

These were our property. I suppose Davis stole them, because his wife, through the assistance of the girl, had disposed of them. I have inquired Andrews's character, and find it a very good one.

            . I am a pawnbroker. There were four parcels of goods pawned with me by three different women. E. Taylor brought one piece, and wanted 16 s. upon it. I said it would not do for me, and made her take it back again. I cannot swear to any of the women that brought the four parcels. I turned several parcels back that Davis's wife brought.</p>

The prisoner came into our house on the 9th of Feb. between four and five in the afternoon, and asked for Mrs. Smith, who lodges in our house. I asked, if she would go up to her, or should I call her down. She said she would go up. The prisoner should have gone up but two pair of stairs, but she went up three, and she returned in about ten minutes with a great bundle in her hand. I inquired if she had been with Mrs. Smith, and found she had not. I ran out and found her about an hundred yards from our house. I told her they were my clothes; she said they were not. She said Mrs. Smith gave her them to wash. I held her till my master came and took hold of her; they were the things laid in the indictment ( mentioning them by name). They were taken out of a back garret and front garret up three pair of stairs. They were all clean but the table cloths of my master's. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>

She went out of the room and brought me a bundle of things, and said I must get what I could on them. When they brought me back, I came willingly. Though Mrs. Smith said she did not know me, I have known her between five and six years.</p>

The next day I counted them, and there were no more than fifteen of them. Among the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050009"/> twenty I had observed one of the baskets to be of a different kind, and this is that very basket. I mentioned that at seeing it.</p>

There, as the coach was turning, the people were pretty much on a crowd. The prosecutor's coat was unbuttoned. I saw the prisoner take a red and white, or purple handkerchief out of his right hand pocket. He wrapped it up, as if going to put it into his pocket. I hit the gentlemen on his shoulder, and said, You have lost your handkerchief; he felt, and said, I have. I said, This is the fellow that has got it. I took hold of him, searched him, and found two handkerchiefs upon him, which he said were his own. I asked him if there were marks on either of them; he said there were not; but we looked, and found the letter A upon a corner of one of them.</p>

I found it as he had said, I went into my study, and found all my drawers taken out. There were several mourning rings, medals, and things missing. I mist two silver spoons and two silver salts from out of the parlour, and one silver spoon from out of the pantry. I mist also a tea spoon. I thought this must have been done by a workman. I suspected the prisoner, and upon inquiring, found he had been seen with a great deal of money, gold pieces, and medals that he knew nothing of the value of. I applied to Sir

I asked him concerning the trunk at her house, he said he knew nothing of it, but that it was given him by a journeyman carpenter, whom he did not know where to find. I went back, and got a warrant from the bench of justices at St. Margaret's Hill, and opened the trunk, in the presence of Crisp the constable. I found in it three silver table spoons, two of them with crests, and one with no mark. The rings with the mottoes on them, and a bag of medals, such as I had lost. The medals I do not swear to, there may be others like them. I sealed them up in the bag.</p>

After that the prisoner came and offered two shammy skins, and said he had some dark canvas, or something of that sort. I desired him to bring that. When he was gone, I went and told the prosecutor; he came, and the prisoner was stopt when he came with the Russia drab.</p>
               <p>Thomas Hall. On the 25th of March, the prisoner came with two skins and some Russia drab, and offered them to sale. I had had notice from the prosecutor, that he had lost such. I asked the prisoner the price; he asked 12 d. each for the skins, and 10 d. a yard for the Russia drab. I kept him longer than I should do, expecting the prosecutor. I slipt them behind the counter, and said I would stop him. He attempting to make his escape, I catched hold of the skirt of his coat, but he pulled it off, left that with me, and got away.</p>

It being dusk, I got a candle. They kept telling me to reach down goods. I feared the y were upon some bad design. The goods mentioned in the indictment were there when they came in, and when they went out they were gone. The prisoner went away first, and said to the other, I will go, and you will come to me.</p>

On Easter Monday, about nine o'clock, I had a suspicion of the prisoner and his wife making use of my property. On the 27th of March I followed the prisoner to a public house. I went to him. He said he had been to my wife and paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050013"/> his rent. The boy carried a pot of beer. I went home and got into the room before the boy. I saw a candle standing without a candlestick, and said, What is become of your candlestick? The wife said she left it at such a man's room. I clapt my hand to the bedstead to pull it down. The wife said, I will fetch your sheets, they are out. I pulled the bedstead down, and I saw the blanket, bolster case and sheets were gone; then I mist a brass fender and a flat iron. I then proposed to him, if he would tell me where my things were, I would make up the matter. I could get nothing out of him for half an hour. Said he, If I tell, you will prosecute me. I took him and his wife into custody. Then I found some of my things at two pawnbrokers. I can swear to all the things but the frying-pan.</p>

I advertised a reward of two guineas for a discovery. On the Thursday following, at night, I heard a noise of somebody in a carpenter's shop, which is at the back of mine. I fired off two horse pistols and waited some time, and found every thing quiet. About two in the morning, I heard somebody call, Mr. Hopkins! Mr. Hopkins ! you have been robbed again! the thief is in the carpenter's shop, and here are two of your coppers dropt in the street. I came down and went into the yard. We surrounded the place. I went into a back place, and, under a form in a wash-house, I found the prisoner at the bar; he is my neighbour's apprentice. He was asked how long he had been there; he said, Ever since eleven o'clock. A neighbour of mine told him he saw him in Mr. Ewers's shop, a little before the coppers were found in the street.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Bill's other apprentice pulled the washing tub from before the prisoner. He had pulled it before him, to conceal himself. Though the prisoner had been absent from the Monday night, I had no suspicion of him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bills. Where had the prisoner been all that time?</p>
               <p>Bills. He was in the neighbourhood all the time. I had seen nothing of him since the Monday till the Friday.</p>

               <p>Bills. I take as much pains as most people do with apprentice.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner was coming along with a carcase of mutton at Hay-Hill, near Berkeley Square, between eleven and twelve o'clock that night. I asked him what he had got there? To the best of my knowledge I think he said he had got a dead dog. He attempted to go into the buildings where I was at watch, but I would not let him; then he went into Brudenell Muse, just by Berkeley-Square, and hung it up in a stable there. It was a carcase of mutton. He used to lie there. I knew him before. Then I went to my master that employed me, and told him of it. He desired me to take care of it. so that the prisoner did not spoil it. I went and took it, and laid it by. The prisoner was taken the next day by the Muse. He had some bread there, which he sopped in water, and threw it about as if he was mad. I by enquiring found the mutton belonged to Mr. Jolley.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jolley. I had the mutton again. It was my property. We have a particular mark in our business. I knew it well.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

Said he, Have you lost any thing else? I said I had, an old sack, marked with T. R. in a ring with a star. He informed me Dyer was stopped with such. I have known Dyer from a child; he was born in the neighbourhood. I lit of Dobbins at the election at Brentford, on the sixteenth day of the month; but the mob took his part there, and took him away from me.</p>

            . I live at Crookham, near Crundal. The two prisoners were at Crookham three weeks ago yesterday, and they asked my son how far it was to Reading. He told them about sixteen miles. Then they asked him if he would buy a horse; they asked him 50 s. for him. At last they allowed him for 30 s. My son telling me this, and that he thought they had stole him, I said, Let us examine them, and take them up. Dyer is a chimney-sweeper. I asked him if the horse was to be sold. It was a sorrel gelding, with a bald face and four white feet; they had him in the road. Dyer said, Yes, the worse is my misfortune. I said, Why so? He said he had a couple of apprentice boys run away from him, and he had heard they were at Guildford, but that he took but sixpence in his pocket, thinking to go to Guildford and back the same day, and when he came there, he heard they had been there and were gone on for Farnham: that he went to Farnham, and there he was told by a chimney-sweeper, of whom they had enquired, that they were gone for Reading, and he said he must sell his horse to bear his charges, for he could do nothing without his two boys. Said I, Where do you live? He said, At Hammersmith. I looked in the horse's mouth, and asked how old he was. He said he did not know. I desired him to trot him; he did: then to gallop him; he did. I then said, What do you ask for him? He said, Six-and-twenty shillings. I said, I suppose you stole the horse; and he said he came very honestly by him. I questioned him very hard, and said, If he would go before a Justice of the peace and clear his character, I would give him five-and-twenty shillings for him: he said he would. I said, Where did you buy him? He said, At Smithfield, and that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050016"/> had had him two years next Whitsun-Tuesday. Said I, Perhaps there is some fault in him that I cannot see, therefore I'll just go up to an old farmer that has more judgement that I. I went and said to him, It is my opinion they have stole the horse. The old man said, I believe so too. He advised me to take him before the Justice The prisoner was very willing to go. I shewed Dyer the road round, and Dobbins and I went the foot way. We met at Sir

               <p>As I was going along the road. I met this horse with a bridle and sack on him. There was no rider. We thought he had thrown his rider. We enquired all the way we went thro' Shepperton and other places. We could find no owner. We went through Guildford and Farnham, but could not hear of any owner. We were very hard drove for want of victuals, and then we offered to sell the horse. We went there to see if we could get some work.</p>

               <p>Going along together, between four and five o'clock, we met the horse near Sunbury, with a sack and bridle; we went on and enquired for an owner, but could not hear of any body that had lost a horse; then we got upon him and rode to Guildford, and enquired there, but could not find any body that had lost a horse; we then went on, and could get no work. Dyer then proposed to sell him. I said, I did not know whether we had best to sell him or not. I was fearful we should be prosecuted if we did, but at last he resolved to sell him. My friends are in Berkshire, and cannot come.</p>

Last Easter Sunday, at night, I was a little in liquor, and I went to see an acquaintance in Penitent-street, at the sign of the Cannon. I staid a little latish, and went away about eleven o'clock. Going along the street, I met two young women. I was smoaking a pipe, and one of them asked me to give her a pipe. The prisoner was one of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Ryder. This was in Ratcliff-highway. They asked me where I was going? I said, I was locked out of my lodging, and being a stranger in this country, did not know where to get a lodging. The prisoner said I should go along with her. When I came into her house, I paid her eighteen pence for my lodging. It was in some court. I went to-bed, but before I went to bed I sent for sixpennyworth of brandy, as she desired something to drink. The other girl went and brought the liquor in and went away. After that, the prisoner sent for a pot of beer. Then she came to bed to me. She blowed the candle out, and after she had been in bed about ten minutes, she got out of bed, saying, she must go and lock the door, for fear of thieves. She took all my things out of my pockets, and did not come back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you on a ground floor, or up stairs?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050017"/>Ryder. It was in a room up one pair of stairs; she left one of her stockings behind her. After that, she sent a woman to get me out of the house. The woman came swearing at me, and asked me what business I had there. She asked me if I had lost any thing. I did not know then that I had. I went to look after my things, and found my watch, money, and things were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money?</p>
               <p>Ryder. About 7 s. My watch was a silver one, and I lost a paper tobacco-box, and a leather pocket-book. When I came to look about for my things, I found one of her stockings. I asked the woman after the prisoner; she said she knew nothing of her. She swore so at me, I went out of the house, and went up to Whitechapel, got an officer from the watch-house, and went to search the house, but the woman would not let us in. We observed the window to be open, and the key of the door hanging in the window. The watchman took it and opened the door. We went in, and up stairs, and found the prisoner lying in the bed where she and I had laid before, and another young man and woman in the same room. The officer took them all to the watch-house. We found nothing on the bed then but my pocket-book. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Had you searched well before you went out of the room?</p>
               <p>Ryder. I had searched the bed all over, and under it; they were taken before the bench of Justices, and were all three committed. The other two are got clear, but I do not know how they got clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body else in the room before you lost your things, besides the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Ryder. The prisoner is the only person that was in the room at the time. I am sure I had my watch, money, and pocket-book, after the other girl went out of the room and brought up the liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he sober or fuddled?</p>
               <p>Thorburn. He was sober, to the best of my judgment. I asked him whereabouts he lost them; he told us. The watch-house was very full of prisoners, so I could not go. I sent some of the watchmen, and soon after I went down myself, but I could not get in. I called to the girl, and said, Who have you got in the room? She swore there was no body in the house but herself. I heard a girl call down not to open the door; after that we opened the shutter, and found the key hanging on the inside. We took it, and opened the door, and found the girl which the prosecutor said was the person that took his things. We searched the room, but found nothing except the pocket-book. We took them all before the Justices, except one man, who got away.</p>

He gave it her directly. She asked him where he was going; he said by the May-pole, but could not get in. She said if he would go along with her, she would help him to a night's lodging. He went with her. I said, the house was none of mine. It belongs to Mrs. Talbot. He sent for a pint of beer, and said he had no more money. She offered him the farthing, and he would not take it. I left them and went to the King of Prussia, at Saltpetre-Bank, and when I came back again, they had turned the man out of the house. I have no friends in London, my friends live a great many miles off. There were four beds in that room, and people in them.</p>

He piled it up in a heap, and went in, and presently he came out again with a bar, and it made a noise against a post. I knew it to be iron. I said to him, What have you got? He was going off. I said, My friend, I must know what you have got. I ran, and catched hold of him, and he threw the old iron about my legs. I called for help. There were two gentlemen coming along, who stopt him, and we brought him to the watch-house. I said, I would send him to Newgate. He said, It is hard to be sent to Newgate for old iron; that he said as I was bringing him to Newgate.</p>

I told the gentleman he had lost his handkerchief; he felt in his pocket, and said he had. I had the prisoner by the collar. He pulled it out of his bosom, and dropt it down.

After I had served her, she said it was not enough, she wanted the same quantity more. It came to sixpence. They were both put up together, and she paid for it. There was a piece, containing ten yards, lying on the compter. I suppose I looked on one side when she took the cotton, and left her lawn. Immediately after she was gone I missed the cotton. I got over the counter, and pursued her. She was got about the distance of three doors, when I saw her turning down a little court. When I came to the corner, I saw her running up the court as hard as she could. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050023"/> overtook her in about thirty yards running, and told her she must go back with me. In coming along she dropt the cotton. I took it up, and brought that and her into my shop. I sent for a constable. She acknowledged the crime, and begged pardon, to be let at liberty, but I would not, being almost sure she had robbed me once before. (The cotton produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Westcott. It was some time on a Monday: I cannot tell the day of the month. We went to Mr. Grece's house: he is a taylor, and lives in <placeName id="t17690405-36-crimeloc196">North-Alley, York-buildings</placeName>

               <p>Q. How did you get into his house?</p>
               <p>Westcott. The door was upon the latch; we went up into Duke's Place, and Tresler disposed of them for three guineas and a half. I staid at a corner of a street the while. I was not with him at the time he sold them; he told me he sold them to a Jew, named Lyon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any share of the money?</p>
               <p>Westcott. I had a guinea and a half, and two shillings of it.</p>

I brought them home, and laid them down on the table; the things mentioned in the indictment. Whether I shut the outward door or not, I cannot tell. As it grew dark, I was called down to put up the window shutters. I then found the things were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any of the things since?</p>
               <p>Copage. No, not till Wesoott gave me a piece of the night-gown, which I have here. We had a search-warrant from my Lord Mayor to search the Jew's house, named Lyon. I took an old coat under my arm, and went to Duke's Place. I said I would sell it. I went to Lyon's house, they said he was not at home. I said, Did not a person sell some gold and silver waistcoats here the day before? They said, Yes. When Lyon came in, I asked him the same, he said he did buy them; then I searched his house, but there was not a rag of cloth in the house, except some linen, and an old waistcoat. When he found what we were upon in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050024"/> searching, then he said he had not bought them.</p>

            . I live in Chandos-Street, Covent-Garden. I missed money several times, and did not know how to come at the knowledge of the person that took it. I took and marked some on Easter-Eve, and on the Sunday morning I missed out of my breeches pocket five shillings of the marked money. On the Monday night I had a few friends with me: after they were gone I put more money marked; some in my coat, and some in my waistcoat pocket. When I went to put my clothes on, I missed seven shillings. I had marked twenty-four shillings, though I found but seventeen left.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Bell. I keep a coffee-room and wine vaults. The prisoner was waiter in the coffee-room. I sent my man that waited at the bar to him for change for half a guinea; when my man brought it, I gave him a strict charge to keep that from all other money. He delivered it to me. I took and locked it up. After which I examined it, and found three shillings, to the best of my memory, that I had marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know your own mark?</p>
               <p>Bill. I did not mark them all alike.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you in your house?</p>
               <p>Bill. We have seven servants, when we are full. We had six then, besides a hired porter. I have trusted the prisoner with a thousand pounds before this happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the other servants the same access to his room as he?</p>
               <p>Bill. They had.</p>

As I was going into the prisoner's house, the George in St. Giles's, I met him. I said to him, Is your name Maginnes? He said it was. I delivered the note to him. He looked at it, and said, Why could he not put his name to it? How long has this money been come due? I said, I would look and see. I was going to read it to him, when he snatched it out of my hand as soon as I had read the first of March, and refused to give it me again. When I asked him for the money, he said, I might get the money and be d - d: he would go and stay in the Marshalsea before he would pay a farthing.</p>

She was very difficult, asked for several sorts, and looked over a great many parcels. At last she fixed upon one, and ordered me to cut some off. After that she went out of the shop. When she was gone, I looked to see if she had taken any thing. I missed a piece of lawn. I followed her into Bedford-Bury, and there I took her. Under her cloak she had the piece. (Produced in court.) It is my property, and was lying by her when she was in the shop. There are twelve yards of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am an unfortunate woman of the town. The prosecutor met with me in the street, and took me to the Turk's Head, in James-Street, where he treated me with wine. Some familiarites passing between us, and he having no money, ordered me to come to his shop. I came, and he gave me this piece of lawn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Was you ever in company with the prisoner at the bar at any tavern?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same defence she made before the Justice. Upon my oath I never was in company with her in any room but in my shop in my life. I never saw her but once before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050027"/> to my knowledge, which was in my shop, and then I believe she robbed me. There is not a word in her defence true. I never was in a tavern with her; I never drank wine with, nor gave her this piece of cloth, or any thing else.</p>

He was not gone above a quarter of an hour, before he came back: then we went to the place where the ship lay. She was dropt down to Deptford. Then said he, As I want to buy some trowsers and jackets, we will go over to Rag-Fair and buy them. When we got there, he said, I have got some handkerchiefs, and I want to sell or pawn them. He desired me to go into that gentleman's shop to pawn them. I went in, and the gentleman stopped me.</p>

I thought, if they did not turn over a bridge that goes to Denham, they could be upon no good. I seeing them come by that, I took a stick and went after them. I saw them very busy with their hands down, and when I got about two or three hundred yards from them, I saw them go down towards some bushes. Then I had an opportunity to get farther on. I saw them just going down before. I jumped over the Ware-Gate, and passed Fletcher; then seeing

Just before I got to Hawke, he took his handkerchief and wiped his face. I took hold of Lively. I could not get him on so fast as Hawke. I left him, and went on. Hawke threw some craw-fish down. I took up three. I found nine more. Lively came to us. I brought them all three to my father's. I got my father to acquit them. Going up to Denham, I advised them to pursue better ways. Lively had a little remorse of conscience, and said he would never be concerned with them any more. He added, Hawke said he would come and steal this net in the night. I let them go. I heard them go past me, and heard Lively say, Don't go any farther than the crawfish which I tied in the ditch. One of the others said, D - n it, I'll go and have the net that is worth 4 l.

The prisoner said, I am innocent, do not go to take an innocent man's life away. Mr. Spinnage asked the deceased, whether he would take his oath of it, as he hoped to go to heaven when he died. He answered, Yes. There was a book put into his hand, and he swore it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what he meant, when he answered your question, by saying the grinders?</p>
               <p>J. Palmer. Yes; the prisoner and his brother had been about the streets grinding a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen them before?</p>
               <p>J. Palmer. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the deceased live after this?</p>
               <p>J. Palmer. He lived from the Thursday night till about ten minutes after two on the Sunday morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him after the Thursday night?</p>
               <p>J. Palmer. I saw him on the Friday morning; I believe it was about eight o'clock; he said then they had done for him; they had done his work.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he go into particulars?</p>
               <p>J. Palmer. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say they had done for him?</p>
               <p>J. Palmer. No, he said he (meaning the prisoner) had done for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody in your hearing ask him what had led to this unhappy accident?</p>
               <p>J. Palmer. No.</p>

O! said he, for God's sake go and fetch somebody. I ran out for a surgeon, and the surgeon came in about ten minutes. Mr. Curtis was in our shop when he came. He lay upon the ground with his clothes off. He was carried home on a chairman's horse, and put to bed. The surgeon desired another surgeon might be sent for. Mr.

            , desiring the prisoner and his brother might be sent there, to see which of them it was that had stabbed the deceased. The prisoner and his brother were brought up close to the right side of the bed where Mr. Spinnage's clerk, Mr. Jones, and several other persons were.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell exactly what past, as near as you can recollect.</p>
               <p>W. Palmer. Mr. Spinnage said to him, Pray, Mr. Curtis, which of these men is it that gave you this stab? The deceased held his right hand out to the prisoner, but I do not know whether he quite touched him or no. He pointed to him with his bloody hand, and said, That is the man in the blue apron. It being candle light, he said presently after, I beg pardon, Mr. Spinnage, it is the man in a green apron. (The prisoner had a green apron on.) Blue and green are very easily mistaken for each other by candlelight. Mr. Spinnage said, Are you sure and positive this is the man, as you hope to go to heaven if you depart this life? He answered, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him any time after this?</p>

            . On Thursday, the 23d of March, I was spending the evening with Justice Spinnage, when the prisoner and his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050032"/> brother were brought in. A little after seven o'clock, a message came from Mr. Thompson, the surgeon, desiring they might be brought down, and that Mr. Spinnage would come and take the deposition of the dying man, the surgeon having said the wound was mortal. Upon seeing the coat and waistcoat that were brought to the office, I thought it was a very bad affair, there being two stabs on the left side of the coat and waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean a stab through the coat, and another through the waistcoat only?</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderton. There were two separate cuts; one above the other; one not so deep as the other. There had been two stabs. I went with Justice Spinnage to the house, but I do not know the name of the street. The deceased lay in a buroe bedstead, with the head turned to the door. Major

             desired the two men might be put to the end of the bed, between the foot and the side (it was a very small bedstead) as close as they could be. I stood near the Major, and the prisoner and his brother were next: they were handcuffed together. I said to Mr. Curtis, The surgeon has pronounced your wound mortal, in a very few hours you will be before your Maker, point out to me which is the man that did you the injury. Upon which he drew his hand from under the bed clothes, and pointed to the prisoner, and said, That is the man that stabbed me. I again desired him (as he seemed very sensible, but in a languishing condition) to take rest, and point out to me the person again. Upon which he pointed to the prisoner again, and said, Him with a blue apron (as he took it to be); and more particularly he said, It was a man with one eye. Upon which I desired the people to take notice. (The prisoner has but one eye.) After that the deceased very earnestly desired the prisoner might be let go, saying he was innocent, and had done him no harm, for it was the other that stabbed him. I turned round to see the information that was preparing, something having past that I did not hear, when the prisoner desired the deceased to forgive him, and offered to kneel down with his hands together. The deceased said, God forgive you, but I cannot; you are the man that stabbed me! The information was then brought for the deceased to sign; but he was so weak, I was desired to give way for Major

            's clerk to bring the book for him to sign. I moved away for the book to be laid under him, and the information was signed by the dying man, by his making a mark upon it; and afterwards he was sworn upon it. I desired the witnesses to take notice of every thing that past, as I was sure I should never see the deceased again. I was very cautious in every act I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When the deceased pointed to the prisosoner first, do you recollect what the prisoner said?</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderton. The prisoner said he was deaf, and what he said was repeated to the prisoner. Then he said, He was not the man, he was innocent. As Mr. Spinnage is a major, and so am I, I see some have mentioned questions as asked by him, which I asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper. (He takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderton. This is the information. I saw the deceased make this mark upon it. ( Pointing to it.) He could not support his hand to make a cross, so he made this long mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was sensible when he made this mark?</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderton. He was as sensible as I am of every circumstance I had been speaking of. I take it from his pertinent answers, from his behaviour, and from his asking for something to drink after he had signed. He shewed thro' the whole that he was sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the prisoner be in the room with the deceased?</p>
               <p>Mr. Alderton. It might be altogether about twenty minutes, while the information was taking, and these questions asked.</p>

In the interim Mr. Curtis's man brought in a bloody coat and waistcoat, with a message, desiring the two prisoners might be brought to the deceased. I took them both to Mr. Curtis's house in Heart-Street, by Grosvenor-Square. When we came in, Mr. Curtis was groaning in great agony. I went up to him, and said, Sir, which is the man that stabbed you? (The two brothers were in the room, but not close by the bedside.) He pointed to the prisoner, as I thought, and said, That is the man in the blue apron. I knowing it to be a green one, said, Come close to the bedside. Then I said, Mr. Curtis, put your hand upon the man that did it. He put out his hand from his left breast, all over bloody, and put his hand on the prisoner's left-hand, and said, That is the man that stabbed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He never touched my hand; he put his hand upon my coat.</p>

I believe the Major was then in the back parlour. There was a little short knife taken out of the prisoner's brother's pocket, but there was no appearance of blood upon it. While the Major was examining them, a message was brought from Mr. Thompson, desiring the Major would let the prisoners come down to the person that was wounded, for he was then in a state of sensibility, to discover the person that had stabbed him. They were carried there, and placed by the bedside, as has been mentioned. The question was asked Mr. Curtis, If he knew the man that stabbed him?

            . On the 23d of March I had been in the country, and came back to the Running Horse. The person that keeps the house said, There had been a bad accident happened; young Mr. Curtis, the tinman, has been stabbed. I went to the door. Mr. Palmer was there. I went into his shop, and there the deceased lay on the ground all bloody. I said he should be got away. There was a chairman or two, so I helped to carry and lay him on a chairman's horse, and he was carried to his father's house in Hart-Street Grosvenor-Square. We took him from the horse and laid him on a bureau bedstead; it stood with the head towards the door which we went in at. The surgeon examined the wound; it was upon his left side; he probed it. I apprehended it to be about four inches deep. After he had laid still a little while, one that was by, and I myself, asked him, If he could know the person if he saw him that gave him this blow or wound; he said, Yes. Upon that, by the desire of some gentlemen that were in the room, the prisoner and his brother were sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that they were in custody?</p>
               <p>Walden. I had heard they were taken up; and it had been told to the deceased in my hearing, that they were taken up and gone to Justice Spinnage's, by the description of being grinders. The prisoner and his brother were brought in; and I thinking they stood too near the head of the bed, I said, Do not do so, take and set them towards the feet, that he may have a full view of them. Upon which they were brought towards the feet, near the fire-place. After some time, I said, Mr. Curtis, was either of these men the man that gave you the blow or wound? His answer was, Yes. Upon which I said, I would have you be very particular and clear, as you may b e upon a dying bed; and farther I asked him, Which was the man? He with his right hand pointed towards the prisoner on the right. They were hand-cuffed together. I said, What, the man on the right? He said, Yes. What, said I, the man with one eye? He said, Yes, that is the man. Upon which they were brought nearer to the deceased; then it was asked by a gentleman, whether he was clear, and sure, he was the man, mentioning to him the consequence of being uncertain in taking an oath. I do not know that I saw him touch the prisoner, but he was within a very little of touching him, and said, I am very sure that is the man. Upon which Justice Spinnage swore him. I asked the prisoner to confess, and to speak the truth, whether it was him or not. Upon which he went down upon his knees, expressing he was as innocent as the child unborn. This is all I can relate as to what arose that night. The next morning I visited the deceased, but he could not talk then: I went to him twice after, that was on the Friday and Saturday mornings. One of the mornings I asked him again how the affair appered; he said, There were two men that went about grinding scissars and razors, or things of that kind, which he saw using a countryman ill, and he said, How can you, or are you not ashamed to use the countryman so ill? You ought to be licked, and if I had you here, or had hold of you, I would knock your heads together. I asked him what ensued upon that, and he said the man with one eye gave him a blow on his side with a knife or instrument. I cannot be certain which day it was that he mentioned this. I visited him again on the Saturday night; he was then very sensible and very chearful, and said he was very contented to die, which would not be long before he did. I was with him till his decease. I was not with him when he received the sacrament. He said more than once that he forgave the poor man; adding, God forgive him, for I forgive him. When the surgeon and apothecary came in, there was a whispering that he said, I do not want to be slattered; I know I shall not be long here; I want to go to Jesus Christ. I believe he was fully in his right mind, as any gentleman here, both then, and at the time he charged the prisoner. I am quite clear in it.</p>

            . I live and keep a public house in Oxford-Road, at the corner of Duke-Street. About seven o'clock that evening, the prisoner and his brother came into my house. There was a great mob at the door. As I went to shut the door, one of his brothers threw something out of his hand into the street.

            . Palmer said, Let me in; you know me. The mob cried, There are two men in your house that have stabbed a man. The prisoner and his brother were sat down in a box, and I desired them to walk out peaceably; which they refused. The people at the door said they had stabbed Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176904050035"/> Curtis. Then I opened the door, when three or four of them came in, and took them away. I went afterwards to Mr. Curtis's, and heard him say, That is the man, who has but one eye, that gave me the wound. I believe I have seen the prisoner four times before; his brother I never saw, to my knowledge. They had been both at my house that day, in the afternoon, about five o'clock, and had two pots of beer, and a quartern of rasberry brandy. There was a countryman with a wallet with them.</p>

               <p>Jones. It was strongly reported that they were about trepanning the countryman to enlist into the East-India service, which occasioned the uproar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curtis. I am father to the deceased. As long as he was in his senses, he said it was the prisoner that gave him the stab; and he was as sensible, I believe, as any gentleman here, as long as he could speak, which I believe might be within an hour of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Thompson, the surgeon, gave his evidence follow, it was impossible for the short-hand writer to hear so as to gave it to the public in his own words: but this in general can be ascertained, That he found a very dangerous wound on the deceased's left breast, between the second and third rib, which received the whole length of his probe, and that when he opened the body afterwards, he found there was a wound above two inches deep in the lungs; which wound, he made no doubt of, was the occasion of his death; and that from the first of he his attending him, to the last, he was very sensible.</p>

            . I am hammer-man to a blacksmith, and work in Little George-Street, Grosvenor Square. When we went into the alehouse to take the two brothers, one of them said, Don't lay hold of me, it was not me: if it was one of us, it was my brother. When I first saw them, the boys were hooting them down Great George-Street, saying, They had used a countryman ill.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As my brother and I were going to put my barrow up, a person brought me out a razor to grind; I ground it, and carried it in; they then gave me another and a long clasp knife to grind. When I had begun upon the razor, who should come but a countryman with some corks; he and I were brought up in the same place in the country. He said, I have not seen you a good while, if you will go back to the Quebeck, I will give you part of a pot of beer. I set my barrow up against the wall, took the razor and knife in my hand, and went with him. He called for a pot of two-penny, which we drank: I then called for another pot of beer, and two penyworth of bread and cheese; saying, As you have been so good as to give me part of two pots of beer, if you will go back with me (I had then not a farthing) till I take my money for these things, I will give you part of a quart. We went back, when I had ground the razor and knife, and took 5 d. for them. I went a little farther, when a tripeman called me, and gave me two knives to grind. As I was doing them, the young countryman and my brother came to Mr. Wyld's, where they had a quartern of rasberry brandy. I took my barrow through Mr. Wild's house, and put it up. After it was in the yard a man brought me a small pair of scissars to grind; I ground them, for which he gave me twopence After that the countryman and my brother broke the crank of my barrow. I having but eightpence in the world, I said, I hope you would pay for the mending it; they said they would. I carried it to a smith, he mended it, and charged a shilling. Then the countryman said he would not pay a farthing, and began mobbing the smith, saying, He could have had it done for twopence or threepence in the country. I told him, If he would pay sixpence, I would pay the rest; but he would not pay a farthing. I could not help crying, having nothing to get my bread with. I hit him a blow, upon which he hallooed out murder. There were a great company came about us. He told them, I was putting upon him; the mob sell upon me directly, in throwing of stones and brickbats, and some hit me with their fists before I could make my escape into the house. They threw great bricks after me into the house. My brother took up one, and threw it out at the mob again. While I was there, they said there was a man stabbed. They came and took hold of my brother and me. I knew no more, when they came to take me, what it was for, than the child that never saw a man in it's life. They took me to Mr. Spinnage's, where I was searched, and this eightpence found upon me, and an old pair of rusty scissars. I knowing nothing of the stabbing the man.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live two doors from Great Duke-street in the road. About seven o'clock that evening, as I was standing at my door, I heard a great noise in Great Duke-street. I came to the corner, and stood by the White Hart sign post. Just as the people past me, I saw the deceased strike a man two blows on the head with his hand; there were some words passed at the time. As soon as Mr. Curtis had struck, they moved forward, and as they moved, Mr. Curtis followed them, to go across the road, and about the middle of the road, as near as I can guess, the prisoner turned again upon Mr. Curtis. (This was after they might have been got ten yards.) I thought they had been going to fight. I could not conceive what was done, because people were round them. I turned and went in at the door directly; soon after I heard Mr. Curtis was stabbed. I did not see one person else use their hands.

               <p>I deal in cyder; I sold a cask of cyder in London, two years ago this spring; it was to be shipped off for France directly. The man gave mean order to go to Westminster bridge to receive an order for the money. I could not get my money of him. I never saw him after till last February. As I was coming down Oxford road, I met a man, whom I thought was him; I turned round, and asked him for my money for the cyder, and was very urgent for it. I took him to the Buffalo's head; and he there gave me the banker's note. I looked and saw the indorsement on it, and I gave him the remainder of the money. I then came down to the linen-draper's, bought a piece of cloth, and he gave me the overplus of the money. As to the other paper that I carried to Mr. Fretwell, that I took at the White-horse, Piccadilly, of a man that came from Bristol. I met him, and he asked me if I had sold my hops that I had at Bristol; adding, that he should go out of town in a litle time, and if I would meet him at the White-horse, Piccadilly, perhaps we might agree for them. I met him there, when he showed me the paper, and said it was a good note; and that his name was

I bought of him every week since they were published there. I bought this there (holding one in his hand) the 21st of January, 1769. It is The Extraordinary North Briton, the date of it is January 21. I never bought any but of him. I have seen a person with him at the first beginning, he was called More. (The paper delivered in.) This is my hand-writing, being the time I bought it. The prisoner lived about two doors lower than Hatton Garden. (Part of it read in court.)</p>

               <p>William Bibins. I bought an Extraordinary North Briton of the prisoner at No. 55. in Holborn. There was no person in the shop besides him when I bought it. It was the day it was published, the 21st of Jan. last. (Produced in court.) It was No. 37. &amp;c. (Read in court, the same as the former.)</p>

            . I let part of a shop in Holborn to Mr. More.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt in your mind that Mr. More was not free of the city?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I once asked Mr. Brayne if he thought Mr. More was free. He said he believed not, but he said, he himself was free, and as a servant he could sell. When Mr. More took the shop of me, he told me he should put in this person as a servant: he did it. I believe he ignorantly sold them all along. Mr. More is not a man of good character, he used to come sometimes in the evening. I believe he will never come any more.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Do you know the reason of Mr. More's keeping out of the way?</p>
               <p>Sharp. He was fearful of being arrested by Mr. Curtis. As for the prisoner, I think he knew nothing of the matter, he was hired by Mr. More at 14 s. a week. I do not think he was any ways concerned.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you yourself have not heard him speak of this particular North Briton?</p>
               <p>Sharp. Yes, I believe I have. He said, I believe the day of publication of it, he did not see that it was a dangerous one; he hoped there was no danger in doing it. He did it ignorantly, I am very sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Can he write or read?</p>
               <p>Sharp. I believe he can.</p>

            . I am a mercer in New Bond-street; I have known the prisoner near twenty years; he is a very harmless quiet man. I do not think he would be guilty of publishing a libel against Lord Mansfield, if he knew it. When he engaged himself to Mr. More, he was in great distress; he must have starved, if I and a relation had not relieved him. He has been guilty of some little indiscretions in relation to women, and his friends have turned their backs upon him. He engaged in this to keep himself from starving.</p>

Mr. More told me the prisoner's wages were 14 s a week. Mr. More came to me and asked me if I was free of the city. I said I was not. He said he wished I was, for his man (that was the prisoner) and he had quarrelled. The North Briton is published still very constantly. I have seen Mr. More write them. I have fetched them from the press for him, and have fetched paper for the printing them from the stationers.</p>
