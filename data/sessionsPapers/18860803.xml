I am Usher at Wandsworth Police-court—on June 18th Gregory and another man were brought up there before Mr. Paget, for uttering a bad half-crown which Sexton handed to me and I handed it to the Magistrate, who told me to put it in the fire, I did so and it melted very quickly indeed; Mr. Barnard, of the Treasury, afterwards asked for it back—I did not recognise Gregory as the man who had been there on May 21st—it is usual to remand prisoners, but in this case, as the evidence was doubtful, it was not done.</p>

               <p>Street, Clerkenwell—on 28th June, about 11.30 p.m., Hartley and Neill came in—Hartley called for half-a-pint of ale and two of port wine, which came to 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and handed me a bad shilling—I bent it with my teeth and told him it was bad and I could not take it—he asked me to give it back to him and he would give me a good one, and said he got it at the Bell—I gave it back to him and he paid me with a good florin—Neal went out at the door twice, and while he was away I asked Hartley why he gave me the bad shilling—he said that the other young man Neill had given it to him—after Neill came back the second time, and while they were being searched, Gregory came into the opposite compartment and then into the one next to them, and put his hand up and made signs to Neill, and I heard Neill ask Gregory to bring him some breakfast in the morning—the police took Hartley and Neill—Gregory went out, but the police brought him back and I recognized him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the shilling, I know it by the way I bent it and by my teeth marks.</p>

I waited months, and then I gave up with the intention of committing suicide, and I procured a razor and a bottle of spirits of salts. On going to Mrs. J. Tonge's on Monday evening, July 4th, to get some money promised, I saw Mrs. J. J. Tonge there, and she began to bully me, which never did me any good, and being at that time homeless, penniless, half starved, and half mad, I rushed at her, at which he screamed, but I remember no more until I found myself at the bottom of the stairs with my knee covered with blood, and my hat on the stairs. I then went up to the door and saw the constable, and was given in charge."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Good heart and Metcalfe, of Great George Street, Westminster, solicitors to the prosecution—we have acted for Mr. Sell—these dishonoured bills were put into my hands in December, and on 15th December I went to Bir<lb/>migham and saw the prisoner—I produced the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, and told him I had heard rumours of its being a forgery—he asked who had informed me of that fact—I said Messrs. Lake and Co."—he said, "You have not seen Lord Devon about it"—I said "No"—he said, I think it is only fair to me before you accuse me or suggest such a charge, to see Lord Devon himself," and he emphatically protested that it was Lord Devon's signature, and added that his personal relations with Lord Devon were such as justified his asking his Lordship to lend him money, and that he had assisted him by giving him these acceptances—he satisfied me with his explanation, and told me of the new arrangement come to with Mr. Birch, of the Odontobat Company, and his relations with him and with Lord Devon were such as justified me in accepting his statement—I proposed that the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which were due should be paid, and he asserted again that there was no difficulty in paying it; he was to see Mr. Birch, the owner of the business, and get him with himself to write to Mr. Sell a letter proposing at what date the 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be repaid, and a written arrangement was entered into—I have not got the document with me, but it was agreed to pay 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on January 1st, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on February 1st, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on March 1st—the 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid within a day or two of the time named, but no other installment was paid—several letters passed between me and Mr. Lehfeldt in reference to this arrangement.</p>

I am a confectioner of 40, Westow Hill, Norwood—on 17th May I sent my niece, Maria Strange, to the Norwood post-office for a postal order for 10".—she brought me the order, I took down the particulars of it, L.8. 143,104—she wrote a letter by my direc<lb/>tion; I enclosed the order in it and addressed it to Mrs. Fricker, 9E, Peabody Buildings, Orchard Street, Westminster—I sent her to the post with the letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am the only person employed at the office—my time is very much taken up, but it is not a particularly busy office—this order was issued three days before; we do not pay much attention to that so long as it is not more than three months old—a communication was made to me to know to whom I paid this order; I could not remember at first, but I afterwards remembered that it was a postman, and that I should know him if I saw him—that was a fortnight or three weeks after cashing the first order—it was just after 9 o'clock when he came in with the other order, and I recognised him at once—I did not think it worth while to ask him if he had been there a month before—he was dressed in his uniform the same as now, with his number on one side of his collar—he was not there more than three minutes—I am sure he wrote the signature there—Mr. Blentish came and made inquires about 3 or 4 o'clock, and I showed him the second order—I had not been told to keep a look out, but when the second order was presented by the same person, and signed at the same time, I took notice, and if Mr. Blentish had not come down I should probably have communicated with him—I allowed six hours to elapse; I had no instructions, and did not consider it my duty—if he had not come I might have communicated with some one else—I believe Mr. Blentish comes from the Private Inquiry Office—he took me to the walk to see if I could identify the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Confiden<lb/>tial Inquiry Branch of the Post-office—it is part of my duty to investi<lb/>gate cases in which orders have been lost or stolen—I was instructed to investigate the complaint about this order of May 17th—on 21st June I went to Roehampton Street Post-office, where Miss Everett made a com<lb/>munication to me, and I made arrangements for her to see the prisoner next day—I was not present when she identified him, but I afterwards had him brought to the South-Western office; he was in uniform, with the number 70 S.W.—I said "I belong to the Post-office; your name is Arthur Edward Fribbins, I believe, and you are a first-class postman in the South-Western District office?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You have been identified by the receiver at Roehampton Street Post-office as having cashed two postal orders for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one on 20th May and one on 21st June. The first order was issued at Westow Street, and on 17th May was enclosed in a letter addressed to Miss Fricker, 9e, Peabody Buildings, Orchard Street, Westminster; that letter has not been delivered, and you should have delivered it on the afternoon of May 7th; the second order was issued at Ludgate Circus on June 12th," and I showed him the two orders and said" How do you account for your possession of them?"—he said "I know nothing about them"—I gave him in custody—when he got to the General Post-office a little later on I asked him to write some signatures, and he wrote this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my presence; he first wrote the small "a" and then he was asked to write a capital letter—the greater portion of my official time is spent in looking at writing, and I have no difficulty in saying that the person, who wrote the receipts to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030033"/>
               <p>these two orders, also wrote this—I do not see how any one can fail to see it—a cigar case, several keys, a silk handkerchief, 117 stamps, and a meerschaum pipe were brought to me—I showed them to the prisoner, and asked him if he had any explanation to give of them—he said that they were given to him by his brothers or sisters, and that he had bought the stamps—some of them have been torn off letters.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I live at 70, Sherridan Street, Commercial Road, East, and am warehouse-porter to Megeson and Co., wholesale druggists of 14, Mill Lane, City—John Hugil is a partner—I have been there just on six years—it was part of my duty to go the Steam Packet public-house, Lower Thames Street, to obtain food for the other men—I went there as usual on Wednesday, 14th July, and saw the prisoner there; I had seen him three times before; he started talking something about horse-racing, and then came to my side and smelt me and said "Have you anything on you?"—I said "No, I don't know what you mean"—he said "Where are you working?"—I said "Megeson and Co., Mill Lane, Thames Street"—he said "Could you get me anything?. If you can I will make it worth your while, it doesn't matter what it is; can you get me any quinine, I think that is more expensive?"—I said "I don't know"—I arranged to see him another time—on the following Saturday I had a conversation with a man named Harvey, who is in my master's employ, and in consequence of that I made a communication to Mr. Hugil—I received certain directions from him and met the prisoner again at the Steam Packet on Monday at dinner-time—he said" Have you got anything with you?"—I said "No, I will see you another time "—he said "Try and bring something out with you if you can"—I said "I don't know whether 1 can or not"—I had seen Oldhampstead before that—the prisoner fixed Tuesday, the next day, for me to see him, and I went to the Steam Packet and saw him—he said "Have you got anything? "—I said "No"—he said "Can you bring anything?"—I said "No"—he said "Can't you bring me anything in here at five o'clock? I am known in here:" this was in front of the bar: "It is all right, people mind their busi<lb/>ness here"—I objected going to the Steam Packet—at five o'clock that day Mr. Hugil gave me three bottles of citrate of quiuine and one of chloral to take to the Boar's Head in Cannon Street, where he had promised to meet me—Oldhampstead followed me a little in the background—the prisoner did not come and I was going back and met him—we returned to the Boar's Head, and when we got inside he said "What are you going to have?" and called for two half pints of ale—he then said "Give us what you have got"—I gave him this big bottle—he said "Well, I have not got much money, but here is sixpence"—I then gave him these three bottles and he wanted to give me the other sixpence he had got, but I did not take it—I said I did not want to take the last sixpence from him—he said "That is the style, get me what you can, it is worth your while, it doesn't matter what it is"—he said he would meet me next day at the Steam Packet and see how I got on—I said "All right," and went back to work and told my master about the interview—I believe Old-hampstead was in the public-house listening, when I gave him the bottles—on Wednesday, at three o'clock, I met the prisoner at the Steam Packet public-house—he said "It is right oil"—I said "What do you mean?"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030037"/>
               <p>he said "I never sold them, I took them but I could not get the price I wanted for them," and said he had left them at a public house in Mile End Road—on Wednesday, a week afterwards, he said "If you see any<lb/>thing on the counter and no one is there, <hi rend="italic">whip</hi> it up and bring it round to me, I am always there"—I said "I will see what I can do—I went back and told my master—next day I <hi rend="italic">whipped</hi> up these two bottles of sulphate of quinine and took them to the Boar's Head—he was not there, and I was coming back and met him at the statue in Cannon Street—we returned to the Boar's Head and he gave me a glass, and then he said "Come on, give us what you have got, have you got quinine?"—I said "I think it is"—he said "The others are all right, I left them down the Mile End Road, what time do you knock off work? I have got to go down there and I will meet you and take you down there"—he was then arrested, with the two bottles in his possession.</p>

Megeson and Co., wholesale druggists; what have you about you"—he said "I have nothing"—I said "Where are those bottles this lad gave you?"—he said "I have no bottles"—I felt his pocket and from the outside I felt them—I said "Who is that lad that left you?"—he said "I shall answer no questions" or "I shall give you no ex<lb/>planation "—at that time he had a pine apple—I took him to the station and saw these two bottles taken from his coat pocket—I had information through Wallis that the other bottles could be found at a tavern in the Mile End Road and I went and fetched them—the barmaid is not here—the prisoner gave his address in Brick Lane, I inquired and found he was not known there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant in the office of the Receiver of the Metropolitan Police—from March, 1882, down to June, 1886, the prisoner was chief clerk at the Hammersmith and Wandsworth Police Courts—it was his duty in that capacity to receive the fines that were imposed at those courts—the dealing with those fines was governed by some regulations by the Home Office and I have here a copy—the pri<lb/>soner would pay in a banking account the moneys he had received in the course of each month—for the Wandsworth police-court a banking account had been opened at the London and South Western Bank; that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030039"/>
               <p>would be kept in the name of the chief clerk for the time being, in accordance with the provisions of 29 and 30 Vic. c. 39, sec. 18—for the Hammersmith police-court an account was opened at the London and County Banking Company, in the same way and under the name restric<lb/>tions—according to Rule 7 of the regulations it was the prisoner's duty in the first seven days of each month to make up his account and draw a cheque in favour of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, and pay it in to the account of the Receiver of the Metropolitan Police at the Bank of England—he would also make out a return showing the amount he had received and paid at the end of each month—that would be made up in the first week of each month, and would have reference to the month immediately preceding—in the return of the Wands worth police-court for April I find the net receipts as carried out in the prisoner's handwriting and signed by him amount to 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 7th May I find this cheque for 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. drawn by the prisoner in favour of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England—that was returned marked, "N. S." in the first instance; in consequence of that the prisoner was communicated with by the officials, requesting an explanation, and on 15th May he replied stating that the letter should receive his imme<lb/>diate attention—on 20th May he was written to again requesting that the fines be paid without further delay, in answer to which he wrote on 22nd May stating that he was devoting a large amount of time to the matter, and would use every effort not to defer it—on 26th May there is a memorandum showing that the cheque was presented a second time——on 27th the prisoner wrote that if the cheque was presented next week he was in hopes it would be met—on 4th June I went to Wands worth, having received instructions to do so, in the meantime the cheque not having been met—I saw the prisoner and said I was desired by the Receiver of Police to see him with reference to this cheque which had not been met, and to ask him whether he could explain it—he said that he had been trying to discover how it was, and he showed mo a mass of figures that he had been going into, extracted from the books, and he could not understand it—I asked him to show me the books; he did so, and I then tested them as far as I was able—this is the cash book that he showed me; I examined it, both for April and May—the deficiency for April was 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for May the net receipts was 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making a total of 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went on to examine what amounts he had received in June down to between the 1st and 4th—I found he had received about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first four days of June—I asked to see the pass book; he showed it me, I examined it—he said he had about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his safe, I suggested that he had better pay that into the bank and then have the pass book made up—he did that, it was sent by a messenger, made up and brought to me, and I examined it—the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. appeared to have been in hand, or something equivalent to it—it was only a preliminary exami<lb/>nation on 4th June—on 7th June I had the pass book and all the books sent to me, and it was then that I ascertained what the actual deficiency was, but on 4th June I roughly ascertained it to be about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said to the prisoner that there appeared to be a deficiency of about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he believed it was about that; that he could not understand quite how it was, he was investigating it—I then suggested whether it would be better to pay the amount in to his account, and if on investigation it was found to be an error in the books it might be repaid to him—he said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030040"/>
               <p>he thought it had better be ascertained first—that was substantially all the conversation on 4th June—on the 7th I made an investigation into the books, and then discovered that the exact deficiency was 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the difference between the amount shown in the cash book and pass book was paid in to the bank—on 7th June I went to Hammersmith and saw the prisoner with reference to the fines account there—I told him I had come to examine into the Hammersmith account—he produced the books and gave me every assistance he could—the result of my examina<lb/>tion was that he was deficient 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had made returns for April and May; the fines for April had been already paid by that time—the May account shows the net receipts to have been 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which tallied with the cash book, but on audit subsequently he had paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. too much—only 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid over to the receiver—the deficiency between those two items was 44<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he had some small amounts in hand amounting to about 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he paid into the bank; that was between the 1st and 7th June—after paying that amount into the bank there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. standing there to his credit—14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was what he had to account for, the deficiency was 57<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I mentioned to the prisoner the amount of the deficiency; he said he thought it was about that, but he was still pursuing his investigation, that he had been very much pressed with work and had not been able to discover how it had arisen—with reference to the stamps account I think he was supplied with 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stamps for both Courts, not in money—as he used those stamps for the purposes of the Courts it was his duty from time to time to replace them by others, or to have money in hand for that amount; I think that was his duty—the prisoner succeeded Mr. Leigh, who was chief clerk up to 1882—there was an interregnum in which Mr. Newton acted as chief clerk; the prisoner succeeded Mr. Newton—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a book supplied for the public service; it is marked "Stamps" outside, and on the first page are the words, "Stamps account, amount allowed for working the two Courts 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and imme<lb/>diately under that are initials which I believe to be the prisoner's—under the date of March, 1882, I find worked out in detail how the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stamps came into his possession—on the next page I find in the pri<lb/>soner's handwriting a grand total of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand on 2nd March—this book was produced to me in the course of the investigation on 7th June—here is an entry in it of 1st February of money and stamps to the value of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. given out to the officials of the Court, for which they would be responsible to the prisoner, leaving a balance in the hands of the chief clerk of 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 7th June I asked the prisoner to produce to me such stamps as he had in hand, and he produced 90 of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each and eight half-crown stamps—I made the deficiency 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said to the prisoner, "It appears to me you are short in your stamps 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said he believed it was so, he could not account for it, and he also said he was investigating the matter—that was substantially all he said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I may have seen the prisoner before the 4th of June, but I should not have recognised him—I had no communication with him till I went on 4th June—police court accounts are examined under my direction, I have a supervising knowledge of them—there was a Treasury letter of June 6, 1882, at the police-court authorising something that had been approved of by Mr. Lushington in the Secretary of State's office. (<hi rend="italic">This related to the chief clerk paying money into a banking account</hi>)—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030041"/>
               <p>these books are authorised to be kept under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879—there are several books to be kept in accordance with the minutes—since the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, there is considerably more work to be done in the way of bookkeeping than before—I know by the forms that different claims arise in respect of the fines or costs—I cannot answer about details, they are gone into by other members of my department—to my knowledge there is no cheque drawn on the banking account for any private purpose—I was not directed to audit the official account—I have a general audit, but I examined the pass book in this case, and I may say generally I should think there was no such cheque drawn—the salaries are paid by our department, and I know by his came that the prisoner has been more than twenty years in the public service—I found the cash account was correctly entered, the prisoner was most correct—within seven days after the termination of each month the chief clerk should submit to the receiver on this form C a return of all fines received, and all persons committed to prison—this is a return showing the fines sent to the receiver, and shows that he received during the month 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and had to make payments in respect of it of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and so he deducted 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the bottom of the account, and that deficit, 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., means the difference due to him—the receiver can audit from C by looking at it and comparing it with the magistrate's notes of his decisions with the fines imposed and the costs—fines paid after persons have gone to prison are received by the governor of the prison, and are paid only by him to the receiver—the Metropolitan Board shares can be paid out of current fines—some of them are claimable from the chief clerk, they are not often large sums, sometimes 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the chief clerk's account is always a running one, at the end of every month he has to pay over—the minute that bankers may pay over without a cheque at the end of every month has never been acted on, it is never done in that way—the prisoner's banking account since his suspension has been continued as the account of the police-court, the acting chief clerk operates on it—no new account has been opened since his suspension—I think the Hammersmith account was opened in December, 1882, when the prisoner was chief clerk; there was no official banking account prior to that, and the same with regard to the Wands worth account—I should think all moneys were left in possession of the clerk who drew on the account for stamp money, there would be nothing irregular in that—the money went into the bank<lb/>ing accounts—the credit for stamps is limited to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if the stamps were burnt, lost, or misused, the chief clerk would have to make them good—in this case every shilling of the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency has been paid into the Receiver's account and made good—the Receiver his nothing to do with, the audit of the stamps; I was sent down by direction of the Home Office to inquire into it, and I asked the prisoner whether he would show them to me, and he did so at once—they would be under the chief clerk of accounts in the Inland Revenue department, Somerset House—it does not fall within our duty—if the chief clerk resigned he would have to account to his successor, who would not take the burden of the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. debt unless he had the value—the mixture of money of the stamp account has been going on since 1872, as far as the bank is concerned—the stamps vary in amount from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upwards—one of these books refers to the Hammersmith account, and the other to the Wandsworth account—the books were in this condition when given to me, they contain vouchers of the persons who</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030042"/>
               <p>have received the stamps—he told me that he had been unable to discover that any deficiency had arisen—he gave me every facility in examining any books and papers and answered any questions I put to him—I noticed some corrections had been made in the pass-books—I noticed to some extent the amount of returns of the fines and receipts of every month, comparing it with the balance at the bankers at the end of every month, without taking into account the feeding of the account with moneys paid in in the first seven days, but it is not altogether a fair test—I believe if I struck the balance at the banker's at the end of each month the deficiency would be sometimes more and sometimes less, because he might in the last day or days have heavy fines imposed which he might not have time to pay in, or the cheques might not be cleared by the end of the month, and therefore it would not be a fair test—the prisoner would not pay the working expenses of the Court, he would pay costs of complainants and so forth—he was allowed 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to cover the whole of his travelling and other expenses, and that was paid once a month to him by the Receiver of police, and he would not have to pay anything for that himself—I know the business at the Courts has increased very much, from the trouble it has given our auditors—under date of December 12th, 1883, it was discovered that another person's cheque had been charged against the prisoner and his balance diminished by an error of the bankers—I did not investigate all those entries—he showed me pages and pages of figures which he had prepared for the purpose of trying to discover the cause of the deficiency—I don't know that he said he had been working at it for months—he said he had been taking books home, and that he was very much pressed owing to the absence of the second clerk, who was away—I believe the second clerk had gone there recently—undoubtedly there was very great pressure on the prisoner, and there would be immense pressure on the prisoner if a new hand not acquainted with the machinery of account keeping, was put in as his assistant—on 4th June I knew the deficiency was about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with regard to one Court—I went into it independently of him, he admitted it was about that he was investigating the matter—the police-court proceedings commenced on 20th July—I did not give him any figures of what ought, to have been paid to the Receiver till I went to the Court and stated them on oa'h, and he did not know then to a penny what it was—by rule 19 as to fees if a person takes out a summons for assault and the man is fined 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and pays it, he would have a right to take 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the chief clerk without anything going into the banking account—I made no inquiry as to whether the prisoner had been living extravagantly, I was only requested to investigate the accounts—I believe he had a family of children ill with scarlet lever, and was not allowed to come into a public office for some time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> For all moneys received for fines he would enter in the cash-book of the Court the name and amount of the fine—the payments he makes are connected with the legal business, not expenses of the office—at the end of the month he always makes the summary in red ink; thus in April there are the receipts in different columns, and then the gross receipts, and then the payments—77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is the net receipts, and he would draw a cheque for that and report it—seven days are allowed so that the money up to the end of the month shall be paid into the bank before he makes up his account, and to give him true to make it up—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030043"/>
               <p>a receivable order has to accompany the cheque, it is an explanation of it—the cash and pass book are counterfoil books—they are under the chief clerk, and he can manage it his own way—all we look at at the end of the month is to see that correct amounts have been entered—I think his salary was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 410<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the time of his suspension.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">H. P. NEWTON</hi>. I am now chief clerk at the Greenwich and Woolwich Police-courts—both courts are taken on the same day—formerly I was second clerk at the Hammersmith and Wandsworth Police-courts, and during the illness of the late chief clerk, Mr. Leigh, I did the duty of chief clerk—he died on 10th February, 1882—the prisoner was appointed on 8th February, 1882, and entered on his duties on 1st March, and it then became my duty to account to him for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the imprest—this book in the prisoner's writing shows the mode in which I accounted to him for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is "Hammersmith, handed me by Mr. Newton," and then so many stamps and cash, and then "Wandsworth, handed me by Mr. Newton," and stamps and cash, the two together making 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—at that time some of the stamps were in the hands of some of the officers of the Court, and are all accounted for—for two or three months in the autumn of 1882 the prisoner was away, in consequence of the illness of his family—I then took over the duties of chief clerk—he accounted to me for the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when he returned to his duties I passed over the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he started with that sum again—those entries are in the prisoner's writing, "Total imprest, 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; in hands of three officers, 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; balance in hands of chief clerk, 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—it would be in the discretion of the chief clerk to keep money and stamps in the safe or to pay it into the banking account as he thought most convenient—the practice is as stamps are sold to the public and money comes in, he buys more stamps when he wants them with that money, and so keeps up the working of the two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is always a debt of 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Receiver for stamps—there is no time for demanding back the payment of that 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. until his death or removal—I have had 15 years' experience of police-courts—I was 11 years at Hammersmith as second clerk before Mr. Leigh was ill—the business there was always heavy—when Wandsworth was taken, in the morning the business was so pressing that they seldom got their summonses reached—it is three miles and three-quarters from Hammersmith to Wandsworth, and the prisoner would have to walk to Addison Road, then go to Clapham Junction, and change there for Wandsworth—since Hammersmith was made the morning court I have not got away from there till 5 o'clock on some days, and the Magistrate is sometimes kept at Wandsworth till 7 o'clock at night, and it was not unusual to be there till 6 o'clock—I consider there is immense pressure on the clerk to work the two Courts—I suggested it would be well if the junior were to go to Wandsworth and the chief clerk limited himself to Hammersmith—the young gentleman who came as second clerk had no experience of police-courts—the prisoner told me he would have no leisure if he did not take depositions—it takes a trained man to take depositions to enable the Magistrate to get rid of the business—making up the returns and the books would take about half an hour a day at each Court—the clerk would do those for each day on the following day—we have frequently had 46 charges and remands at Hammersmith and about half that number at Wandsworth I should think—summonses run</p>

                  </hi>. I have been assistant clerk at Hammersmith Police-court since March, 1882—these initials "J. J. G." to the stamp account are the prisoner's—he used at times to leave stamps in my hands to sell if he were absent—in February this year I had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of stamps—they were renewed from time to time—as I received money I handed it to the prisoner for fresh stamps, and so I kept account with him—requisitions were used to get stamps from Somerset House—there are two such requisitions signed by the prisoner, dated 31st May and 4th June—the 31st May is for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that for 4th June is 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., making 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. together—these two cheques in the prisoner's writing correspond with those two sums mentioned in the requisition, and are made payable to the Receiver-General, Somerset House Stamp Office—that amount of stamps would probably be bought, because that would be the amount of money forthcoming at the time—in April, I think it was, the prisoner said to me that he had lost some stamps to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he must have done so bringing them from Hammersmith to Wandsworth—he never referred to it afterwards that I am aware of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The requisition is in the prisoner's writing—previous to 1st February I only had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps, and after that date the prisoner increased it to 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because the chief usher up to that time had had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had then handed it back to the prisoner—from that time I would have more money and less stamps, or less stamps and more money—they were used every day in large numbers—I go to both courts as a rule, and the prisoner did so too, as a rule, I think.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was to the effect that Charles Cullen, as owner of the docks, entered into an arrangement that in consideration of the witness Thomas Paulin promoting a Company for carrying out the work and procuring money he agreed to pay him a commission of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per cent, on all capital raised in addition to professional charges. It was unsigned.</hi>) I did not draw that and am not responsible for it; it was not directed to me, that is a mis<lb/>take in that copy—I did not put it in at the police-court—it was to be directed to some one else—Mr. Powell, who appeared for the prisoner, put it in—I repudiate it—it was not drawn up by my sanction—I saw it afterwards, and that is all I can say about it—the prisoner said "Let me take it away and have a look over it; I don't like to sign anything in a hurry"—I was not given in April the order of the Chancery Division ejecting the defendant from the premises in June, 1885—one of my witnesses produced this document at the police-court—I first heard of the ejectment at the end of May or the first week in June—I went to the Queen's Bench to see if the bills of sale had been paid off—I can't tell the date—I found one was paid off, and that satisfied me at the time—I do not know that the defendant insured his furniture which was burnt for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his own name—I don't know what name it was in—the policy was put in at the Mansion House by the Insurance Company's witness—I heard it stated at the police-court by the defendant's solicitor that an action was pending by him against the company for the recovery of the money—he said he expected the company would pay him the money at the first board meeting—that was the money on the policy on the furniture that was burnt—there was a communication with Mr. Russell of a deposit bank as to bills of sale on different property—that was before 28th April—Mr. Russell was going to lend money on the machinery to the prisoner—I went to see him, but he would not see me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I never lend money—the prisoner came to me with a story about the fire, and asked for a 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week or so—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid him, and the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was travelling costs and expenses—he had agreed to that—I never intended to charge him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never intended to claim both sums, and I emphasised my intention by putting 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in pencil over the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when I gave him the commission note he said "All right, I will sign it; let me take it away"—he took it away, and when he brought it back he said "I don't think this will suit"—he preferred a document in which the vendee was paying down 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Slessenger was the person whom originally he should pay this 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to—the second was intended in substitution for that—instead he bought this.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Messrs.

Rosher, dated 2nd June, 1885—I sent my officer to Rosherville with that writ to deliver possession to Kosher—this is a copy of the policy of the London, Liverpool, and Globe Insurance Company, insuring the furniture and effects of the prisoner for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a claim was made for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of the policy for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the name of the defendant—the fire was on 16th October, 1885, and the claim was made on 27th October—an action was brought on 27th February, 1886; we are defending that on behalf of the Company, the claim is still in abeyance till the action is completed—we have never agreed to pay him any money in respect of this claim.</p>

I am managing clerk to Mr. Tierney Clark Matthews, of 58, Lincoln's Inn Fields, solicitors to the Kosher family, the owners of the Rosherville Graving dock—there was a lease to the defendant of that property, he failed to pay his rent and an action was brought—this is the order in the action ejecting him, and this is the writ from the Sheriff directing possession to be delivered up to me; I went down and the Sheriff delivered possession to me, and I have held it ever since for the Rosher family, the freeholders—the prisoner has had no interest in it since then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We have not been in negotiation with Mr. Edwards with regard to the sale of it, he has been at the office; I do not think he has been there when I have not seen him—he only came once I believe, and then saw Mr. Mathews, my principal, in my presence—the owners since they have had possession have agreed to sell to Mr. Irwin, and they had done so when Edwards called—the prisoner was in possession for 10 years, from 1875 to 1885, before he was ejected—he owed 21/4 years' rent, I think the rent was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I don't think he paid all the rent except the 21/4 years' rent, we only sued him in respect of 2 1/2 years; I don't think he paid any, but it was paid—I never saw the prisoner after the ejectment—no contract was entered into with anybody besides Irwin, who had paid a deposit, and was holder of the contract—the prisoner had a certain time under the order of court in which to pay the rent and save the ejectment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engraver at 112, Fleet Street—I have known Myers 10 or 11 years; he was recommended to me by a friend as a dealer in pencils; I did not know Czarnichowski—in April Myers asked me if I could copy writing on wood—I said "Yes," and as he went out he said, "A sort of little cheque"—I said "Yes," and he left saying he would bring up a friend shortly that wanted it done—on 26th May, the Derby Day, Myers came again to my office, and said he had brought his friend, and suggested that we should be alone—my friend, Mr. Hampshire, and my apprentice were in the office at the time; I sent them out, and Myers went down and brought up Czarnichowski—Myers intro<lb/>duced him to me, I don't remember in what way; they spoke a good deal in a language which I did not understand—they sat down, and after some little time Czarnichowski produced a note similar to this, and asked me if I could make an exact copy of it—I looked at it carefully and said "Yes"—he asked me how much it would be—I said it would come to about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that it would necessitate three blocks, as there are three colours, blue, black and violet, and it would require a separate block for each colour—Czarnichowski looked about the office, and I showed him the process of engraving on wood—he said if I did it I was to keep it to myself and not let anybody know, and that I had better do it myself—he said could I find the paper and do the printing—I said that would do later on—I am not sure whether the note was left then with me or later—next day, Thursday, Myers came and brought another note, I believe of less value, but I don't know what it was; he simply handed it to me and said I was to have a careful look at it, and he went away—next day, Friday, Myers brought me a note similar to the one I first saw; he left that with me on the Friday, and told me to get on with it and his friend would come down next day and give me some money on account of the work—the other note which I thought of less value was taken away—on the Friday afternoon I went to Bride Street Police-station and saw Inspector Pitman; he referred me to the Old Jewry, where I saw another officer—on the 29th, Saturday, Myers came up to the office again and asked me to go down, and said his friend would wait round the corner for me—we went into Bride Street and there met Czarnichowski just outside a public-house, and he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—we then all three went to the Black Dog public-house; Czarnichowski told me to go on with the note and asked when I should have a portion of it ready to show him—I said in about two weeks time—he said, "You will see very little of me, I shall transact everything through Myers"—after that interview I got on with the blocks, these are the three I made (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on Friday, 11th June, I saw Myers and made an appointment for the fol<lb/>lowing Saturday, the 12th—previous to that Myers had asked me to give him a few shillings, which I did—the next appointment was for Tuesday the 15th, Bank-holiday—I had given Myers this proof of the figures and scroll part on the Saturday—on the 15th I met Myers at the Grapes public-house in Farringdon Street, and he made an arrangement for me to meet Czarnichowski next day, when he said, "I think my friend will have more money for you"—on Wednesday, the 16th, I met the two prisoners by arrangement at half past seven at the Black Dog in Bride Street; Czarnichowski said, "I have received the proof and am</p>

               <p>very pleased with it, I will forward you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. next day"—on Thursday, the 17th, I received this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note enclosed in a telegraph form, there was no writing with it—on Friday, the 18th, Myers came up and there was sm e talk about paying the whole of the money, he said he had made a mis<lb/>take about his friend coming to see me, but he would see me on the Saturday following at the Bodega on Ludgate Hill, and on Saturday, the 19th, I saw both the prisoners there; Czarnichowski then said, "Can you name a place where I can speak to you privately without being over-heard"—I said I would think it over and let him know—I promised to let him have a further proof on the following Monday morning if he met me in Farringdon Street—he didn't come, but Myers did at the Farringdon Street Station, and I then gave him a proof similar to this with the Russian arms on it—we then made an appointment at Carr's Restaurant in the Strand at 4 o'clock, I met both prisoners there—Czarnichowski objected to the place because it was not private enough, and I made an appointment for half-past 7 at my office—before leaving Carr's Czarnichowski gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at 7.30 I saw him alone at my office; I then showed him the three blocks—he said he was very pleased with them—he had said at Carr's there was something a little wrong with the cross at the top, but when he compared it in the evening with the original note he said it was cor<lb/>rect—he then said "You will have to do the printing; I will arrange for the purchase of a small machine, which can be obtained, and then broken up when it has been used"—he said "I have arranged for 50,000 pieces of paper, with the watermark complete"—he said "You know how to mix the inks; in purchasing the inks you can cut up the note into pieces, so as to get the ink one colour at a time, so that no one can tell what it is"—he said he would bring some other notes of varied colour, that I might see the tints of the ink better—he impressed secrecy upon me, and said "My life is in your hands, and yours in mine"—he promised mo 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me to finish the blocks by Tuesday, 29th June—he said it was as well not to let Myers know too much, as he was an old fool, and he wouldn't send Myers to the office too often, but tell him to stop away until the thing was finished; I was to keep the blocks locked up until the paper was ready—on the 28th Myers came and asked mo if the proofs were ready—I told him that the appointment was for the next day, at 7.30—I wrote a letter to Czarnichowski making the appointment—I asked Myers what name I should put on the letter—he said "Anything will do, put Mr. James"—on Tuesday, the 29th, at 1.30, Czarnichowski came; he said he had made a mistake with regard to the time, and he made an arrangement to send Myers next day at 2 o'clock for the finished proofs—he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and made an appointment for Moorgate Street on the 30th—on the 29th he showed me the letter I had sent him, with the name of Myers cut out of it—on Wednesday, the 30th, I met Myers at the Black Dog, and we walked round to the Viaduct, and on the steps there I gave him these three proofs, which I had ready—I then made an appointment for Farringdon Street Station next night, when I expected full payment for the work—on Thursday, 1st July, I met Czarnichowski at Farringdon Street Station—we went round to Hatton Garden and ho asked me to let him have a complete finished proof on Saturday night, and he wrote on this piece of paper this name and address, "B. Bruhn, 17, Bedford Square, Commercial</p>

I have been in business in Fleet Street about five years, not in a very large way—before Czarnichowski came to me I think I had read in the papers about the forgery of Russian notes; I am not certain about it, but I think I must have read it in the course of time—I understood when the prisoners came on the 26th that they requested me to forge Russian notes—I didn't express any abhor<lb/>rence of such a proposition; I said nothing, I remained silent—when I asked Czarnichowski to put a proof in his pocket I intended to beckon to the detectives if he had done so, in order that he might be taken with a proof on him—I don't know that the Russian Government give rewards; I have heard so since the arrest—I don't know a man named Landsberg, I don't think I ever heard the name—I saw him at the Mansion House giving evidence; that was the first time I saw him or heard of him—I have no recollection of the names of Blumerstock, Cornwasser, or Sastono<lb/>vitch.</p>

               <p>how much money I had—I said, "From 800 to 1,000 roubles, and if I required more money I could get it from home"—he said, "You cannot do any business here; if you buy false paper money you will become fortunate"—I said, "How do you sell it, by the weight or the measure?"—he said he sold it by per cent, not by weight—I said, "That is too large, have you not got three or four?"—he said, "That used to be long ago, now there is nothing but 25's"—he said, "Last year, during the holidays, a young man, Itsic, came to me from Moscow with a Christian Russian merchant; the Christian came with 10,000 roubles, and I would not take it, and I sent Itsic and the Russian merchant away, and at 4 o'clock I gave him, the Russian, false money and sent him away"—I made no reply to this, I only took note of what he said—he said he dressed himself and went with him to several drinking places, and drank beer and spirits—he begged of me to let him have my money, so that I should buy of him false 25-rouble notes—he said he was in great need of paper from the manufactory—he did not show me any of the false notes—he said, "In London I cannot give you any money," because they looked after him so much; he should have to go away from here to Rotterdam or Hamburg, and he would send it to me by post or bring it personally—I did not make any bargain with him on that occasion—he begged me to come back at 9 o'clock in the evening—I went at 9 o'clock; he dressed himself, and the talk was the same as before—on the Thursday he took me upstairs into a chamber, took out a small packet, and said, "In five months' time this packet will be ready"—he showed them to me, they were five goulden Austrian paper money, but he said the Russian notes must be made first—I went out with him into a large street, and ho took me through several stations underground—either that day or subsequently he asked me for money to pay for the Russian notes, that he was in great need of money to pay for the paper and to pay the workmen—I said, "I can't give you any money"—he said, "Lend me a few pounds"—I gave him a 5-rouble note of my own—he said he would return it to-morrow—he said, "Wait here at this public-house, I have need to go and see some one"—I saw him again on Friday morning at 11 o'clock—he did not show me any Russian note then—on Saturday, at 5 o'clock, ho showed me a 25-rouble note with green letters and "25" in black; it was like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but it had not this letter "H" on it—he said, "This is only a sample, but it will be made the same as in Petersburg"—he did not say where he got it from—his wife came upstairs, and I immediately went down with him and went into several drinking places, and I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in small money—I saw him no more after that—I did not know that he was getting Russian notes made at an office in Fleet Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, of 53, Moorgate Street, and am employed by Mr. Colls, a builder—on 21st July I was employed at 53, Moorgate Street, and when I left at 8.20 p.m. I went round and saw that all was fastened—there are two trap-doors, one in the roof and one in the ceiling—I left no one on the premises—I went again there next morning at 6.15, and found the door locked as I left it—I looked up the staircase and saw the prisoner Munroe looking over the handrail—I went up and found him and Cox—Cox was sitting on the gas-meter—I said "Halloa, what are you doing here?"—Munroe said "All right, Sir, we are doing no harm"—I locked the door, ran into the street, and called Detective White and another constable who were watching the premises outside—they came in and took the prisoners—after they were taken to the station, I went back and found that they had got in through a trap-door—both of the trap-doors were forced open—the one on the roof had two bolts, the bottom one had no bolts—on 30th July, about 10 days afterwards, I was at work there, and one of my <hi rend="italic">mates</hi> picked up this tool and a lamp after moving some timber.</p>

On 21st July I went with Bullivant and another officer to the roof of 55, Moorgate Street—he pointed out where Cox was seen, and I picked up this instrument there—it has been a screwdriver, but it is what they use for house-breaking—the trap-door was fast, but there were some footmarks on the lead—we did not find the prisoners—I was ordered to keep watch, and about 6.10 a.m. I received a communication, went to 53, Moorgate Street, and saw the two prisoners on the first floor—I said "Halloa, you are here, then?"—Munroe said</p>

I am a carpenter of 9, Grovedale Road, Upper Holloway—on 16th July about 3 o'clock I was in a public-house in Holloway Road, when Bennett came up and asked me to stand him a drink—I stood him a pot of six ale—I then left that public-house and went into another where Bennett, who had left me, came up again and took me by my arm—I said I did not wish to assist him in any other way; he wished for some more money (he asked me for money in the Birkbeck public-house) I stood him four pots of ale—I threw him away from me and went round to the back of the workhouse, and there the three prisoners and another man rushed on me—Digby took hold of my coat and Pickering struck at me and knocked me down, I did not know whether I was dead or alive, all three prisoners and another man did that, and Bennett put his hand in my coat pocket, where I had 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., not 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was in my waistcoat pocket and 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. here, and I changed a half-sovereign—I had spent 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in treating them, and had 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket when I came out—I had about 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when this attack was made on me—every halfpenny was taken, my coat was pulled off—each of the prisoners struck me; they ran away and left me lying on the ground—I saw Bennett on the Saturday afterwards and made a complaint to a policeman, who spoke to him and he said he had never seen me previously, and afterwards at the station he said "I only knew him that night and there are other three; he treated us to four pots of ale and then gave me sixpence to get another"—I had done so, I gave him the sixpence—I was hurt in my face and eye and was almost killed; I could not see for three days—I identified the other two in Holloway Road on Saturday and Pickering on Friday.</p>

If you have give me your name and address"—he said, "No, I am only acting a friend to you, I am trying to get you away"—Prince and Digby came up, and Lightfoot said he was one of his pals and struck him between the eyes and nose—Digby and Lightfoot had a stand up fight without their coats—Prince took off Lightfoot's coat and waistcoat—they fought for about ten minutes and then stopped, and Lightfoot said, "I will rip your—up," and Pickering and Digby walked away and left Prince with Lightfoot's coat and waistcoat—I heard nothing about any money being lost—Lightfoot had two black eyes; he was drunk.</p>

On 16th July I received information about the robbery at Mr. Clift's, and in consequence went to 66, High Street, a common lodging-house, where I found the prisoner—I told her she had left a portion of a chain at Mr. Warren's to be made up into a ring, which had been since identified as a portion of Mr. Clift's property, and I asked her how she accounted for possession of it—she said "I picked it up some months ago"—I told her she would have to come with me to the police-station—she put on her bonnet and shawl; she had a child in her arms—I locked the door and left a constable out<lb/>side—she said a woman had given them to her, and she mentioned the names of Johnson, Harvey, and Beaumont as the woman who had given the things to her on Sunday morning, and said she expected to have the brokers in, and told her she would be justified in spending any portion of the money she chose—in going to the station we passed through William Street, where she said she felt very faint and ill and begged to be allowed to sit down—I allowed her to do so on the doorstep of the Duke of Wellington—she sat there three or four minutes, and then I begged her to get up—I got her inside for a minute, and then got her to the police-station—subsequently Pritchard brought the articles to the station—afterwards I looked at the public-house—there is a hole, by the two steps leading up to the door, as big as three fingers, where two bolts go down, and there was just space for her to put these things through—that hole leads into the cellar—at the station I said to her "Have you any money about you?"—she handed me a purse contain<lb/>ing 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. saying that was all she had left—she gave me information implicating other persons, but she said that they were not the persons—I asked her at the station why she threw the jewellery down the hole—she said "Because I did not want the articles found on me"—I showed them to her.</p>

About 6 p.m. on 24th June Ranton was brought to Woolwich Police-station suffering from a wound on the left side of his head; he appeared stupid—I sent for Dr. Login, the divisional surgeon, who dressed his wounds—Ranton had several fits; it took several men to hold him—when his wounds were dressed he was allowed to go away with his friends—in consequence of a statement he made to me I was directed to make inquiries whether Southgate should be arrested or required to go to a Magistrate—I went to the coal wharf of Messrs. Winter and Rahtz in Woolwich; I did not find South-gate there—I returned to the station and met him outside—I said</p>

               <p>"Ranton has been to the police station and complained of your striking him on the head with a hammer"—he said "No, I did not do it, I have two witnesses here with me who know different"—I then accompanied Southgate to the lobby on the coal wharf—Southgate showed me the place where Ranton was standing inside the lobby—he said "Ranton was abusing me and I asked him to leave the lobby several times; he was very drunk and refused to go. I took hold of him, gave him a push, his feet caught in the loose chains which were lying on the floor, he fell backwards and his head came in contact with this lock which was hang<lb/>ing upon this doorpost (<hi rend="italic">Post and padlock produced</hi>)—I examined the lock and found spots of blood upon it—it was about 7 p.m.—about two feet six inches on the side of the lobby and near to the floor I found a great quantity of blood, and a pool of blood on the floor—it appeared as if his head had laid close to the boards—the lobby is about eight feet square, about ten feet high, and is used for tools—the door opens inwards and is fastened by the padlock—you can see the whole of the lobby when you have closed the door from inside—there is a little window looking towards a dead wall; some of the glass is broken—this spanner-hammer was not there; I borrowed it to show the Magistrate the kind of instrument spoken of—a great number of tools were there; there was a spanner with a long handle—Ranton said that was not the instrument used—Ranton was suffering from loss of blood and apparently half conscious—Southgate had a screw hammer in his hand like this; a spanner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Southgate came voluntarily to the police station—this is what he said: (<hi rend="italic">Reading from the depositions</hi>) "Ranton went on to the works, was drunk, asked for a job, was told there were full hands and used bad language. I went into the lobby and Ranton followed me. I then asked Ranton to leave; he refused. I pushed him, his feet caught in some chains, he fell and his head came in contact with a lock, by which he was injured." Ranton appeared as though he had been drinking—he was partially suffering from loss of blood—I did not smell his breath—some chains were lying on the floor—the pool of blood was as if his head had struck the doorpost and he had then rolled down—the blood was on the wall and on the floor—I have known Southgate about twelve months; he is in the service of Messrs. Winter and Co.—Mr. Rahtz, a member of the firm, is here to give him a character—the complainant is known in Woolwich.</p>

I am a medical practitioner, of High Street, Wool-wich—on 24th June I attended Ranton at his house, about 9.15 p.m.—I found him in convulsions and bleeding from the head, almost close to the middle line of the back of the head, on the left side, near the base of the brain—the blood was still oozing; he was more or less in danger then, he was afterwards in danger of lockjaw—he did not speak to me that night—I merely stopped the bleeding; I did not smell his breath—I told his friends to let him come to my surgery in the morning—he came between 10 and 12; I examined his head—I found two wounds, one very slight, just a little below the crown of the head; another one to the left, a little lower down, about an inch long one way and half an inch the other two sides of the wound—I dressed the wounds—he came to me every morning for five days; he got worse every day—eight days after-wards I got a message and went and found him in bed, unable to get up—I feared lockjaw would set in—he is not quite well yet; he complains</p>

               <p>of being unable to hear with one ear—that might possibly be the effect of the blow, but not probably—the bottom wound might have been caused by a fall, or a blow from a blunt instrument—this spanner might have caused the two wounds if opened, or the bottom one if closed—if the blunt instrument had caused the bottom wound and he fell, I do not think this padlock would cause the smaller one—if he had been thrown with great force, and the padlock had been open, he might have been wounded in that way—I saw the padlock in another position, and so gave a different opinion before the Magistrate—the distance between the open parts of the padlock was the same as the distance between the wounds, about two inches; I did not measure it—I said before the Magistrate that he must have been thrown with great violence to cause the wound—that is my opinion still.</p>

               <p>of it, I swear that—the day after that confession she was brought up, she never said a word then—I was not examined all through as if that confession never took place, her solicitor said it was wrung out of her by threats and promises—the prisoner slept at the Stores, and my wife at my private house—she was the working housekeeper at the Stores, and I relied on her to look after the domestic arrangements there—my wife does not assist in the business or in the domestic arrangements at the Stores, she would as a rule go there once a week, some weeks she may have been there twice—the prisoner's little boy was not in the house when she left on the 18th—I first heard on the Tuesday that she had been to Walton-on-the-Naze, by a letter purporting to come from her mother—my wife received it on the Monday morning—I did not know that she was going to Walton-on-the-Naze. (<hi rend="italic">A letter was read in which the prisoner stated that she was ill and intended going to Walton-on-the-Naze.</hi>) I did not know that her little boy was staying at Walton-on-the-Naze—the prisoner came to me as a widow, I know she left her husband because of his ill usage—I spoke to her first about 12 o'clock on the Thursday—four persons in my employment sleep in the house, there are 10 or 11 in and out of the premises all day—this lumber-room is on the top floor and near where these four persons sleep, and if they wished they could have access to the room—none of the 10 persons had any business up there, but there was nothing to prevent them going up—the prisoner's room door was not locked while she was gone, and they could have gone in there or in the lumber room—all the 10 persons have access to the Stores—I have had the servant at my private house about 12 months, she went on the Monday to the Stores to get a bit of dinner for us, because there was no one else to get it, it was a most unusual thing for her to go to the Stores—she went on the Tuesday for the same reason—I think, the prisoner had one half holiday, and she may have been out for a day—my wife went into the lumber room before the things were found there, she said she was going through all the rooms before the new housekeeper came in, as they were dirty—I never missed anything from my shop before I went upstairs, the stock is very enormous—I don't know whether the prisoner had a key by which she could come into the Stores—the prisoner did not on the Wednesday ask permission to sleep at the Stores that night, she asked whether she might pack up some things, and I said the men had strict orders not to admit her—on the Thursday she did not come in through the shop, so she must have got in through the back—the policeman was there before the boxes were searched, and it was at my instigation that he was sent for—the grate was filled with things, any<lb/>body going over to the mantelpiece could not see what was in the grate because a piece of cardboard was fixed in like a fire-screen and covered it to the top—she made no reply to the charge in the hearing of the police—her father is a wholesale stationer in Stoke Newington, in a large way of business—I have made no inquiries respecting him—I have a lady here as a witness with whom the prisoner lived before; she was not called at the police-court—I have a man named White in my service—some of my assistants have left me recently, the last was three or four months ago, I believe before the prisoner came—when my wife called me up she said "Come and see these things in Mrs. Pearn's room—the cardboard was removed when I got up, but I know it had been there because my wife put it back as she had found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife, and live at Silverdale—the business is carried on at Kirkdale—on 22nd July, between 11 and 12 a.m. I went into the room occupied by the prisoner at Kirkdale and looked round it—I was alone—I saw a dirty piece of cardboard covering the top of the fireplace and paper in front of the bars and around them concealing the contents of the grate—I removed the cardboard, and found the articles named, and spoke to my husband and showed them to him—I had previously been in the lumber-room, but found no goods there then—Christina McKay was with me in there, but after going into it she had to go down and look after the dinner—I did not go into the lumber-room after the prisoner came into the house—I left to go home.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 97, Kirkwood Road, Nunhead, and have been a packer and warehouseman in a firm at 7, Coleman Street, City, for 20 years—previous to 20th Feb. I had seen the prisoner with reference to the purchase of the Camden Stores, 97, Kirkwood Road—I asked him if the house was for sale; he said "Yes, that is my business to see you"—I asked him what he had for sale; he said the licence, the house, the goodwill, and fixtures—the first price was 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the course of a week or two I said I could not find that money, and he brought it down to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I said I could find—on 10th February I signed this agreement. (<hi rend="italic">This acknowledged the receipt from Hodges of</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">a deposit on the purchase of the Camden Wine and Beer Stores, and stated that the term was</hi> 41 <hi rend="italic">years at a rent of</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">that the premium agreed was</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; possession to be given on 17<hi rend="italic">th February, when all arrears of rent, rates and taxes were to be discharged or allowed for, and the licence transferred, etc.</hi>) I then asked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030093"/>
               <p>him if he had the lease—he said "My solicitor has it"—I asked him if it was free; he said "Yes, quite free"—I said to him "Then in refer<lb/>ence to the business, because I have a large family of eight little children and don't want to be taken in, tell me truthfully what it is"—he said "There is the licence, the lease of 42 years, and doing a trade of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, which with a little attention can be increased to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked him if the licence was all right; he said "Yes, everything is in perfect order"—I believed those statements—the change was fixed for the 17th but took place on the 18th February, when I signed this agreement (<hi rend="italic">By this Trill agreed to sell the Camden Wine and Beer Stores for the residue of 42 years and the licence for</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">of which</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was to be paid on or before signing, the balance to be paid</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th May, and</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">on</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th August, to be secured in the meantime by bills of exchange or promissory notes. The purchaser to be liable for all outgoings, the same having been by the vendor up to date.</hi>) I believed the rent had been paid; I particu<lb/>larly asked about the rent, rates, and taxes—the agreement was read over—I did not deduct any money out of the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent, because it was stated the rent was paid—I paid 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the night of the change, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on deposit, and gave two bills at three and six months—I certainly should not nave parted with my money if I had not believed those statements—on the 27th I paid the licences—on the 19th, next morning, I saw a notice of a writ of ejectment posted on my door by the freeholder for non<lb/>payment of rent—as to the trade, the whole of the first week I took 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the second week was 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was only a fortnight open—on the transfer day I attended at the Newington Sessions to apply for a transfer of the licence; it was refused in consequence of the writ of ejectment of the late tenant, and the police inspector reported the conduct of the outgoing tenant to be such as not to warrant the bench in renewing the licence—I have lost my money as a net result of the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had had six months' experience of the licensed victuallers' trade in the country some long time ago—I first came across this by seeing the place was for sale; living in the neighbourhood I saw it was closed and asked who had it, and ascertained that it belonged to Messrs. Morgan, the brewers—I sent them a note which they sent on to the prisoner, and then he called on me—Morgans were the brewers of the house—one of the bills was not presented and one is not yet due, so that all I have paid is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—only the certificate for the licence was handed to me—I paid for the licence without the certificate; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not say the licence is not in order—the prisoner had not the lease in his possession, I do not say he had not a lease—as long as I got the lease when I paid the money it did not matter to me who had got it when he made the representations to me—at the time of the change I asked the solicitor if he had it, and he said "You will find it will be all right, when your money is forthcoming your lease will be forthcoming"—that is the solicitor—I understood Trill had a free lease to do what he liked with—I do not think there is any reason why he could not do what he liked with it—the house was closed at the time I bought it, with a notice, "Closed for alterations"—it was closed before I saw the prisoner—he said with proper attention I could do 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I swear he told me he had taken 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—I had had a change before when I had been in a public-house—I did not ask for any books or anything; I only asked if all payments were made—in the country I had had brewers' receipts</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188608030094"/>
               <p>but no books produced—I knew Morgans were supplying the beer; I did not ask to see their books—I made no inquiries from them as to what beer they had been supplying to the house per month—I sent nobody to make inquiries—it was not a full licence—I did not ask Trill with whom he had been dealing for wine; I did not ask him a single question about it—I did not ask him for receipts, because he said "What I give you I can assure you is right," and I took the statement—I think Mr. Merrington can tell you what Morgans supplied; there is nobody else—I had no authorised person acting for me, out I asked a friend who is a broker to come with me; I did not understand that he knew about the exchange of public-houses—I simply said I was taking the place, would he come over with me, and he did—there was no stock and nothing to take over there, it was an empty house with the exception of a few fixtures—I took it thinking there was a trade with it—I asked how long it had been closed; it was only a week or two, as the prisoner's son had gone away and left him in a dilemma—I have no connection in the neigh<lb/>bourhood, only among my neighbours—I am not known as a publican.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have lived in the neighbourhood for two years—when he told me the lease would be forthcoming I did not know it had been mortgaged and was in another solicitor's hands; I only know it now by hearsay—one solicitor, Mr. Packman, acted for us both, and we both paid him—the agreement was drawn up on the prisoner's statement—I paid Mr. Packman a guinea for his costs.</p>

               <p>

On 9th July last I was with Jupe and saw the prisoner in High Street, Peckham—I saw him go into the Bull's Head; he then had nothing with him—he came out again in a few minutes, carrying a bag—I followed and stopped him, and said "Ken<lb/>nedy, do you know me?"—he said "No"—I said "I am a police officer, what have you got in your bag?"—he said "It is jewellery, it is all right"—we took him to the Peckham Station, where we opened the bag, and found it contained two gold watches, another one with plated cases, three silver watches, a foreign watch, French, I think, two pins</p>

               <p>that had had stones in them, a gold horseshoe pin, two bows of watches, apparently broken, studs that apparently have had stones in them, a bar of a watch chain, and two or three small broken pieces of jewellery; I also found on him a pawnbroker's contract note for a gold watch with no name and number, a purse containing 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a silver watch, and metal chain—I said "Kennedy, can you give me the names and addresses of any persons from whom you bought these watches, so that inquiries can be made?"—he said "I can<lb/>not, I have bought them in a business way; I am a dealer"—he was asked for his name and address—he said he did not like to give it on account of his wife—I saw keys taken from him, and went with Jupe afterwards with these keys to 42, Lambeth Road, where I opened a large tin box in the room with the key, and found in it a box containing some weights and scales, a file testing-iron, and nine empty jewel cases—it was the top back room of a private house—there was no sign of business there—I had seen Kennedy before in the Rockingham Arms, the Eques<lb/>trian, and other public-houses in the neighbourhood of the London Road and Elephant and Castle, during business hours, and at all hours of the day.</p>

               <p>then proceeded to search the room, and in a cupboard I found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> a screw-driver, and a bottle of aquafortis—I have compared the screw<lb/>driver with the marks on the galvanic battery, which appears to have been broken open, and it exactly tallies—when these were found Shaw said to Stevens "How do you account for the possession of these things?"—she said "A man named Bush brought them there"—the cupboard was not locked, but they were packed up in a corner—I took possession of them, and took them to Teddington Police-station, and went back to Kennington Lane Station, where I had left Scott—I found on him a knife, upon which were marks showing it had been dipped in acid—on 31st May Scott was dealt with by the Magistrate at Sunbury—on 2nd June I and Shaw went back to 21, Frances Place and took Stevens in custody—I told her she would be charged with burglariously breaking and entering Beechwood, Balham, and stealing a clock and other articles—she said "I know nothing about it"—afterwards she said "All I know is that on the morning you arrested Scott he got up about 8 o'clock in the morning, went out for about half an hour, returned with the clock, and put it on the mantelpiece"—she was then taken to the station, and detained—on 16th June I went with Sergeant Jupe to the prisoner Knight's house at Prince's Buildings, Lambeth; it is a private house, and is used as a second-hand boot and clothes shop—while I was there I saw Johnson and Williams, two men on another charge (<hi rend="italic">see next page</hi>), go into the place, and after they had come out I went in there—I met Knight half-way down the passage leading to his house, which is at the end of the passage—I said "I am a police officer; what have these two men sold you that have just left?"—he said "A clock; I gave 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; they wanted 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I don t know the value of such articles; I am a dealer; I never saw them before"—that is the clock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which has been identified by Mr. Marks—it was in a sack then which the two men had brought it in—I detained him till the return of Sergeant Jupe—Knight said "This is my house, and that is my house over the way"—I then proceeded to search, and found a quantity of plated articles, and among them Dr. Burn's surgical instruments, a pair of scissors, and two pairs of boots spoken to by him—I also found among the plated articles a silver jug, three silver knives, and a pair of trousers, which have been identified as being taken from Dr. Stewarts, of Lewisham, on 14th April—I found marks on a large quanty of the articles, as if they had been touched with acid—on searching Knight I found on him a watch without a bow and case—those articles were found at Nos. 10 and 11, but the greater majority at 10; they are opposite houses; the outside of the houses are the same—the parlour of one shop was used as a parlour, and the other house had some pairs of trousers and 200 or 300 pairs of boots hung up outside.</p>
