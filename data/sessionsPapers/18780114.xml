On 29th October, about 7 p. m., I went to 36, Sale Street, Bethnal Green; it is a greengrocer's shop—it is about a mile and a half from the Stepney station, and about half a mile from Martha Street—I went to execute a search warrant there—I saw Green in the shop with his daughter and Darch—I asked Green who Darch was; he said either "my son," or "my son-in-law," I can't recollect which—I told him I had come to execute a search warrant—he said "Very well, you will find nothing here"—Detective Waller was</p>

               <p>with me, and Green said, turning to Waller, "You know, Mr. Waller, I told you I would tell you if anything was brought to me"—I went upstairs, and searched the upper portion of the premises, in company with Green and a City detective—at the time I entered Green's house I sent two constables to No. 3, Park Place, the door of which is opposite the side gate of Green's house, and the width of the court is only four or five feet—I found nothing upstairs—on coming down into the shop a bag containing ginger was lying in the doorway—Green's attention was called to it by a constable who was with me, and he said "It is a plant, it was not there when we went upstairs, somebody has put it there to ruin me"—there were a number of bags in the shop containing potatoes of almost a similar appearance to the bag containing the ginger, so that I could not say whether that bag was there when I went there first—about this time the constables I had sent to Park Place came into the shop, and said they could not gain admittance—I directed them to force the door open—I afterwards went there—the door opens direct into the kitchen—the fire was alight, and there was every appearance of the place having been recently occupied, but nobody was on the premises—the search warrant was issued with regard to a quantity of chemicals, and I found a bottle of infusion of senna, which was mentioned in the warrant—I found about 25 or 30 cwt. of tin plates similar to those produced, also parts of broken boxes and iron hoops, parts of which I produce, and which have been shown to the witnesses—I also found two firkins of butter, two crocks of butter, three sacks of split beans, a sack of wheat, four canvas wrappers, some silk handkerchiefs, some ostrich feathers, three great-coats of the Irish constabulary, and two pairs of new trousers—these things were found in the kitchen and back-room on the ground-floor, and some in the rooms occupied as a bedroom and sitting-room—there are four rooms in the house, two on the ground-floor and two on the first—the name of "Seamark, Maidstone" was on the wrappers—I took possession of all the things, and they have been seen by the witnesses—Green was taken to the station while the house was being searched—Darch and Green's daughter left while I was searching upstairs—they did not come back—I placed a constable in charge of the house, and he remained there all night—at the station I showed these goods to Green, and said they had been found at 3, Park Place—he said "I know nothing about the place"—I saw this machine there which is used for opening cases without leaving any mark.</p>

Bishop's distillery, Ropemaker Walk, Finsbury, where he was employed as carman for about 12 months—I told him it was for being concerned in receiving a quantity of goods at 3, Park Place—he said "I know nothing about them"—I said "You were there last night with Green's daughter and ran away"—he said "Yes, but I know nothing about the goods you are speaking of"—I said "You are married to Green's daughter?"—he said yes, he was there last night, but knew nothing about the goods—he did not say where he was living at that time; on the way to the station he said he was living at 1, Collingwood Street, Shoreditch—on the night in question I assisted in searching Park Place, and found this Bible on the bed in the bedroom; there is this writing in it: "March 25, 1868. This Bible belongs to J. Darch, aged 12 years, a gift from his grandmother, Susan Dean, aged 60 years." On 31st, at the police-court, Darch asked me if his wife was outside; I said "Yes."</p>

I am 16 years old, and live at 30, Alfred Street, Camberwell, with my parents—I was van guard to the prisoner on 27th October—we left the Chatham and Dover yard at 11 a.m.—the van was empty—we went to Thames Street and got some hops, and presently went to Mr. Bowles's in Smithfield—the prisoner then got down from the van, and told me to run up to Wright's to see if there was anything for the Chatham and Dover Company—I went and was away two minutes—when I came back the prisoner was not with the van, but came a few minutes afterwards—the tarpauling was covered over the van—I went to George Yard—Ridley told me to go—I do not know where he went, but he went away—it took me two or three minutes to go to George Yard—on my way I noticed, for the first time, two firkins of butter in the van under the tarpauling—I did not know if they were there when I went to Wright's—Ridley joined me and the van is the Old Bailey—we called at the booking-office there—I was in there five minutes—we then went to Lavender's—I went in—Ridley stayed with the van—I came out, but saw no more of the van—I went to our booking-office—a man outside told me to—I saw the prisoner there—he was not with the van—I went</p>

I live at Sutton, in the parish of Heston, where I am groom to Mr. Jones—on 21st January, about 5.30 p.m., he was away from home, and I went out and locked up the house—I returned about 6.30, and found the dining-room window, on the ground-floor, broken, and I missed from that room three coats, a pair of trousers, a gold-plated Albert chain, and a burnisher (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these are them—three shirts are still missing—I then went to Quinlan's, the pawnbroker's, at Hounslow, and there found the prisoner Pusey pawning two coats and a pair of trousers, and he had an overcoat on—I have known him two months; he slept in that room on the Saturday before this—I gave him in custody—I do not know Hope.</p>

I am a labourer, of Heston—on 2nd January, about 5.30 p.m., I saw Hope walking backwards and forwards, and while I was having some beer at the Old George he came in—I looked him in the face; he is the man—I then heard Pusey in the house; I knew him by his voice—Hope got a light for his pipe and joined Pusey, and they both went away together—Pusey was courting a young woman there—that house is a quarter of a mile from Mr. Jones's.</p>

I keep the Rifleman beerhouse, Hounslow—on 2nd January, about 7.15 p.m., Hope came in with a coat on his arm—a friend of mine at the bar said "Have you been travelling?"—he said "Yes, worse luck"—ten minutes afterwards a constable came in with Pusey, who picked up the coat lying beside Hope and put it on—this is it.</p>

I am a pawnbroker, of Hounslow—on the evening of 2nd January, Pusey came and produced two coats and a pair of trousers, and said that his name was Liddell, and he lived at Heston, and that the trousers were made for him expressly, at Pennington the tailor's, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "They were never made for you, they are gen<lb/>tleman's riding trousers"—I detained him and went to the door to look for a policeman, and met the prosecutor and another man, and Pusey was taken in custody—he still persisted that the goods were his own, but afterwards he said that a man gave them to him at the Rifleman beerhouse—two constables brought Hope there, and I asked him whether he gave Pusey the goods—he said that he had never seen them.</p>

The policeman came in with Pusey and said "Did this man give you the clothes?" He said "Yes." I said "It is false." He picked up the coat which belonged to him and put it on—I am innocent.</p>

I said "You have to get your living and I will get mine." After that I was going home and saw him <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> a bundle down. I picked it up.

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Herman Koekoek, a picture-dealer, of 72, Piccadilly—on 24th September the prisoner called and I saw him—he had called about a week previously—he called to see an English landscape which he wanted to form a centre between two other pictures in his drawing or dining-room—I promised to get some<lb/>thing to show him—he afterwards decided not to have it—he gave his address, 15, Cavendish Place, Brighton—he said he was going to leave there, but was in treaty for a house about eight miles from Brighton, where he could have some fishing and shooting and amuse himself by looking after the men in the fields—I said I rather liked Brighton and had some notion of going to live there—he said "Well, if you are I will sell you my house"—he said he had bought it before things had gone up so, very cheap, furniture and all—he did not name any price—he did not state the name of the place he was in treaty for—he said they wanted 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, there was 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. differ<lb/>ence between them, but he had the option of taking it if he liked with the option of purchase afterwards—he said he had a small collection of draw<lb/>ings, some of Birket Foster's and others, and also a small collection of pictures by the old masters; and he invited me, if I was coming to Brighton, to come and see them—I think he said that the two landscapes he had, for which he wanted one to put between, were by Meadows, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187801140015"/>
               <p>I said "Well, Meadows is not a very great man, though he is a pretty painter"—there was a picture standing before him which he said was a very pretty picture—I said "Yes, it is by a very good man"—he asked the price—I said 95 guineas—he said "Well, I will take that"—I showed him another by Bazzani—he said it was a very lovely picture—I said he was a very great man, his pictures realised a very large price, and were increasing in value—he said "I should like to buy that, what is the price?"—I said 160 guineas—he said "If you can give me a little time I should like to take those two"—a drawing by Birket Foster was put by for him—the third picture was by Verbeckhoven—I agreed to sell him the pictures—he took the Birket Foster away with him that day; the others were to be sent, and I sent them the following evening—I have since seen the Birket Foster in the possession of Mr. McLean; the Ver<lb/>beckhoven in the possession of Mr. Gilbert; and the Bazzani in the possession of Mr. Cochrane—the first thing that induced me to let him take away the Birket Foster was, knowing the family of Elkington to be by reputation first-class, I believed his statement about the house in Cavendish Place and about his having a collection of pictures there, and that he had the power of selling the house—he also represented that he had a good income: that he was a man of independent fortune—it was the different statements taken together that influenced me—if he had said nothing about the house in Cavendish Place and his collection of pictures I do not think I should have parted with any property—if I had been perfectly satisfied he was the man he represented himself to be, I should not have hesitated—if he had been one of the family of Elkington, and a person of independent property; I very likely might have parted with the pictures.</p>

I am a stonemason, and live at the South-Western Chambers, Wandsworth Road—on Saturday night, 5th January, about a quarter to 12, the prisoner came up to me near Temple Bar, and asked me to treat her—we went to a public-house, and I paid for some drink—she was then on my right side, and I took my purse out of my left trousers pocket, took some money out, and put the purse back in my left pocket—we remained there about a minute after that, she still being on my right side—we both left together, and when we had got about fifty yards beyond Temple Bar I missed my purse, which had in it, when I put it back into my pocket, two sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, a German twenty-mark piece, and some German and English small change—when I missed my purse I turned out my pockets—the prisoner wanted to get away from me, but I caught hold of her, and called out "Go with me," and she said "Go with me"—a woman came up and said something to her, and wanted to take her away, but I said "You must stop with me till the police come"—the prisoner had talked to another woman when we were in the public-house—that was not the woman who came up afterwards—no one was near my left-hand pocket after I put the purse back but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I did not treat the other woman—I left the public-house first, and the prisoner followed me—when we got through the Bar I put my hand in my pocket and missed my purse, and then I asked her to go with me—she said "No, I will not go with you, you had better come with me"—I cannot speak English, but I made her understand—I made signs that she should go with me, and she made signs that I should go with her—that was after I had missed my purse—when I called "Police" she wanted to get away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a money-changer, of 58, Old Broad Street—on 27th July, 1876, Henry Eldon, the managing clerk to Mr. Chapman, a solicitor, brought me this card of Mr. Chapman's (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and a piece of paper, on which was written "Chicago Bonds"—he after<lb/>wards called and introduced the prisoner, and two bonds were produced (<hi rend="italic">Numbered</hi> 2275 <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 2493)—I gave the prisoner a crossed cheque for 326<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one of the bonds—he gave his name F. A. Randolph—he left this sold note with me, "Sold by F. A. Randolph, of 19, Claydon's Terrace, Clapham"—I sold the bond to W. H. Bishop, who gave me a cheque for the amount, and some days afterwards the bond was returned to me marked "Counterfeit"—I have had to pay Mr. Bishop the money and the expenses.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 1, Gresham Buildings, Basing<lb/>hall Street—this card of mine is an old one—I became acquainted with the prisoner a short time anterior to March, 1876—I knew him by the name of F. A. Randolph, of 19, Clayland Road, Clapham—I became ac<lb/>quainted with him by his calling on me and saying that a client named Field had recommended him to me—he did not give Mr. Field's Christian name or address, and I never knew what Mr. Field it was; it was a hurried interview, and it was never discussed afterwards—he said that his name was Randolph, and I understood him to say from America—I issued a writ for him in the Common Pleas, and later on he said that he had some valuable securities which he wanted to realise, or had got to realise—that was about 6th or 7th July, when I had asked him for some<lb/>thing on account of the action pending—I sent my clerk to introduce him to a stockbroker, but I did not know to whom he was going—I never saw the securities, nor did he say what they were—on the same evening he brought me this cheque for 326<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was post-dated, and asked me to cash it for him—I agreed, and paid it in to my private account at Woolwich, where I have a local office; and on the morning of the 28th I sent Mr. Smith, my manager, to get a draft on Glyn's for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he brought me in notes, and I gave them to the prisoner, who, I believe, was waiting—I kept back 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as there was about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me for costs—I feel sure that I took a receipt, but I cannot find it—I saw the prisoner a day or two afterwards, when he said "How is my action going on?"—I cannot fix the date—I set the action down for trial, but had to drop it, as he never came back—he had not told me that he did not intend to come again—I do not know when he left Clapham—I did not receive a farthing for the introduction to Mr. Chick—I did not know that my clerk had introduced him to Mr. Rossett, or I should not have allowed it—I am not acting as his solicitor now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. When he first came to me he had purchased some furniture and paid the major part of the money, and the person who had lent it to him went one day and took a portion of it away—as far as my information goes it was a perfectly legal claim—the only name known to me was Randolph—at this time in July Eldon was my clerk; he had not then been convicted, nor did I look upon him as a person who would be likely to commit himself—he was my head clerk—he did not say to me in the interval between introducing the prisoner to Mr. Chick and turning the cheque into cash "Mr. Randolph says they cannot <hi rend="italic">squeak</hi> for 10 or 15 days;" there was never a whisper of it—I never heard it suggested that the prisoner had used that expression till Eldon was in the witness-box—I subsequently discovered that the prisoner is most highly connected, that he is the son of a Canon of St. Paul's and the Vicar of Ruislip, but had no notion of that when he was my client—I never saw Webster, who took the bonds to Mr. Kingwell.</p>

I am a prisoner in the House of Detention undergoing a sentence of six months for stealing—in July, 1876, I was Mr. Chapman's clerk, and had been so since February—I knew the prisoner, but only as Randolph; I thought he was an independent gentle<lb/>man—I was spoken to about realising some bonds, and made inquiries of Mr. Chick, and afterwards went with the prisoner to Mr. Chick—that was, to the best of my belief, on 26th July—I introduced the prisoner to Mr. Chick and gave him Mr. Chapman's card—I had never seen Mr. Chick before—the prisoner said "I want you to go to a place, you will see the name of Chick on the blind"—I told Mr. Chick that I was Mr. Chapman's clerk, and was present when the prisoner gave him two bonds and received a cheque—it was just 4 o'clock, and Mr. Chick said that the cheque would be of no service then, but the prisoner said that he could make use of it, and Mr. Chick gave it to him; it was dated the 27th—on the same day, 26th, we were at a public-house, and I said "Is there any<lb/>thing funny about the bond?"—he said "No, why?" and he said "They cannot squeak for 13 days"—he said, as to the action, that he should have to go—I said "What, show the white feather"—he said "Well, I shall be away, and the principal witness is a lady, and it won't be con<lb/>venient to have her called," and that he had given Mr. Chapman 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was very exorbitant—I saw him again on the 27th and following day—Mr. Chick gave me a half-sovereign, and the prisoner gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note about the 28th or 29th—I proposed to give him change for the note, but he said "Oh, no," and I took the whole note—two or three days alter I introduced him to Mr. Chick I saw him at Mr. Chapman's office—he gave no address, and I did not know where he went to—the action was dropped—I next saw him at Guildhall in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>.

               <p>30th May, 1876, the prisoner brought me this card, "J.

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Allen and Wiley, stock-brokers, of 2, Copthall Court—in February, 1875, I was carrying on business on Cornhill—on that day Mr. Payne, a member of the Stock Exchange, introduced the prisoner to me outside the door of the Stock Exchange as Mr. Pack, who was distantly connected with him—the prisoner then asked me to sell some American bonds for him and showed me five bonds of the Chicago and North-Western Railway, Nos. 2389. 2426, 2586, 2727, and 2749, and told me he wished to sell them—I made some inquiries about them on the Stock Exchange of dealers in American securities and found they were not negotiable there; not on the official list—I told the prisoner that I should have to send the bonds to America, and would do so if he wished it—he said that he wanted some money immediately, and gave me the name and address of a gentle<lb/>man who he said was his father—I wrote this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from what he told me—from his introduction I believed him to be a thoroughly respect<lb/>able person, with whom I was justified in doing business, and went with him to Mr. Cross's office in Cornhill to inquire the value of the securi<lb/>ties—he said that he wanted 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. immediately, and instead of selling them I agreed to lend him 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on them—he said that his father had Turkish bonds to sell, and so engaged me in conversation—I then wrote these two cheques produced.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. If the securities had been London and North-Western stock I should still have required an introduction—we have books and circulars to tell us the interest paid on the bonds, and I could see that there were such things as these 1,000 dollar Chicago bonds, and I believe I should see who was the secretary and the president, and as to the redemp<lb/>tion in 1885 in gold—dealing with thousands of bonds with coupons attached I never test their genuineness in any way—it is not true that some American companies have repudiated bonds of their former com<lb/>pany and marked them as not genuine, but if they have not the money they do not pay.</p>

               <p>Lane—in February, 1875, a person I had never seen before, but who gave the name of Webster, came and said that he had a friend who wanted to buy a carriage—he called three times alone, and once with a another gentleman—when he called alone he gave me a cheque for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Allen and Wylie, and said that if his friend bought the carriage he should want me to cash the cheque so that he might pay for it—he endorsed it in my presence, and I told him I would pay it into my bank, and get the cash—I paid it into my account at the National Bank, Char<lb/>ing Cross, on March 1, with another cheque for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and found next day that it was duly credited to my account—I then drew a cheque for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., cashed it over the counter in five 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and some tens and fives, took them to my premises, and within a minute or two Webster came with his friend, who I had never seen before—I understood him to he the son of the Dean of Windsor—he handed me a card with "Francis Pack" on it, which he wrote on one of my cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I have no recollection of having this card when I gave him the notes—I use this sort of violet ink, and it is the same ink as the endorsement on the cheque—the card was most likely written in my presence, but I do not remem<lb/>ber it—the prisoner does not look to me to be the same person—he looked a brighter, sharper man—I only saw him ten minutes—the carriage was not purchased—he said that he was going abroad that afternoon, and would call again when he returned—I had given the notes to Webster in the other man's presence—I never saw him afterwards—about a fortnight afterwards a detective from the Old Jewry came, and I suppose I handed him the card—I do not know who Webster was, but he said that he lived at Windsor—on the second occasion he told me that the gentleman's father was the Dean of Windsor, I understood, and lived there—I had one of the Queen's carriages in my place, and he said "Be particular, this carriage is going to your own people; the address is, 'The Cloisters'"—Pack did not buy the carriage, but he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble in passing the cheque through my bankers, and cashing it—I saw some reports in the papers, and went to Guildhall to see if it was Webster.</p>

I walked from York to London, and was hungry—I met a friend who promised me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a meal, lodgings, and a situation—he asked me to take the note, saying it was for provisions. I opened it, and seeing nothing about provisions I felt suspicious and gave the boy the same instructions as I received, and waited for the answer, which was that the shopkeeper would send them. I took the answer to my friend, who gave me 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some bread and cheese. After waiting 10 minutes, he said he would go to the shop himself, and he went in that direction. I have always borne a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital Square—at noon on 24th December, I saw the prosecutrix at the Commercial Street police-station—I examined her—I found a clean-cut wound between the third and fourth fingers, reaching from the back of the hand about three<lb/>quarters of an inch into the palm—her eyes were very much swollen; the skin around both eyes was very much inflamed, and the lining mem<lb/>brane of the eyeballs was very much inflamed, and raised with a good of serous effusion underneath—the inflammation appeared to be of a very irritable character—she complained of great itching—the wound was caused by some sharp instrument—if she fell on a broken bottle that was well bevelled off to a sharp edge, and that came in contact with that part of the hand, I see no reason why it should not have inflicted such a wound—the state of the eyes could not arise from any ordinary ailment that I know of—it was evidently produced by some external irritant having been applied there—strong rum, if the evaporation was prevented, might produce it-—the mere throwing rum on would not—she was evidently suffering great pain—I think the injury to the eyes has en<lb/>tirely passed away—I have not seen her for some time—she was only casually under my care—Chili vinegar would be much more likely to cause the injury than anything else—I should expect it arose from that—the peculiar irritable state was attributable in all probability to the irritating effect of capsicums.</p>

               <p>bills were overdue and unpaid, and he said that if I would discount these bills he could put off those bills, and I could discount a few more a month hence—I gave him these two cheques for 182<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him on that occasion whether he intended to liquidate—he said "Most certainly not"—I believe that bill of 10th August was for goods which he had sold to McLaughlin, and that this "P. McLaughlin" was McLaughlin's writing—had I known it was an accommodation bill I would not have had anything to do with it—the bill of May 10 came back dis<lb/>honoured, and they said that it was a forgery—I saw Mr. McDaid about it—he said that it was not a forgery, and he should be able to convince me that it was not, and would get McLaughlin to write to me, or to come over and convince me—I showed him this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I had received from McLaughlin—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter McLaughlin wrote to McDaid—McDaid afterwards brought me this letter, which he represented to be from McLaughlin. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "September 21st, 1877. Sir,—The bill referred to in your letter of the 17th instant is a forgery, and of that fact I informed the bank here when they presented it to me. I will not pay it.—Yours truly, P. McLaughlin.") This note was brought to me afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated September</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">from P.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I received this letter from McLaughlin about the date it is written, 22nd September—I realised from that that forgery had been committed in his name—I took no criminal proceedings, because I know that forgery is very difficult to prove—when I got McLaughlin's letter I do not think I inquired whether the second bill was a forgery too—I thought it best to settle up one first—I use the expression "settle up" because I was not fully convinced that it was a forgery—I wrote to him, I did not send—I tried to see McDaid—I did not give him in custody—I had many transactions with him prior to May when the bill was brought to me—the earliest was some time in 1875, and from that time I had gone on discounting bills for him, which were generally honoured up to May this year—there were one or two irregularities before, down to July, but they had been put right—I mean that they were not paid when due, but afterwards—I discounted three other bills of McLaughlin's some time in 1875—I think my books will show that I discounted his acceptances the first year that I began to discount—I have not discounted bills for the prisoner to the extent of 24,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not think it is 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not looked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 10, Gresham Street, City—I acted for Messrs.

I live at 157, St. James Road, Bermondsey—I was in my brother's employ in Spa Road as a shirt and collar manufacturer—in the autumn of 1876 I heard a conversation between McLaughlin and my brother in the counting-house—they talked about how much more business they could do if they had more capital—a paper like a bill was lying before them—I saw it pass from McLaughlin to my brother—I saw McLaughlin write on it, return it, and say ''There, that is all right"—my brother said that some Saturday he might want cash to pay the workers, and it would take a long time to send a bill in a letter and get it returned if he would allow him to use his name it would be an obligement—McLaughlin said he had no objection, and in return he would want him to assist him in the London houses in trade—my brother said he would do all he could—McLaughlin also said it would be easier if my brother would assist him to open a banking account—my brother said he would see about it—in August, 1877, McLaughlin was in England again and at my lodgings, and Heggerty was present—I mentioned that there was a bill out, and asked if he had any objection to those things going on—McLaughlin said not the slightest, as he depended upon my brother, and he would see to it all right, and that he had come over to see about some trade my brother had promised him—he asked if we had any work ready—I said the last goods were delayed and so turned out bad in the market—McLaughlin said he was so slack now that he could do them cheaper and better now—he also said that he did not mind his name being used, and if my brother would assist him to open a banking account he would meet the bills when they became due when it would not be convenient to send cash, and he could pay him back when convenient.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in the employ of the prisoner Stepney, a bottle merchant, at Euston Mews, Euston Square, as general labourer—my sister lives with him as his wife—I came up from Herefordshire—a man named Barnes was also employed there—I recollect going with the horse and cart to Wapping—I saw Sleven there unloading his van, which contained long boxes, after which he came over to Srepney, who was in a public-house opposite the wharf—I stood outside minding Sleven's horse and van—they remained in the public-house 5 or 10 minutes, and Sleven told me to back the van into the wharf—two large barrels were then rolled into Stepney's van, which was driven on the opposite side of the road, and Sleven followed in his van as far as Lower Thames Street, near Billingsgate, where Stepney and Sleven went into a public-house while I stood outside with the horse and van—Stepney and I then got into my master's van, with the two barrels in it, and drove home to Gower Mews, where Stepney has a warehouse, into which the barrels were put—on the same night Simmonds came to Euston Mews, where Stepney lives, and said "Are you going over to the <hi rend="italic">tother</hi> place?" mean<lb/>ing Gower Mews—Stepney asked me for a hammer—I got it, and Sim<lb/>monds had it—they went to Gower Mews and I followed them—Mr. Stepney came into Gower Mews intoxicated—Simmonds was then apply<lb/>ing the chisel-end of the hammer to undoing the hoop of one of the casks which I had left there, and Stepney was standing alongside it holding a candle—Mrs. Stepney said to Simmonds ''I will <hi rend="italic">round</hi> on you to Mr. Schweppe if this carrying on is going any furthur"—Simmonds said "Hold your tongue," and Stepney pushed her against the door—I caught her as she went down—Simmonds then opened the casks, and took a paper out of each—both barrels contained empty lemonade bottles—next day Barnes and I went to the warehouse and unpacked the barrels of the bottles, put them into <hi rend="italic">prittles</hi>, and they were taken away on different occasions to a man named Mason, who lives at Highgate Road or Camden Town, and the barrels were broken up and made into firewood—three weeks afterwards I left Euston Mews with my horse and van with Stepney—there was a bit of loose straw in the cart and two bags, but no bottles—we went to a public-house in Castle Street, and remained three-quarters of an hour or an hour—Sleven came in and said "<hi rend="italic">Step</hi>, all right"—we then got into the van and drove up the street, and when we got 20 yards he told me to get out and meet him at a public-house in Little Tichfield Street—I got out, and when I got into</p>

               <p>Charles Street I met the van coming out of Wells Street with the hampers in it, and a little straw thrown on them and a bag—Stepney was driving—I walked on and found Sleven, Smith, and Stepney in the public-house and the van outside—they asked me to have some drink, which I did—I saw Stepney pass money to Sleven, but cannot say how much—Stepney and I drove home to Gower Mews, leaving Sleven and Smith at the public-house—we carried the four hampers into the warehouse--they were open, and contained empty lemonades with straw at the top—some had Schweppe's name on them and some had his labels—I afterwards saw those four hampers at the station with the bottles—I once saw Sleven under an arch near London Bridge—there were three or four vans of Mr. Schweppe's there—I had my horse and van there, and Stepney was with me—two of the same kind of barrels were rolled out of Schweppe's van into mine—they contained empty lemonade bottles—they were taken to Gower Mews—on the 28th November a carman of the Brighton and South Coast Railway brought two hampers full of empty lemonades, and he and Stepney went to a public-house at the top of the Mews—I went there and saw Stepney give him money, I don't know what—after we had drank Stepney and I returned to the Mews, and Sim<lb/>monds came in and said to Stepney "Where are the papers of those two hampers?"—Stepney told me to light a candle and fetch them—I went down and fetched the papers out of the hampers—one had no writ<lb/>ing on it, <hi rend="italic">tother</hi> had—I gave them to him, and the one that had no writing on he rolled up and put in the fire, and put the other in his pocket—I fancy I saw "Brighton" on it, but I cannot say—"Schweppe and Co." was on the bottles and on the labels—Stepney and Simmonds then went to a public-house at the top of the Mews, and Stepney gave Simmonds money in a backhanded way—I afterwards saw one of the hampers at the station—I remember hearing Simmonds ask Stepney to have some more, and Stepney said "You will very soon have a house out of old Schweppe"—Simmonds said "It will take me a long while about it"—I subsequently made a communication to Messrs. Schweppe, and the prisoners were given in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KELLY</hi>. This selling of bottles has been going on for a number of years by his own word of mouth, but according to me about three months—I said at the police-court that I had never been in trouble—I was not subsequently obliged to confess that that was a lie—I have been in trouble as a boy, but not since—I was a man in 1875—I was not committed for 14 days at the Hereford Petty Sessions on 29th May, 1875—I was not convicted in the name of Werter Gay; that is not true—I was convicted as Werter Gay at the Hereford Sessions, in 1867, of stealing lead—I was not committed for 14 days in 1857, at the same sessions, for being disorderly and resisting the police—I have served 11 years in the 23rd Fusiliers, and have a good character—I have not been six times convicted in Hereford City—I have been con<lb/>victed twice for drunkenness and once for lead—I gave information against Stepney, and my sister told him she would do the same—I had had no <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with him; we went out one Saturday night, he got drunk, and she was drunk, and I will say I was; on the Sunday morning a chest of drawers was covered with glasses, she swept one away, and he swept the others, and he told me I should have to leave—I went out on Sunday and came back on Monday, and said "Are you going to</p>

               <p>pay me for those old corks?" which I had saved from the bottles—he said "Yes," and I said "I am going to Mr. Schweppe," and I did go—I did not know for a long time that the bottles were being stolen, or where they came from, but Barnes said that there would be a noise about them before long—that was about a month before I left—I remained a month after I knew that the bottles were stolen, assisting in receiving stolen property; I was a servant—I did not inform against Stepney because he put me out of my place—I went to Schweppe when I thought I would go; if you had been employed as a servant perhaps you would have done the same.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CROOME</hi>. I was three months in Stepney's employ, and I first knew that something was wrong after I had been there two months—I did not suspect it before, because he is a bottle<lb/>merchant—I cannot say how long my sister has lived with Stepney—she brought me up from Hereford to London, and Simmonds came to the house the same night—my sister is here—Barnes was not there when the casks were opened, but he was when they were brought in, and helped to roll them in—I have not seen him here—when I say that I saw Stepney pass money to Simmonds in a back-handed way I mean that I saw money pass, because he paid for the beer out of the same hand—I was the out<lb/>side party, I was not between them—I saw money pass from hand to hand.</p>

Schweppe—I saw Sleven on the morning of 30th November, and he said "There are some bottles we may get rid of in the evening"—I told him I would rather have nothing to do with it, but about 5. 30 he came to me just outside the warehouse and said "I am going to fetch the van" and at 7 o'clock he beckoned me down the Mews—I followed him and lowered four full hampers down by the crane into his van, which were placed against the folding doors of the loft—Stepney was with the van, and Sleven was in it—it drove out of the Mews—I went back and put my coat on, as Sleven asked me to meet him in Little Tichfield Street—I went there and saw Stepney and Sleven with the van—I had something to drink, and saw Stepney pass money to Sleven, who gave me 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of it.</p>

Schweppe's warehouse—I know Simmonds, Sleven, and Smith—Simmonds was the head of the un<lb/>packing department—he would unpack hampers of empties, and report the numbers that arrived, verbally to me—I then gave the carman who brought them a small ticket, with a note of the number of packages re<lb/>ceived—the carman would then go to the front office and obtain a receipt for them—I took Simmond's word for the numbers received—our cus<lb/>tomers generally enclose at the top of the hampers a paper like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was Simmonds's duty to account for those papers—Sleven's duty was in the packing department, export end—he was sent to Greller's Wharf several times in November—Smith remained to the last, not to shut up, but to see that everything was cleared away at 7 or 8 o'clock—on the afternoon of 30th November Sleven was sent to Greller's Wharf, he returned about <hi rend="italic">5</hi> o'clock—about 6 or 7 o'clock I sent Smith to the export end to get some empty boxes—he remained away from five to ten minutes each time he went down—he might have brought one or two boxes, but he reported that there were none—on 3rd December I went with Brown to Stepney's premises; he said "I have come after those hampers which you received on Friday"—Stepney got excited and had some conversation with his wife, who said "My brother has done for me"—I asked Stepney who he got the hampers from—he said "From Harry Smith and Peter Sleven"—I saw two hampers of empty bottles at Stepney's, such as we receive from our customers; the greater part of them had our labels, as well as our name printed on then—I subse<lb/>quently saw at Stepney's other place, Gower Mews, other bottles and hampers, one of which contained 11 dozen and three full bottles of lemonade—they were our export bottles, and it was export lemonade—it is always bottled plain and double wired to send abroad—we do not supply that lemonade to home customers—I afterwards went to Mr. Mason's with Brown and Aunger and saw about 500 dozen bottles with Schweppe's label on them. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

On 3rd December, between 2 and 3 p. m., I went to Euston Mews and saw Stepney—I told him I had come for the bottles he had fetched from Wells Mews on Friday morning—he said "Good God, if I go to prison for this it will kill me"—I went with him and Reeks to Gower Mews, unlocked the warehouse, and found the hampers of empty bottles—before we started he said that he bought the hampers of Smith and Sleven—his wife said "I suppose my brother has <hi rend="italic">rounded</hi> on me through the <hi rend="italic">row</hi> we had on Saturday night, it is a pity we ever had him up from the country"—I took him to the station and then went back to Gower Mews and found several hundred dozens of empty bottles—I made further search, and under some straw in a corner of the warehouse I found a hamper containing 11 dozen and three bottles of lemonade—I took Sleven—he said that he knew nothing about it—Simmonds was given into my custody in the office; he said that he knew nothing whatever of it, and did not know Stepney—I asked him if he knew Euston Mews—he said "No."</p>

I am a boat-builder, of 18, Beach Street, Deal—at a quarter to 10 on Saturday night, 29th December, I went home, and shortly after 10 o'clock went to bed with my wife and children, with the exception of one son, who was out—I saw the door closed; I closed it myself, and it was latched, I am quite sure of that—it was not locked, it was left for my son to come in—after I had been in bed some time I heard the latch turn—I should think it was then nearly half-past ten; I had been in bed a quarter of an hour—I got out of bed and called out, and not hearing any footsteps, I thought it was suspicious, and called out "Who is there?"—not getting any answer, I opened the front window and looked out—I saw no one standing at the door, but saw a man going along to the north, about 40 yards from me—he had some<lb/>thing on his arm—I cannot say what it was, but I thought it was a bag—I did not go downstairs directly, but very soon, and then I watched him tumble about with the bag, and he dropped it and picked it up, and then went towards the south—I then got a light and went downstairs—I found the door about three inches open—that was the door I had closed—I saw that the pegs on which you hang things in the passage were all empty, and I missed a jacket which I had put there at a little before 10 o'clock, when I went to bed—I called to my wife to know if she had taken it—I also missed three other articles which I had seen there when I went to bed, but I do not know what articles they were—I also missed two jackets and a waterproof cloak of my wife's, and my little boy's ulster coat—I next saw the coats at half-past 11 the same night at the police-station—they are produced in Court—these are the articles (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>); they are my property.</p>

I am a member of the police force at Deal—on this Saturday night, 29th December, I saw two men in Alfred Square at a little after 11 o'clock—the two prisoners are the men—they were carrying a bag—I spoke to them and asked them what they had got in the bag—White had got the bag, and I asked him what he had got—he said "I have got nothing in the bag but what I am selling"—I told him it would not do, I must look and see what he had got, and asked him to put the bag down—he put it down, and Nicholson said something to White, and they both ran away immediately, but not in the same direction—one went to the south part and one to the north—I pursued White, but he got away from me, and I went back for the bag, and took it to the police-station—it contained the clothes produced—the prisoners appeared to me to be sober—shortly afterwards White was brought into the station by another officer—he is the man who I had seen before with the bag—I next saw Nicholson the following day, Saturday, at Sandwich—he is the man who was with White on the day previous—Sandwich is about six miles from where this happened—I spoke to him, and asked him whether he was at Deal last night—he gave me no answer.</p>

I live at 45, Duke Street, West<lb/>minster—my father and mother are alive—on a Wednesday night in December I was with Smith, Neckless, and Miller, at the corner of Robert Street, where I took five pairs of cord trousers from a van, and about a quarter-past; seven I took three pair to Mrs. Daniels, 36, Isabella Street—Herbert told me where she lived—there is no shop, I knocked at the door, Mrs. Daniels answered it, and I said "Mrs. Daniels, do you want to buy three pairs of trousers?"(Neckless was a little way down the street)—she said "How much do you want?"—I said "3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—she said "I will give you half-a-crown"—I said "Yes"—she gave me a florin and said she would give me another sixpence to-morrow night—I was in the passage by the side of the front room door, which was open—I was talking to her about five minutes—I had never spoken to her before—she did not ask who I was, or where I came from—I saw a man in an Ulster in the front room, who I have seen since at the police-court—he is the brother-in-law, Moses Daniels—I did not speak to him, or he to me—I then went back to Neckless, and then to the theatre—I went to the Board school next day, and was taken there by a policeman.</p>

I am an ironer, and live at No. 1, Hatcham Terrace, Old Kent Road—on Monday night, 24th December, I was in company with Head and a Mr. Stanforth—as we were walking along we heard cries of "Murder" and "Police"—Head ran across the road—we saw Francis on the ground, and Mr. Freeborn on the top of him—Head said "Let the man go"—he lifted Mr. Freeborn up, and said "What is the matter?"—Mr. Freeborn said "That man has put his hand in my pocket and robbed me of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Head says "If he has robbed you, the best thing is to give him in charge"—Head picked up their hats and gave them to them, and said "The best thing for you two men is to get home"—he did not strike Mr. Freeborn—I am positive of that—we crossed the road, and Francis said to Head "I thank you very kindly for coming up as you did, or else I might have been strangled, "and he asked us to go in and have something to drink—we refused—he said Are you frightened at getting intermixed with this?"—we said "No"—we went in, and he called for a pot of ale and threepenny worth of whisky—we remained in the house about five or six minutes—I was examined before the Magistrate, and gave the same evidence as I have done to-day. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had not done my work till nearly 8 that evening—I had just gone home and cleaned myself, and then came out and met Head—I had not been in any public-house. <hi rend="smallCaps">

I am a solicitor, and have offices at Somerset Chambers, 151, Strand—I have been acting for the defendant for many months past, more particularly in reference to the matter of Mr. Sayers—Mr. Glancey called on me with the summons—I had met Sayers at the change, which I attended, and I saw him from about 2 o'clock till half-past 5 or 6—after an interview with Glancey, I wrote this letter (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I obtained the address from the summons—I saw Mr. Myers from Mr. Webb's office—he called on me on the 4th August—my letter is dated the 2nd—I presume that Glancey would be at my office on that day, because I should write immediately—I prepared an affidavit about the 10th August for him to swear in the County Court proceedings—this(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the copy affidavit I supplied—I took my instructions from my client, Mr. Glancey—leave was obtained to appear—this letter, dated the 7th August, which I wrote to Messrs.
