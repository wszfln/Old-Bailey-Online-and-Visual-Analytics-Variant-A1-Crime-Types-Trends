On the 17th of April, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, I opened my shop-door, and saw two men crossng the road - one of them had a great coat on very much resembling a coat which belonged to me, and the other had a bundle - the great coat had a fur collar - whether the first man had a bundle I could not see - I then called to my daughter Sarah, who was in the parlour, to know if our bed-room door was locked; she said, "Yes" - I had left it locked when I was last up there - I ran up stairs, and found the bed-room door, on the first floor, forced open - a box was broken open, and my clothes scattered about, and some things were gone - I ran down stairs, and gave an alarm to my daughter - the lock of the bed-room door was still locked, though it was forced open - it could not have been done with a skeleton-key - I had locked the door myself about two hours before, and hung the key up in the parlour; I then went in pursuit down Drake-street, and down different streets, to see if I could see the two men - I saw a policeman, and then went to the station-house in George-street, and gave information of the robbery, that it might be in the Hue-and-Cry the same night- I then returned home - when I first went into my bed-room, I missed the things out of the box, but did not wait to ascertain what was gone - when I returned home, I re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160004"/>ceived information that a coach had been stopped in Holborn - I then went to Giltspur-street, and from there to the station-house in Bow-street, where I saw part of my property, and the three prisoners had been apprehended; I had not seen them before on that day - I cannot swear whether either of them were the men I had seen crossing the street - I had seen two of the prisoners in my shop on the Saturday week before; that was Guest and Richardson- this was on Wednesday - they came to see if I had got a pair of boots to fit them, but I had not; and Richardson was in the house on the Monday previous to the 17th - I was whitewashing and cleaning my staircase, and he came on the staircase, and I spoke to him - I have a good many lodgers; mine is a double house - he asked me if a young man named Williams was at home? I told him No; he said he wanted a pair of trousers made - Williams is a tailor - I told him Williams was never at home till after eight o'clock at night, and he said he would call on Wednesday evening - my street-door was generally on the spring-latch, for the convenience of the lodgers; a person can let himself in from the outside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you pay the rent and taxes of the house? A. Yes; a dozen of my lodgers might pass my bed-room door to go to their rooms - I locked the door at two o'clock, and at half-past four found it broken open; I cannot say whether any of my family had gone up stairs after I locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q.Might you not have locked the lock, and yet the bolt of the lock miss the catch? A.Never - I cannot swear that I turned round to see if it was fast, but when I took they key out I could tell it was fast, or the door would have fallen back - the street-door is often open - I know the parish my house is in by my tax papers - I missed some of these things when I first went into the room, but did not examine to see what was gone - I had not seen Guest, except when he came to my shop about the boots, to my knowledge - I can swear he is the man who applied for the boots, I have not the least doubt of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You said the door would fall open if not locked? A. Yes, it would fall back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Richardson. Q.Did not you say you saw me after the robbery, before you saw me at Bow-street? A. No, unless it was you that was at the corner of Drake-street, with a bundle under your arm - I will swear you are the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I thought you said you could not be certain who it was? A.He had a blue coat on at Bow-street, and I believe him to be the man I saw with the bundle under his arm in Drake-street, but cannot swear positively.</p>

            . I am the daughter of George Newport - on the 17th of April, about four o'clock, I was at tea in the back parlour; I looked into the yard through the window, and saw a man there; he was a man who I had seen come into my father's shop on the Saturday week previous; I knew him again directly - he had come on the Saturday night as near eight o'clock as possible; it was the Saturday fortnight before - it was two weeks, and part of another week; another man was with him on that night(pointing to Guest) - I am positive it was that man, I made the remark to my father the moment I saw him; he merely looked into the parlour window - the moment I went to Bow-street, I recognised Richardson as having been with him on that Saturday; about ten minutes after I saw the man in the yard my father gave an alarm of robbery, I went up stairs with my father, and found his bed-room door broken open; there were two pieces of wood broken off the door, and the lock was forced out - the lock of the box was forced, and the lid broken - there was a child's money-box in a drawer of a chest of drawers, and I found that broken and laid on the table, with the poker by the side of it; and I found my father's box emptied of the whole of its contents; and the bottom drawer, which belongs to me, but which had not been locked, was opened and emptied - I missed a cloth cloak belonging to me, a black silk frock, a boa, and, I think, a shawl was taken out of that drawer, but can't be certain which drawer it was in; it was in one of the drawers - when I first went up, I did not notice what was missed, but while my father was gone in search of the men, I examined to see what was taken away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. One of the prisoners looked through the window, was it not quite a momentary thing? A.Quite so, but I distinctly saw him, his eye was exactly fixed on mine; and the moment I saw him, I recognised him - I am positive it was Guest, he had the same coat on at Bow-street, but I speak to his face; the coat at first struck me, but the moment I looked in his face, I knew him to be the man I had seen on the Saturday night, for I had left off what I was doing that night, and took notice of them in the shop, that they should not take any thing - I think that was on the Saturday fortnight, but am not certain - I had put all my father's things away in the box on the Monday morning, and I gave him a shirt out of the box on the 17th in the morning and it was in its usual condition.</p>

            . I shall be fourteen years old on the 27th of August; I am the prosecutor's son - on the afternoon of the 17th of April - I heard the alarm of robbery; I was at tea - I went out into the street with my father - I went down several streets, and my father and I met a policeman - I then went home with my father, and was directed to go to my brother's, who lives in Rosoman-street, Clerkenwell - I saw my brother, and left him in Exmouth-street - I was then going home, and saw three men at the corner of King's-road, and Gray's-inn-lane, (it was the three prisoners) - I had seen Guest before, crossing our yard, while we were having our tea, that day - I had not seen either of the others before; when I saw the three men - I think it was Richardson who had on a great coat, which I knew to be my father's by the fur collar, and the fur being worn off at the back of the neck; I am sure one of the three had it on - Guest had a pair of trousers rolled up under his arm, and the braces hanging down - Richardson had a bundle - I can't say whether Jones had anything; because he was in the watering-house - I think Jones was first, Guest next, and Richardson last; and the last person had the great coat on - there is a stand of coaches at the bottom of King's-road - I saw a coach drive off the stand to the prisoners; they got into the coach all three of them, and the coach drove down Gray's-inn-lane - I followed it; it went to the bottom of Holborn, and then turned to the right hand - the coach was afterwards stopped; it then turned round to the left; it was then between Middle-row and Southampton-buildings - I saw a policeman, named Bolton, at the corner of Gray's-inn-lane - I said, "Can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160005"/>you take charge of three men in that coach?" he and I followed the coach, the Policeman went in front of the horses, the coachman stopped the coach directly, and then the Policeman opened the coach-door - I then saw Guest put his hand out on the other side, and open that door; Guest and Richardson jumped out on that side, and then Bolton apprehended Guest, and brought him back to the coach; and then Richardson was brought to the coach, and the coach drove to Bow-street - I went with it - Guest and Richardson, and two Policemen and I were in the coach - I don't know what had become of Jones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from them when you saw them in the King's-road? A.Across the road; it is rather wide; there were not many persons passing - the prisoners got into the coach on the same side of the way as I stood, their backs were towards me; there were no persons before them - I am sure I kept sight of the right coach, for I ran behind it, and had hold of it - when I first saw the three men, one walked before the others - one went into the watering-house - I am sure the same persons got into the coach.</p>

            . I am a Policeman; on the afternoon of the 17th of April, I saw the last witness; he gave me to understand his father had been robbed, and that the parties were in that coach, No. 558 - I went after the coach, and told the coachman to stop; it stopped directly - I opened the door, and saw the three prisoners inside - I saw in the coach a large coat with a fur collar to it, and a good deal of other property, which I have here to produce; I have had it ever since - when I opened the coach-door, the three prisoners began emptying their pockets, and seemed very much confused; one of them then opened the coach-door on the other side, and Guest jumped down first, Richardson next, and 
               <persName id="t18330516-3-person118">Jones</persName>
             the last; I caught him by the skirt of his coat, and part of it came off - they ran away down Holborn; I pursued Guest, and apprehended him in Fetter-lane - I called out for another Policeman, but none were near at the time - when I took Guest, I took him by the coat, and brought him back - I had not lost sight of him - he said he did not know any thing at all about it - when I got back to the coach, I found the property which I have here - Richardson was brought back by another man from the city, and given in charge of the city Policeman - I took Guest and Richardson to Bow-street; another Policeman was with me - the prosecutor's son went with me - when I got to Bow-street, I gave Richardson in charge of another officer, while I searched the coach for the property - I found a coat on Guest, which I marked, and have here - I searched Guest's pocket, and found a handkerchief on him, which was returned by order of the magistrate; it was his own; I also found a halfpenny on him - I searched Richardson, and found 1s. 10 1/2d. in silver and copper, and I found two body coats on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Before you took Guest, had you taken the number of the coach? A. Yes, it was No. 558 - I was quite sober when the witness spoke to me, I had not tasted any thing to drink till after I left Bow-street, at twelve o'clock - the examination was in the evening - I was not reprimanded by the magistrate for being in liquor, I was as sober as I am now, and I have had nothing to-day - I heard the magistrate make no observation, if he had I should have known it - I did not lose sight of Guest when he left the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When you opened the coach-door, were the three men getting out on the opposite side? A. No; they were in confusion emptying their pockets - I can speak to Jones as well as the others - I am certain of them all three; they got out of the coach as soon as they could empty their pockets - Jones was on the front seat of the coach - I am positive he is the man, I never expressed a doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Richardson. Q. You say, when you opened the coach, there was a coat with a fur collar? A. Yes, it laid on the cushion of the coach - you said nothing to me when I searched you; another officer searched you first.</p>

            . I am the owner and driver of a hackney-coach. On the 17th of April, in the afternoon, I was on the coach-stand in the King's-road, and was called off the stand by three persons; I drew up, and the waterman let them into the coach; they all three got in, and they had, I believe, a bundle each - I can swear to Richardson, but will not undertake to swear to the others, but believe them to be the men - I was ordered by the waterman to go to Henry-street, Portland-road; I was then on my box - I got down, went to the coach-door, and said, "Gentlemen, there is no such street as Henry-street, Portland-road;" Richardson said, "Coachman, it is Henry-street, Waterloo-road, go over Waterloo-bridge" - I went on in that direction along Gray's-inn-lane into Holborn, and turned to the right to go down Southampton-buildings, when Richardson stopped me, and asked where I was going? I said, according to his direction, over Waterloo-bridge; he ordered me to turn about, and go over Blackfriars-bridge - I turned round, and on proceeding down Holborn near Leather-lane, Bolton called to me to stop - I first saw the prosecutor's son when I was called over to take the prisoners up; he got up on the fore-wheel of my carriage as they were getting into the coach, and asked me if he could ride along with me: I had a conversation with him, and told him to get up behind the coach; I don't know whether he did or not, for I proceeded on.</p>
               <p>Richardson. Q. Did you ever see me before? A. Never to my knowledge, but you were so particular in giving me directions, and you put your head out in Holborn, and told me to go over the other bridge - I am satisfied, on my solemn oath, you are the man who gave me those directions.</p>

               <p>GEORGE NEWPORT. (Looking at the coats found on Richardson) - This coat is one I lost from the box, and this other one is mine also; (looking at the one found on Guest) - this is mine; I had two black coats, one with a velvet collar and one without - I only know them from the wear - they have been in my possession these two years; they were all kept in my clothes-box - I might have seen them about a week before; I have not worn two of them for two years, but I have seen them - here is a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, and great coat, which belong to me; here are some of my own things in my trousers-pocket, and here is the great coat which I saw on the back of the tallest of the two men, who I believe to be Jones, and this black silk waistcoat I can swear to by having burst it here - here is a silver spoon of mine, and part of a gold seal which Bolton has produced, and this medal - I had seen the seal on Sunday, but the spoon I might not have seen before; and these pearl beads belong to my daughter - this brooch belongs to me - the medal belonged to my son, it was a reward which he had at school.</p>

               <p>Jones' Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen; - I was passing along the street, and met my fellow-prisoners carrying bundles; I had had a slight public-house acquaintance with them, and I consented to carry them. It was suggested that it would be less difficult to carry the coats on our backs than in bundles, and we put them on. I soon found the situation I had placed myself in when the coach we were in was stopped, and being alarmed for my own situation, and the disgrace which my family would suffer, I consequently ran away. I knew nothing of the robbery nor should I have received the property, had I not unfortunately accidentally met my fellow-prisoners. I have witnesses to my character, and hope your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen, will consider my case mercifully.</p>

            . I live at Birmingham. On the 26th of March last, I received a letter from Mr. Dugleby; in consequence of which I gave Scattergood, my son-in-law, a 5l. note on the 28th of March, I asked him to write a few lines to Mr. Dugleby, and to enclose the 5l. note, and I gave him 1s. 6d. to pay the postage; on the Tuesday following I received information that it had not arrived - I only know the note was one I received from Goodrich, but could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note there are the letters G G on it? A. I believe this to be the note; but my eyes being so bad I can't identify it without my glasses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.You cannot say that is the note? A. No; I know it was the same note as I received from Goodrich, because I had no other.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SCATTERGOOD. I am son-in-law to Mr. Chinn. In March last I recollect he gave me a 5l. bank note to inclose in a letter to Richard Dugleby; I inclosed it on the 29th of March - I took the number and date of the note, and have them here in my own hand writing -(looking at a 5l. note) I believe this to be it, and the number and date correspond - I read the letter from Mr. Dugleby, this is it; I made the memorandum of the note which I sent on it, it was 19,743, dated October 22nd, 1832- I directed the letter sent to Mr. Dugleby with my own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160009"/>hand - I took the direction from the address given in the letter, "No. 8, Queen-street, Picton-street, George-street, London;" I now know that Mr. Dugleby lives in Camberwell; I wafered the letter, and gave it to a youth, named Thomas Green, to take to the Post-office; he was employed under me as a porter - I gave him 1s. 6d. to pay the postage; when he returned he brought me 9d. back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was that memorandum written on the letter? A. At the time I enclosed the note in the other letter - I did it in the counting-house; nobody was present at the time, but before the letter went there were two other persons there; neither of them are here - I wrote the letter, enclosed the note, wafered it directly, and put it into my pocket till I sent it to the Post-office - I am quite sure it never went out of my possession till I gave it to Thomas Green - I only know the note by the number and date corresponding; I cannot say it was not a forged note that I enclosed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How long might the letter remain in your pocket before you sent it to the office? A. About two hours and a quarter; the wafer must have been dry before it was sent to the post.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GREEN. I remember taking a letter from Mr. Scattergood to the Post-office - I don't remember who it was directed to; I took it to the Post-office with 1s. 6d.; I can't remember when it was - I heard nothing afterwards about its not arriving; I went to the Post-office and delivered it; I did not alter nor meddle with it till I delivered it at the Post-office, which is about a quarter of a mile from my place of business; I asked the postmaster how much the letter was, he said 9d.; I gave him that, and carried the 9d. back to Mr. Scattergood - I delivered it at the office twenty minutes before five.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you errand-boy to Mr. Scattergood? A. No, to Mr. Butteridge - I received the letter about half-past four - I never received one before to take for Mr. Scattergood; I did not put it down anywhere after I received it; it was looked at at the office with the usual care - I had no other letters that day - I was going to carry some goods, and went to the office at the same time.</p>

            . I am chief clerk at the Birmingham Post-office. It is my duty to make up and dispatch the letters for London; a letter put in before five o'clock in the afternoon would go to London by that night's mail - a letter bill is made up every day with the amount of the paid and unpaid letters - here is the bill for the 29th of March, the paid letters are 4l. 8s. 3d; the double postage from Birmingham to London would be 1s. 6d., a bank note would make it a double letter - the bag was sealed, and dispatched that evening under my own eyes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean that it was done by your authority? A. The letters were made up by myself, and put into the bag by myself - there is nothing in this bill to shew what each letter came to, it is only the total amount - I don't receive the letters at the window, the clerk in attendance does; I believe his name is Vaughton; he is not here - there are plenty of paid and unpaid letters for London, but in the hurry he might take the wrong postage, and charge a single for a double letter, or a double one single.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Whether you discover a note in a letter depends on the accuracy of folding or not? A. Yes, they are often folded to avoid being noticed, and it often succeeds.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear that on that day you took each letter and added the postage together to make it 4l. 8s. 3d.? A.

            . I am a charge taker of the 4th division of the carrier's office; my duty is to take the letters which come from the "blind sorter" and deliver them to the letter carriers - "blind letters" are letters with imperfect directions, and sometimes letters which have been sorted to other divisions by mistake; they come from the inland office to book, which means to go to the blind sorter - each charge we take notice of separately in the book, they are afterwards delivered to different sorters; if a sorter cannot find a direction he brings it back; for instance, if it was,"George-street, London," if he does not find the George-street in his division, it is sent to another George-street - on the 30th of March, I remember a letter for the blind sorter, directed to Queen-street, George-street, Picton-street, London; I called it out in the office as loud as I could, and nobody answered, and I put it to Great Queen-street, Westminster, I gave it to

             to carry it to Great Queen-street, Seven-dials, he returned it on the following day, the 2nd April, I then took it to the blind sorter, and transferred it into the hands of Daniel Miller, the charge taker of No. 3 division, I remember 9d. more to pay was stamped on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it part of your duty to deliver letters? A. Yes, I have a walk, I have been six years in the office - it has happened that a letter marked, more to pay, has been found to be single - there is not an entry made of every letter in the blind sorter's office, but when the direction is very bad and there is little probability of finding the person a list is posted in the hall for the public to see - there are sometimes a hundred letters sent to the blind sorter in a day, we frequently find a great number misdirected - I cannot tell the direction of all the letters, but I know this letter came into my hands from the book - I have the transfer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160010"/>book here (producing it), the address is not entered here.</p>
               <p>Q.Then what enables you to speak to this particular letter, being directed as you have said? A. It being such a very singular address, which I never heard of before, and being an extraordinary address I considered it a letter of consequence; letters are frequently marked, more to pay, but they usually have correct addresses - I was not examined at the police office, I gave the letter to Swift and to Miller with my own hands - if a carrier cannot find an address he keeps the letter three weeks, it is then entered in the return book - there are cupboards kept to lock up letters in, which cannot be found out - I cannot swear what Swift did with the letter till he returned it to me in due course.</p>

               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. It was marked 9d. more to pay, would Swift be charged with that 9d.? A. Yes, and when he returned the letter, the 9d. would be allowed in his general account.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Can you inform us whether there were any more letters received that day which would be charged 9d. more to pay? A. I cannot say, but no other came under my cognizance that morning; I can tell that from my book - it is possible that a thousand letters might pass through our division.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q.Would this letter appear in your book? A.The transfer of it from the 4th division to the 3rd would.</p>

            . I am one of the sorters of letters in the blind letter office, they are letters imperfectly directed - I remember seeing a letter in our office between the 6th and 12th of April, directed to 8, Queen-street, George-street, Picton-street, London, and 9d. more to pay marked on it, it had been out to other places before it came to me - the prisoner was in the employ of the Post-office as letter carrier, at that time to the 8th division; Northampton-square is in that division, and Charter-house-square; there is a Queen-street in that division, and that would be in the prisoner's delivery - I sorted the letter into the No. 8 division.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. From whom did you receive it? A. It came among the letters in the usual way from the 3rd division; it was brought to me at my writing table, I cannot say who by - I believe there is a Queen-street, George-street, Picton-street, in Camberwell; we should have sent it to Camberwell at first, if it had been so directed.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.How would you sort a letter for Camberwell? A. To the 2d. post delivery.</p>

            . I am charge taker to the 8th division; Northampton-square is in that division; the prisoner was the letter carrier to that district; a letter coming to my possession directed to George-street, Queen-street, Picton-street, I should sort to his delivery; Queen-street, Northampton-square, is in his delivery; I have a faint recollection of a letter coming so directed, early in April - if he received the letter and could not find the person he should have returned it to me the following morning, in order that some other Queen-street might be tried.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would the letter be given to the prisoner in the first instance? A. No, but if it came into our division it would be given to him - I do not know of it being given to Swift, I do not swear positively to the direction.</p>

             for change for a 5l. note, he got him change; he gave his name as Robinson, 29, Atfield-street, within my hearing; he received the change, and after he was gone I said something to Sutton, and was called on as a witness at Bow-street afterwards - at the time I spoke to Sutton, I knew the prisoner's name was Cox, and knew he belonged to the General Post-office - I saw him at Bow-street, and knew him again there; he is the man who gave his name as Robinson, and got change for the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at him and tell me conscientiously whether you have not a doubt of him? A. I have not a doubt, I think it was about five in the evening, it was at the bar, which is not a dark place, nor particularly light - I only had a side view of him; I have known him some years, and saw him frequently; I had seen him at different times, perhaps three or four days before, but I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear you had seen him for three or four months before? A. I think I can, there was nobody but him and the witness at the bar; I was certain at the time that his name was Cox - his asking for change did not create suspicion in my mind, I considered him a respectable man, but when he gave that address, I said to myself,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160011"/>"Bless me, that is not his name, his name is Cox;" I did not go and tell him so, as I did not know but he might be changing it for somebody else; I had not the least suspicion; I merely said as I was reading the newspaper, his name is Cox - the moment he left, I said, "Why his name is Cox, but he is a general postman, and I dare say every thing is correct;" he was not five minutes in the house; I am not mistaken in his person.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Besides his face did you notice his dress? A. I did, he had a great coat over his red Post-office coat; I communicated with Sutton directly he left, which was directly Sutton wrote his name and gave him the change - I did not know where he lived, and could not tell whether he gave a false address, or was changing it for another person.</p>

            . I am inspector of letter carriers; I produce the letter carrier's time book, in which they enter the time at which they finish the delivery of their letters; I know the prisoner's hand-writing - on the 1st of April his name was entered in his own hand-writing; it is entered every day from the 1st to the 10th for Charter-house-square delivery, which is the same as Queen-street, Northampton-square - he was in attendance on the 30th and 31st of March.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far have you searched the entries? A. I have gone from the 30th of March to the 10th of April, that is all I have referred to; I find he was there on the 11th and 12th, the entries are in his own writing - there are nine or ten more persons in that division, but he is the only one who would deliver in the Charter-house-square district - the seat which we call a division has nine or ten more persons; if a carrier was unwell and another took his place, the substitute's name would appear instead of his.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Explain, is there more than one person to the Charter-house-square district? A. No, several belong to the division, but only one to the district; the prisoner having signed the book proves he was on duty on those days.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. There is one book which has not been produced of great importance to me, that is the "cart book" - Fuller states I was in the public-house between four and five in the afternoon; I left home at three in the afternoon, and called at my brother's in Holland-street, Blackfriars-road, then proceeded over Blackfriars-bridge, on my way to Tottenham-court-road; I had no red coat on then, but the dress I have now; I might have had my great coat, but I am not certain; I do not wear a great coat one time out of twenty, either morning, afternoon, or evening - I have turned out at five in the morning in all weathers, and left home without a great coat, because I knew what I had to go through, I knew the fatigue of my office - Fuller has spoken very false in saying I was there at five in the afternoon, I had to leave home at three and go to Tottenham-court-road, and be at the office by four, at which time the mail cart left there to proceed round the west end of the town, and be back at the post office at five; and after delivering my bag in by the mail cart I used to go to Charter-house-square, and ring my bell from five to six, and if I was called on duty by the inspector, I had to stop till eight - Fuller is a false man, and why has he come here, because a few years ago his own sister robbed my father of six silver spoons and my father never prosecuted her, and now he comes here to-day to swear to injure my family - now, my Lord, I delivered six years and a half in Russell-square walk every day to Mr.

On the night of the 18th of April, I went to bed about ten o'clock; the house was safely shut up - early the next morning I was awakened by the Policeman knocking at the door, I came down, and found the kitchen-window had been broken open, the shutters were forced, and two panes of glass were broken, which would enable a person to put their hand in to open the casement; there are iron bars, but they are wide enough to admit a small person through them - I went to the Police-station, and saw the articles mentioned in the indictment; I then missed them - I had not missed them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Who fastened the house up? A. I expect my daughter did; she is not here- this window was fastened before we went to-bed; I had seen it fast perhaps half an hour before we went to bed - I am married - my son was at home, and in bed before me - I did not see him in his room, but he was ill, and had some gruel, and went to bed half an hour before me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Upon the solemn oath you have taken, were you not in your father's house with this girl? A. Never; I did not get her through the kitchen-window that night - I had never seen her in my life - I never took any female of this sort to my father's house in my life - I did not give the prisoner 6s. - I never saw her in my life to my knowledge - when I got home that night, I went down stairs, and had some gruel, and went to bed at half-past nine - I did not get up till I was called by my parents the next morning - my brother-in-law, and my five sisters, were in the house - I have no brother - I was subpoened here by the solicitor for the prisoner - there is only one lodger in the house, which is a female.</p>

            . I was employed to watch some premises opposite the prosecutor's house - at an early hour in the morning of the 19th of April, I was standing opposite the prosecutor's house, and saw the prisoner come out of his kitchen-window with a parcel of things; she stood some time, and then came towards the door, and as she came she made some answer, as if she was speaking to some person in the kitchen - I crossed the road towards her - she concealed the parcel under her cloak - I could not see what it was - she went on, and turned down a court; I went and brought her up with the assistance of the private watchman, and gave her to the Police.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see any person put a bundle through the bars? A. No; I think the prisoner saw me - it was a few minutes before four o'clock - I did not see any man near there.</p>

            . (Police-constable K 72.) I was on duty at Stepney-green on the morning in question - the last witness gave the prisoner to me, and this bundle - I took her to the Station-house, and then went to the house - I saw two panes of glass broken, which would admit a hand to open the window - I cannot say how the glass had been broken, or how the window had been opened, it was open.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE to ITHIEL PRICE. Q. Were there inside shutters to your kitchen window? A. Yes, which were fastened with a bolt at the bottom - the casement opens outside, and fastens with a turn buckle - there are some upright iron bars, which are rather too wide to prevent a small person from getting through - there was a bolt at the bottom of the shutter, which bolted into the cill, and that bolt was forced off.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it such a bolt as it was possible for such a person as the prisoner to force off? A. I think she could - I never saw the prisoner before - I was at the Station-house; my son came there immediately after me - she made no remark of what the learned counsel has suggested- she said before the magistrate, when he asked her what sort of a man it was who took her into the house? that it was a good-looking middle-aged man, and she then had 6s. but the Policeman had searched her at the Station-house, and she had no money there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much intoxicated, and in going down Mile End-road, a man stopped me close by this place, and took me into this house; he put some rubbish down for me to lay down on, and gave me 6s.; I had not put the 6s. in my purse, but between my stays and my bosom; the Policeman did not find it; but before I went to the magistrate the officer asked me if I had the money, and I showed it to him.</p>
               <p>COURT to ITHIEL PRICE. Q. Was any other man in the house? A. Only my son-in-law, who is here.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What state was the fastening in inside the shutter? A. There was a small bolt in a very good state- I think a girl like the prisoner could have pushed it in with her foot while she was in the area, the bolt was not of that strength which it ought to be.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had the bolt been put on with screws? A. No, it was an old bolt nailed on - I found the bolt, it appeared as if a person had shoved against it, the cill had given way a little, and the bolt had come off; but I had always trusted to the iron bars; the area is two feet six, or three feet wide.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what state did you find the kitchen-door that opens into the passage? A. That was bolted in the morning, no one had passed through there.</p>

             had hold of the tails of his coat, one tail in each hand, he (Cooper) was stooping; Davis was trying to get out of the stable; they were in the stable, and the door of the stable was open; Davis succeeded in getting away, and left the tails of his coat in the hands of the deceased; Cooper then fell on his right side- my window is about eighteen yards from the stable - I could see as I stood there a little blood on Cooper's smockfrock - when Davis got away my husband went down stairs- Cooper looked up at me while Davis was making away towards Bloomsbury-court, and made an exclamation - I can't say whether the exclamation was loud enough for the prisoner to hear, I heard it from my window - Davis was about as far from him as I was - I heard it quite distinctly, he said, "O God! George has shot me" - I went down to Cooper to the stable-door - I saw him last Sunday at his own house in 37, Brownlow-street, Holborn, dead - I am certain he is the same man as I saw in the stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Your window is eighteen yards from the stable? A. Yes, as near as I can tell - had heard no quarrel, nor any noise, before I heard the report - I had been at the window about five minutes before, but was not there when I heard the report; I went to the window when I heard it - they were in the stable, I could see distinctly into the stable, they were about the corn-bin, dragging towards the door - I saw John Burrows come out, he was there at the time - I have seen Cooper day after day, living in the neighbourhood for three years - I am certain I afterward saw the same man at Brownlow-street - I had been to the window, and asked Cooper what was o'clock; it was half-past five when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a stick in his hand when you saw him in the stable? A. I never saw him with one - at the time he made the exclamation, the prisoner was going to make his way down Bloomsbury-court; he had not turned the corner, he had got across the road - I knew the prisoner by sight before - I did not observe his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Your reason for saying he is the man then, is from seeing the skirts of his coat torn? A. Yes, and I knew him well before.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You saw the deceased go into the stable about half-past five, he had no stick then? A. No; I had seen the prisoner go into the stable that morning; I saw his face then, and saw him endeavouring to get from the person who was holding the skirts of his coat, and am perfectly certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. On the morning of the 2nd of May, I remember hearing the report of a pistol; I was up stairs in my room with the window open - my wife was at the window; immedilately after hearing the report I heard an exclamation twice over, "Oh Lord, Oh God, George has shot me!" I went to the window (it was while I was at the window I heard him cry out) - I saw the prisoner run out of the stable-door into the street, wanting to make his escape; I opened my loft-door and looked out, and saw him running away with the pistol in his hand - I went down to Cooper's assistance, and went for a doctor, and when I was at Mr. Ireland's, the doctor's door, I saw the policemen bringing the prisoner back; that was 600 or 700 yards from the stable in Hart-street; I observed the skirts of his coat were torn off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. Yes; I have lived opposite for two years and a half; and I knew Cooper before - I did not hear the least noise or words before I heard the report - I saw no stick in the deceased's hands when I came out, nor did I see a stick near the door.</p>

            . On the 2nd of May, I was in the service of the prisoner's father. His father had told me to come to work that morning - I sleep in the stables - I was cleaning the horses about half-past five that morning; the deceased came to the stable at the same time, which was his usual hour - I did not see the prisoner about at that time, but about five or ten minutes after the deceased came in, the prisoner came in and was standing against the corn-bin - the prisoner said to me how long have you been up? I said I had just got up; he said it only wanted a quarter to six; the deceased made answer, "it wants half an hour to it yet, Sir:" and that was all that passed between them - Cooper stooped down to lace up his boot, and the prisoner took and fired at him immediately as he was stooping to lace up his boot - I did not see the pistol till after he had shot him - I was in the same stable as they were - Cooper had no stick when he came in; he used no stick at all at any time - he did not attempt to strike the prisoner with anything - he was in the act of stooping to lace his boot - when I heard the report I turned round immediately, and saw the prisoner running out of the stable-door with the pistol in his hand - the deceased had hold of the tails of his coat; he dragged the deceased to the stable-door - the door is about twenty yards, as near as possible, from the spot I first saw them at - when I turned round on hearing the report, the deceased had not hold of the skirts of his coat, he was going to run away, and then the deceased took hold of the tail of his coat; he dragged the deceased to the stable-door - the prisoner got away, leaving the tails of his coat in the deceased's hands - I heard the deceased say, "Oh Lord!" putting his hand to his left arm; I could not see whether he was wounded - Mr. and Mrs. Ward were the first that came over; Mr. Ward was the first - the deceased was lying outside the stable, just by the stable-door - the prisoner was brought back in about two minutes by two policemen - the deceased was immediately taken to the hospital - I went before the Coroner's Inquest and saw the body of the deceased; it was the same man as I had seen in the stable; he was wounded in his left thigh; the inquest was held at the Middlesex hospital.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in the stable when the deceased came first in the morning? A. Yes; I was cleaning a horse at the time the prisoner came in; he placed himself at the corn-bin; which is about a yard from where I was - I was engaged at the stall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse and the stall between you and the party? A. Yes; there was no conversation between the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160014"/>prisoner and deceased as to whether he was not too late; he said it was a quarter to six, and the deceased said to me, it wants half an hour to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the deceased doing anything to the prisoner? A. No; I saw no scuffle at all - I heard the report of the pistol and came out of the stall.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether the pistol went off by accident? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. If there had been any scuffling or any stick used, must you have observed it? A. Yes; there was no stick used, nor any scuffling.</p>

            . My husband's name was Thomas, he was in the service of Mr. Davis, a carman in Silver-street, Bloomsbury. I saw him on the morning of the 2nd of May, before he went to work; he was quite in good health- I did not see him again till between four and five in the afternoon; he was then at the Middlesex hospital; he was wounded at that time - they told me he was likely to recover, and that he would do well, and would be out in a fortnight's time - I saw him for the last time on Tuesday, the 7th; I was with him there all day; he was very lightheaded and quite insensible then; he knew nobody - the last time I saw him when he was sensible, was on Sunday, the 5th; he was then much worse than on the Friday before when I was there; and he said he was sure he should not recover - he said, the prisoner had said he would do for him, and he had done for him; he said George Davis had shot him - Davis was then in custody - my husband said this after he should not recover.</p>

             (policeman E 97). I knew the prisoner before this - on the 2d of May, between five and six o'clock, I was in Holborn, between Lion-street and Bloomsbury-court - I was about two hundred yards from the prisoner's father's stable, and heard the report of fire-arms; it seemed to come from Silver-street, from the stables - I proceeded to the corner of Lion-street, and on turning round I saw the prisoner running from his father's stable- I did not observe anything in his hand - I ran into Holborn and saw the prisoner cross Holborn; I went right against him, and caught hold of his hand and took him into custody; I did not then know what had occurred - I brought him back to the stable, and saw the deceased lying on his right side, a little within the stable-door - when I took the prisoner, I said, George, what have you done? he said, "I have done nothing;" that was when I first came up to him; I searched him on the spot, and found a pistol under his left arm; I took him back to the stable, and then, for the first time, saw Cooper lying in the stable-door - I saw his left arm apparently black and burnt with powder - the pistol was not loaded; I looked at the pan; the flint was down, and it had been recently discharged - the pistol was under his left arm, in the inside of his coat - I did not notice the deceased's leftthigh until he was taken to the hospital - when I brought the prisoner back, I stooped down and said to the deceased, loud enough for the prisoner to hear, Thomas, what is the matter? (I did not see any blod at all) he said, "George has shot me, I give him in charge:" I afterwards took the prisoner to the station-house in George-street, Bloomsbury, and searched him further, and found two leaden bullets in his right-hand trousers pocket - I found nothing else - nobody else searched him in my presence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you got the tail of the coat? A. No, I have seen a powder-flask in possession of Driver, another constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I see this pistol is in very bad condition, it is impossible to keep it at the full cock? A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it very likely to go off by accident? A. You cannot keep it back at full cock; I had known the deceased for the last eight months - when I took the prisoner he looked very wild; I have on many occasions observed something extraordinary in his manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed circumstances so extraordinary as to induce you to give information to his father? A. Yes, I have done so, on two occasions.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you previously seen him go about the street with a brace of pistols in his hand? A. Never with a brace - he had a pistol, but it was out of repair - there was no hammer to it - I once saw him dressed in a long cap - three or four months before this it was a cocked hat- I have not seen him about the streets with different figures on his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the cocked hat, did you consider him a person of sane mind? A. No; I consider he very often acted like a madman when he got beer - I cannot say but that when I have seen him in his sober moments he always conducted himself well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether for some time after he has been in a state of intoxication his conduct was that of a man of sound or unsound mind? A. He always avoided me when he was sober - on this morning his manner appeared quite wild - it was about half-past five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were induced to make a communication to his father, was he drunk or sober? A. He neither appeared drunk nor sober, he had been drinking - his conduct was so extraordinary then as to induce me to make a communication to his father.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He then appeared neither drunk nor sober, but as if he had been drinking? A. Yes, he was in the habit of drinking at times - sometimes to excessbut I never saw him rolling drunk - I have seen him in a kind of stupid drunken way, he could walk very well; when he had the cocked hat on he appeared to me more drunk than I had ever seen him before - on the morning in question, he did not appear to be drunk nor sober; he appeared as if he had been drinking, a sort of stale drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, as if part of the debauch had left him and he was recovering himself? A. Yes, apparently - I never saw him conduct himself different to other persons when he was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when sober did he appear to you a man who knew right from wrong? A. He appeared so, but I never had much conversation with him when sober - all the observations I made on his conduct as extraordinary were on occasions when he was either drunk or had been drinking - this pistol will go off at half cock - (trying it); it requires the trigger to be pulled - it will not go off of itself - when I took it from him the pan was entirely down - if I let go of the cock at full cock without meddling with the trigger, it will go to half cock, but only to that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160015"/>- that would not discharge the pistol - but if I put my finger to the trigger at half or at full cock, it will go off.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. A pistol made property will never go off at half cock? A. No; but this can be fired at half cock.</p>


               <p>ROBERT DRIVER. I am a policeman. I produce a powder-flask which I found in a coat pocket which I got from the deceased; it was the tail of the coat - he gave it to me about ten minutes before six, before he was taken to the Middlesex Hospital - I also produce the other part of the coat which I took off the prisoner at Hatton-garden the same day; the tails agree with the top of the coat and have formed part of it.</p>

            . I am the house-surgeon of the Middlesex Hospital. On the morning of Thursday, the 2nd of May, the deceased was brought to the hospital about half-past six - I examined him a short time afterwards, and found a gun-shot wound on the left thigh, and the upper left arm slightly grazed, apparently by the same ball; it was the interior part of the upper arm, which was quite a superficial wound, not of any serious consequence - the wound in the thigh had penetrated the skin and muscles by the lower part of the upper third of the thigh - the ball had struck against the bone, and pursued its course up the thigh immediately in contact with the bone; the ball remained in the thigh - the grazing in the arm must have been from the ball first striking the arm and penetrating the thigh; if the man was lacing up his boot or shoe that might happen - I did not at first consider it a dangerous wound; it was attended with a certain degree of danger, but I thought he would ultimately recover - a gun-shot wound is very likely to bring on erysipelas; the contused wounds are peculiarly likely to be followed by erysipelas - he went on tolerably well until the Saturday, and then he had an attack of erysipelas, which I should imagine was produced by the wound he had received by the ball; he died on Wednesday morning, the 8th of May - the erysipelas was undoubtedly the cause of his death - the ball was extracted from the thigh the same morning - I discovered nothing at that time that led me to suppose he would be attacked with erysipelas except the gun-shot wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many years have you been in the profession? A. Five; the situation of house-surgeon of the hospital is frequently held by students - I have not seen many cases of gun-shot wounds - erysipelas was certainly the approximate cause of his death - he died of erysipelas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time discover any thing to induce you to think he was a person likely to be attacked with erysipelas? A. I did discover appearances which would be likely to produce erysipelas - I have seen a great many cases of erysipelas; it is a complaint, the external appearances of which, frequently come on suddenly, the subject being previously pre-disposed to such a complaint, and when it does appear, death has followed in as short a time as it did with the deceased when there has been no wound.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether, at the post mortem examination, from the constitutional appearances you observed, might not death have happened from erysipelas, and that erysipelas arise independent of the gun-shot wound? A. Certainly, it might; but I cannot say it did.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. In your judgment, was it in this case produced by the constitutional causes you observed, or by the gun-shot wound? A. It was produced by the gun-shot wound; but I should say the man was pre-disposed for it, from the chronic disease which I found on the post mortem examination - in the state of chronic disease I found him, he would be more likely to be attacked with erysipelas if he received a gun-shot wound than without it; erysipelas would be more likely to follow a gun-shot wound with a person so situated than one in good health - the appearances I disovered after death, warranted the conclusion that he would be a likely subject for erysipelas, and more likely to be attacked with it if wounded than another man.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Is there anything to show a medical man when death arises from erysipelas alone, or when it has been produced by a gun-shot wound? A. I have never been able to distinguish - I have seen but very few gun-shot wounds.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the chronic disorder you discovered from which erysipelas might be called into action? A. He had chronic inflammation of the lining membrane of the air tubes - he had a disease of the valves of the heart on the left side, and of those immediately at the commencement of the large artery leading from the heart - one of the membranes of the brain presented also an unhealthy appearance; this last I believe is frequently caused by the agonies of death - that is all I observed.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing the wound had not taken place, were there any appearances from which you should have said the death would have originated? A. Not at the precise time at which it took place - not in so quick time certainly.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PRING (policeman). I went to the spot between half-past five and twenty minutes to six, with Cayford - I saw Cayford come up to the prisoner, and take the pistol from him; I assisted in taking him to the stable- I saw the deceased.</p>

I did, and named it to his father; the last time I had occasion to communicate anything to his father was about three days before the 2nd of May - I recollect the prisoner coming into the work-shop of Mr. Paliser, a harness-maker, in Finsbury-pavement, about three weeks ago from this time; there were two men at work there - I observed his paleness and a wildness about his eye which made me mention it to the shopmen.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way had he come into the shop? A. When he came in he said, "Halloo Harry," in a friendly way, holding out his hand - I said, "Halloo George, who should have thought of seeing you here" - he said, he had left his father - I said I was sorry to hear it; and said "Never mind, George, we will go and have a drop of beer;" we went together and had two pints of half-and-half, and he told me he was going to shoot himself.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. At this time was he working with his father, and living with him? A. He had been, but it appears he left him that morning - I don't know how soon he went back again; I have not been to the beer-shop with him lately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed the paleness, and wildness in conversation, was he drunk? A. I cannot say he was drunk; I should say he was sober - I cannot say he had not been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know he is a dissipated young man? A. I know he will drink - I never heard that he was a dissipated character.</p>
               <p>Q.Constantly intoxicated? A. I don't know that he was constantly intoxicated; I believe he has been so frequently lately.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe anything extraordinary or wild in his conduct or features till he began to drink? A. I don't know that I have.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You have observed the wild appearance and manner about him at the time he was sober? A. I think I have.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Forward, who works for Mr. Fender of Holborn. I have known the prisoner seven or eight years - I have observed a difference in his conduct within the last month, and consider his conduct that of a man of unsound mind - I remember his coming to my house; I think it was three weeks or a month ago, and he seemed not to be in a sound of mind at all; he said he was going to make away with himself; he seemed to me in a very queer state of mind - he did not attempt to do anything that night, but a night or two afterward he called and appeared strange; he took up my husband's razor and said he would go and make away with himself - I and my husband took it from him by force - about a week after this he had a tidy velveteen jacket but not a new one, and he parted with it for an old tattered one and fancied himself a sailor.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you frequent opportunities of seeing his conduct and behaviour? A. Yes, I lodge over the stable where the man was shot - he was not in the habit of drinking that I know of; I never saw him - I never knew him in the habit of drinking - I saw him very often when he has been at work for his father; he has left his father's employ about ten days; they were not on good terms.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath has not his father refused to see him in consequence of his dissipated and drunken habits, and don't you know it? I know he seemed in an insane state of mind - I never heard that he was dismissed his father's employ in consequence of dissipated and drunken habits.</p>
               <p>Q. About three weeks ago he took up a razor and said he would kill himself, is that what induced you to think he was of unsound mind? A. Yes; he was working for his father at that time - I did not communicate this to his father at that time - I told my husband, George could not be sound in his mind - I did not communicate my opinion to his father till after the man was shot; his father let him go about the street and do his work as usual - I thought he could not be sound in mind, because he talked of destroying himself or shooting himself - I never saw him attempt to destroy himself; I only speak from what I have heard him say - I don't know whether he had quarrelled with his father at those times - I suppose they had been quarrelling, he looked in a strange state of mind.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him drunk in your life? A. I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, the last time you saw him before he was taken up, was he not drunk? A. He was very strange to me; I do not know whether he was drunk or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell whether he was drunk on any other occasion when you say he looked strange and seemed wild? A. I do not know; I have not seen his father to-day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen him employed by his father just before this happened? A. Not for ten days; till then he was working for his father and keeping the accounts.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. I have known the prisoner between seven and eight years - I have worked with him for his father - I first observed a difference in his conduct about a month or six weeks ago- I frequently saw him at my house; he always looked wild.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed this wild appearance when you have known him to be sober? A. Yes, I have; I was going to shave myself in my apartment, and took the razor from him - he got it to destroy himself; I took it from him, and told him if he wanted a razor to go home to his father and get his father's - I was present when a jacket was disposed of, it was not a very good one nor very old - he parted with it for a ragged one and said he was a sailor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160017"/>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing whether he was sound or unsound in mind? A.Unsound mind.</p>
               <p>CLARKSON. Q. When did you first observe this unsoundness of mind? A. In my apartment; I told him if he wanted to destroy himself, to get his father's razor and not mine - I don't know whether his father has a razor; I am neither barber nor clerk; I don't know whether the prisoner shaves himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you went to his father and told him his son was of unsound mind? A. I saw him to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. And told him to get his father's razor if he wanted to cut his throat? A. Of course - I did not tell his father he was unsound in mind, and unfit to keep his accounts - I told him nothing of this till after the prisoner was charged with this offence; his father lives at No. 40, Museum-street; I lodge over the stable - I saw his father sometimes twenty or thirty times a day - I have not worked for him for the last four years - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing the prisoner's conduct during the last three weeks or a month; I saw him at the stable every day - I have seen him driving a cart, and about his usual occupation, but still he looked wild - I have drank with him; the last time was four or five days before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was he not in the constant habit of getting drunk? A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you seen him drunk often? A. I cannot say anything about it; I never saw a drunken man unless he could neither stand nor walk.</p>

I am the housekeeper; on the night of the 21st of April I retired to bed about eleven o'clock, after seeing my house secure, and about one o'clock in the morning I was awoke by the police, who told me some persons were in the house - I got up, and after a good deal of search, we found the prisoner concealed in the coal-hole; there was two policemen with me - the coal-hole is in the house; he was taken by the policeman and searched - he was brought out of the coalhole - I looked at the coal-hole where he had been concealed, and found a dark lantern, an ash-stick with a piece of lead at the end of it, a case-knife, and various other things - there was a phosphorus-box, a screw-driver, and chisel - I neither threatened nor made him any promise - I have known him for some time; and I asked him the reason why he broke into my house - he told me he was in want of victuals, that he was in a state of starvation, and victuals he must have, and if he was not satisfied down stairs, he should have made his way up, and ransacked the house, or words to that effect; he said he knew every room in my house as well as I did myself - I afterwards examined to see where he could have got in, and found the flap of the cellar forced open by means of a small crow-bar - the cellar broken into joins the house I now reside in; it is part of my house, but being large, I had made it into two houses by a party wall - they are both occupied by myself at present, and the cellar part has never been divided - the cellar is under the house - there are two cellars; one I occupy as a beer and wine-cellar, and the other for coals and lumber - but the cellar has never been divided; it is a vault - there is a communication from my house to the cellar by a staircase.</p>

               <p>Q. Does one cellar open into the other? A. I keep my spirit-cellar locked - there is a door to the spiritcellar - the flap of the cellar that was broken was nailed down, because I had no use for it - I found it broken open by a crow-bar; the person could then get to my house by means of the staircase - the flap was fast and secure at eleven o'clock at night, I saw it then fast for I stood on it- the prisoner was in my house that evening till about eleven o'clock, or it might be a few minutes later, but it was after I had seen the flap fastened; he wished my wife and niece good night, and left the house - he only lives ten doors from me - I did not myself see him go out of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You know there is no fastening to the flap, it is only laid down as a loose board; where you go in and take up coals, there is neither lock, chain, nor bolt? A. It had been nailed down, and had been so for two or three months, till he broke it open, and it is nailed down now - I used to have occasion to go to it for a quantity of coals once, but I always fastened it down again; I used to take out sufficient coals for a week, and then nailed it down again - I have sometimes taken sufficient for a month, and on this night, at eleven o'clock, it was nailed down and fastened as usual - I told the prisoner he was the last man I should have thought would have done this.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I wanted something to eat being out of work four months, and something to satisfy hunger was what I wanted.</p>
               <p>Witness. I told him I had always been exceeding kind to him, and if he had asked for any thing he should have had it; he said if he was not satisfied down stairs he would have gone up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Does the flap fall downwards, or do you lift it up? A. I lift it up; it is flat with the pavement - I did not pull it to see if it was fastened, but I was standing on it, and found it as usual - it rests on a groove - I must lift it up to enter from the street; I don't recollect how many nails I put into it - I think there was two on each side; they were large nails, about two inches long.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see any nail in it, you had not fastened it that night? A. No; nor perhaps for a week, or a month; the nails might have been drawn out before for what I know; if it was frequently open it would injure it certainly - I had not wanted to go to it for two months; but previous to that I went to it once a month, or perhaps oftener - it was dark at the time the prisoner was found, it was one o'clock in the morning, and it was quite dark at eleven - the flap is made of two-inch stuff-there is no ring to lift it with.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. How could you get your hands in to raise it? A.

I was on duty with Davies, on the 21st of April - I went to Grady's house, at one o'clock in the morning - I had observed the cellar-flap at twelve o'clock; it was fastened down then - I did not try it, but Davies did, he carried a lantorn and he tried it; we always try all the fastenings when we come on duty - he and I went together again at one o'clock, and perceived the flap of the cellar had been moved - we opened it and went in; we went up on the ground floor of the house and called Mr. Grady - he came down stairs, and we went down into the cellar with him, he was not satisfied that all was right, and I was placed outside on the flap, while they searched inside, and when they had taken the prisoner, I was called in at the front door - I said it would be better for him to confess - I put the question to him myself; I asked what he meant to do?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him, or hear any body tell him it would be better for him to confess what he had done? A. I did not hear them, but after Grady and Davis went up stairs, I had him in custody, and said to him, "What do you mean to do, what brought you here?" he said, "I am in distress," and I said he had better confess; nobody was present then, it was after Grady and Davis had spoken to him; they had given him into my custody while they went up to search the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You say you stood outside while Davies came in doors? A. Yes, we both went in together; and I went out again afterwards.</p>

             re-examined. I did not hear Murphy tell the prisoner he had better confess, I said nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRADY. I said nothing of the kind to him, nor did I hear Murphy say so; the conversation we had with him was while Murphy was outside; it was before Murphy came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All I have to say is I was out of employ, I had no money, all I wanted was something to eat; but as to the flap being fastened down there was no fastening, and if I recollect Grady said, it had not been opened for a month; but I am sure I have fetched coals out of it, for he retails coals, and on the Sunday before I had a quarter of a cwt. myself from his own bar.</p>

            . I have nailed the flap of this cellar down for Mr. Grady since this happened, I cannot say that I saw whether any nails had been in it before, I did not see any fastening, but as to nails, I cannot say whether there had been any or not, I did not see either lock, chain, or fastening.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you nailed it down, you saw no nails? A. I did not, I have been brought up a carpenter; I got the nails myself to nail it down, between six and seven in the evening of the day this happened - I used 20d. nails; I did not lift the flap up to see if it had been nailed before or not, I fastened it to the wooden curb.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If it had been nailed before you would have seen the nail holes? A. I did not perceive any; the neighbours have been served with coals from the cellar, I know, at one time, but whether that was done up to that time, I cannot say - I live within a few doors of Grady.</p>
               <p>Q. How often in the course of a week do you suppose the flap has been opened to sell coals from? A. It has been opened in the course of a week, but I don't know how many times - it was opened daily; I think it has been opened six times in a week; I did not see any mark on the flap as if it had been opened by an instrument.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it used at this time to supply the neighbourhood with coals? A. Not at that time, I dont think it was; it might have been three weeks before.</p>
               <p>JURY to JAMES GRADY. Q. Had the prisoner been drinking in your house the night you found him in the cellar? A. He had; I cannot say he could be very sober when he left, but he did not appear intoxicated when he was taken, but from the quantity he had taken I should not have expected that he would have been sober - I keep no lodgers; I did not see him go away, and cannot say whether he was tipsy - I never gave him permission to sleep in my house; he was never in my employ; I have known him four or five years, and never knew any harm of him; I would have trusted him any where in my house; he said he knew every part of my house as well as me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160019"/>I asked how he came to know it, as I never knew him beyond the bar - this crow-bar or large chisel was found with the things.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM DAVIES re-examined. I observed a mark on the cellar flap, that night - we both went into the house together at first, and as soon as Grady came down, my brother officer was sent out - I examined the flap afterwards, but did not find any nails in it; part of the curb was broken; I saw no nails there; it appeared to have been broken from raising the flap up - I do not know how it is usually raised, unless it is done from the inside, but on this occasion it appeared to have been raised from the outside, as part was broken, and the wood looked fresh where it appeared to have been broken, the splinters were fresh.</p>
               <p>JAMES GRADY re-examined. I blamed the policemen for coming into my house together, because I have reason to believe that two persons escaped while the policemen were in the house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you usually raise the flap from the inside or outside? A.Sometimes one way and sometimes the other - if I cannot open it inside I do it outside, there is no bolt or fastening except the nails.</p>
               <p>GUILTY of entering at the trap-door by lifting it up, but not of breaking the nails.</p>

            . I am a plumber; I was going through Cheapside, and saw the prosecutor in company with a gentleman in the Old Jewry; they turned down the Old Jewry, I saw the prisoner following them, and half way down Old Jewry I saw the prisoner lift up the prosecutor's pocket, take the handkerchief out and put it in his trousers pocket and run away - I ran after him, and overtook him in Coleman-street, I gave him in charge of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160020"/>watchman, who held him while I went and informed Mr. Preston; and when the watchman began to search the prisoner I saw him drop the handkerchief between his legs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.You say you saw me take it out of the gentleman's pocket, did you not ask him if he had lost a handkerchief? A. Yes, I ran after you, and took you before I spoke to the gentleman, I said "You have lost a handkerchief, sir."</p>

               <p>ALFRED COPELAND. I live at the King's-head, Fenchurch-street. This happened on the 16th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night - I was rather tipsy - I recollect having my watch safe in Leadenhall-street going home - I was in company with two women at a public-house in Leadenhall-street, but I cannot swear to them; they walked with me from by Whitechapel-church, and from there to a public-house in Leadenhall-street, but I cannot say that I can swear to them - I never have sworn to them.</p>
               <p>Q.(Handing him his deposition). Is this your handwriting? A. I signed a paper at the Mansion-house - I think it was read over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not asked if the contents of the paper were true? A. I might have dropped the watch myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't be guilty of prevarication, or if you do the Court have a way of dealing with such persons - were you not asked if the contents of your deposition were true? A. There was so much noise at the time I could hardly hear what was read over - I was sworn to speak the truth; I don't know what the deposition contains, and cannot say I ever did; it was read over in a hurried way, but I cannot say I knew what was in it - my watch was produced at the Mansion-house the morning after I missed it - it was my watch I am sure, I picked it up and looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how you lost it you cannot tell? A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear that positively? A. I cannot very well; the name

               <p>WILLIAM SMITH. I am watchman of Aldgate-ward. I was on my beat in Fenchurch-street on the night in question, and saw the prosecutor pass in Fenchurch-buildings, which is opposite Church-row, and saw the two prisoners - I followed them, and heard a bit of a scuffle - I heard the prosecutor say to the two prisoners, "Give me my watch" - I cannot say what they said further than that they had not got it - I saw the elder prisoner pass her hand behind her, and as it appeared to me give the youngest something, but what I could not tell; I instantly saw the youngest stoop, as if in the act of dropping something; one of my mates came up, and took hold of one of them - I stooped and picked up a paper, and in it was this watch; it was within a yard of each of the prisoners - I am sure the prosecutor addressed the two women and said, "Give me my watch" - I had not seen him come out of the public-house with them - they were taken immediately - the prosecutor appeared before the Lord Mayor the next day and the day after - I was present when he gave his evidence; I believe what he said was taken down and read over to him, but I should not like to take my oath of it - he did not express any doubt about their being the persons he had been with, and who had taken his watch.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PLAISTOWE, JUN. I produce the watch, I found it in the watch-house when I came from the Compter - Smith delivered it to me at the watch-house - I attended at the Mansion-house, and saw the prosecutor there, and heard his evidence; it was taken down, and read over to him, and he swore to it; he claimed the watch - he said at the watch-house that he had been in company with the women, but he did not wish it to go any further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at the watch-house impute to them the stealing his watch? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. I think I understand you, that at the time you lost your watch, the prisoner was the only person by you? A. Yes; the persons who ran on my giving the alarm ran about him or after him - I did not observe that he had any companion - while I was calling "stop thief" several persons ran calling"stop thief" also - it did not take him a moment to get my watch - he was taken in two or three minutes at the corner of Finch-lane - I did not lose sight of him - I cannot say what he might have done with the watch while he was running - I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

I am a patrol - I heard the cry of"stop thief" in Finch-lane, and met the prisoner running, and several more within three or four yards of him - I laid hold of him; the prosecutor immediately said that was the man who had robbed him of his watch - I took him to the watch-house; he denied the charge, and said something in the watch-house about his having come in a Paddington omnibus about seven o'clock that evening - the prosecutor was within sight of him when I heard the alarm.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.What did he say about the omnibus? A. He did not say it to me, but to the inspector; he said he had only just got out of the omnibus, and that he left Paddington at quarter-after seven, that he got into the omnibus at a quarter-past seven to come to London- he went quietly with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Monday week my brother, who lives at Paddington, asked me to come to his house, which I did; I left home about six to be there by seven, and got there about seven; I stopped there a little while, and about half-past seven took the omnibus - I told the man who rides behind, to drive quick; there was a stoppage in Newgate-street, and when I came to where the omnibus stops, I got out and ran; hearing a cry of stop thief, and seeing a mob running, I would not run that way, but ran the other way; the watchman caught hold of me and took me to the watch-house - the gentleman said I took his watch; I can prove I never did such a thing in my life.</p>

On Monday evening, the 6th of May, the prisoner (who is my brother) came to my house between four and five o'clock, he stopped from half-past six to seven, or it might be a quarter-past seven; he left me intending to take an omnibus; it would take him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to go from my house to where the omnibuses start from.</p>

            . I am conductor of Mr. Bird's omnibus; I ride behind. On Monday evening, the 6th of May, I took the prisoner up between Marylebone-lane and Bond-street, a little before eight, and took him to the corner of Threadneedle-street, opposite Princes-street - we are generally there about the half-hour, or a little before, as our regular time to start is three minutes after the half-hour - when I took him up he said he was rather late, and ought to be home before that time; and when I sat him down, he paid me, he said he was behind time, and ran off from the omnibus up towards Threadneedle-street; he went into Threadneedle-street - I can't say whether I saw him pass Bartholemew-lane, but I saw him to the lane - he has rode with me several times before.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he say anything to you about driving fast? A. He said, when he got out, that he was behind time; he sat off running the moment he left the omnibus, straight up Threadneedle-street; he ran along Threadneedle-street as if to go to Bishopsgate-street - I heard no cry of stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q.It is ten days ago, are you sure you remember the prisoner from the circumstances? A. Yes; I don't know where he lived.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Do you know any of the other passengers? A. Yes; the regular gentlemen who I carry every evening - I believe the prisoner lives somewhere Whitechapel way, but I don't exactly know - I put him down in Threadneedle-street, beyond the Bank, just on this side Bartholemew-lane.</p>

            . I am a constable of the ward. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, a few minutes before I came in; he said he had just come from his brothers by the omnibus, and was going home - he behaved very well.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. RACKWITZ. Q. Was it dark? A. It was not day-light; there was a lamp just opposite - I am positive of the man; I cannot be deceived; I was very collected; I felt the watch go out of my pocket; he held my pocket down with one hand and took it with the other - I caught hold of his hand, but could not keep hold of him - I saw his face while I held him; there was no obstruction in the lane - after I cried stop thief several persons followed him, but I am positive I never lost sight of him - I did not turn up Finch-lane; he was stopped at the corner; I was close upon him, and did not lose sight of him when he turned into the lane - I did not observe any communication between him and the persons who followed - I was robbed by the shoemaker's-shop at the corner of Bartholemew-lane - he met me; he came running against me and dodged me - I tried to get out of his way, but he would not let me- I must have lost sight of him when he turned the corner.</p>

             re-examined. When the prisoner got out of the omnibus, he did not appear to have anybody with him; he was the last but one that got out - I put him down opposite Princes-street, and he sat off running - I heard no alarm of stop thief; the conductors of the omnibuses are always calling out "Paddington," and I could not hear.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How many persons were in your omnibus? A. I had about seven when at the Bank; he was at the furthest end, being the second passenger I took up.</p>

At half-past ten o'clock refreshment was allowed them; and at twenty minutes after four o'clock that afternoon, they came into Court and stated that eleven of their number had determined upon a verdict of acquittal, but the other Juror would not agree to that verdict; nor was it likely that they should come to an unanimous decison; and that one of their number was extremely ill. A medical gentleman who had attended the Juror, deposed that he conceived that it would be attended with danger to his health if he was longer confined. The Jury were accordingly discharged.

I can swear to them - I don't know how much there may be in London; I have no private mark on any thing - I did not know that the prisoner worked for any other person - I sometimes have watch cases to clean - I scrape them when I am compelled; we do not return the filings to the owner of the watch, we use them in our work.</p>

                        targets="t18330516-23-off111 t18330516-23-crimeloc113"/> I had my purse in my right hand, with which I had hold of his arm - he asked me what I had in my hand; I said it was my purse; he took hold of my hand, and immediately took hold of the clasp of my purse and drew it from me - I tried to hold it but he drew it so hard that I could not keep it - we then walked on for two or three yards, during which time I asked him to return the purse back to me - I asked him once or twice, and he made me no answer - I asked him for it again, he said did I think he was going to run away with my purse; he scarcely gave me time to answer, but left my arm and ran as fast as he could towards William-street; he turned down there and I ran after him - it was no great distance - I can't tell how far - I saw a policeman in William-street, and he went down the street and took him; I saw him taken, and I afterwards saw my purse picked up within three or four paces of where he was taken - I swear positively that the prisoner is the man who took it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What kind of a night was it? A. It was a fair morning - I am quite positive the prisoner is the man; he was talking to my companion first; but she is not here - she was not at the police-office - she had as good an opportunity of seeing him as I had - I saw her last night; she lives in the house I do - she did not know that she was required to come here - the prisoner was searched in my presence, and two sovereigns, one half crown, and one sixpence were found on him - I had never seen him before; he denied having seen my purse - I have not seen his wife, nor sent any message to her - I did not say before the magistrate that I gave the prisoner my purse.</p>

             (police-constable, S. 69). I was on duty in William-street; I was called to take the prisoner for robbing her of her purse and 4 shillings; he was running - when I first saw him he ran by me, but he afterwards walked and stopped when I called to him - I found on him two sovereigns, one half-crown, one sixpence, fourpence in copper, seven new silk handkerchiefs, and two phials of spirits.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from where you saw a person running, did you take the prisoner walking? A. I suppose about forty yards - I had my police dress on; the prisoner could see it no doubt; he must have known that the prosecutrix was running after him - I did not hear any alarm - the prisoner gave his right address; I went there by his direction - I saw his wife, but she would not have the medicine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far did he run after you called to him to stop? A. I called to him to stop, and then he walked five or six yards.</p>

             (police-sergeant, S. 12). When the prosecutrix left the watch-house, I went with her to the spot where the prisoner had been stopped, and I found this purse about ten yards from the place, there are 4 shillings in it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been down to the Borough, and then went to spend the evening with a friend named Adams - I was then going home, and met a tradesman who promised me a ticket to see the Zoological-gardens; I walked a few paces with him - I was then stepping down William-street, and met the policeman who took me - the prosecutrix charged me with robbing her; I said "It is no such thing; I have not seen you" - I stated at the police-office where I lived, and they went and frightened my wife, and asked her to describe my dress which she could not do - and the officer came back and said I had given a wrong address; but he went at eight o'clock, and found it was right - I bought these handkerchiefs at Morrison's, and my mistress went there and found my name entered in their book, but they could not tell who served me.</p>

             (police-sergeant F 4.). The prisoner was taken by another officer, and brought to the station-house - she was put into the cell with another woman - I knew the prisoner, and knew her voice perfectly well; I heard her say to the other woman that she supposed she should be transported this time - and the other asked her what she was there for - she said for robbing a man of some money, that it had done her no good as she had been drinking about ever since, and all she got out of it was a bonnet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is false - I said I was there for robbing a man of seven sovereigns, and I had not had it; for if I had I had no occasion to have pawned an article that week to have got my bonnet from the cleaners - he came in while I was speaking to that woman, and she asked him if she could have a pint of beer, and I said if she had not got the money to pay for it, I would give it her - and she said to me that if I was to be transported, it was what she had been and had returned - I have the duplicate of what I had pawned that week.</p>

On the 15th of April, I was sitting in my room about a quarter after twelve o'clock, I had previously withdrawn the bolt of my chamber, my clerk being out; I heard the door go and some person go into my bed-room - I thought it was my clerk, but in a minute or a minute and a half I heard the door go again, I went to the door, and saw the prisoner with some musical-sticks in his hand; I said, "You have been in my bed-room" - he said he came to sell the sticks - I said stand still; I opened my bed-room door, and found the boot-rack was stripped - I secured the prisoner and in his bag I found these boots which had been safe an hour and a half before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known Rosetta Diggins? A. About two years; she is a shoe-binder - we are pretty good friends, but not too intimate - I don't know that she gets her living in any way but by shoe-binding; I had not seen her for ten months before this time - my wife knows of this young woman; she does not know her personally, but she knows that I paid my addresses to her once, I mean my respects - I was not in love with her - I met her about ten o'clock, opposite Spring's, and we were there till half-past twelve; we had three pints of ale there - we went to another public-house in Drury-lane, that was in our way home; I cannot tell where Rosetta lives - she told me, but I forget; I believe I had a little rum in Drury-lane - I had nothing else, I don't know how much I had, I believe I paid 5d. for it; I was perfectly sober - there was another female with us who was Rosetta's sister - I don't know that I told the magistrate that there was no other female in our company - I did not say so - I met Rosetta and her sister by accident; they live together and were both drinking with me.</p>

            . I have known Mr. Smith four or five years; I was with him when this happened - we were walking arm in arm; at the corner of Carey-street I saw Goadly draw the watch from his pocket, and pass it behind him, where were two persons - they ran off down Chancery-lane - Mr. Smith ran four or five yards to see if he could overtake them - I took hold of Goadly; he seized me by the throat, and the other prisoner came and took me away from him, and tore my shawl - Reboul ran off when the police was called, and the officer took him; I am sure of them both.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known Goadly before? A. No, Sir; I should not know the other two persons; I am a shoe binder; I have known Smith four or five years, only as a friend - I met him about nine that evening - I had not seen him for six or seven months before; it was not so long as ten months - my sister was with me - I live at No. 8, Market-street, Haymarket, but I then lived at No. 7, Clement's-lane - we went to the Craven's Head, in Drury-lane, and we had before that called on a friend in a public-house, I don't know the sign, but Spring keeps it - I took a glass of ale there, and stopped some time on account of the rain - Drury-lane is not in the way to Clement's-lane, but I had to call on a person - Chancery-lane is out of the way to Clement's-lane, but I walked a little way back with Smith - it was about two o'clock when we got to Carey-street; I had not drank any thing at Drury-lane - Smith knew where I lived, for I told him; I went to Drury-lane to call on a friend at No. 23, but they were in bed; it was then half past one - Goadly positively denied that he had any part in the transaction.</p>

             (Police-sergeant, F. 12). I was on duty in Carey-street, and heard the cry of Police! between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 14th of April - I went to the corner of Star-yard and met Reboul running towards me, as though he was running from the spot; I took the prisoner back, and found Goadley being held by the prosecutor and another constable - I took another person afterwards who was not identified.</p>
               <p>Goadley's Defence. I had been to Drury-lane theatre, and then to a cook-shop and had my supper; I then came down Carey-street on the right hand side, and when I got near the bottom I heard a noise; I walked on, and when I got to the corner I saw the prosecutor, the witness, and two more women all in a bother, calling police; I stepped up and asked the prosecutor what was the matter - he said, you are one of the men who have stolen my watch - I was going home to Blackfriars-bridge, when he collared me - I said I would go with him; I made no resistance nor did I attempt to escape.</p>
               <p>Reboul's Defence. I was at work in Drury-lane, and left at half-past one; I walked down the Strand, and turned up Bell-yard, and the policeman took me back, and this woman swore I was one who had attacked the man.</p>

On the evening of the 16th of April, I was informed a man had taken a cheese, I proceeded down the street, and took the prisoner with it on his head - he was quite a stranger - he said some one gave it him to carry; this is it - it had been in a cart at my door - I had sent some cheeses to Smithfield for a gentleman to look at - my brother brought this and several others back in the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was looking for a place, and a man asked me to carry this cheese to the bottom of Cromer-street, or to Mr. Cubitts; I thought the man was on the other side of the way.</p>

On the 24th of April I was there, I recollect putting these notes and bills of exchange into my pocket-book; I took them from my pocket-ledger - I cannot be upon my oath that I left my pocket-book on my desk, but I am fully persuaded that I did - I then went home to dinner, and did not go out again - on the following morning I missed my pocket-book and notes; I went to my counting-house, but could hear no tidings of the pocket-book - I had never seen the prisoner to my knowledge; this was on a Wednesday, and on the Sunday the prisoner was taken - I received some information, and went with an officer to the prisoner's lodging; we found his wife at home, she gave us up the pocket-book without any hesitation; it contained the bills of exchange, but not the three 5l. notes, they were gone; the prisoner came home drunk soon afterwards, he said he knew nothing about the pocket-book; he was taken to the station-house; he then said he had left two of the notes with a person at Bermondsey, and had drawn 20s. upon them; the serjeant sent an officer the next morning, and found the two notes - all that is lost is one 5l. note, which the wife after some hesitation acknowledged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160027"/>they had spent through distress - the prisoner said he had found the book in Upper Ground-street, and the next morning he said he found it in Hatfield-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Where is Hatfield-street? A. My gate-way goes in from Hatfield-street, which joins to Upper Ground-street - it is possible that I might have dropped my pocket-book, but I think not probable - I advertised it as being lost supposed between Stamford-street and Nelson-square - I never conceived that I had lost it - I had my privy searched, and then I advertised it - the man who gave me information was at Bow-street - I spoke to him in the street; I gave him a sovereign for his honesty - I did not charge any one with stealing this - it was about twelve o'clock in the day when I put the notes into the book, and I left in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.You stated at first that you lost it from your desk? A. I conceived so, but I thought it possible I might have put it into my pocket and lost it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give me leave to remove the dresser? A. No, nor any of the articles, because I am bound to keep them, and to return them up again to the landlord on a repurchase.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I went with the prosecutor to the house, and missed all the fixtures - we went to the station, and were told to look after the prisoner- we went to Finsbury-market, and the prosecutor saw him come out of a house and pointed him out; I followed and took him - he said he had sold the things a fortnight before to a broker in Old-street, but he did not say to whom.</p>

I was at the public-house on Sunday evening, the 21st of April, having a pint of porter; I saw Rogers, the prisoner, and two men sitting in a box - I sat down on the other side of the room - I saw the prisoner hugging very close to Rogers, and I thought I would take him out of the room - she was on his right side, and I saw her put her face close to him as if kissing him, and she drew his watch - I said, "Rogers, you have lost your watch;" I saw her attempting to put it under the table, and he took it from her and gave her a shove away, and came out into the tap-room; she then took up the pot, spilt the ale, and with a desperate blow, she cut his head open.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Fann-street, North-street, Bethnal-green. I have known the prisoner ten years; when I first knew him he was married; but he lost his wife; he then lived at No. 2, Wood's Buildings, whitechapel-road - my husband's name was John Hill, he has been away thirteen years; he was a sailor - I have not seen or heard from him; I heard from the mate of the vessel that he died at Calcutta - the mate is not here, he is not arrived yet, but is expected daily - I was living in service, in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160030"/>Commercial-road; the prisoner visited me, and we were married at Limehouse-church, on the 30th of April in last year - the prisoner represented himself as a widower; we lived together after the marriage, in Marmon-street, Commercial-road - I went one Wednesday to Henry-street, to inquire for him, and in consequence of what I heard, I gave them some information - I found him and his wife, he was up stairs, and would not come down; I did not go up to him, but his wife said he was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say you heard your former husband was dead, from the mate of the vessel? A. Yes, he heard he said that he died in another ship into which he removed; the mate did not say that he was in the vessel when my husband died - I married my husband, at Stepney church, sixteen years ago; it is ten years since I first knew the prisoner; I married him at Limehouse church, that is Limehouse parish, I am sure of that; my father was present at my marriage, and the bride-maid - I was very intimate with the prisoner ten years ago, I lived next door to him - I was almost too kind to him, I borrowed money and gave him; I was as familiar with him as I have been since we were married - he was not frightened into this marriage with me; he used to leave me every other night after we were married - I had intercourse with him ten years ago, but not often; he then went to sea, and came home fourteen months afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go to your father's house with a large cloak on at that time and find the prisoner there, and did he not desire you to unbuckle your cloak, and you would not? A. Yes, I was in a family way by another person - he did not sleep at my father's nor at my house at that time; he did not sleep at my house afterwards - I do not remember going to his bed-room to awake him one morning; I will swear I did not; I never had any intercourse with him after he found me with child by another man - he was very angry and quitted me, and I did not see him again for some time - I cannot tell the name of the father of that child, I had only intercourse with one man - I had two children by my first husband, and I have had this child in my arms by the prisoner since our marriage - I have had four children in all; I cannot tell the name of the father of my third child; it is so many years ago; I cannot tell whether I had intercourse with him the first time I saw him; he was a bricklayer.</p>

I am the brother of Mary Hill, I knew her husband Hill; I recollect his going to sea thirteen years ago - I gave the prisoner in charge; I met with him, and told him, I considered he had acted a foolish part in marrying two women - he acknowledged he had, but he said it was done and could not be undone; I was not aware how my sister had conducted herself with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you live in the house with her? A. Yes, I know she had a child fourteen months after the prisoner went away - I never knew the name of the father of it; I never had the curiosity to inquire; I don't know whether my father or mother did; I had enough to do to look after my own business - the policeman is here who was with me when I took the prisoner; he was examined at the police office, he did not state there that he never heard the prisoner say it was a bad job.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you the certificates? A. Yes, I got one from Stepney and the other from St. Anne's, Lime-house - I got this in the vestry-room from the minister and clerk, I compared it, it is a true copy.</p>

On the 18th of April, about half-past three in the afternoon, I was coming from Islington and saw the prisoner and another coming out of No. 22, Pulteney-terrace, White Conduit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160032"/>fields, with a very large bundle - the prisoner came out of No. 22 to No. 20 and knocked at that door, and did not wait for an answer (he knocked at the door after he saw me); I apprehended him - I was unwell myself and did not lay hold of his companion - I live myself in Pulteney-terrace - I asked the prisoner if he saw a policeman in Half-moon-crescent, he said no; I took his hat off, and found in it a tea canister which was claimed by the prosecutor; I searched his pockets and found 3 weights of a clock - the clock had been taken from the house; and I found 2 keys and a chisel on him - I found nothing more- his companion had the large bundle, and got away with it - there was about 2 1/2 oz. of tea in the canister; I asked him how he came by them - he said he met his sister at Hoxton, and she gave him the tea canister with the tea, but he could not tell me where she lived - I can't say how the party got in, there was a mark of this chisel in the frame of the door, but I can't say whether that would enable him to force back the bolt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were either of them out of the house when you first came into the street? A. The other man had come out, and the prisoner shut the door after he came out - I did not see the prisoner stoop down by the gutter, I pursued him very near a quarter of a mile, but never lost sight of him; he turned no corner; we came into Half-moon-crescent together.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not a back door? A. Yes, I shut the back door myself that morning - I am positive the caddy is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The policeman says he never lost sight of me - he went down one street forty yards long- I went down another which had no turning, and he took me; I had been out to look for work, and met a man who said he thought I could get employment of Mr. Smith, No. 20, in that street - I went down the street, tied up my shoe, and then saw the policeman - I knocked at No. 20, nobody answered, and I went away - I went down the street, and saw a man going with a bundle, and saw these articles, and picked them up - I put the weights of the clock into my pockets, and the caddy in my hat - I went on and saw the policeman stop a man with a bundle on his back at the corner of the street and question him; he touched the bundle and let him go and followed me.</p>

               <p>Q. You don't mean to say the prisoner stole your bonnet? A. He took it off my head, and used me very cruelly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it dark?

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not come forward of his own accord? A. No, not to me; while I was taking him to the station-house, he told me he took the cards himself, and ran away with them - I had not asked him a question.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How long had you been with your friend? A.Sometime; we had been into the country and were returning - we were both quite sober - I did not see the man before I felt the snatch, it was so sudden; I cannot tell whether my friend observed it; I called out that I had lost my watch, and he pursued.</p>

            . I was a warehouseman to Mr. Hopkins, of Great Dover-road. At the time in question I was in Bishopsgate-street; I did not observe the prosecutor - my eyes were attracted towards where he was - I was going in the same direction as him, to the Flower Pot, and on the same side of the way - and I saw a man make a snatch at Mr. Oakley, which drew my attention, and in a moment Mr. Oakley sung out that he had lost his watch, and cried "Stop thief" - he made a bit of a run, and stopped as if he was lame; I did not see the prisoner's face - I saw a person run across the road towards the London Tavern; I ran directly, and he took a short turn, and I could not see through the corner of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160035"/>Leadenhall-street, and I lost sight of him at the corner, only for a moment, as he turned into Leadenhall-street - I did not lose sight of him afterwards - a young man stopped him, but he broke from him, and the time-keeper at the Black Boy Tavern stopped him; it was more than one hundred yards from the corner of Leadenhall-street, I never lost sight of him after he turned the corner, except that when he was laid hold of, a mob gathered and followed him to the watch-house - the watch has never been found - to the best of my knowledge he is the man, but I did not observe his features; from the size of the body, and the height of the prisoner I should have no hesitation in saying he is the man - I did not go into the watch-house, but returned back to the prosecutor, who was holding another who he suspected to be concerned - I believe the prisoner to be the man who snatched the watch, but am not certain; the prosecutor saw him when he was brought to another watch-house in Cornhill.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined Q. I believe two other persons were in custody on this charge? A. Yes, it was Sunday evening, there were a great many persons in the street; the same person who made the snatch ran across the road; I saw no watch in his hand.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was Mr. Oakley walking arm in arm with his friend? A. I believe so; Mr. Oakley was outside and so was the man - I was about three yards from him; he turned and ran towards the London Tavern, the same way as I was going; he had turned back from the direction in which he was originally going; I consider he did that to get from the persons who had seen him do it - he crossed the road on the same side as the London Tavern, and turned on his heel, and directly turned again, and went down Leadenhall-street.</p>

            . I am a time-keeper to the Blackwall stages, and also a City officer. About ten minutes before ten o'clock I heard a cry of "Stop thief," proceeding from down Leadenhall-street; I saw some persons running down Leadenhall-street; I ran down, and turned round the coaches to meet him, and met the prisoner running at the head of the others - a young man who met him made a snatch at him, but he got from him; I instantly ran on him and secured him; he said, "I am not the man, I am running after the thief, you have got the wrong person" - Mr. Welch and several others came up and said,"Hold him;" I took him to Lime-street watch-house, and searched him; I found no watch on him, or any thing relating to the charge - having to dismiss the ten o'clock coach, I left him there; I was present when Mr. Oakley saw him at Cornhill watch-house; he could not identify him when I stopped him; Welch said, "Hold him, he has robbed a gentleman of his watch."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take any other persons? A. No, they were taken in Bishopsgate-street; the prisoner said, I had got the wrong person.</p>

I said I did wish, and did so - they both sleep in the same room, but had separate boxes; on looking over her box at that time I found nothing; I searched M'Carthy's box the same day, and found nothing - when Mahony asked me to search her box, she asked if I had any objection to her taking it away on that Thursday night, and I allowed her - I went up stairs directly I had given her leave, I followed her up; I opened her bed-room door, and she then had a small red box in her hand; I had not searched any thing at that time, and when I did search, I forgot the red box in my hurry; I searched the red box before she left the house, and found in it a duplicate of a pillow, a pillow case, and blanket - I afterwards went to the pawnbroker's, and saw the things, and the pillow case I knew directly; it had no mark on it, but I had made it myself, and know it by my own work; I have since missed a pillow, and don't doubt but that belongs to me; Mahony was not in the room when I found the red box containing the duplicate - the duplicate was found in Mahony's box, but we found it had been pawned by M'Carthy, and Mahony acknowledged sending her to pawn it - I do not recollect telling her it would be better to tell about it; when I found the duplicate, I locked her box again, and went down stairs, and went to the pawnbroker's - I knew the articles; I came back and put the ticket into the box again - I then sent Mahony to the West End of the Town, and sent an officer with M'Carthy to the pawnbroker's, who identified her; when Mahony returned the officer produced the duplicate, and she said it was her - the things were pawned in the name of M'Carthy; the three articles were all in one duplicate - we had both the prisoners taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What wages was due to them? A. To Mahoney, 3l. 10s., and about 30s. to M'Carthy; the things were pawned for 1s.</p>

            . I manage the business of Mr. Robert England, a pawnbroker near the Town-hall, Borough. I have a pillow, and case, and blanket, which were all pawned at one time by the prisoner M'Carthy in her own name, on the 9th of April, towards the evening; I took them in myself - we have a customer of that name in Fishmonger-alley, who she was acquainted with, and I put that address to it; she only asked 1s. on them, saying she wished to take care of them, which Irish people often do when they don't want money - I am quite certain of her person - Mrs. Austin saw the articles about a month after, and brought a pillow-case which matched the one we had.</p>

I took charge of the prisoners; I took M'Carthy over to the pawnbroker, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160036"/>said she was the woman who pawned them; I took her to the watch-house, then staid at the prosecutor's till Mahony came in; and in the red box I found the duplicate of the articles - Mahony acknowledged that she had given them to M'Carthy, who had pawned them; and M'Carthy said she had pawned them, and they were her master's property; she at first said they belonged to a relation in Fishmonger-alley - she said, "Master, it was yours, but Elizabeth gave them to me" - nothing was said to induce her to say so.</p>
               <p>M'Carthy's Defence. She brought them down to me in the passage, and asked me to pawn them for 1s.; I did not know what they were, and pawned them in my own name, and gave her the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Mahony's Defence. I was short of money, and did not wish to trouble my mistress till I had a settlement with her, so I gave M'Carthy these to pawn, intending to get them out before I left the house.</p>
               <p>MRS. AUSTIN. They had not applied to me for wages - I had a good character with them both - I have lost a great many things for the last two years, but never suspected them.</p>

            . I am certain of the note, here is my endorsement on it with the name of Wall, who I took it of on the Friday before - I have not a doubt of it being one of the notes which were in my pocket-book.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you any date on it? A. No, but I am sure I took it of him the day before, I have taken money from him before, but don't recollect ever giving him change; he is a regular customer - I perceived this to be a shattered note, which is the reason I put his name on it; other persons could go to this place, but none had business there, except the prisoner - I look over my money every night, before I go to bed - I had a good character with the prisoner.</p>

I was sweeping the passage and am quite sure nobody went into the kitchen from the time Miss Rowlatt laid the coat there till I saw the prisoner take it - there was nobody with the prisoner and nobody went into the place where he brushed the coat.</p>

            . I was in James-street at a quarter before one o'clock that morning - I saw the prosecutor walking quite alone, but he was intoxicated - the prisoner came down the street, stopped him, and took his watch from him- I did not hear a word pass between them - I did not know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How long did this take? A. Not many minutes - I had never seen the prisoner before, but I am sure she is the woman; I know her by her bonnet and her dress.</p>

             (police-constable, C 124). I saw the prosecutor in the passage, he told me a woman had taken his watch from him in James-street and run into that house; I went up stairs and met two women and a man coming down - I found nothing on them; I then went up higher, and found two young women in bed; I made them get up, and searched the room, but found nothing - I then went into the cellar, and found the prisoner; I asked her for the watch, she denied having it; I brought her up stairs, and said I would take her to the watch-house; she said if I would allow her to go down, she would find the watch; I went down, and found it under the cellar stairs.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me the watch to go with him to a house in Coventry-court, which I did; and when we came out, I took it to this house, to leave it for some money - I was tipsy as well as he was.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JONES. I am a private in the Guards. I met the gentleman and a young woman together at the corner of Little James-street, turning into the Haymarket, about half-past twelve o'clock - they made a stop, and the gentleman said "I have no money, not a farthing, but my watch," and he had his watch in his hand; he said "Do you know any house where we can leave it for a few shillings;" she said "If you will give me the watch I will try," and they went towards Whitcomb-street - I merely looked round and looked at their dress - the next morning I was passing the street, and heard of the young woman being taken, and I told what I had seen to two young women; and the same night I told a policeman of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long have you been in the Guards? A.Eighteen years - I had never seen the prisoner before that I know of - they were walking - I have seen the prisoner's mother; that was the day we were at Westminster Sessions-house; I had not known her mother before, but she found me out by some means - I did not go before the magistrate, I was at drill that morning - I know the house in Whitcomb-street, I have been there in company with a young woman, but not with the prisoner; I have been there more than once, but never had any conversation with any one there - I had not seen the prisoner before, but I noticed their dress; the gentleman had brown top-boots on, and the woman had a sky-blue bonnet.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at Lambeth. I know nothing of the prisoner, but I was coming from Somers-town that night, and passing down the Haymarket about half-past twelve o'clock, I saw a man and a woman together coming out of a court, and going down the Hay-market - I heard the man say to the woman, "I have no money," but I did not see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You knew nothing of the parties? A. No, I did not see the soldier, nor the brothel-house keeper, nor the house; three or four nights afterwards as I was coming along the Haymarket, I met a person who asked me if I had been out on such a night, and she asked where I lived, and I told her, and then they sent me this summons to attend here - I cannot tell how many men and women I saw walking together the same evening; I have since found that the person who spoke to me had been sent by the prisoner's mother.</p>

Bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q Had you not another woman in company with you before you saw the prisoner? A. No, Sir; the prisoner and the other woman were in company, the other woman had a child in her arms; they called me uncle - the prisoner said, I will take care of it for you; we went into two or three houses, it might be five or six - they did not refuse to serve me in any of those places - I did not drop the note in any public-house, I had it in my side pocket; I did not take it out till I got into the house where I was robbed of it - I will not swear that I did not.</p>

            . I am assistant to my mother who keeps the York Arms. The prosecutor came there with two women, the prisoner was one; the women had something to drink, but the prosecutor had not; he offered me a 5l. note to change, and pay for what they had - I said I could not change it; he said he had no more money - the prisoner said she had money, and she paid for what they had had with a shilling - she then said to the prosecutor, "Uncle, give me the note, I will take care of it," and she stretched out her hand, and took the note from his hand; the other woman was gone in a minute; the prosecutor seemed surprised, but in a minute he said to the prisoner "Give me my note" - she said she had no note - I said, "You have, I saw you take it;" I opened the door and called the policeman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were there in front of the bar? A.There were only the prosecutor and the two females; the prisoner brought the child in, but the other woman took the child before the prisoner took the note - I am certain the prisoner took it, she was not out of my sight.</p>

Mr. Burt called me in - I asked the prisoner where the note was? - she said she had never seen it, and I might search her; in taking her to the station, she said she did take it, and offered the prosecutor 3l. to make it up - on the Saturday following, the man she lives with came and offered 3l.; and when the prisoner was before the magistrate the third time, she said she gave the note to the other woman.</p>

             (police-sergeant, G 145). On the 29th of April, about seven o'clock, I was in a court in the Curtain-road with Johnson; we were watching a house which we suspected of being a receptacle for stolen goods - the two prisoners came to the house, Coxhead knocked and went in with a bundle, which I supposed to be a coat as I saw part of it - soon afterwards they came out and Ross had a basket, which they had not when they went in- we took them, and found this coat in the basket.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH STELL. I live at Prestwick, four miles beyond Manchester. I came to town on the 18th of April, and about seven o'clock that evening, I was on the other side of the river; I came over the iron bridge and soon after saw Rose standing by the side of a cart; I asked him to direct me to the White Horse, Fetter-lane, where I had put up; he said he was going past Fetter-lane, and if I would wait a few minutes, he had a friend coming, and we would go together - I waited three or four minutes, the prisoner Williams came up, and we all came on together towards St. Paul's - they asked me if I had ever seen that church; I said, No; we then went on, and I treated them at two public-houses - Rose then took my right arm and we walked on some distance, I then found his right hand near my pocket; I felt in my pocket, but I had not lost any thing - I shortly afterwards felt my watch drawn from me; I seized Rose by the breast and charged him with taking it; he began to strike me, and struck me many severe blows in the face; I had two very black eyes; I still held him and called for assistance; the officer came and took him - Williams was on his right hand and he made his escape with the watch, which was afterwards found in his possession.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you ever been in town before? A. No; I did not ask any one to go to the play that night - I cannot swear I had not been in three public-houses; I was in one after I left the prisoners; I can't tell how many I had been into in the day; I had had two pennyworths of gin at two vaults before I met them - I had some rum and water after I met them; I don't know whether I went to the George and Dragon; I don't know the signs - I remember a pretty landlady, but I did not try to be intimate with her, nor take any liberties with her, no further than speaking to her - I don't remember her husband threatening me if I did not leave her alone - I was not refused half a pint of rum that night to my knowledge; I called for no liquor but what I paid for, and what I called for they brought in; I don't remember asking Mrs. Barton for any money, nor dancing in the street - I was sober, but I don't know how much I had paid for liquor that day; I drank three or four glasses of gin and water in the length of the evening; I think not more than four, but I will swear not more than five - I treated the prisoners for them to direct me in my way, I had told Williams where I lodged, but upon my oath I did not give him my watch.</p>

On the night of the 18th of April I was on duty in Fetter-lane, and saw Williams talking to the waiter at the White Horse; the waiter gave me a wink to stop; Williams offered him this watch, and the waiter would not have it; he then offered it to me, and said he had been with a companion, and they met with a countryman, and had shown him the way; that he went to the Bell, in Holborn, where he wanted to speak to a female, but he had persuaded him not - that he had given him his watch to take care of, but that going under a gateway he had lost him and his companion - I said, "You must be a very honest man, and no doubt the gentleman will reward you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not hear him ask if the gentleman lodged there? A. Yes; he might have gone off with it.</p>

            . I am constable of the night; I have had the watch ever since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Rose's Defence. The prosecutor charged me with robbing him of his watch; he seized me by the handkerchief and almost choaked me, and he would if I had not stood in my own defence.</p>
               <p>William's Defence. I solemnly declare I am innocent; when the prosecutor and us came out of the Queen's Head, he took hold of a young woman and asked her to go to the play, and he gave me the watch, telling me to mind it for him - the young woman got from him and we went on to Museum-street, where I stopped - I lost the prosecutor and my fellow-prisoner - I then went to the play-house, but could not find them; I went into a public-house to have a pint of porter; I fell asleep and when I awoke I hastened to the White Horse, where the prosecutor said he lodged - I asked the waiter if a gentleman from the country lodged there; he said, yes; I said I had a watch of his, which I wished to deliver up, but he would not take it; I was coming out, and two policemen were at the door, who said I had better take it to the station, which I did.</p>

            . I keep the Pewter-Platter, in public-house, Charles-street. I remember the prosecutor being at my house, about nine o'clock on that night; he was very much intoxicated, and was disgusting to every body in the tap-room; he sat down and called for half a pint of rum; I told him I would not draw him any liquor, but to go and get sober where he got drunk - I went into my parlour, and when I came out he was standing at my bar quite in the way; I pushed him on one side and told my wife I wanted 2l. 2s. for the Sick Society, which was in my parlour - the prosecutor pulled out a 5l. note, and said he could lend me 2l. - I said I did not want him nor his money; he then went away with the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you? A. I shall be fourteen in November; I know it is a wrong thing to tell a lie - my master told me if the judge should ask me where I should go to if I told a lie, I was to say, I should go to the naughty place - he told me the prisoner would be tried for his life - the person who was running had his back towards me, and the handkerchiefs were thrown on the ground - I had seen three boys in the street within half an hour; I did not know them, the prisoner was not one of them, I did not see him; the three boys had been looking in at the window - the prisoner said he was the wrong boy, it was not him who took them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure he dropped the handkerchiefs? A. Yes; he turned his face and dropped them; he was stopped in about five minutes afterwards - I lost sight of him as he turned the corner, but I am certain of his person; he dropped the handkerchiefs a few yards before he turned the corner; it was half-past five o'clock, and good day-light - these are the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you a mark on them? A. Yes, the private mark, it is on these, we never sell them with that mark on them.</p>
               <p>MR. SWEETING re-examined. Q. Was any thing found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160048"/>on the prisoner to account for the breaking of the glass? A.No, I suppose it had been cut with a diamond; it was certainly not broken - my house is in the parish of St. Giles without Cripplegate; it is my dwelling house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.How soon after you heard the noise of the window, did you get sight of the prisoner? A.About half a minute; he was four or five doors off; I had seen the prisoner before, about the house; I heard the window crack by drawing the handkerchiefs out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going in search of a situation; the handkerchiefs were thrown on my shoulder by three lads who passed me; I thought they were stolen and threw them off, when I heard a cry of stop thief.</p>

            . I am the daughter of the last witness. In February last I received two 5l. notes from my father while I was visiting at Mr. Britten's - I put the notes into my glove, and when I got home, I missed them - I had left my glove on my dressing-table in the bed-room; I had gone out early in the morning and returned in the evening; it was about the 16th of February - I should not know the notes again; I did not mark them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.Where did you receive the notes from your father? A. In Spode and Copeland's shop - I don't remember whether I saw them after I got into the house; I was in one or two hackney-coaches before I got home, and cannot say whether I lost them before I got home - I put them into my glove at Spode and Copeland's, and did not take my glove off after that till I got home - it was a short glove; I put the notes inside it - when I took the glove off, I left it on the dressingtable; I don't remember anything further about it - I am sure I did not take my glove off at all while I was out.</p>

On the 1st of May, I was called into the house of Mr. Britten; I saw the prisoner; she was suspected of having taken two 5l. notes - she said she would go up stairs with me to search her box; I went up with her - she unlocked the box, and immediately thrust her hand into it; I put my hand in also, and took from her hand this black bag, with the two 5l. notes in it - I asked her who the notes belonged to, she said they were her own.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is there not a gate in Warwick-court, and a man to open it? A. Yes, but the man happened to be asleep, for he knew nothing of the transaction when he was asked - I did not see him there - I did not call myself an attorney at the police-office - I said I lived with a gentleman in New-inn; what I stated was read over to me, and I signed it, but it was not read that I was an attorney - when I seized hold of the prisoner he was returning down Warwick-court, and was about the centre of it; the gate is not at the bottom, but forty or fifty yards from Holborn - I should think he was about the centre, and on the shady side of the court, where the lamp does not reflect - there was nobody but me and the prisoner in the court at that time; I met him running - I had spent the evening at a friend's house, and was returning home - I had been at Mr. Harris's public-house, in Houghton-street, Clare-market; I went with a friend, Mr Hawkins; we paid about one shilling for what we had, I will swear eighteen-pence would cover the expenses; we were there two or three hours, but did not sit down at all, we stood talking at the bar all the time - I had not spoken to a female that night, nor been in company with any - I am not in the habit of putting my watch in my pocket, but seeing the prisoner a few paces before me, it struck me his character did not look so well as I could wish, and I put it into my waistcoat pocket as the quickest way to put it away; I had not time to return it to my fob, he was so close to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What was there in his appearance which indicated that his character was bad? A. I thought he was coming too close to me, and facing me too much; he might have passed a little further off - a number of persons collected after the circumstance occurred; I had hold of him at that time - I was in my senses although I had drank a little; no female accosted me.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was in Holborn a little before one o'clock, on the morning of the 10th of May. I turned into Chancery-lane without seeing any body - in about five minutes I returned, and came into Holborn again; I looked towards Warwick-court, and saw three persons together; two or three different people ran, and I ran after them to see what was the matter - I ran over, and Cooper was given into my charge by the prosecutor, for robbing him of his watch; this was a few yards up Warwick-court, I took him in charge - nothing was said to induce him to confess in my hearing; he said something about a woman running up the court and taking the watch, he said the woman had taken the watch; I looked round, and could see no woman in Warwick-court, but several females came up from Holborn, and some men; I took him to the Station-house, and there he acknowledged to me that he had pushed the prosecutor into the kennel - Ashley had been drinking, he walked along behind us very steadily, and did not appear to be drunk; he could walk very steady, he was agitated in mind; the prisoner appeared rather agitated, whether he had been drinking I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You could perceive that the prosecutor had been drinking? A. Yes; I searched the prisoner at the office, and found three keys on him which were delivered up to his employer; they were keys of chambers - he had a few pence in his pocket; he had been seized by the prosecutor when I came up; whether he meant that he had pushed the prosecutor into the kennel before he was seized or afterwards I don't know - I don't recollect ever seeing the prisoner before; I did not know him before,</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the morning of the 10th of May, at half-past three o'clock, I found a watch down in the area of No. 11, Warwick-court, Holborn; it was down at the bottom of the area - the glass was broken, I took it to the station-house, and then to Hatton-garden; the prosecutor identified it, and I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

            . I am a ladies boot and shoemaker, and live in Bishop-court, Chancery-lane. I was in Holborn on the morning of the 10th of May, about one o'clock, and just facing Chancery-lane, I saw Mr. Ashley knocked down by a man who ran up the court facing Chancery-lane, I don't know the name of it; I followed the prisoner when Ashley got up - he ran up the court, and I ran up after him, and when he got to the top, Mr. Ashley collared him and brought him down the court - I did not lose sight of him after I got into the court; I was not at the end of the court when he was, so I lost sight of him there, but after getting into the court, I did not lose sight of him, only when he crossed the pavement to go into the court - the prisoner is the man Ashley collared; when I recovered sight of the person, he was running up the court as fast as he could - I followed him to the station-house, I am certain he is the man I saw Ashley collar - I was on the same side of Holborn as Ashley was knocked down on - there was nobody in the court besides him and Ashley when he ran up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where had you been? A. I was returning from my mother and brothers; I had drank part of a pot or two of beer, but very little - I was on the same side as the man was knocked down, not on the Chancery-lane side, it happened facing the court - Ashley ran up the court before me, I saw him seize the prisoner, who was running as fast as he could; when Ashley seized the prisoner, he was on his return, coming down the court; his back was to me when he ran up the court, but he was seized when he was just returning down the court again, a few yards from the gate, a good deal nearer to the gate than to Holborn; I had been out altogether about four hours; we had had about three pints of beer between us, not at a public-house but at my mother's -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160050"/>after the prisoner was taken, several females came up in Holborn, but not in the court; two men came up when we were at the bottom of the court.</p>

            . I am a member of Lincoln's-inn, and a student-at-law. I live at 3, Raymond's-buildings, where the policeman came to deliver the keys to Mr. Parker; the prisoner has been my servant about two months - I received a very good character with him, which he sustained - Curtis the policeman delivered the keys up to me; I expressed my surprise to him that Cooper should be so accused, upon which the policeman said,"Oh, Sir, we suspect him, we have seen him several times, in not good company." I don't mean to give his exact words, but it was to that effect.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was the other policeman with him? A. Yes; Mr. Parker's chambers are in the same building as mine; the prisoner had Mr. Parker's keys and mine - he slept on the basement story of the house with his wife; Warwick-court was in his way home - I believe the iron gate is shut at nine o'clock; the prisoner must have known it was no thoroughfare.</p>

            . I have chambers of Mr. Parker in Raymond-buildings - I have known the prisoner for two months, he bore a good character - I was at the chambers when the two policemen came to deliver up the keys, one of them said something - I have a slight scruple on my mind, but am nearly positive that it was Curtis - they were both abreast at the time, they came to deliver the keys, to me thinking they belonged to Mr. Parker - I expressed my surprise at the charge, and said I could not believe it, he was a man of such good character, and I had heard recommendations of him; he gave a very significant shake or shrug, as if to say, you don't know the man as well as I do - I again said, "I will not believe it," and then he said, "He was in rough company enough last night, a comb could not have combed London for worse, if I could have combed all London for it." I am quite certain of the expression.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did the two men follow the prisoner and prosecutor into the court or not? A. When we were coming down the court, the prosecutor and prisoner were kicking up a bother, and I think that made the gentlemen come into the court; they came into the court when we were coming down it with the prisoner - I am confident that before the prisoner was seized he was running up the court as hard as he could, and the prosecutor after him - I had seen the man knock the prosecutor down, and directly run up the court - I could not tell whether they had been conversing together.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see them meet? A. I was not taking notice of them until I saw one knock the other down; I cannot be certain that it was the prisoner.</p>

            . I have come out of the prison. On the 30th of March, I was barman to Mr. Clarke, a publican of Battle-bridge; I had previous to that deposited sums of money in the Provident Institution, St. Martin's-lane - I saw the prisoner on the 30th of March, and asked him to put 5l. into the Savings'-bank for me; I gave him five sovereigns and my deposit book, and told him to tell the clerk at the bank to put the amount of interest at the bottom of the book; (looking at a book) that is the book I gave the prisoner; here is 62l. 13s. added up, neither of the sums after that amount were in the book when I gave it to the prisoner; "£5, and £2 0 0 1/2. C. Boodle, 175," have been added since; it was not there when I gave it to the prisoner - I saw him again in the evening of the 30th, between five and six o'clock; I had no conversation with him about the money that night - I asked him for the book, he said he had left it at home, and would bring it, down to me in the morning; but I did not see him again till Monday night, between ten and eleven o'clock, the 1st of April, he called for a glass of ginger-beer, which I served him with - I asked him for the book, and he gave it to me; he said nothing - I put it into my pocket being busy, without looking at it - I went to bed about half-an-hour afterwards, and then I looked at the book - it had been in my pocket from the time I received it from him; I then saw this entry of "£5, and C. Boodle, £2 0 0 1/2," at the bottom - I applied to the Provident Institution on the 20th of April, to take out all my money - I saw Mr. Morton, and showed him the book; Mr. Morton then made these figures 175 in it then; this was on a Saturday- it requires a week's notice to get the money - I applied again on the 27th of April, to receive my money, and saw a gentleman named Arnott, and produced the book to him; and in consequence of something which was said, I went with the book to Mr. Boodle at his seat in the office- in consequence of some communication I made to him, the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q.Were you not in the habit of lending the prisoner money? A. I never lent him any in my life - I could not get out to take this money myself, and got him to do it - I am certain I saw this entry the first time I opened the book after he returned it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe your master accuses you of stealing this money? A. He has done so, and the Grand Jury have found a true bill against me; I am now in custody on that charge.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Is not your master's charge for embezzling half-a-crown? A. It is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When Mr. Boodle pointed out the forgery to you, did he ask if you had given the book to anybody to bring to the institution for you? A. Yes, I said to no one but who had brought it to the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, "No, I have not?" A. I said so, but I said to no one but what had brought it to the bank - he put the question to me two or three times, and told me to be careful how I answered - he asked if I had trusted the book to anybody, and I said no; I said I had not given it to any person but who brought it to the bank; and he said, did I know the person.</p>

            . I am one of the clerks in the Provident Institution. It is a rule for people to give a week's notice before they can take money - by the books it appears that the last witness deposited several sums in our bank - I remember his applying to me on the 20th of April; he produced this book, and I marked it 175, which is the folio of the notice book, where all the sums to be drawn out are entered - I produce the notice which he signed to withdraw the money - I took down the amount as being 67l. 8s., which included the last entry of 5l. - I told him to apply that day week - the amount, when I had the book, was 67l. 8s., but a witness can explain a difference in it.</p>

            . I am ledger clerk in the Provident Institution. On the 27th of April, I recollect the prosecutor applying to me for payment of his money - it is part of my duty to compare the amounts in the ledger with the pass-book - this is the book produced by Jutsum; the entry 5l., and 2l. 0s. 0 1/2d., were there when he produced it- in consequence of suspicion, I sent Jutsum to Mr. Boodle's desk - the notice for 67l. 8s., arises from the amount of interest not being entered on the 9th of February, when 10l. had been paid in - the entry of 2l. 0s. 0 1/2d., is an irregular entry, it is incorrect whoever made it.</p>
               <p>EDWARD BOODLE, ESQ. I am auditor of the accounts of the Provident Institution, and am a barrister. The prosecutor was brought to my part of the office on the 27th of April, by Mr. Arnott - It is my duty when deposits are made, to enter them in a book of my own, and sign my name to the deposit-book - this signature to the 5l. entry is not in my hand-writing - this is a pass-book; the entry 5l., purports that 5l. was paid in by Jutsum, on the 10th of March; it purports to be a receipt by me on account of the institution, of 5l., from him, which, if correct, we should have paid on application - here is "30th March, 1833, 5l." - that is not in the hand-writing of anybody authorised to make the entry - the signatures before that are in my hand-writing, but not the amounts - the Duke of Somerset's name is

               <p>COURT. Q. When Jutsum was brought to you, did you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160052"/>ask if he had given the book into any other person's hands to bring? A. I asked if the book had been in any other person's hands; he answered no, two or three times - my impression was, that he thought I was asking if he had left it in any person's hands; I repeated the question, and he said he had never parted with it, except to the party who had brought it the last time.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. In consequence of information which I received, I took the prisoner into custody on the 29th of April at Battle-bridge - I told him Mr. Clarke's young man had got himself into trouble, and that he had brought his name in question; I said he must go before a magistrate and account for it; he seemed confused, and his father asked him if he was going on business - he said, "Yes, it is bad business."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how his name was brought in question? A. I said it was with respect to 5l. - his father asked what it was about, and asked him, and he said it was respecting the 5l. he had of Mr. Clarke's young man - his father said, "If that is all I think we can make it right" - I don't think he made any reply - I then took him into custody - I cautioned him not to say anything, if he did I should take notice of it - before I brought him out of the house; but on the way to the office he said, "I see what this business is, it is a forgery" - I said, yes, you have acted very foolishly indeed, and if you had spoken to the young man about the circumstance I think it would not have come to this - he said he had met Jutsum several times but never had fortitude enough to tell him the circumstance, or otherwise he thought it would have been better - I searched him, and found a piece of writing-paper on him, which he said was his hand-writing, but afterwards denied it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure what he said was not "If it is a forgery it will be a bad job for Jutsum?" A. No, he did not, nor anything to that effect.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say you mentioned to him something about 5l., and he afterwards said, it was about 5l. of Clarke's young man which got him into trouble - did anything occur between those two statements to give him any knowledge that was the 5l. referred to? A. No, he appeared to be aware of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him Clarke's young man had got into trouble about 5l.? A. I said Clarke's young man had got into trouble, and his name was brought in question, and he must account for it before the magistrate - he asked me what it was about; I said, respecting 5l. - he told his father it was about 5l. which he had had from Clarke's young man - he said nothing about the money being lent to him.</p>

(read.)</p>
               <p>"The prisoner says, the first witness cannot be relied on; he has left his situation for taking the money from the till, and he says he gave me five sovereigns at one time which was not true; I had one sovereign full a week before I had the other four.

The prisoner is a stranger - on the 7th of May, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come into the shop with a woman, who asked to see some black handkerchiefs; I went to the other end of the shop to fetch them, and was about half way returning, when I saw the prisoner walk out of the shop rather brisk; the woman was still sitting down - they had come in together - this ninety-seven yards of silk had been about six yards further into the shop than they were standing, on another counter - I did not show the handkerchiefs to the female, for I saw the silk hanging down from under the prisoner's arm, and instantly ran after him, and by the time he was turning out of the door into the street, I was within a yard and a half of him - Mr. Norton was coming in at the time, and spoke to me; we both followed him calling, Stop thief! and overtook him about twenty yards off; he turned up a narrow court - he had the silk when we laid hold of him - I saw him drop it a few yards in the court; it is ninety-seven yards - he ran a few yards and was laid hold of in my sight - I instantly returned, and the woman had gone also - Mr. Norton picked the silk up - when the prisoner was brought back to the shop, and I said I should go for an officer, he said, "Oh, don't."</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q.Have you the knife here? A. Yes; the prisoner is a labourer in the East India House; it is a knife which he uses to open tea chests - I had lodged in the same room with him for about three months and slept with him; I had had words with him, in the presence of Jones, on the Monday night; I said he had come home drunk on the Sunday night, and complained that his toe nails annoyed me in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night this happened, was not the prisoner in the room before you went into it? A. He was not; he came in after I was in bed and asleep; I was awoke by his marching about the room and using abusive language; he came along on my side of the bed and stumbled down by my box; he was not so much in liquor for he could lock the door and wind up a Dutch clock; I don't think he sat on the bed at all; I first saw the knife after I let Mrs. North in, as he was coming round the bed, and the instant I saw it I knocked him down; my hand was bleeding before I let Mrs. North in, and before I saw the knife - Mrs. North said on the Monday morning that she saw my hand bleeding - I believe the prisoner has an annuity from his friends; I never said I might as well have the annuity as him, and that his friends would pay it to me, and I would prosecute him to get him out of the way; I said nothing to that effect at any time; I don't know his friends; I might use abusive language to him on the Monday - and on that night he went out of the room, came in again, and said,"Now Mr. Edward, if you say another word to me, I have got a brace of pistols in my pocket and will send a bullet into you;" I might have said I would knock his head off.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you suppose the knife was likely to lay on your side of the bed, or was it always in his possession? A. He generally carries it about him in his waistcoat pocket, and used it to cut his victuals; it is very sharp - he got into bed with his breeches and waistcoat on; I suppose he got into bed to do as he had threatened, and that was the reason I struck him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On Wednesday morning, the 24th of April, I saw the prosecutor; he had a simple wound of the integuments, partly entering the tendons of the hand: I think I dressed his hand four times myself; his hand was disabled during the time I attended him; he has very nearly the use of his hand now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was not a very severe wound? A.Certainly not; if the prosecutor's hand came in contact with the prisoner's, with the knife in it, such a wound might be inflicted; but it would depend on the position of the hand.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.Will you describe the cut? A. It was a transverse cut across the back of the hand, dividing the integuments and one of the tendons; the hand and the knife must have been very nearly in a line with each other.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house; I saw the prosecutor's hand, and it appeared to me dreadfully wounded; and I moreover saw a wound on his left arm, a scratch with a little drop of blood flowing from it; and on examining his shirt there was a cut exactly corresponding - on searching the prisoner's person, I found a variety of documents, and among them a duplicate, and next morning I stated to him what I had taken from him, and mentioned the duplicate, he said "Ah, that is the thing that did all the mischief;" I said, how so; he said, "I pawned a coat that day, and with that I got intoxicated."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you spoken to Thomas Jones respecting this case? A. We may have got into conversation about the badness of the case; I did not use threatening language to deter him from giving evidence; I don't see what evidence he could give; he came to my house and requested me to give up the documents which I took from the prisoner - I refused; he said Mr. Wontner wished them to be given up, as they related to property; I said I would deliver them to Mr. Wontner myself; I found that was false; I saw

             the next day, and said,"How dare you come to me and state a falsehood, I certainly will tell the Judge what you have said to me;" I never used angry words towards the prisoner, nor demanded money of him; I took one shilling and ninepence from him when I searched him, and he ordered me to pay it to different people for services they had rendered him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I came home that night, I was going to cut my toe nails, Pinniger called me an old b-g-r and a boar; I took no notice of him, I was going to take my stockings off, and he fetched me a rap and down I went; I got up again, he aimed at me again and caught the knife, he said to me "I will have that annuity made over to me; your relations will pay me sooner than you; you have possession under two forged wills, I will get you transported" - Mr. Horton demanded nine shillings from me for taking me to and from the prison - I had taken this lodging to myself, but this young man came as a religious man, but I found him quite the opposite, and I believe there was some correspondence with my family; they have had me twice in Whitecross-street prison; the ill-treatment I have received from that man is most unaccountable; I had no animosity towards him, and did not mean to stab him, nor threaten his life; he came to me as savage as a bear both on Saturday and Sunday night; Mr. Jones and Mrs. North could hardly keep him from me; my life has often been threatened by him.</p>

            . I keep the house in White-street, where these persons lodge; the prisoner came home on this night about half-past ten o'clock; the prosecutor was then in bed; the prisoner came into my room very much intoxicated; I could not get him up, he staggered so; I got him to sit down, he talked a good deal to himself, and was quite stupid, he fell down all along the hearth; I got him up to bed with the assistance of the watchman very quietly; I took off his shoes and gaiters, untied his garters and the knees of his small-clothes, and put him on the bed-side; he was quite comfortable and wished me good night - I left the room, and went up in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to see if all was safe; when I first went into the room with him, Pinniger was in bed, I told him to get further and make room for the prisoner, but he was very heavy in sleep, and I don't think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160055"/>he knew I was there; when I went up again Pinniger opened the door to me, and the moment I entered he struck the prisoner down all along on the floor; the prisoner was out of bed standing on his feet; when I left him he had his coat on, but he then had only his breeches and waistcoat on - the prosecutor was sober, thelight was burning, I could see the prosecutor distinctly, I was close to him, I saw no blood at all - when he knocked the prisoner down he never moved hand nor foot; I said "Oh Edward, how could you do so;" he turned to his bed-side and said "Do you think I can stand this?" and as he spoke he wound a handkerchief round his hand, but I don't know why, I was some distance off; I saw no blood - the prisoner was very drunk and quite helpless; I did not see anything in his hand; I never heard the prosecutor say anything about the prisoner's annuity; the prisoner was a particularly inoffensive man, rather a peace-maker than a peace-breaker.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. On your oath was there no knife in the room? A. There was; because he had it in his hand, but I did not see it till it was put into my hand after the blow was given - my daughter took it out of his hand as she said - I cannot say whether the prosecutor's hand was or was not cut when I entered the room, or whether his handkerchief was then round his hand; I saw him wind one round his hand afterwards; I saw blood on his shirt, I suppose that came from his hand; there was a hole in his shirt, it looked more like a tear than a cut.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prosecutor hit the prisoner with his right or left hand? A. His right hand, I am sure of that; there was only two spots of blood on his shirt; he told me he struck the prisoner with his right hand, but I cannot say, I was so frightened; he is not left-handed.</p>

Pinniger said, Do you think I can stand this? look at my hand, and then wrapped a handkerchief round his hand; he had no handkerchief round his hand when I entered the room - I am sure he had struck the prisoner with his right hand.</p>

Yes, I do; I had no talk about giving her 5s., she asked me to go to a house, but I refused - I had left Bagnigge-wells an hour and a half before I found myself in Oxford-street; I had been walking in some streets, I don't know their names - I had not been into any public-house, nor spoken to any woman that night - I believe I went into two streets with the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Wilson, of Eyre-street-hill. I was in Brook-street on the evening in question; I saw Mr. Jones there, and three or four young men about him - the prisoner came in front of him and snatched his watch from his fob; it appeared to be a silver watch - they all ran over the road and up Fox-court; I was taken to a house in Drury-lane about ten or eleven o'clock the same night, and the officer brought the prisoner down to me - I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This occurred all in a moment? A. Yes, the prisoner was a stranger to me; I went on to Leather-lane after I saw it, and when I got there it was about five minutes past seven o'clock; when I went to the public-house, the prisoner was brought down to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, consider; did you not say when you saw him,"I think he is the man?" A. No, I did not; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then you did not say "I think he is the man?" A. The policeman brought him down and said"Do you know this man;" I said he is very much like him - he then turned round and I said, "That is the man, but he has changed his waistcoat."</p>

I am a watch-finisher, and live at No. 21, Tash-street - on the evening my son was taken, I went from home at six o'clock, leaving him at home at tea; I returned a quarter before nine; I had left him a piece of work which he could not do in less than an hour and a half or two hours - the work was done.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You live but a short distance from Brook-street? A. No, the prisoner might have gone out - I can't account for the officer picking him out in Drury-lane, but I believe he frequently went there in the evening - my son was in trouble once before, I think it was for stealing a plane.</p>

             (police-constable H 169).

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you know the prisoner before. A. No, Sir - I did not see a woman near my van - I know Jerusalem-passage, but I don't know of any green-grocer's shop there - there was a tall man standing by my van when I left.</p>

            . I keep the Horse and Groom-inn. I heard of the loss of this package; I went out instantly down the Woodbridge estate - I saw the prisoner carrying this package, I asked him politely if he would walk back with me into St. John-street; he said no, that he was employed to carry it by a man - he then threw it down, and said I am d-d if I carry it any further - I collared him, and he struggled with me; I was a minute or more before I could get him to come back with me; he then said I was a hard-hearted young man, and he wished me to let him go - I brought him back, and gave him to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not seize him by the throat? A. No - I did not tell him it was stolen at first, but I asked him to turn back - I had not seen a tall man about the van; I could not, as I was in the warehouse - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160058"/>held the prisoner tight, and might have got my knuckles into his neck - I did not hear him say that a woman had seen it given to him, he said he was going to Percival-street with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not throw it down till he took hold of my collar and tore my shirt - I said you are not the young man that hired me to carry it; he said "You come back with me," I said I did not know why I should - I had been hired by a tall young man to carry it to Percival-street - I am a porter in the City.</p>

            . My mother lives at No. 25, Wilson-street, Somers-town; for the last ten weeks I have been backwards and forwards at the prisoner's - she enticed me awayfrom my mother, and told me if my mother locked me in to draw the bolt, and she would give me a bellyfull of victuals to come and live with her - when I got to her she used to send me out for a halfpenny ball of cotton, she did not say what shop I was to go to, but I was to get anything that laid on the counter, and bring it home to her, which I used to do, and she went and pawned it - I got this piece of gingham out of Mr. Lee's shop; it was on the counter near the window; I went there for a halfpenny ball of cotton - she used to tell me to draw it off the counter, put it under my shawl, and if the shop was full to come out and say nothing to anybody - when the prisoner took this to pawn she said she got a shilling for it, and she showed me the shilling in her hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Now, I would have you be very cautious; when was it you went to this woman's house? A. I cannot tell what day, it is about ten weeks ago - there is a man lives with my mother, and he ill treated me; he wanted to take liberties with me, as he had with my sister Sarah; I was frightened at him - I met this prisoner in the street, and told her of it, but I did not ask her for shelter; she took me home - I slept there, and staid some days - she did not tell me she could not keep me long, nor say she could not afford to take the bread out of her children's mouths to support me - after I had been there some days, my mother fetched me away, but the prisoner had sent me out stealing before that - I had been absent from the prisoner for a week, but I went back again- before I got this gingham, she told me I had better go down Shoreditch or somewhere; I lived in a court in Shoreditch, and slept there during the week I was away from the prisoner - I don't know the person's name, but the prisoner gave me 6d. to pay for my lodging, because she said my father-in-law was looking after me - I did not go to the prisoner's house that week, but I saw the man she lives with, and he told me that she sent word for me to come back - I had been sleeping at the prisoner's for two or three nights before I took the gingham; she knew where I got it, and she gave me the money to buy the cotton.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to work and met this child, I asked where she had been, she said sleeping all night under her sister's steps; I said "What is the matter?" she said he has been taking liberties with me - when I got home at night I found her at my house, I said "Are you not gone home," she said "No, I will make any shift if you will let me stay here;" I said "You know how you treated me before when you stole my little girl's boots" - I went out the next morning telling her to go home, but she did not; she went and slept under the stairs; I could not bear she should do that, and I let her be with me for a few days, when her mother and two men came and kicked up a great piece of work - she then went home for two or three days, and then came to me again; with her body very much wealed; I took her in, and named it to several persons, in hopes they would take her, but no one did; I told her again to go away, and she went for a week, but returned again - I was born in Islington, and no one can say any thing against me - on the day she brought this home I had been out at work all day, and she said she had a little place to go to the next day, and she had picked this up a great way off, and I pawned it for her.</p>

On the night of the third of May, about twelve o'clock, I was on duty on the bank of the river, near Chiswick, with two of my brother-officers - we heard some persons conversing across the river; I and my brother-officer went and took a boat at Chiswick-ferry, and proceeded across the river towards the spot where we had heard the conversation - we got half-way across and saw a barge moored off the Surry side, and saw a boat shoot a-head of the barge, coming towards the Middlesex side - we rowed round the barge, and it was loaded with lime; we followed the boat but lost sight of it, but a boat passed us in-shore laden with sacks and two men in it; it was coming towards us, not in the same direction the other had gone; we turned, suspecting their's was the boat we had been following; it passed us so near that I was obliged to unship my scull to let them pass, one of the men in it was Thomas; I could not swear to the other man; we followed them, and they drove it up a drain which carries the water through the meadows; we did not observe it go up the drain but saw the stern sticking out - we jumped on board and found it was drawn on shore, but not fastened; we got on shore, but the mud was so thick we could not proceed after the men, and the fog coming on we got on board again, and found the sacks of oats and beans on board, we took the boat to Chiswick - Mr. Downs owned the boat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose boat did you take to go in pursuit of them? A. A waterman's at Chiswick; it was not foggy at first, it was a fine night; I had not seen Thomas before.</p>

             (police-constable T 100). I got into the boat with the other officer, the boat passed us in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160061"/>shore with the two prisoners in it; we followed it; it ran into a creek and the men made their escape - we secured the boat and the corn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did it pass your boat very near? A. Yes, so near that the man next the boat had to unship his scull; they must have been within half a yard of us; we did not stop them, as we did not know it was the boat we were in pursuit of - but I thought it might be, as I had seen two men in the other boat, just as it was gaining the point where we lost it.</p>

             (police-constable T 120). I was with the other officers and saw the boat; it came within the length of a scull of us, I should think within two yards and a half; there were two men in it rowing, but I was rowing at the time and did not notice them; we took the boat with this corn in it - we took the prisoners at Watson's mother's, at Brentford.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When did you take them? A. On the evening of the 4th of May; I don't know whether they could have got away.</p>

            . I live with my father at Richmond. On the 3rd of May Watson was in his employ; I have seen the boat in which the officers found the corn, it is my father's, and is the boat Watson had to go away with the lug - he had no business of ours at Chiswick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was he to go with the boat? A. To St. Katherine's Docks; the boat ought to have been in London.</p>

            . I am Watson's mother, and live at Mrs. Vaughan's, at Brentford. On the day before my son was taken, I had been on the river with him, and Thomas, and Mrs. Vaughan - between seven and eight o'clock we were hailed by Chuter, who asked my son if he would give him any thing to drink, which he agreed to do; Chuter said if we would take him back he would come on shore and have some - my son said Thomas should take him back, as his arm was bad and he could not row; my son did not row the boat at all, from the time Chuter got into it; when we got on shore and had had something to drink, my son, Mrs. Vaughan, and I went home, and Thomas came with the boat; he and my son then went out to Chuter; it was then a quarter before nine, and at a quarter-past eleven o'clock they all three came to the door together; I did not see them, but my son came in, and was in bed by half-past eleven o'clock; Thomas came in and was in bed about ten minutes after my son; I slept in the same room - my son was called at half-past four o'clock in the morning and got up; he could not have got up before without my knowing it.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.How long have you known Thomas? A.Nearly twelve months; he has lodged at my house full six months - there are only four rooms in the house; I have slept in the same room with my son and Thomas ever since before Christmas - I went bofore the magistrate at Hammersmith, but was not called - I know it was a quarter before eleven o'clock when the three came to my door; I looked at the clock - I know Thomas went to bed ten minutes after my son; I do not sleep very soundly; I fastened my door on the inside; I knew my son had to go to London to the lug, but he came home to have his are dressed, as he had scalded it; I don't know whether that would disable a man from rowing, but he did not row when we were out that day.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.When they first came to the door, after they had been to drink, they came altogether? A. Yes, my son did go out to help them launch the boat off, but he came in again directly; Thomas rowed Chuter to the barge and then he came in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you bolt your door? A. I locked it sir; Thomas went to bed last and I then got up and locked the door; it is but a small room.</p>
               <p>MRS. VAUGHAN. I keep the house in which Mrs. Watson, her son, and Thomas reside. I was in Mr. Downs' boat with them that evening - Thomas rowed the boat as Watson had scalded his arm; Chuter was in his barge, he called to Watson and asked him if he would give him some beer if he came on shore; Watson said he would, and they fetched him - we afterwards went home, and the two prisoners went out to meet Chuter; they all three came to my door afterwards; and after launching the boat, Watson came in and went to bed, and Thomas came in in about ten minutes; he went to hed in the same room where Mrs. Watson and her son slept - I don't sleep in that room, I sleep with my husband - neither of the prisoners went out again that night, for I was up ironing till half-past three in the morning - they could not go out without going through the room I was in.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. What is your husband? A. A labouring man - Mrs. Watson goes out nursing, and when she is at home she sleeps in the same room with her son and Thomas - when the three men came to the door it was a quarter past eleven; I know the time; I have a clock in the room - I did not exactly look at it - I can't tell how many times I have talked this matter over.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I said I would not take sixpence of him nor of any man; he said he had no more money, but he would give me some the next morning - he then took hold of my neck and knocked my head on the ground - I never had any money but the sixpence he gave me, and one shilling and a farthing, which I had earned where I had been at work - I called out for the officer myself - I don't know two persons in the neighbourhood, but when I cried out one of them went for the officer - the officer found one half-crown on the prosecutor - it was glass that broke; it was not money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. The gold tops and the garnet broach are certainly yours? A. Yes; I speak to them positively - I had told him not to use any of that gold in my business - he was in the habit of using small quantities of gold - he did not say he had used it in my business, he said he used it for himself - I know Gleeson; I cannot tell whether I said in his presence to the prisoner, that it would be better for him to tell me the truth, I might, but if I did, I believe it was some time before the prisoner was taken into custody - when his father was at my house, when I was speaking about his calling on persons for goods in my name - Gleeson works for me, but I don't recollect speaking to the prisoner on this subject in his presence - the prisoner was to leave me this year; I had heard he was to set up in business.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did the conversation you had with the prisoner in the presence of his father, allude to this transaction? A. No; to some other - when he spoke to me about this he said, if I would not do anything to him he would make the gold good.</p>

I took the prisoner - his master said he had lost a great deal of property and he would make no promise to the prisoner; he said if his master would forgive him he would restore the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160063"/>gold - I have the coral necklace and other articles which I got at Mr. Campbell's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you see Miss Campbell? A. Yes; this brooch was in Mr. Campbell's shirt, and I received these gold tops from him, and this snap from Miss Campbell.</p>
               <p>Mr. COOPER. I know these tops and this brooch - I had several pairs of these tops in my counting-house; the brooch is marked.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who puts the mark on your articles? A.Sometimes myself, sometimes other persons- the prisoner has marked some - I have sold some brooches, though not perhaps exactly of this description - I have no mark on these tops, but they are not a common pattern; I only know one workman who makes that pattern - there may be others.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Did you miss any brooches from your stock which have not been sold? A. Yes, several.</p>

A.Only Mrs. Cooper, who would occasionally go to the back of the counter; I have two persons who work in-doors, and several I employ out of doors; they have not access to my stock - this letter is the prisoner's writing, and is signed with his name. - (Letter read.)</p>

               <p>To Miss Isabella Campbell - My dear Isabella; - I hope this will find you well, as it leaves me at present. I am sorry to say you will be under the necessity of coming to Hatton-garden on Tuesday next, to say I gave you the coral-necklace, the coral-snap, also the gold tops, and the garnet brooch which your father had. Do not say any thing else; perhaps they may ask you many questions, but you need not answer any unless you choose. I hope, my dearest love, you will come, or else I shall be kept until you do come. For God's sake come, and keep up your spirits, as I am almost certain it will be all right then, if not then, it will, of course, be right at the trial.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. COOPER. Were you at Hatton-garden? A. Yes; Miss Campbell did not come, I believe she is out of the way - I have been to Bristol in search of her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Is your husband here? A. No; I have been married eight years, we were married at Aldgate Church - I made a charge of a similar nature to this against a woman who was tried in the Old Court; I swore to her, but she was acquitted - I was robbed of fifteen shillings then; I have been talking about this case - my husband and I were offered ten pounds not to come into court, but my husband said not ten pounds, nor one thousand pounds should prevent it.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever say to anybody that you were very sorry you had not seen the prisoner before you found the bill, and you would not have done it? A.Never; I know Mr. Meek, he is the person who offered me ten pounds not to prosecute; he gave me his card to call on him, and I and my husband went together - I said to a woman that I was very sorry that I was obliged to come - I was very sorry the young man had been guilty of what he had, but I never said that if his father had come forward on Monday, and made proposals to me, I would have cleared the boy - I did not say I would instruct my child to say that she did know whether it was the prisoner - I don't know how the woman I swore against came to be acquitted; the jury found her guilty of an assault, and they said they could not find her guilty of that in that court.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I am turned fourteen years of age - I was with her on this night I had seen her put some money into her pocket before she went to Shoreditch Church - I saw the prisoner and three others get round her; I recognize the prisoner as one of them, and while he held her arms one of the others put his hand into her pocket, and took the money; three of them then ran off, but my mother caught hold of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160064"/>prisoner against the church-rails - my mother was struck in the mouth when she lost her money; I called the policeman, who came and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You left your mother with the prisoner? A. Yes, against Shoreditch Church; the prisoner was taken in about five minutes; he could not have got away, my mother kept hold of him, and kept her eye on him - it was not my mother who told me to say I was fourteen years old, I am that age - she told me she prosecuted a woman for robbing her of 15s., but I was in the country at the time - I have been at home two years; she told me of it soon after I came home - I did not say that my mother was robbed of four bright shillings on this occasion - I did not see the man take the money out of her pocket; we were going to meet my father; it was about half-past nine o'clock - my father is a <rs id="t18330516-118-viclabel611" type="occupation">wine-porter</rs>

             (police-constable H 49). On the 8th of May, I saw a crowd opposite the church - the prosecutrix came to me, and called me, she was on the curb; she pressed on, and I followed her for about twelve yards; she passed through a number of persons and pointed out the prisoner to me, who was leaning against the rails, she said he was the man who had robbed her - the last witness said, "No, mother, it was a man in a hairy cap"- but the prosecutrix said he was with him; she said yes, he was - I asked her if she was positive he was the man - she said yes, she was; the prisoner seized me, and made no further reply - I then took him to the station; she then stated that he was not the man who robbed her, but that he had held her arms while the other robbed her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was there not a great crowd assembled? A. Yes, a bell-ringer was dead, and they were ringing the dead peal over him; I suppose there were fifty or sixty persons there; the prosecutrix came out from the people, and called "Police" - she certainly had not hold of the prisoner at that time; she was going on towards him when she spoke to me - her back was towards me; I don't know whether she had been at a greater distance from the prisoner - her face was rather towards me when she spoke to me; I should think she could not be looking at the prisoner then - there certainly were some persons standing between the prisoner and her; she pointed the prisoner out to me when I came up to him; she had not hold of him in my presence.</p>

            . I am an iron-plate worker. I have known the prisoner eleven years - I live at No. 3, Somerset-place, Hoxton - the prisoner was five years and a half in my employ; he has borne a very good character - I never offered the prosecutrix ten pounds.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you any interview with the prosecutrix? A. Yes, on Thursday last; I was walking in the Old Bailey-yard, I asked the prisoner's father which was the prosecutrix, and he pointed her out to me - I asked her if she was the prosecutrix of Allen, she said she was; I said I thought she was wrong in the identity of the person - while I was speaking to her an Irishman came up and said "The d - I of bit of necessity is there for this boy to go before the bar at all, come and have a pint of porter" - I went with them, and had a pint of porter; the man took the pot up and drank, and said "Two or three sovereigns will do away with this - you stop here, and I will go out and talk to her" - they went out and said three or four minutes - I then went out and said, "Well, have you any thing to say to me?" the man said, "She will do nothing without her husband, you had better tell her where you live" - I gave her my card, and at about nine o'clock in the evening she, and her husband, and a girl, came to my house - the man said, "What have we come for?" I said, "That is best known to yourselves;" her husband said, "She is not come here to be bribed;" I said, "She will not be bribed by me, I will not give one farthing" - there was a gentleman in my parlour at the time - the prosecutrix said,"I wish I had seen you, if I had, I would never have filed the bill, for by God I spent the last penny I had to do it; we have not a bit of bread, do for God's sake give me a shilling;" I put my hand in my pocket, gave her two shillings, and shut the door.</p>

A.By his coming to me with goods from Mr. Meek - I was at Mr. Meek's on the evening when the prosecutrix called - I went to Mr. Meek's on business, and supped there - I must say I went by Mr. Meek's desire, as he expected the prosecutrix would call - I don't recollect that he stated he had given her his card; he thought it was a foul conspriracy against the prisoner, and that the prosecutrix would do anything for money - I knew the prisoner was charged with a capital felony, and that the prosecutrix was desired to call there - I went to witness what she might say - I did not see him give her two shillings, but I heard him say he did, as she had not a bit of bread to eat - I think the prisoner has left Mr. Meek a year and a half or two years - I have lived in the City-road thirteen years: I have two houses and two shops - I had not seen the prisoner after he left Mr. Meek's.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.How came you to busy yourself about it?

I don't know whether it is the house of the firm, or not - I don't know how the rent and taxes are paid - on Wednesday afternoon, the 1st of May, I was going towards the door, when a gentleman told me that three men had cut our window, and gone up Sun-street; I pursued, and saw a person who I thought had got the property; I went on to a second person, and he called to the prisoner,"Run it;" the prisoner then ran down Peter-street, and I pursued him; he turned into Dunning's-alley, which I suppose he thought was a thoroughfare, but it was not; and I came up to him and seized him; I kept him till I got assistance - we threw him on the ground, and while he was there he raised himself and turned from his pocket this pair of pistols, which are my employer's property - we got to the shop, and I found a pane of glass had been cut, and piece of glass had been pushed in - these pistols and salt holders had been within reach of that place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was it the window in Crown-street which had been cut? A. No, the side window in Long-alley; there is no shutter at the back of that window - I had my attention called to that window within twenty minutes, I know it was secure, and at that time I saw this property safe - our private mark is on this pair of pistols, it is Mr. Attenbrough, Seniors mark; I had them in my hand, and have cleaned them several times - the prisoner had got about forty yards from the shop, when he turned the corner; he was about twenty yards before me - it was rather dusky - there were not more than three or four persons round the prisoner when he dropped them; he scuffled with me, but I picked up this pair of pistols while we were scuffling; three of us could scarcely hold him; the scuffle lasted twenty minutes, but the pistols fell from him in two minutes - another of these pistols afterwards dropped, which I took up, but I did not see it drop from him.</p>

Yes, Sir; I was close to him, and he kicked me- five or six persons had hold of him, and there were other persons came round; there might be eight or ten persons - he was on the ground when he took the pistols from his pocket - the witness took three of the pistols; another pistol and the salts then came from the prisoner's pocket; I took up these salts, and another man took up the odd pistol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never had the salts; I plead guilty to receiving one pair of pistols, but I did not have the others; I did not break the window - there were above thirty persons round us when the officer came up, I was under a cart, with seven on the top of me.</p>

In November last year I had dealings with the prisoner for timber, and he offered me a bill of exchange in payment (looking at a bill), this is it - I objected to do it without further security; I made inquiry as to who the acceptor was; it was accepted at the time the prisoner gave it to me - it purports to be accepted by John Gore, and is addressed to John Gore, No. 2, Camomile-street, Bishopsgate - The prisoner at that time lived in Camomile-street, and was a carpenter. - I inquired and found Mr. Gore a butcher, in Camomile-street, was a respectable man, and I was satisfied - a Mr. Wagner came to me and gave me security as far as ten pounds if the bill should not be paid; he is in court; before Wagner came, the prisoner said Wagner was a surveyor, that he was doing a job under him, and he should call and speak to me as to his character, if I desired it - Wagner called and offered the guarantee before I made the inquiry - I asked the prisoner if Gore was a respectable man and how long he had lived there; he said he had lived there two or three years, that he was a butcher, and very regular in his business, and a steady man - I paid the bill into my banker's; it was a three-months' bill; it was returned to me on the 26th of February dishonoured; after that Mr. Wagner called to pay the ten pounds.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you keep the bill after it was dishonoured? A.I did, till a few days before I applied at the Mansion-house, I had then given it to Mr. Newman, who applied to me for it, and gave an undertaking that it should be paid; he wished to have it for the purpose of prosecuting the prisoner - I believe he is an independent gentleman; I had seen him once or twice before - he gave me an undertaking for nineteen pounds the entire amount due on the bill - I am not at the expense of this prosecution.</p>
               <p>JAMES GORE. I am a butcher, and live in Camomile-street, Bishopsgate. I know the prisoner - (looking at the bill), this acceptance is not my hand-writing, nor my name; I did not authorize anybody either to draw on me or accept that bill for me - there is no person named

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Had you a conversation of some lenght with the gentleman who called? A.I had, he was a very few minutes with me; it was not a quarter of an hour - I do not recollect the person of Wagner; I cannot exactly state when the prisoner applied about the bill - I may have accepted a bill before I was in business, not knowing the nature of bills, but not since; I have been in business three years and am twenty-six years old - I believe I never did accept a bill; I swear I never accepted this bill - I never told anybody I had accepted this bill - it was presented at my house on a Monday morning, while I was at market, when I returned I was told a bill drawn by Spring had been presented - I think it was about two months ago - I went to the prisoner's house directly, to inquire for him, but he had left; I saw Mr. Newman there - I named this to a person in my street, and he told me if I had nothing to do with it to take no notice of it, and I did not - I am sure I told the gentleman who called that I had not accepted the bill; I cannot say how long that was before I was at the Mansion-house - I was present when Wagner was examined at the Mansion-house, but cannot say whether it was him that called on me about the bill.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.How soon after you heard of the bill did you go to the prisoner's house? A. The same morning, directly I returned from market; I found he had left - he never returned.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Did you ever in your life sign your name to a bill as John? A. Never, it is not my writing, I don't know whose it is - my hand-writing is under the bill.</p>

I was in Bishopsagate-street, with my brother, when he met the prisoner; I think it was about two months ago - my brother, I believe, called him a pretty fellow to try to get him into such trouble - the prisoner said, "Mr. Gore, you need not trouble yourself, it is all settled, the bill is paid" - this acceptance is not my brother's hand-writing.</p>

            . I live at Brixton-place, Surrey, I live on my property. The prisoner was a tenant of mine, he lived in a house of mine, No. 9, Camomile-street; he quitted it on Saturday, the 23rd of February - I have frequently seen him write - this bill is decidedly not drawn in the prisoner's hand-writing; but the acceptance is in the prisoner's usual way of writing - I first saw this bill of exchange on Monday morning, the 25th of February, the day it became payable; I was in the house - Mr. James Gore and another person called; I merely saw the bill - I said I had nothing to do with it; that Spring was gone; I presume they took me for Spring - I afterward went to Mr. Gore for the bill; in consequence of what occurred - this prosecution is instituted at my expense.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you distrained on the prisoner? A. I did; he has brought an action against me since for defamation, but it is an action of robbery - upon his bringing the action, I endeavoured to find out what I had said, and found he was in debt to every body, and was a complete swindler - it was said,"defamation, nonsense, there is forgery against him;" and it was six weeks before I could find this out - I expect if he is convicted, it will be an answer to the action - that is one reason why I have taken this up, but it is the complete system of plunder; the man has brought several actions against me - Wagner was sent to entrap me - my object is the love of prosecuting such swindlers and wretches that I have been beset by; it is nothing but for the sake of public justice' - it will necessarily save me from the action - I stated at the Mansion-house, that the prisoner would have been ten quarters in my house, if he had stopped till Lady-day, and I had received but two quarters in money; the rent was fifty pounds a year - he has got the account - by my buying the fixtures, and work he has done, the rent is settled up to Christmas - I cannot say how much he owed me at Christmas, for he never paid me but by driblets - this is my receipt for twenty-two pounds thirteen shillings, (looking at it) - he does not now owe me a farthing for rent - I did not swear at the Mansion-house that he owed me money for rent; I said he owed me money - he has cut my house about - he was a carpenter, and I allowed him to do all the business on the estate - my sister died and I gave him the funeral; he said he was poor; and I advanced him twenty pounds, then twenty eight pounds, and altogether he drove the bill for the funeral up to one hundred and nineteen pounds, odd- this receipt, (looking at it) is my wife's writing; it is for a quarter's rent due at Christmas, but his bills are included; it was not paid in money - I understood he has brought two actions against me; it is an action of trover- the action is for detaining pieces of wood - I never saw Wagner in my life till he called on me - I saw him at No. 3, Broadway, Doctors' Commons - I went to him after he had called on me, to give him a job to survey a house, as he told me he should be a considerable loser by Spring - I did not know him till Monday the 25th, when he called on me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.Wagner called on you on the 25th? A. Yes, the very day the bill was presented, about a quarter of an hour after; he did not speak favourably of the prisoner - the receipts produced were given on the balancing of accounts between us, allowing for work which he had done - I never received but twelve pounds from him in money - I was examined at the Mansion-house by desire of the prisoner's solicitor.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. By whom was the bill brought to the prisoner's house on the 25th of February? A. By Mr. Walton, the holder, and Mr. Gore, who said it was neither his name nor hand-writing, and he wrote on the bill "The above is neither my name nor hand-writing,

            . I am an officer of the City. I took the prisoner into custody on the 6th of May, on St. Andrew's-hill, Doctors' Commons, coming out of the Three Castles public-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (Written). Mr. Newman distrained upon me for rent - all accounts between us were however settled, (and although he had the cruelty to insinuate on my examination before the Lord Mayor, among other things equally untrue, that, I had been in his house ten quarters, and he had only been paid two) a balance of about nine pounds was found to be due to me after paying all the rent due to him. Upon this settlement I quitted the premises and the neighbourhood, as I felt myself disgraced by the distress put in by Mr. Newman; although it proved there was nothing due to him, and as he still retained possession of some property belonging to me, I commenced legal proceedings against him; and to get rid of the consequences, do I attribute the persecutions of Mr. Newman, for he afterwards called upon a Mr. Greig, who had accepted a bill for me, and insinuated that it was a forgery, which Mr. Greig denied - with Mr. Gore, whose name I am this day charged with forging he succeeded, and has prevailed upon him to deny his acceptance to the bill. Gentlemen, it is necessary I should explain under what circumstances I obtained Mr. Gore's acceptence: - I had been employed by Mr. Wagner, to do the carpenter's work of some houses at Hoxton; Mr. Walton, the timber merchant, would not let me have the timber without I gave him some security, and Gore's acceptance was obtained and deposited with him; at which time I also paid him ten pounds, and I prevailed upon Mr. Wagner to pay him ten pounds more, on account of the work I had done for him: at this time Mr. Newman well knew I had credit with Mr. Walton, and that this bill was becoming due, and I believe was in possession of my house when the bill became due, and was presented to Gore, and who sent the notary's clerk to my house, from whom I believe Newman received the ticket. Up to this time, nor for two months afterwards, had an insinuation been made against me, that the bill was a forgery; on the contrary, Gore, on my wife's going to his shop for meat, had, upon more than one occasion, said he hoped I would be prepared for the bill (but I am deprived of her testimony, as I am advised the law will not allow her to be a witness for me) and after I had left the neighbourhood, I got Mr. Wagner to call on Gore to tell him not to make himself uneasy about the bill: to him Gore did not say one word about its being a forgery, but said he only did it to assit me. There is one circumstance I should explain to you, - when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160068"/>I had drawn the bill, I had put the wrong Christian name; Gore, however, said that was of no consequence, and it was so accepted. Gentlemen, bear in mind, Gore must have known of the presentment of the bill at his house; had it been a forgery, would he have waited two months to consider about giving charge of me? I was on intimate terms, and used to ride out in his cart with him, and he has on a former occasion assisted me. Newman also knew of the bill's being presented; although he two months afterwards buys up the bill to incite this charge against me. I am ruined by him, and am pennyless.</p>
               <p>JOHN WAGNER. I am an accountant; I live at No. 3, Broadway, Doctors' Commons, Blackfriars. I had employed the prisoner to do builder's work for me at some houses; he was going on with them when I paid Mr. Walton ten pounds on account of this bill - I called on Gore very shortly after the bill became due; I introduced myself by saying, "I believe you are the acceptor of a bill now in the hands of Mr. Walton?" Gore replied, somewhat pettishly,"I know nothing at all of it; I cannot pay it; I only did it to serve him" - I had known Spring about three months, he conducted himself as an honest, although a poor man - I have paid him nearly a hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You had a high opinion of him? A.I had a good opinion of him as an honest industrious man; he was not in my debt, except as to the guarantee.</p>
               <p>Q.Have not you said he was in your debt to the amount of forty pounds? A. I think not; I cannot answer further than that - I never represented that he was a very wicked man, and had robbed me of forty pounds - I saw Mr. Newman at the house in Camomile-street two days after Spring had been destrained on - it was the day the bill became due - Walton called on me to inquire the character of the man, and I called on him afterwards on Christmas morning, Spring was not in my debt then, but finding my job was going on rather slowly, I gave the guarantee to further the job and serve him; he was working on a house belonging to a party for whom I was concerned, named Bishop - Coster was not concerned in it; I swear he had nothing to with it; I did not know him - Bishop lives at Dalston, he is a poor builder, who has been unfortunate; he applied to me to assist him; I finished the carcased, and by that means the job got into my hands; his application to me was to aid and assist him to complete them, and perhaps to advance some portion of money, entirely as an agent - I am an accountant and agent, I don't call myself a surveyor, I will not swear I never called myself a surveyor; I have been a linen-draper; I have been a bankrupt and paid sixteen shillings and tenpence in the pound, at the age of twenty-three; I don't believe that I ever called myself a surveyor.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not represented yourself as employed to survey houses for Mr. Rhodes? A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you represented yourself as connected with Mr. Rhodes? A.Only as regards these carcases, which are on his estate; I called myself before the Lord Mayor an accoutant and conveyancer, I have not taken out a certificate as a conveyancer; I am not yet admitted at any inn of court, nor am I a student at any inn at present - I did not tell Mr. Newman the prisoner had robbed me of forty pounds, nor that I was very much inconvenienced for want of the money; I did not ask him to employ me as a surveyor; he asked for my card, and said he might put business into my hands; I did not say I was surveying houses for Mr. Rhodes, at Dalston - Mr. Newman called on me in Broadway, and said, he wanted me to value the dilapidations of a house; I said my time was so occupied that I could not undertake it at present; we talked about my terms; he said "Have you seen Spring lately, how is he going on?" I said, rather indifferently, and then we parted, for I had several parties waiting for me up stairs.</p>

               <p>Q.When you saw Newman at Camomile-street, did you complain of the prisoner's conduct? A. As far as related to the job I believe I did, as it went on slowly; I did not say he was a d - d rascal, I might say he was a rascal, and believe I did after Newman had made his statement to me, but I afterwards enquired into the truth of what he did say - I told Spring what Newman had said against him in a fortnight or ten days, and an action was brought against him; I was applied to as a witness.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you satisfy your mind upon enquiring that Mr. Newman, either mistakenly or designedly, told you what was wrong? A. Yes, I endeavoured to satisfy myself, and then mentioned it to Spring.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When you called on Mr. Gore, had you the bill in your hand? A.Certainly not; I had not seen it, I did not think it necessary to tell him how it was accepted; I applied to him as the acceptor; I swear positively he said he did it to oblige Spring, I knew nothing about the bill, except paying the ten pounds, till about three weeks ago; I saw the ten pounds written on the back of it; I paid the ten pounds after it was due on the 27th of February; and about three weeks ago Walton applied to me to see Newman - he told him it was a forgery; I said it could not be, and told me if Newman would pay him, by all means to take the money - I knew where Gore lived when I paid the ten pounds; Walton had told me it was accepted by Gore, a butcher, in Camomile-street; I cannot recollect whether he told me his christian name; the bill was never in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ask Gore how he could know nothing about it if he accepted it to serve the prisoner? A.No; I thought it proceeded merely from his manner; I had no further conversation with him about the acceptance - I have seen the prisoner write; I should say the signature 
               <persName id="t18330516-123-person1035">M.J. </persName>
            Spring, to the bill, is not his writing, the indorsement I should say is his writing.</p>
               <p>JAMES WALTON. I received the bill on the 23rd of November.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When did Wagner agree to the guarantee? A.It might be about Christmas; I had some doubts about the bill and he gave the guarantee to strengthen it; I had not then delivered all the timber.</p>

I am a linen draper, and live in St. John-street, Clerkenwell - the prisoner came to our house three times to offer ribbons - I saw him the second and third times, I bought of him, on the 1st of May, twenty-four pieces of black ribbon on rollers, and on the 10th of May, we bought of him fifty-two half-pieces on rollers; I paid for them three shillings and three pence a-piece, which contains thirty-six yards, they were on rollers; the goods bought on the 10th of May were five-pence or sixpence below the market price, and we suspected from that, the did not come honestly by them and detained him, we asked how he came by them, he said his name was George Noble - on my very closely questioning him, he said he was a traveller, that his name was not George Noble, but he travelled for George Noble &amp; Co., of Bristol, and his name was George Jenkins, and that he lived at the corner of Bond-street, in Piccadilly; I found that false and gave him into custody; I made inquiry in the mean time, of different houses, and ascertained that the goods had been bought in Oldchange, by the prosecutor, and I caused information to be given to him; he afterwards told me that he lived in Clare-court.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Could I get access to behind the counter? A. Yes; but these were not behind the counter - he came to the shop to bring his work in; and sometimes shut it up for me; my apprentice was in custody with him - I have at times found my shop door open.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.How long was I in the watch-house before you searched me? A.You might be ten minutes, you could not have destroyed the duplicates, as too many were present.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Masterman and Co., who are agents to the Glastonbury bank. On the 20th of March, the prisoner came to our house, and brought two 10l. and two 5l. Glastonbury bank notes, which I produce; we had received a notice about Glastonbury bank notes before that - I at first asked him what he would have for them, and then referred to the book, and saw they were part of those desired to be stopped by the Post-office solicitor - he said he would have gold for them; I asked his name and address; he said Cohen, Edgware-road - when I found they had been stopped, I went and spoke to one of the principals, and showed him the notes, and Mr. Oxley required Cohen to come and speak to him - he told Cohen the notes had been stolen, and payment was stopped by request of the Post-office - he was then asked if he had any objection to go to Hooper and Co., Thames-street- he said no; I went with him to Hooper and Co., and saw Mr. Hooper, and told him the notes had been presented for payment; he requested me to walk to Mr. Peacock's office with Mr. Cohen - which I did, and saw Mr. Peacock, and told him what took place, and the prisoner was detained - I asked him how he got the notes; he said he took them from two men who were going to St. Katherine's-docks to take a passage to New South Wales; and at Mr. Peacock's office, there was a conversation; a Mr. Ramsay was present, he and I went into Mr. Peacock's room together; I had shown Ramsay the notes before I went into the office; I met Mr. Hooper at the Post-office - Mr. Peacock, when he first saw the prisoner, seemed very much surprised, and said,"Mr. Cohen, is it you?" - and questioned him how he became possessed of the notes - he said he took them of two men who came to his shop, and bought goods to the amount of 24l. or 25l. - their name and address were not on the notes, but the prisoner's name and address had been put on since - he said he had them from two men going to New South Wales - Mr. Peacock said that it was, (I think,) the third or fourth time he had had stolen notes in his possession, the prisoner replied that it was only the third time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. The notes are payable at your house? A. Yes - I did not know the prisoner before, but his house of business was known to our house, we occasionally had bills accepted by him in our hands - there was nothing whatever written on the notes when he brought them; he went with me willingly to my principal; we had received notice of the notes having been stolen about a week before, or more - he went readily with me to Mr. Hooper, and gave his name and address at once; he observed, as we went to Hooper's, that he had a cheque on Messrs. Scott, in Cavendish-square, which he wished to get cashed, and when it was proposed to go to Messrs. Peacock's office, he wished to go to the Minories - a 100l. note, and the cheque he spoke of was found on him; these bills of his have all passed through our house - (looking at them) they amount to above five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did any bills of his pass through your house under suspicious or dangerous circumstances? A. Some notes which had been received from him, for his acceptances, had been stated to be stolen - I should not have detained him if he had not gone willingly with me, as his name was known at our house.</p>

            . I am in partnership with Mr. Askew. On the 20th of March, I remember going to Mr. Peacock's office in the Post-office; the prisoner and last witness were there, and Mr. Ramsay - when the prisoner was brought in, Mr. Peacock said, "Mr. Cohen, is this you again?" his answer was, "It is" - Mr. Peacock said,"How did you come in possession of these notes?" he said, "I took them of two men, I have not their names; they were going to St. Katharine's-docks," that he sold goods for the notes, but did not recollect what kind of goods - Mr. Peacock observed, "It is very strange, you took these notes on Monday; this is Wednesday, and you do not recollect what you sold them for; come, try and recollect" - he said, "Well, perhaps half a dozen pair of trousers, as many jackets and stockings" - Mr. Peacock said, "How did they take them away?" he said, "In bundles" - Mr. Peacock said, "They must be very large bundles to amount to twenty-three or twenty-four pounds;" and the prisoner accounted for about 7l. or 8l. worth - the prices were asked; I believe he did not mention the prices, but the calculations were made by Mr. Peacock and myself - Mr. Peacock told him, according to calculation, they would not amount to above seven or eight pounds, they would not exceed ten pounds; he stated that to the prisoner - to my best recollection I heard him say so, and then he asked him who was in the shop at the time he sold the goods, whether his shopman was there; he said No; he was asked "Where was your shop man?" and said, "Out, collecting" - he was asked,"Where was he gone?" and said, "I don't know" - "At what time did he go out?" "At two o'clock" - "When did he return?" "I don't know, I cannot recollect, but I believe it to be about tea-time, about five o'clock" - "Was any other person in your shop?" "There might be part of my family, my children" - he was asked if he could not recollect the men if he saw them - I believe he said,"I did not know them" - Cohen demanded the notes; Mr. Peacock said he should not give them up, it was a case which will require very serious investigation, and Mr. Peacock said, "I believe this is the fourth time you have been here" - his answer was, "It is only the third," or,"It is the third."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you mean to represent, that Mr. Peacock mentioned the particular sum? A. He said it would not exceed ten pounds; the prisoner was in the room, but I don't know whether he spoke to him - I have no doubt he heard it, but cannot be certain; he was a few yards from Mr. Peacock, who addressed himself to all who where present, not the prisoner in particular, it was a general observation - I believe it was said that was but a small proportion; he said he kept no books - we did not ask him the price of each article; I made a calculation being competent to do so - according to the things generally sold in such shops, which are usually a low sort of things; I was never in his shop; I fixed a very low price.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand them to be second-hand clothes? A. No, but low-priced, as it is a clothes-shop - I never dealt in clothes; I once bought a low-priced top-coat for a person at one of these shops; he said he sold them to two men, and it is natural to suppose, if he called them men, they were not gentlemen - I believe Edgeware-road is not a very respectable place, not the part I am speaking of - I live in Guildford-place, Wilmington-square.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was the observation about the goods not exceeding ten pounds made by you or Mr. Peacock? A. I believe Mr. Peacock said so, or within a very few minutes I made the observation; Mr. Peacock said, "Don't you keep books?" - he said, "Not for daily taking, but for accounts."</p>

On his entering, the solicitor said, "Mr. Cohen, is that you?" he said, "Yes, it is" - he said, "Have you presented these notes at Masterman's?" he said, "Yes, I have" - "How did you become possessed of them?" he said, "I took them on Monday afternoon last of two persons," that he did not ask their names; they had come in to fit themselves out, and were going to New South Wales; they purchased different kinds of articles - he was asked to enumerate them, and said he could not - Mr. Peacock said, "You must recollect this was only last Monday" - he said, There might be half a dozen pair of trousers, stockings, and shirts, and he could not recollect any thing more - he was asked what amount the goods came to; he said about twenty-three or twenty-four pounds - it was suggested to him that these articles could not amount to that, but he could not recollect any others which he had sold- Mr. Peacock said, "Mr. Cohen, you must remember this is the fourth time stolen notes have been traced into your possession" - he immediately answered, "No, Sir, it is only the third" - he said he made no entry in his books, and could not give us the particulars of the articles, that his shopman was gone out collecting debts at the time, but he could not recollect where; that he had written several letters, he did not know to whom; that nobody was present but his wife, or some part of the family - he afterwards said, the two persons had other notes in their possession; it was remarked to him, that the articles he had sold must be very large to amount to twenty-three pounds - he said, they were rather heavy, that he made them up in two parcels of brown paper; he gave one to each, and he understood they were going in an omnibus - I afterwards went with an officer, and searched his premises, and found several letters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you take down the number of articles he said he had sold? A. No, I have taken down jackets, shirts, and trousers, I believe I before mentioned stockings instead of jackets - I believe he mentioned four articles; on a second conversation with him going to Bow-street, he told me the number of the articles he had sold; I am not aware that much more passed than I have taken down, but I was not in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160073"/>the room all the time - I am not aware that I have omitted any thing in his favour - a cheque and a hundred pound note were found on him, and some sovereigns which I did not count - I have spoken to one person who lives in his neighbourhood, but did not take him before any Justice - he was a Post-office letter-receiver, living within a short distance of him; I only asked him respecting certain persons supposed to reside in that neighbourhood - the prisoner's is a large shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What, in your judgment, is the value of articles exposed for sale there? A. Some, I should think, not worth more than one shilling and sixpence; there were coats perhaps as high as fifty shillings; it appeared a new and second-hand clothes shop.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. It was in the course of your duty to make such inquiries in the Edgeware-road, as you thought proper? A. It was; I only formed an opinion of the value of the articles - I believe as I left the office, my brother was putting a value on the different articles which the prisoner had said he had sold - the prisoner has surrendered here to take his trial; he was bound under a recognizance of one hundred pounds, and four sureties of one hundred pounds each; the prisoner said he had sold goods to the amount of twenty-three or twenty-four pounds for the notes; I understood him to mean that he had given change for the rest, but he did not say so.</p>

            . I belong to the Glastonbury Bank. These notes are duly issued and signed; there are no more of that number or date issued by the bank.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). On the 18th of March last I was at Mr. Flint's auction-rooms, a few doors from my own house, when my son came and told me that two men at home wanted to purchase some clothes. I asked him if James (meaning the shopman) was at home; he said no. I then left the rooms; when I came home there were two respectable looking men in the shop, who said they were recommended to me to purchase some goods, and that they had come from the country: they each selected goods to about 11l. or 12l. They each paid me a 10l. and 5l. note of the Glastonbury bank, payable at Masterman and Co.: after referring to my Directory, I found the firm to be good. I had no hesitation in taking them, I gave each of them their change. I then packed the goods in large sheets of paper, and they took them, saying they were going to St. Katherine's Docks, and they would take the omnibus: they each took their parcels, and left the shop. I then returned to Mr. Flint's auction-rooms. On the Wednesday following I was going to Leaf, Son, and Co., Old Change, to purchase a quantity of shawls, when I went with the notes in question to Masterman and Co. to get them changed. I presented them to Mr. Simpson, he asked my name and address, which I gave him; he then left me at the counter several minutes, when one of the principals came out and said he was sorry to inform me, but that these notes were stolen from a post-office letter, and Mr. Peacock had stopped the payment of them: he then asked me if I would accompany Mr. Simpson to Mr. Hooper in Thames-street, I said certainly. Mr. Simpson and myself went in together to Mr. Hooper, and on the way Mr. Simpson asked me how I came in possession of the notes. I told him as above stated: when we came to Mr. Hooper's, Mr. Simpson informed him I had tendered the notes for payment. Mr. Hooper said he could not say anything to it, but that we had better go to the Post-office. We then went together. Mr. Peacock asked me a great many questions how I came in possession of the notes, which I answered him in the same way as I did Mr. Simpson; he then put a great many more questions, which I answered, not knowing he intended to make my answers evidence against me, and to detain me; if I had known that I would have reserved my answers until I came before a magistrate. Mr. Peacock then asked me if I had any objection to be searched, I said I had none. An officer was sent for, he found in my possession nearly 200l. for which I gave a satisfactory account, and it was returned to me. Mr. Peacock then asked if I would allow an officer to search my house, I said I had no objection; and I gave Mr. Peacock the key of my desk. Mr. Peacock with an officer took me to Bow-street, and left me in custody at Bow-street. They would not tell any of my family where I was, until they had done making the search, which took some time; but what I had said at the Post-office was confirmed by my family at home, although none of them knew where I was at the time. Mr. Peacock and the officer returned to Bow-street. I was then taken to a private room before Mr. Minshull, and without being asked one single question as to the possession of the notes, was remanded to the House of Correction, and there kept in solitary confinement, at the request of Mr. Peacock, until the Saturday following; when, after the evidence being gone into, the magistrates were inclined to discharge me; but Mr. Peacock said, if the magistrate would remand me, he had no doubt he could bring further evidence against me; upon that the magistrates remanded me for a week. At the next examination Mr. Peacock failed to bring any further evidence against me, but requested the magistrate to hold me to bail to answer any charge that might be brought against me, when I was held in two sureties of 50l. each. A day before the last sessions Mr. Peacock called on me, and said it was their intention to prefer an indictment against me. I rendered at the last sessions, and at a great expense I put off the trial, using every means in my power since to trace the guilty party implicated, but have failed to do so. Gentlemen, I have taken these notes in my business, and I am entirely innocent of any guilty knowledge; if I had I would not have gone to Messrs. Masterman and Co. where I must have been well known, having paid at that house monies at different times to a large amount, for bills of exchange accepted by me. I have been in business upwards of twenty years; during that time I never let a bill go unpaid, and up to this present day my credit in the City of London is unlimited; so that I could, at a very short notice, obtain credit to a large amount. If I had been disposed to be dishonest, I could have done that which this court could not have interfered with me for. I return in my business between 4000l. and 5000l. per year, how then can I avoid those impositions being practised on me? If I refuse to take notes, I may as well shut up my shop, as some weeks I take 60l. or 70l. in notes; and am in the habit continually of taking country notes, living near the Paddington-canal, where boats come from all parts of the country, and coaches also. I usually look to my Directory, and if I find the bank good, and the notes payable in London, I never hesitate taking them. I had witnesses at the Bow-street office that would have proved my innocence, but the magistrates did not consider it a case to send to a jury, therefore I had no defence to make. Mr. Peacock summoned two persons from my neighbourhood to give evidence against me at Bow-street - when they came there Mr. Peacock examined them privately, and finding their evidence went to serve me, he did not call them. Would any body but a madman have gone himself to the house of Masterman and Co. knowing the notes to have been stolen, and have given his own name and address? 2ndly. Would I have waited; when I had many opportunities of going away, never being in custody until Mr. Peacock had arrived some time? I could easily have left Mr. Simpson, but I willingly went, after I was informed by Mr. Hooper that the notes were stolen. I trust, gentlemen, that these facts, with my character, will at once satisfy you of my innocence, and restore me to my wife and ten helpless children.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother-in-law. I was sent for to his house on the 12th of April; he mentioned that he had missed some money, and the prisoner was desired to bring his boxes down; he was asked what money he had, he said, a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and seven or eight shillings in silver; I asked if he was sure that was all; he said, there might be a shilling or two more - he then said there might be seventeen or eighteen shillings, but that was the utmost - there was found in the box a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, seven half-crowns and other silver; he said it was all his - Mr. Clarke took up a half-crown and said, "Is this yours?" he said, yes, but after a few minutes he confessed he had stolen it - I said, "Did you steal this half-crown from Mr. Clarke?" and he said, he did, but it was all he had stolen - Mr. Clarke said, "This is not all you have robbed me of you scoundrel;" he said, it was, but afterwards confessed it was not - he divided the silver and said part was his master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When the prisoner was asked whether it was not his master's, was not his answer, it may be? A. Yes, several times he said, "It may be," but when I asked him if he had stolen it, he said, he did - my brother-in-law must have heard it, I think - I am not certain that Mr. Clarke asked him if he had stolen it, but I did, and he confessed to him and to me that he had stolen it - I am not acquainted with Bigg; I don't know that he is an acquaintance of my brother's - I understand the prisoner appeared against Bigg - my brother-in-law said he would prosecute the prisoner, but that was after he confessed - I don't remember Mr. Clarke saying, "If one goes the other shall" - I don't know whether the prisoner was taken up till he had appeared against Bigg. (see page 504).</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When, after the discovery of the half-crown, was the prisoner taken? A. I don't know; Mr. Clarke said he would send for an officer; I don't know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160075"/>whether he did - I believe he appeared against Bigg about a fortnight afterwards.</p>

No - I knew Bigg came to my house occasionally; I don't know Dovey; I did not say, "If one goes, the other shall," to my recollection - it was on the 12th of April I found the half-crown, and I brought this charge against the prisoner on the 2nd of May - I might have said they ought both to go.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What was the reason the prisoner was not taken before? A. I was to receive some further information about what I had been robbed of, I had not a doubt about the half-crown.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The prisoner had been with you some time? A. Yes, fourteen months; he had access to my till, and served my customers, but he was to give change from the trays, where we count up silver for that purpose - but sometimes he may have taken money from the till, or from his pocket.</p>

            ; we live at No. 16, Phoenix-street, St. Giles's. On the 3rd of April, Davies, the prisoner, came with a female; they asked to see a two-pair back room, which I had to let; they saw and approved of it - Davies then said he wished his brother to see it, who would not be at home till seven in the evening, but he did not come; on the 4th Davies came again, and asked what sized stove there was in the room; I said a good sized stove for a family, and he took the key and went and looked at the room again - On the 8th of April, Davies came and lodged there, and on the 9th I saw the other prisoner, they came together, and brought goods in with them - I could not see what they had, as it was covered with green baize - it was a small back room, and had no furnace in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When were the prisoners taken? A. On the 15th; I swear Jones came there on the 9th, and he passed afterwards, but I did not make much observation on him - I am certain of both the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a tailor; I lodge in the front-room on the second-floor of this house, the same floor as the prisoners occupied - the first time I saw them to notice them was on the 10th, they were then on the top of the stairs; I was going up and I waited till they both passed me; I observed they passed me in a curious manner, and Davies had a small bundle tied up in a handkerchief; they came down in a sort of faint kind of way, and I heard them say, "Somebody is coming up" - I had seen Davies come up several times out of the street with a large sack or bundle under his arm; and in the course of that afternoon he came up with something which appeared like bricks, and sounded like bricks when he put them down in the room - on the morning of the 10th I had great suspicion from hearing a terrible noise of the roaring of a fire and the blowing of bellows; I made a hole in the door, and looked through, and saw them both about a furnace - I could not exactly see Jones, but I saw Davies clearly, and I am certain Jones was there - I then left, and in the afternoon I heard a little bit of knocking and some filing, like tinkering - I looked through the hole and saw them both in the room handing penny pieces from one to the other, and I saw two parcels of penny pieces - I saw two sieves there and something like a frame with something in it, but I can't say what - on the Monday following they came into the room, but I did not hear them till they were going out; in the evening of that day I watched them into the room, and I immediately went and got the police-officer - he requested me to go into the room with him, we found the prisoners there and the furnace.</p>

            . I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. These eighteen penny-pieces are counterfeit, three of them have been finished off by filing; they have been cast in a mould from the impression of a good penny-piece; these twenty seem to have been used for making the impressions - I went to the room and found this broken melting pot, which I put together; it has metal in it which has been in a state of fusion, and seems the same as these counterfeit penny-pieces; it seems to be copper and brass mixed - this wire sifter is used to sift sand over the coin - here are some pieces which have broken off moulds - I found a small air furnace in the room, which had been lately erected in a rude manner, not by a bricklayer - and there were some bricks, some founder's earth, and casting sand, and rosin, which is used to smoke the face of the mould.</p>

I was the charwoman at the house for twelve years, but being ill, I sent the prisoner - the prosecutrix came to me the morning after she missed this money; I went with her to the prisoner - the prisoner said she had not seen the money; the prosecutrix said, I don't wish to hurt you, if you will give me the money, if you have spent any it must be made up - I saw her put her hand into her bosom, and pull out some halfpence in one hand, which she showed, but her other hand was closed, and I saw her put a sovereign into her mouth, and swallow it - while the prosecutrix was gone for an officer, I said to her "Give me the sovereign;" she said I have swallowed it.</p>

I am the prosecutor's father - my wife and I went out at twenty-five minutes before nine o'clock, and returned in half an hour; I locked the shop door myself and brought the key down for my daughter to take care of till we returned; when my wife came home, she heard what she has stated, and called to know who was there, and the prisoner answered - my daughter had told us Frank was there - I sat down and was going to supper, when I heard a rumbling noise in the shop - I then heard the prisoner run down stairs, I then went into the shop and missed the silk.</p>

             (police-constable H 150). I received information, and went to the work shop - I found the work had been cut off by a left-handed man, and I have ascertained that the prisoner is left-handed; I then went to several public-houses in search of the prisoner; but could not find him till ten minutes before one o'clock, when he was coming home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home at half-past nine o'clock- I went up stairs, but my bed was not made - Mr. Lee and his wife came home directly afterwards, and asked who was in the shop; I told them it was me - I then went and had a pint of beer, and when I was coming back, I was taken - this is the third time these people have been accused, and no doubt they have taken the silk and sold it - I have worked twelve months in their shop; they make yards and yards of silk and sell it.</p>
               <p>MARY LEE. I was robbed in a house I lived in before this one; I was out, and some one broke in, and cut the silk; but the neighbours stopped it; it was not taken away.</p>

             for six months - I first met her in the street; she lived near me, and she dealt at my shop after I had seen her; there was an intimacy between us once, about four months ago - on Wednesday last she called on me and said she was very poor, and asked me to lend her a sovereign; I said I would give her one, but she must not keep calling on me - I gave her one, and she persuaded me to come up to her house that evening; she had lived there about a fortnight, and had been to me several times to ask me to call on her - she said the man she had lived with had treated her so ill that she had quite got rid of him - I called that evening about half-past ten o'clock, but I did not stay more than five minutes; I appointed to call on her on the following evening; I was to have gone at eleven o'clock, but I did not go ill twelve o'clock - I then went to her house, No. 12, Quixote-row, New-road - I had no knowledge that she was married; she always declared to me that she was not - the male prisoner had been to my shop; he said "Don't allow that woman to come here any more, she is my wife, she has given me the ****;" that was about four months ago; when I saw Caroline again on the Monday following - I told her what he had said, she said, "Nonsense, he is not my husband, but a fellow who has ill used me, and I cannot get rid of him; he watched me into your shop, and when I came out he said, where is the blunt" - I had given her a little money occasionally, as I was taken with her - on the night in question, I went to her house a little after twelve o'clock, she opened the door to me and said, I was late; she was just going to bed - I had been accustomed to carry a little French watch about me; she had seen it at my house - and when I got to her house that night, she asked me if I was going to rise early in the morning; I said, yes; she said,"Where is your watch?" I said, "Never mind, I shall awake in time" - she introduced me into the front parlour, and asked me if I was going to stop all night; I said, yes - we then retired to the back parlour, which is the bed room - I asked her if there was any person in the house; she said, no, only the female servant - I had not heard any one come in after I got there; there are two entrances, one back and one front - when I got into the back room I undressed and went to bed, and she went down stairs; she came up in three or four minutes - I heard her talking in the kitchen; she had before told me the servant was going to bed, but she did not say where - I heard her say as she was coming up again, "Amelia" - I had put my clothes in a chair at the foot of the bed - I had a ten pound note, a five pound note, three sovereigns, and two half sovereigns, in my pocket - the female prisoner came into the room, undressed herself, and came to bed - she put the candle out after she was undressed - she had not been in bed with me more than two minutes, before the room door was stormed and forced open; some person came in and said it was his wife, and he would murder me; he struck me on the head and the arm - I got out of bed and went to the window which looked to the back part of the premises; I tried to lift it up, but it was fastened down; I broke the window, and called murder and police - I was not able to get any of my clothes on - I was still in the dark - I think in less than three minutes a man came to my assistance from a cottage which joins to the house; he got over the wall - he looked for my clothes - I was too much alarmed to look for them - but he could not find them; in a short time the police officer came and he had a light with him - we then searched for my clothes, but none were to be found; I had some of them afterwards brought to me, but part I have not found - I looked into the fob of my trousers where my money had been, and it was all gone, but fourteen or fifteen shillings in silver and two keys; I had a receipt in that pocket which had been taken out, crumpled up, and put back again - the policeman took the male prisoner into custody, he had only his trousers on; there was no appearance of the other part of his dress in the room where I was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. TURNER. Q. How long is it since you found this lady? A. Some time ago I had seen Caroline Horne, her servant - I never asked her when her master was likely to be out - when the male prisoner called on me he said, the woman was his wife, and if ever he caught her at my house he would punish me - I had called at her house when I first became acquainted with her - I was in her first floor, but not more than five minutes; no intimacy took place between us on that occasion - I swear that - I remember her calling at my house and going into the back parlour; she staid there for half an hour; there is no sofa there, but there is a rug - I did not give her any money then - she has had pork chops in my shop, but she usually paid for them; I made no charge for them - I had never made her any presents, and never promised her anything - I had not promised, on the night before I was robbed, that I would give her a brooch - I had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160079"/>been in bed more than two minutes, on the night in question, with her, before I was interrupted - I had not been asleep - she had gone down stairs before she came to bed, as she told me, to give some directions to her female servant; I heard her talking, and heard her say, Amelia; whether she said good night I don't know - I never said that if I was interrupted by the male prisoner, I would murder him - I have said I would use violence to him or any man who should come in while I was with his wife - she had often asked me to come to her house, and I said I would not go to any woman who had a man living with her - she told me this house was taken for her by an old gentleman, and she was going to live gay and to see gentlemen - there are two entrances to the house, but I think no person could come in at the front door, while I was in the back parlour, without my hearing them - I believe when I first saw the male prisoner in the room his boots were off, but I will not swear it.</p>

I heard the prosecutor cry murder, and went to his assistance; I burst the outside door open, and entered the parlour; I found the prosecutor in his shirt, and the female prisoner in her night-dress - there was no light in the room - the prosecutor said "For God's sake protect me, I shall be murdered;" I said I will - the male prisoner came into the room, and I seized him; he said "It is my wife" - I told the prosecutor to put on his clothes, he said he could not find them; I felt, but I could not find them - the policeman came in about ten minutes, and brought a light - I pulled off the bed-clothes, and looked for the prosecutor's clothes, but could not find them - his trousers were afterwards brought in by some person, but he stated that he had lost his money; it could not be found in the bed, nor in the house.</p>

            . (police-sergeant S 10). Last Thursday night I heard the springing of a rattle, I went up the road, and to the house in question - there are two kitchens and six rooms above - I found Mr. Luckie in his shirt. and the female prisoner in her night-dress in the back parlour, which is the bed-room - I saw the male prisoner on the same floor shortly afterwards, he had his trousers and shirt on - he was not in the bed-room when I went; the first place I saw him at was on the landing-place - there was no female servant in the house - I took the two prisoners into custody, locked up the doors, and proceeded to the station - I returned to the house with the prosecutor, we examined the house, and I found this money in a trunk in the back parlour under the bed; in which were some clothes belonging to the prisoner - I found this handkerchief outside the room, the prosecutor said "It is my neck-handkerchief" - he found his drawers in the kitchen in my presence - there was a sofa in the kitchen, and a large blanket; it appeared as if arrangements had been made for a person to sleep there - I asked the male prisoner in going along where the servant was, and he said she left at nine o'clock that night; I don't think he told me her name - this money was down in one corner of the trunk; here are three sovereigns and two half sovereigns, wrapped up in the bank notes; I found 6s. in another paper in the box - the man was asked at the station what money there was in his house, and said only a little silver - I heard him say at the office, that he thought this money was a brooch wrapped up in paper, as a present for his wife; and he said he had taken clothes and all away, because when the police came they should find the prosecutor and the woman in bed together, and he had taken this money from the pocket supposing it to be a brooch.</p>

             (police-constable S 102). I went to the house with King, what he has stated is correct.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LUCKIE. These are my notes, they are both marked in my own writing.</p>
               <p>Ernest Elsnor's Defence. I went to Kensington about seven o'clock, and told my wife I should be very late at home, as I was going to see a friend who was going to New York; I came home at a quarter-past eleven o'clock - I had the keys of the doors; I let myself in, and saw through the glass-door of the parlour a man sitting on the sofa with my wife, and heard Mr. Luckie's voice; I went down the steps a little way, and heard him say "What a fool you are to live with him, you have often complained; you don't like him; if you wish you shall have three pounds a-week; never mind the house, nor the furniture, I will protect you;" she said "He will follow me;" he said "He shall not come where I am;" he then said "Can I stay with you to-night;" she said "No, I expect him home;" he said "Let me look at your bed-room," he went in, and said "What a shabby little shawl you have got;" she said "Give me a better;" he said "I will bring you a brooch;" he then said "I will come to-morrow night," and she told him to come to the front door - when he was gone she saw me, and asked how I came in; I said from the back door - the next morning I said I must go to Kensington again - I did not go there, I from ten o'clock waited till half-past eleven o'clock to see Luckie come to the house - he did not come as he had promised; I thought he would not come; and at eleven o'clock I went in from the back door, that my wife should not hear - I waited a few minutes, and then went down and laid myself on a board in the back-kitchen, where I thought I would hide myself, I took off my boots and my coat, but not my trousers nor waistcoat - there are six bells in the kitchen; about twelve o'clock, one bell went very softly, I could not distinguish which it was - I went to the bells and felt it was the front-door bell; I thought Luckie was coming; she let him in and said, "I thought you would be sooner;" he said he had been in company, and had a glass of brandy - I heard them talking; I went close to the room-door - I heard Luckie say, "I wish I could go to bed"- she said "If you do you must not stay long;" he then went to bed, and the room-door opened - I ran down to the back-kitchen; my wife came there and threw down a sofa-pillow and a blanket, but I could not see then - she went up-stairs again, and she said to him, "I have a girl down stairs, who sleeps on a sofa;" she then undressed herself, and I heard them talking in bed; I did not know what to do - my blood was hot - I tried to open the door; they would not answer - I tried the next door, they would not open that; I pushed it open, I was very hot - I will speak as it was - I began to strike him in bed; he bore it a good while - I gave him eight or nine blows, he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160080"/>nothing; my wife begged of me "For God's sake, don't make a noise, he shall go away immediately" - then he got up, ran to the window naked, and cried "Murder" - I took his clothes immediately; (all I could feel in the bed-room,) I carried them all into the kitchen, and laid them down; the money fell out, I picked it up and put it into the box, and six shillings in a paper which I had - it struck me that the paper which fell from his clothes was the little brooch he had promised her - I never thought I did wrong in taking his clothes; it was only to say that he was found naked when the officer came - the room was full of people when the officer came; I was hot and dry, I could not speak; if I had found millions of money of Luckie's, I would not have taken it; it was not my intention to rob him - when the police came with his light, I said, "I give this gentleman in charge, I found him in bed with my wife, and Luckie said, "I was with her in bed, and he has robbed me of my clothes and money;" the officer let me dress myself, and then locked the doors and took me to the station where I was kept in custody; they brought down my wife in ten minutes; I then asked, "Who is there?" she said, "Don't speak to me, don't be so jealous, you know you are out of work; I wish you would leave me entirely" - that is all I can say about this affair - I had saved sixty sovereigns; I then thought I would marry; I met this woman in a confectioner's shop; she said she had forty sovereigns, and a gentleman had promised to marry her, but she would not - she said she was not a virtuous woman, but I said "If you will be true to me I will marry you" - we married, and she has not been faithful to me.</p>
