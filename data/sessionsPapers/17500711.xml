             lives in Holbourn, the two prisoners came to take lodgings of my mother the 25th of June. They agreed for the first floor ready furnished for seven shillings a week, and desired the Rooms might be got ready, and the bed sheeted. They went away and said they should be back in a quarter of an hour; they returned again in about an hour and an half, which was about three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pass for man and wife?</p>
               <p>M. Kirk. My mother understood them to be such. They said they were come from the country. They went up stairs into the rooms, they staid there about half an hour; then they came down and locked the doors, and took the keys with them, and said they should be back again by nine o'clock. They not coming back at eleven, my brother went in at the window and took off the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110003"/> staple of the door, and pushed the bolt back, and we went in, but we could not get into the dining room till next morning, when the smith came and took the lock off. We missed the things specified. The looking glass was a swinging one; they had taken that out of the frame. I saw all these things the same day at three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when the lodgings were taken ?</p>
               <p>M. Kirk. I was in the passage, and after that I drank tea with them in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Who offered the seven shillings per week?</p>
               <p>M. Kirk. The woman, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Saunders. It is about ten or twelve doors distant, she agreed with me for some goods, which came to 55 s. She ordered me to make a bill and go with her to her aunt's in Dean-street, and take the money. I took her through Bartlet's buildings ; when we came there she desired me to walk up stairs.

I said it was 2 l. 15 s. They made off with my goods, I pursued them and found them at Black fryar's stairs, she in a boat and he getting in; they had two bundles besides mine, one of which were the goods mentioned by the other witness : my goods were in her possession, and the man had these goods in his possession, lying at the bottom of the boat, and said, be it at their peril who dare touch them.</p>

            . On Friday, June 9, between 8 and 9 clock, I was coming home; I saw Mr. Bennet the constable ; I staid a long time with him in the watch-house; coming from thence through Breams-buildings, I was got about half way in the buildings, I heard somebody trip after me; I went to the turning that goes to Bond's stables ; in about half a minute Smith came running up on the right side of me: he said, hollo; hollo, said I. He ask'd me where I was going; I said, what is that to you? Instantly came three more men, and took hold of my collar. Webb was one of them; Webb put a pistol to my cheek. One of them said, fisk him ; they then set to rifling me ; they took from me a shilling, a steel tobacco-box and my hat; I stared them full in the face. Then they pulled my hat over my eyes; one of them took my hat away, and put his old one before me, and held it there till they went away together. I was mentioning this in the neighbourhood, and I was told there had been a gentleman robb'd hard by, and they chang'd his hat. I found him to be Mr. Jones; so I went to him; he said they left him but an indifferent one. I said, before I saw it, if it was my hat there was a remarkable slit long ways in the brim; he shewed it me, and it was the hat they took from me: so they finding they had no great bargain of mine, they left it with him. I had told the Constable the next morning how I was served; and that day se'nnight he had taken these men, and I was sent for before Justice Fielding; and as soon as I went into the room, I knew Smith: but as to Webb I could not positively swear to him then; but afterwards when I saw him in Bridewell with the coat on, which he had when he robbed me, I said, you are surely the man that put the pistol to my cheek. He then laughed at me. I had before described them both to the constable. I would be very tender in swearing; I swear, I verily believe Webb is one of the men that robbed me.</p>

            . On the 9th of June, about one o'clock in the morning, I was coming under Castle-yard-gate, coming into Holborn, there were four men collared me, and took from me my watch and some silver; my hat was almost new, they took that, and gave me one of theirs. After this, Mr. Smith, the prosecutor, came to my shop, telling me he had been robbed &amp;c. he described the hat to me before he saw it; I shewed it him, and he said it was his.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person who took away your hat?</p>
               <p>Jones. I cannot be positive, but I think Smith came up first; but they covered my face, that I cannot tell who took away my hat. I think I remember something of the two prisoners faces, but I do not swear to them.</p>

            . On the Friday in Whitson week we all met at the Bricklayer's arms, in George-alley, by the side of Fleet-market; there was Ben. the coal-heaver, the two prisoners, and myself We made a bargain to go out a robbing that night; it was 12 o'clock before we went out from George alley. Near Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, by the side of the gate we stopped a little man, and took half a guinea in gold, and silver as much as made it up 16 s. 6 d. then we turned down a turning that went back into Chancery-lane; then we saw this gentleman, the prosecutor, coming from the watch-house, we followed him towards Bond's stables, Smith ran after him, and took him by the collar, and we came up and took from him a shilling, a tobacco-box, and exchanged his hat. Then we left him and went up Chancery-lane towards Southampton-buildings ; there is a gate-way goes into some buildings ; there we stopped Mr. Jones, took his watch and some silver from him. Smith was the person that changed his hat, because we thought his hat better than the other gentleman's. Then we went to Plough-court, at the bottom of Holborn-hill, a thoroughfare into Field-lane. We lay down there till between 5 and 6; then we went to Duke's-place, and sold the gentleman's watch to

               <p>Ben. Bennet. I am constable. On the 15th of June, about 12 at night, going my rounds behind the Bagnio, out started one of the prisoners; he went down to the bottom of the horse-ride by the Star-Inn; he stopped at the corner. When I came down to him, he put his hand to my collar; I immediately called out, watch and thieves. There were three gentlemen came to my assistance, one of them drew his sword. I was bustling with him; he had got away from me, and ran towards Chancery-lane. We took him in about a minute and half. This was the prisoner, Webb. And we took Smith also.</p>
               <p>We took them both to the watch-house. We found nothing upon them. They swore revenge upon me. if ever they got out again, saying, they'd make me remember taking another man up. I carried them to New-Prison. The next morning Mr. Smith, the prosecutor, went and swore to one of them; and about an hour after I came from the prison, one of our watchmen went to the place where they took me by my collar, and took up this pistol, holding it in his hand.</p>

I asked him, if I had not taken such another remnant from him about three months ago; he denied it, but I was very certain I had; I told him I would go home with him, and if I found it to be his property I would lend him money upon it, but in going along he took an opportunity to escape from me.

He said, if you please go along with me to the gentleman's house and see him weigh it, to know what it comes to; (I thought then it was brass.) I went back, he told me he would make me drink; then there were four men came in and knocked me down.

            . On the 5th of last July, the Prisoner happened to come by my husband, my husband said, here is your play-fellow gone by; this was between ten and eleven o'clock in the forenoon. I had lain in about twelve or fourteen days; I desired my husband to call him back, I had not seen him some years, which he did. I desired him mightily to stay with me; he said he was going to Islington. I having sent my child to the church to be baptized that day, is the reason I can remember it so well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stay with you any time?</p>
               <p>Wolley. He stayed with me from that time till 5 o'clock next morning. He was in liquor and sat down in a chair. My husband got up and went to work, and said he would go to his mother, but whether he did or not, I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the child baptized?</p>
               <p>Wolley. At Cripplegate church; it being very ill, made me hasten to have it christened.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Wolley. I live in Golden-Lane, facing the hand and tipstaff.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Olifant. I was servant to Mrs. Wolley at that time. My mistress desired Mr. Crawford to stay with her, he stayed till the company broke up; about eleven o'clock, he, being in liquor, sat down in a chair and slept till morning, and gave me a shilling for awaking him at five o'clock.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110010"/> I went with him that morning near Cripplegate, where he gave me a dram.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child christened that day your mistress speaks of?</p>
               <p>Olifant. It was, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your mistress's business?</p>
               <p>Olifant. She is a fish-woman, and my master a carman; I am positive as to the day, my master would have paid me, it was on a Wednesday, my month being up that very day.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Wolley. Why did not you bring the account of this christening taken from the register of the parish?</p>
               <p>Wolley. I did not think there would have been occasion for that.</p>

The sauce-pan was taken from my yard June 21. between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I found it again the next morning. My wife had a suspicion of the Prisoner, who lived in the neighbourhood; he came the next day to clear himself. I told him, I thought he was guilty, and if he had pawned it I would fetch it out. I stopt him and sent for the keeper of Bridewell to assist me; we took him before the justice, there he acknowledged he had pawned it, also he did acknowledge the same before we got there. I went by his direction and fetched the sauce-pan.</p>

I parted with him. The prisoner came up to me, and said, I'll see you home, I believe you are my country man; I said, what countryman are you? He said, I am an Irishman; I said I was not. He said, you are in liquor (but I was not) and he would go along with me. Just as we came by the duke of Newcastle's house he would have me go and drink with him. I said I had no money, which was true. He came up Queen Court with me under the middle archway, there he took off my hat and wig, and ran away with them. I pursued him; he ran cross the way; I got before him, running faster than he; he ran back again, but I overtook him, and stood before him there; he d - d my b - d, and asked me what I wanted with him? then he knock'd me down with his fist, and kick'd and bruised me much; then he crossed the way again, and I pursued him a second time, and met with the same ill usage; then he went away, and crossed the way again; I got up, and ran after him a third time; then I took him by the collar, and we both fell down, and I called out. The watch came up, and took him before I lost my hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner and you first come together?</p>
               <p>Harris. He overtook me just by Holborn Bars, then I did not like him, and walked apace to get away from him.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Great Wild-street. On the 14th of June, between 11 and 12 o'clock at night, I heard the cry, stop thief, in Great Queen-street; there I saw two men both bare-headed. The prosecutor said, I have been robbed by the prisoner of my hat and wig, and knocked down three times. Then another watchman came to my assistance, we took the prisoner to the constable of the night; then I went and searched in Great Queen-street, and found two hats and one wig under the archway going into Queen Court; they lay together; I brought them to the watch-house, and each took his own; they both charged one another, so they both were sent to the Round-house, then before Justice Fielding, and he committed the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming home from work, about 9 o'clock, Mr. Harris overtook me, and clapped his hand on my shoulder, and said, hollo! where are you going? I am going home, said I; I live in Queen-street; so we went home together. Said he, I have been fighting, and have got a black eye. He had a handkerchief tied round his head; he said, he believed it was one of his countrymen he fought with. We came along together to Queen-street. He said to me, will not you drink some beer before you go home? No, said I, I have drank two pots of beer since I have done my work. Said he, what is the matter you will not? I said, I'll drink none. He said he'd treat me. Said I, I return you thanks, I'll drink none. Said he, you are a scoundrel fellow; he made a blow at me; I stood upon my own defence; I saw no wig; my hat was lost, also my wig, and a handkerchief, which cost 4 s. 6 d. The watchman coming by, he charged me, and I charged him; the watchman went back, and found our hats, but my wig and handkerchief were lost.</p>

            . The child was at play, and was taken from the door by the prisoner at the bar, on the 10th of May. He told her, he'd give it a cake; he kept her from home till 9 o'clock at night; he was much in liquor, and the child bruised very much when he brought her back, her nose was bruised, her shift, coat and apron were very bloody. We thought it came from the mouth of the child. The mother after this found the child very ill. I persuaded<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110012"/> her to go to Dr. Morton; he advised her to go to the Infirmary for the cure of the child; the child had got the foul distemper. The prisoner said he was clean ; but he was examined, and found to be foul. The prisoner owned he had the child with him. The child will be 4 years old next Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is its mother?</p>
               <p>C. Higgins. The mother went distracted upon this account, and died.</p>
               <p>Dr. Morton. I examined the child and the prisoner, they were both foul. The child said, the prisoner hurt her very much with his cock. The child has a buboe now on each groin.</p>

            </rs>; and by order of the court there was another indictment preferred against him at Hicks's-hall, for an intent to commit a rape, and giving the child the foul disease. The prisoner was there cast to be confined in the prison of Newgate three years, twice to stand in the pillory in one month, and once more at the three years end; and find such security for his good behaviour as the court approves on for four years more.</p>

I had put 46 guineas in my chest, I search'd it before the owner and his wife, all was gone.

I went on Sunday evening, he told me of a woman, whom he had informed against before, for receiving part of the goods, and had pledged them, and if I would send the beadle after her she was easy to be found. Then I saw my servant talking to some of the prisoners, he was informed by them that Dawson had then my wig on; I made him take it off, and examined it, and knew it to be mine (it was produced in court.) He said he had it of the prisoner Carrel, and that it was the wig they took out of my portmanteau.</p>

            . The two prisoners at the bar and I stop'd this first witness in Stepney churchyard. We were going towards Limehouse, we went all out of Rag fair together about 8 o'clock; we went over the fields to Stepney, we met the footman in White Horse street; that is about a quarter of a mile from the church-yard. When he came into the church-yard we stop'd him, Wallis held a hanger to his face, and he let the portmanteau fall.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gardner. Did you let it fall, or did they take it from your shoulder?</p>
               <p>Gardner. I believe I let it fall, but I was much surprised.</p>
               <p>Dawson. We took two penknives from him.</p>
               <p>Gardner. They did so, and a penny.</p>
               <p>Dawson. We carried the portmanteau into the fields about half a mile, and broke it open, we did it in a little time, for we were dodged over the fields. We took out the things and threw the portmanteau into the ditch, and left it there. We carried the things to Stitchburn's house where we lodg'd. The things were divided, I had a shirt and a pair of black worsted stockings and some handkerchiefs for my share. The wig I had from Carrel the next day. Carrel had a pair of stockings, a shirt and a pair of new shoes ; Wallis had a new Holland shirt, a pair of white stockings, and two handkerchiefs. The coat, waistcoat and breeches were pawned for nine shillings, I had four shillings and sixpence of the money, but the girl who carried them to pawn would not tell us where she had pawned them; some things we lost ; the house where we lodged was searched the same night, Carrel and I got over a wall into an alley, or we had been taken.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. John, Wapping. Since the prisoners have been taken I know them, I was in pursuit of them about the twenty second of June. Dawson the evidence, when taken, had a hanger, a penknife, a half guinea in gold, and three or four shillings in silver, and a new silver buckle, the knife and buckle were produced in court.</p>
               <p>Row. The buckle is not mine. But as far as I can know a knife I take it to be the knife I gave to my servant to make pens with. Gardner deposed the knife was his property, given him by his master.</p>
               <p>Wallis's Defence. I was going through Rag fair a little in liquor: I met this Dawson that night he came home in the same fleet as I did; he desired I would drink a pint of beer, he said, where do you lodge? I said in Wapping: he said, come along with me; so I went along with him till such time he stop'd that first witness, and ran away with the things. I know no more, I am a stranger in the place.</p>
               <p>Carrel's Defence. I know nothing about it, I have not had my health these three or four months. I was at my lodgings and going for a pint of mild porter; I met a man who said I was his prisoner, and took me up upon suspicion, and I went quietly with him.</p>

While the boy was up the chimney the prisoner stood by, he asked two shillings and sixpence for sweeping the chimney.

I said I had not much, he said he must have it; he searched my pocket and took out one shilling and four-pence; then they took my tobacco box, and a pair of gloves out of my pocket: Bailey took my hat from off my head, and handkerchief from out of my coat pocket; it was a fine moon-light night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took your money, box and gloves?</p>
               <p>Smith. Frazier took them, my Lord. I saw them all four again about three hours after, I met them accidentally in East-Smithfield near the Maypole, I live there. After I was robb'd I went to the watch-house and inquired for the officer of the night, he was not there; these four watchmen went with me into the fields, we could not meet with them. When I was got near home I heard a talking, I thought it proper to meet them, this was about half an hour after two o'clock; I call'd out watch and thieves, they ran, Bailey ran to Cock-alley, he was taken with my hat on his head, and handkerchief about his neck; Frazier was taken two days after, I was sent for to see if I knew him, I knew him at first sight; he confessed the fact.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. 'Tis now, my lord, near 11 months since I was apprehended, during all which time I have been confined in goal, treated as a felon, and loaded with irons. I have undergone the peril of my life, and the loss of the greatest part of my substance, to the almost entire ruin of myself, my wife, and five children. The first seven months I was in Winchester goal without knowing my accuser; and from thence I was removed to Newgate, and now appear before your lordship to take my trial for my life; not, my lord, for the fact I was committed for; for what reason I know not, but for another I am equally innocent of. I had, my lord, above 20 persons of great repute and character from Winchester, and other remote parts of the country attending here last April sessions, at a very great expence, in order to have testified my innocence at my trial, besides the very favourable circumstance of the mayor of Winchester's being then in London; that worthy gentleman, from love of truth and justice (for nothing else could have invited him) would also have appeared for me; but, my lord, my trial was then put off, upon an: affidavit that Pelham, one of the witnesses now against me, was taken ill, and could not attend; whether, my lord, he was really ill or not, and how unable to attend, himself only knows. If the wisest and worthiest of men may be imposed upon as to the matter in question, my lord, I am intirely innocent of it, I was never at Broomhill in my life, and know not, but by information, where it lies ; and as to the two witnesses, Pelham and Hatton, I never, to my knowledge, saw them before. These witnesses, my lord, have sworn the facts to such a charge, supported by positive testimony; what defence, my lord, can even innocence itself make? - 'Tis fortunate, very fully and very positively against me; fortunate, my lord, that from a variety of remarkable incidents happening about that time, incidents that may not attend another man's case of equal innocence, I have been able to recollect, and prove, that I was then at Winchester, about 100 miles from Broomhill. Besides which, my lords, I shall be able to discredit the testimony of Pelham and Hatton, from the evidence of several gentlemen of fortune and distinction, who, tho' strangers to me, have, for the service of the community (with great inconvenience to themselves) kindly come thus far to testify on my behalf. I am sorry, my lords, upon this occasion to add, that there is at the bottom of this prosecution a scene of unheard of malice and cruelty ; such, my lords, as is too tedious for me, at this juncture, to relate; but time, the grand discoverer of all things, will, I hope, bring it to light,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110017"/> and shew the gentlemen who are concerned for the crown how grosly, and by what a cloud of darkness they themselves have been imposed upon. I shall, at this time, trouble your lordships no farther, but call my witnesses, and prove my innocence, and shall rely upon that and the known justice and integrity of your lordships and the jury for my acquittal.</p>

The prisoner is my brother-in-law, he keeps a grocer's shop in Winchester; I have known him live there these seven years; I came to my sister's on the 31st of August, 1746, to be at her lying-in, and continued there till Sunday the 19th of October, and between 10 and 11 on that day, in the forenoon, I set out and returned to Chichester; one Mr. Heath of Chichester was with me, and

             set out thence the day before, whom I overtook a little way out of Winchester on Sunday. My brother the Prisoner breakfasted with me the morning I set out. I called him up myself between 7 and 8 in the morning, and took horse at my brother's stable door near his house; I met Mr. Fletcher upon the road, about 10 miles from Winchester.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Winchester to Chichester ?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. About 28 miles.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to Chichester?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. I got home about ten or eleven at night; I did not see my brother again till about a year and a quarter after this. I received a letter he wrote me the Tuesday after I left him, to tell me who I should get to buy him a horse, he gave me eight guineas for that purpose; I am sure he was at home from the fourth of September to the time I set out to go back to Chichester. I cannot recollect he was three hours from home in that time. My sister was brought to bed on the 4th of September, and Monday, the 13th of October, the fair was; I saw my brother in bed every night ; there was a favourite child which was not well, and it lay with its father every night.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you been at Winchester before?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. About two years before that; he lived there then, and was always at home to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did he carry on then?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. He lett out riding-horses, and sold salt-butter then.</p>
               <p>Q. How many riding-horses had he then?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. He had about five or six.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not sell tea ?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. I never saw him sell tea?</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not keep an open shop then?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any servants to look after those horses ?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. He had nobody but himself to do that; only sometimes he had a little boy to ride them out to water.</p>
               <p>Q. How came your brother not to go part of the way with you home?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. There was a gentleman to bear me company, who came to tell me my mother had been ill, which was Mr. Heath.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you meet with upon the road?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. I met Mr. Fletcher.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak of circumstances that happened a great while ago: what reason have you to take particular notice of the day you came from Winchester?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. I came home with trades-people who had been to the fair; and my going home was upon the account of my mother's being ill. The fair was on Monday the 13th of October, and I went back the Sunday after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not more people who live by letting out horses in Winchester, than your brother?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. Yes, there are. There were gentlemen who used to come constantly to my brother to hire horses, and would call them by their names.</p>
               <p>Q. Did none of these gentlemen use to make you presents?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. I never received none from any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy your tea?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. I never bought any tea; I never went far out all the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not your brother a gray horse?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. I don't remember I ever saw a gray horse among them.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were they?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. There were some of a reddish colour.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Winchester from Chichester?</p>
               <p>M. Sly. About twenty eight miles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Heath. I live at Chichester, I sell ready made cloaths; I was at Winchester in October, 1746. I went along with Mr. Norman to see Winchester, the Prisoner lived there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was you there in October?</p>
               <p>Heath. I was there the 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19th of October. Winchester-fair began on the Monday, I went on the Tuesday and staid there all the week; I paid some money for Mr. Norman, who was arrested on the 17th day for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110018"/> the sum of 2 l. 12 s. one

             arrested him. I had a note given me for it, the Prisoner was privy to some part of the transaction; I have kept the receipt ever since. When Richard Norman was arrested, I sent for Mr. Shepherd the Prisoner, he advised me not to pay the money; the note produced in court was dated the 19th of Oct. the money was paid the 17th, the day he was arrested, it was made up the 18th and dated the 19th, but there was a mistake in the date to be sure. Mr. Shepherd witnessed this note; I staid there the next day, which was Sunday; then between 10 and 11 o'clock Mr. Shepherd's wife's sister and I set out for Chichester; I saw the Prisoner just as we mounted our horses, he wished us a good journey, and we parted with him at the door. Mr. Fletcher met us on the road after we had made up Norman's affair; I sent him out of town fearing another action, and he staid for us about 6 or 7 miles out of the town of Winchester, where we found him and returned to Chichester together that night; we got in about 9 or 10 o'clock.</p>

I know the Prisoner perfectly well; either on a Friday or Saturday in the year 1746 in Oct. he came to me as soon as church was over; Oct. 19 he told me he had sold my horse, he paid me the money; then I said, what shall I give you for a horse for a twelvemonth, as I shall need one? He said, I will not let you have him so long; he had sold mine for 4 l. 19 s. he asked me twelve guineas for half a year for his horse, I had him ten pounds. I made an agreement with him, and have it now in my pocket; it has been in my custody ever since; it was produced in court, with his and the Prisoner's signing to it, signed 19 Oct. 1746. at 11 o'clock; the body of the writing is my own, this was made at the Vine Inn, Winchester.</p>

             and Humphry Hatton ; their characters are very indifferent; they live idle sort of lives, and their oaths would not be credited where they came from.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is Hatton of?</p>
               <p>Temple. We can give no account at Lydd how he lives, being in no visible business to get a maintenance.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not Pelham live at Lydd ?</p>
               <p>Temple. Yes, he does.</p>
               <p>Q. What business does he follow?</p>
               <p>Temple. He has followed no sort of business of late, he was bred to a blacksmith, but I think did not serve his time out; he sometimes has done a little in the blacksmith way, and sometimes fishing, but of late he does little or no business.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you compute Lydd to be off from Winchester?</p>
               <p>Temple. It is upwards of one hundred and ten miles.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in Lydd ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110019"/>Temple. About twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the town of Lydd much pestered with gangs of smugglers about Oct. 1746?</p>
               <p>Temple. It was; I have often been afraid of them, and shunned them often.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect seeing such a gang of smugglers being there in Oct. 1746?</p>
               <p>Temple. I cannot give any account in particular, their associates were the low sort of people.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not Pelham called a fisherman?</p>
               <p>Temple. He may any where but at home; these people are reputed to get their living no other way but by attending at this place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think these persons are not to be credited upon oath?</p>
               <p>Temple. I am afraid, my Lord, they are capable of giving false evidence here.</p>

            . I live at Lydd in the commission of the peace.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the general characters of Hatton and Pelham?</p>
               <p>Lee. Their general characters are, they do nothing for a livelihood, except attending at this place.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you reckon them people to be credited upon oath?</p>
               <p>Lee. I do not indeed; in their own country they would not have any credit given them were they to give evidence there. Pelham served part of his time to a blacksmith, the other is of no business; he once acted as an hostler at one of the inns there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a gang coming there in Oct. 1746.</p>
               <p>Lee. I cannot charge my memory as to the time; there were gangs coming there very frequently.</p>
               <p>Hen. Hatton. I live at Lydd, and have lived there eighteen years next Michaelmas-day.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I am a schoolmaster and parish clerk, and collect the land-lax.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this Pelham and Hatton?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I know them both very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What business do they follow?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I cannot tell that; I taught Pelham to write.</p>
               <p>Q. What are their general received characters ?</p>
               <p>Hatton. Their characters are that of idle dissolute fellows; was I a juryman in any part of the world, I would not give credit to them.</p>

            . I live at Winchester, I keep the Vine-Inn there. I remember Pelham and Hatton coming to my house the 8th of March last, between 8 and 9 in the morning. Shepherd was then in custody ; I talked with them concerning the Prisoner. There were three men rode up to my door, two of them were these two witnesses, they alighted from their horses; Pelham gave me a pair of pistols and desired me to put them by; being ill-looking shabby fellows, having on striped cotton shirts and coloured handkerchiefs about their necks, I imagined they were seafaring men ; I put their pistols by. They asked for something for breakfast; my servant being busy I waited on them myself. I wanted to know their business, I looked very hard at one of them; said I, I think I know you, are not you a Dover pilot? No, said Pelham; but we live in that part of the country; said I, do you know one

            ? they said they did, he was gone for a dragoon; I said, there was a neighbour had sworn against Shepherd for smuggling, they declared they did not know the man; they asked for the collector, he was in town, being the sitting time. They said they never were at Winchester before, and asked me to let my hostler go up with them to the Excise-office; I sent my servant, he was absent about an hour and a half; when they came back they said, they had been to our goal; said I, did you see Shepherd and Cousens? they said they did not remember they had ever seen Shepherd before; they seemed very much confused, as though they had met with a disappointment. They called for their horses, and I took my leave of them at the door.</p>

            . On the 15th of June at two in the afternoon the prisoner was in my master's shop, a gentleman came in to buy a pair of stockings at the same time, I opened a paper with six pair in it, I sold the gentleman two pair; he desired I would give him a skain of worsted to mend them. I walked round a large circumference for the worsted. After the gentleman was gone, there were two pair of stockings missing. I stood behind the counter and desired the prisoner to go to the next door and fetch me a pint of beer. I drank it up and gave him the pot again; he leaned with his right hand upon the counter, and took a pair of stockings from off the counter, and put them into his pocket; then he in a complaisant manner bad me good by; I went to detect him in the public house, but instead of going there he made off another way, and I never saw him for three days after.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour were they?</p>
               <p>Voice. A pair of man's grey stockings. There were three pair lost.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to take him up till three weeks after this?</p>
               <p>Voice. My master is able to account for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see him in the shop after this before he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Voice. No, not in the shop, I saw him in the street before the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hopley. The reason he was not taken up sooner is, I had information given me by a gentleman that lives at Mile-End, that the prisoner had sold stockings cheaper than I could do. I had not time to go just then to inquire about it; and knowing he was to be seen at any time, and as I knew I had time enough to take him before the sessions came on, made me not in a great hurry in taking him up. He has called upon me, and said, God bless you, several times. He is a Jew.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman has taken a very wrong oath. I have gone in the house very often for messages for the foreman; he has sent me often to carry parcels of goods for him; I have been with goods to the Castle in Aldersgate street, and when the waggoner has been out, I have, for safety, brought them back again. I have been in his house four or five times a week; my character is above doing such a thing.</p>

               <p>E. Hodgkin. I went up stairs for my doll on Whitsunday in the afternoon, and Mrs. Avery pull'd me into her room and locked me in, and took up a pot and said she would go and fetch some beer.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. Yes, he was. She set down the pot and did not fetch any beer.</p>

               <p>E. Hodgkin. He threw me down on the bed, and pull'd up my coats, covered my eyes, and stopp'd my mouth, because I called to Mrs. Avery and another of our lodgers. He hurt me very much, he pull'd down his breeches.</p>
         
               <p>At this sessions above 80 prisoners were tried, some of which trials being long and very remarkable, we thought it would be more agreeable to our readers (who we shall at all times be desirous of obliging) to have as full an account as possible, so shall print the whole in two four-penny books.</p>
               <p>N. B. The second part will be published on Friday next the 27th instant.</p>

               <p>Q. IN what manner did he hurt you?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. He hurt me very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did he hurt you?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. In the place where I make water.</p>
               <p>Q. With what did he hurt you?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. With what he makes water, that part went into me; he made me very sore.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find yourself sore immediately?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. Yes, I did, I could hardly walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you bloody?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. No, not bloody.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you so very sore ?</p>

               <p>E. Hodgkin. The foreness was in that part where I make water.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he lie upon you?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. Above a quarter of an hour; after that he held me on the bed, and told me, if I would not promise him that I would not tell any body, he would kill me then; and if I did tell any body, he'd kill me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first tell your relations?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. I told my mama first, about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell her sooner ?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. I was afraid he would kill me.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you tell her then?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. Because she examined me very much.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before ?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. I knew him by his coming to our lodger before.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he stop your mouth with?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. With his handkerchief, and I believe that covered my eyes too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Avery in the room at that time?</p>
               <p>E. Hodgkin. If he was, he must be in the closet, for I did not see him in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to see him after this very frequently going up and down?</p>

            . I am mother to the child. I know nothing of the prisoner any farther than his coming to our lodger, who was his cousin, he was seldom out on a Sabbath-day. I perceived the child very ill, and sick at her stomach; and one day I sent her out as far as Spittlefields, she staid three hours, and she used to go and come again in an hour. I asked her why she staid so long? she said she could not tell me what was the matter; and I had no suspicion of any thing, till I found a great running upon her; then I gave her some turpentine pills, yet she was no better. Her first shift she pulled off I did not observe, but the next was very bad; she shifts once a week. Then I advised with Mrs. Emory, who desired me to go to a surgeon; I did. She told me something of it before I went to the surgeon, and said she had a running in three days after he had used her so. At the surgeon's she told more about it, and is continually telling us more of it.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>M. Hodgkin. The child confessed it on the Saturday, and I never attempted to take him up till the Thursday following. He came the Sunday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take him up sooner?</p>
               <p>M. Hodgkin. The reason was, I was told I could do nothing without the approbation of a surgeon to assist me upon the trial. Indeed, I had hardly patience to forbear him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it known in the house before you took him up?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110023"/>M. Hodgkin He had been charged with it before I took him up. The child would sit all on one upon a chair, and at last of all, she told me she should be murdered if she told.</p>
               <p>Thomas Hill. I am an apothecary. I was applied to about 15 days since; I examined the parts, and found them very much inflamed and swelled; she had a considerable running upon her, I looked upon it to be venereal. She is now in a very good way of doing well, but not perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the parts been lacerated?</p>
               <p>Hill. They had, my lord, and I thing she could not have been in the condition she was, without some person having carnal knowledge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Could these parts be lacerated, and no blood appear ?</p>
               <p>Hill. That is very extraordinary to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could a man have a penetration, and no blood appear?</p>
               <p>Hill. I think not; I cannot conceive but there must have been blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not the infection be taken by a contraction of the parts without penetration.</p>
               <p>Hill. I believe not to so great a degree as she had it; there was a considerable discharge from the internal parts.</p>
               <p>M. Hodgkin. My other witness can give no other account, only testify the child is a sober child. The prisoner has taken physick every two or three days since that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no blood on the child's linen, are you sure?</p>
               <p>M. Hodgkin. There might or might not be blood for aught I know; I did not then (as I said before) observe: when we took the prisoner up, Mrs. Avery said he would be killed, because he had taken physick the day before. I said, why, what is the matter? she said her husband knew what was the matter.</p>

I advertised them the next day. Mr. Whitmore who bought them came to me; he said he had brought the curtains and a girl along with him. I went to Justice Fielding's to see the prisoner, who worked with me till Thursday morning, and went to breakfast and never returned again; the curtains were brought to the justice's.

               <p>Mr. Whitmore. I bought the curtains of a woman June 22. The prisoner was with her at that time, she asked me twenty shillings for them, I gave her sixteen. On the Saturday I saw him and her together again, and I took them both up.</p>

I went and stay'd at his father-in-law's, to see if he was there, I could not find him. I got a key and opened the door, and missed my watch, it was a silver one. I missed a coat, waistcoat, a pair of stockings, four shirts, a silver stock-buckle, a tobacco-stopper. About four days after he sent me word by a man, that the tobacco-stopper was left at home; the man told me he would go along with me the next day to see if he could see him. When I went to his friends he told me where my watch was pawned; then some of his friends told me where two shirts and the pair of breeches were pawned, which was at Mr. Singleton's; the watch was pawned at Greenwich with Mr.

            . The Prisoner came by me with something I observed under her cloaths; I said, what have you got there? she said, what is that to you. I took her gown up, there was this pot; she told me her mistress sent her to sell it, and having seen her asleep not a quarter of an hour before in the street, made me suspect her; so I stopped her and the pot too; the little water that was in it was not quite cold. I asked if any body had lost a pot, and Mrs. Cannon said she had just boiled some pease in it, and set it out in the yard and it was gone. She swore to it as her property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been in the hospital; a woman came up to me crying, saying, she had been boiling some pease for her husband's dinner, and that he was going to throw the hot liquor on her, and she was going to the landlord to desire he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110026"/> would come and seize the goods. Her husband had told her he would sell them all off, but she crying, her husband at last gave her this pot, and bid her take it and sell it, for that would support her a little while. She desired me to carry it to an alehouse in Plumbtree Court, and gave me three halfpence, and said she would be there as soon as I; that gentleman stopped me in Field-lane, and took it out of my hands; I asked him if he owned it, he said no, but would soon find the owner. This witness is a translator. I was going by him once with some old shoes, and because I would not sell them to him, he said, you old bitch, I'll be even with you some time or other; so when he took hold of me I was left to the mercy of the mob.</p>

Having a gentleman going out of a first floor, I let it to the prisoner about the beginning of April. I had a mistrust my things decreased; I went up and search'd the room, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment. He told me, if I would be easy, he had some money to take, due for wages on board a ship, and he would get me my things, saying, he had pawned them; but he only deceived me. I went where he told me they were, and have got only the worst of them again, the people deny the others. Some of the goods produced in court the prosecutrix deposed to them as her property.</p>

He said he wanted to go to Islington; I said if he would give me a small treat, I'd carry him there; so he gave me some rumboe; we had two sixpenny-pots more at the Green Dragon at Islington; there he said he would not stay, he'd go home on foot; he left me, and came to my house; when I came home, he was in the yard, he went in to drink with me; then my Spouse said she had lost a silver pint mug, and ask'd him if he had not play'd some trick with it, and desired he'd not frighten her; he said he knew nothing of it, so I search'd the house to see if I could find it; we went into the parlour, my wife sat on one side of him and I on the other, my wife found it in his side-pocket, he had been drinking much, and said how he came by it he did not know, and may be he did not. After this, he said he'd do something to me, if I made him out a thief. I carried him before a justice that same night; he was very much affrighted, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110027"/> declar'd he did not know how he came to do it.

            . My husband and the prisoner went out together. Some time after this the prisoner came home by himself; I asked him if any thing was the matter ? he said no. He called for half a pint of cyder, the drawer fetch'd it; there was nobody in the house but him. A gentleman came in, I went to call the hostler; no hostler being to be found, the drawer went out to take the horse; after that he went to take a tankard to draw some beer, and missed the pint mug. I searched every where that I imagined it could be; I was very angry with the maid, she said the prisoner was last at the cupboard-door. I desired, if the prisoner had play'd any tricks, he would not surprize me about it: when my husband came home, we sat of each side the prisoner. I took up his clothes, and felt it thro' his coat. Our drawer had been drinking out of it, and had put it into the cupboard. I hope the court will be merciful to him, he was in liquor, and it surely is the first fact.</p>

On the 21st of June Mr. Wood came to my house, and desired I would go with him to his; accordingly I did, and he gave me charge of the prisoner, who confessed the mug was in his pocket, but asserted that he did not know how it came there; he said he did not take it with an intent to steal it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had drank pretty freely at the prosecutor's house, and he told me we had drank brandy and beer at several places where we went; when I was coming on foot from Islington I could hardly walk; the man at the turnpike saw and spoke to me, but I did not remember the next day, when I was committed to prison, what he said to me, I was so much in liquor.

I got up in the morning, and went to take my pocket; then I had but one stocking and ne'er a pocket; the prisoner lodges in the same house I do. I went down stairs to do a necessary on my own occasion, and the prisoner was lying by the fire side in the kitchen; I was lamenting my case, she turned round, and under her lay my other stocking and pocket; the stockings I have now on my legs, and the leather pocket by my side, there were ten pence half-penny in my pocket; she called me old catamarandum bitch, and asked me what I made a noise about.</p>

The man of the house gave me leave to lie down by the fire side; she went up to bed with her candle in her hand; she was a bed and asleep, I lay down by the fire side as naturally as ever you saw any thing in your life, she had half pints of gin and beer to pay for, and to pay the fidler; whatever she did with her money I know not; I never disturbed any body till that woman disturbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you dance that night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The man keeps what we call a hop, he plaid on the violin, I gave him a penny and no more; and please you, my Lord, I did jump about.</p>

I stepped out and saw the prisoner go down the steps at the Bagnio, I pursued him, he let two pint pots fall in Barkin alley, and a quart pot in Seothing lane; I took him in Water lane, he was going down into a wine cellar; these pots we had had from the prosecutor with beer, they have Mr. Bushell's name on them, they were produced in court. Mr. Bushell deposed to them as his property.</p>

I asked him if that was Mr. Clark's house, he said, no; but, said he, I have sold the man a horse for twenty guineas or twenty pounds, and I'll ask the gentlewoman if he has been here to pay the money; he call'd to the landlady and asked if the gentleman had been there to pay the money; she said he had been there five or six times, and she would send for him in a minute; so upon that account I sat down a little Soon after there came in a pretty lusty man and the prisoner at the bar: they set to gaming at something, they called it pricking at the belt; the prisoner first lost a shilling, then a guinea, upon which he asked me to change a five pound, or a 5 guinea piece. I had got a silver watch in my pocket that I had received in lien of some money, that was above my gold. I took that out, and laid it down upon the table, there was a 3 l. 12 s. two 36 s. pieces, and three moidores; I took them out and laid them on the table, upon which, said he, I think you have got a gold watch, I have let mine run down, please to let me regulate mine by yours ; said I, it is but a pinchbeck one. so I took it out; then the lusty man got up and turned me a little about, and carried me out of the door; going out I looked back and saw Wilson clap his handkerchief over the gold and watches, and pull'd them to that side of the table he was on. When I came in again the watches and gold were gone, I did not see him lift them. The prisoner and the boy also were gone. I asked Mrs. Glover what sort of a house she kept, saying. I thought they were robbers. I asked her her name, she was somewhat slow in telling me; there was a gentleman coming by, I was going to ask him, then she told me it was

I had no acquaintance in town, but one gentleman, I went to his quarters and could not find him; then I went and found Mr. Clark. he took his cane and we went along; I put off my riding coat, and put on another hat, and a long tail wig, and walked to the place; the prisoner was sitting at the door smoaking a pipe with something to drink; said I, you have changed your coat, but you have not changed your face, you are my prisoner: said he, for what?

               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there in the house when you was robb'd?</p>
               <p>Millikin. There were only two men and a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this?</p>
               <p>Millikin. It was the 18th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in the room?</p>
               <p>Millikin. I staid there but a very little time, a lusty man pull'd me out of the room after the things were on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the prisoner took your money and watches?</p>
               <p>Millikin. I saw him put his handkerchief upon them and pull them to him, and it was a fair sign he should take them, I think.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110030"/>Q. Was the boy by at that time?</p>
               <p>Millikin. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you and that man been out of the room?</p>
               <p>Millikin. Not so long as I can go out at that door (pointing to a door about five yards from him) if there were no body in my way.</p>
               <p>Q. What door did you go out at?</p>
               <p>Millikin. It was the street door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go out by you at that time?</p>
               <p>Millikin. No, they did not, there was another door went out backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Millikin. I suppose between six and seven o'clock that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that lusty man?</p>
               <p>Millikin. He run away like a rogue as the rest did.</p>
               <p>Q. After you missed your money I should be glad to know why you did not apply to some neighbour and relate the affair, in order to secure the people of the house?</p>
               <p>Millikin. I was a stranger in the place and knew nobody, which was the reason I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Millikin. He was sitting at the door when I came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times did you prick at that belt?</p>
               <p>Millikin. I pricked none, nor did I wager; it was a thing I never saw, and I was ignorant of it.</p>

We prevailed upon the countryman to change his dress, by pulling his great coat off, and I put my hat and wig on his head, and put on the countryman's wig, and walked up after him. We gave him charge if that was the man to give us notice and we would assist him; he went and took a survey of the man, went past him a few yards, I planted myself by the prisoner, the countryman turn'd upon him, and said, '' mon thou '' hast not altered thy heed if thou hast thy dress, '' thou art the mon that robbed me.'' I immediately seized him, jointly with the prosecutor, we brought him down to Mr. Dickerson's tap-house in Chick-lane, the prisoner was very uneasy and wanted to know what he was charged for; he began to be very abusive, and swore he never saw Millikin in his life before. When we came into the tap-house and altered Millikin's dress by putting on his own clothes, the prisoner then said he had seen him about two hours before at the White Hart in Chick-lane; that he went away grumbling, and said somebody had robbed him of six pence; and that the prisoner himself was eating some anchovies and bread and butter for his dinner. He attempted to make his escape. I sent to Newgate and got some hand-cuffs, and secured him, and put him in a coach, and carried him to the Compter, and the next day before alderman Rawlinson.</p>

            . I keep this house, the White Hart in Chick-lane. I remember Millikin coming to my house along with a young man, on the 18th of June, they went into a room that lies even with the common dining room, they had a pot of beer. I believe they had been together near a quarter of an hour; there were two men came in to drink, one of them seemed to stagger like a drunken man. Wilson never was in my parlour; they were two strange men that pushed in at the parlour; I said they must not go in there, there was company; they said, gentlemen, we hope no offence; Mr. Millikin said, no offence. They asked for six pennyworth of bumboe, they drank that and call'd for six pennyworth more. I was going down for some beer, as I came up they passed me; Mr. Wilson was sitting in a box in the other room; he said, he believed they were gone to the door, the gentleman came in again and ask'd me where they were? I said I did not know, but they would come again. I asked whetehr I was not to be paid for my liquor? yes, said he, for what I called for, a pot of beer; he gave me a shilling to change; he said to Mr. Wilson, I believe I have been among a pack of rogues. I gave him nine pence; he did not say he had lost any thing. Wilson was in a box by himself, and the gentleman was on the back of the box talking to him. There was Mrs. Philips drinking in the room.</p>

            . Some time in November, 1748, about 7 in the evening, as I was going cross Holborn, a little below the bars I saw the prisoner following the stage coach just passing by me; I saw him take the hamper from behind the coach; he carried it to Staple's-inn-gate, and rested it on the rails. I waited till he took it up again and followed him up Middle Row; he went into Tennis Court, near Middle Row, it is a private court, I follow'd him through it, that goes to the back door to the King's Head tavern, there he dropped the hamper (I believe he saw me follow him) he then ran away, I ran and overtook him. Just as he was going into Holborn I laid hold of him, and, with the assistance of some people, brought him back to where the hamper was dropped. We brought him and the hamper into the King's Head tavern, and charged Mr. Marsh the constable with the prisoner. I think there was some direction upon the hamper where it was to go. I went to the Bell Inn, in Holborn, to see for

            . I then was headborough. I will not take upon me positively to say, but I believe the prisoner is the man. On the 28th of November was twelvemonth I was sent for to the King's Head, Middle Row, Holborn, to take charge of a person who had robbed a stage coach. He was in a room, and three or four persons with him; we tarried there I believe an hour. There was a porter sent to Mrs. Dormer, the person to whom the hamper was directed. While he was gone, came in about ten men; the moment the prisoner saw them, he said, d - n your eyes, fight away. There were about five or six pistols, and about three or four cutlasses. I am sure to three cutlasses. I received a great blow on my right hand. He was rescued when the messenger came back. He said if the hamper belonged to Mrs. Dormer, it came by the Ailsbury stage coach</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr. Gravenor if he did not come to the lodge at Newgate on Wednesday last with three other gentlemen, and when they came he pointed at me, saying, that is the man in the green waistcoat. Ward said, I cannot take upon me to say he is the man.</p>
               <p>Gravenor. I took Mr. Marsh the constable and Mr. Collingsin, and Mr. Ward staid without to make farther discoveries. The prisoner has been an infamous fellow, his character is well known; he came in at 11 o'clock at night to Mr. Clark's house, (the very man Millikin was enquiring for) and was suspected to be a common highwayman. That night he made a bill of sale of his horse for eight pounds. Mr. Collings said he could not swear to him.</p>

It was moon light. They told me they'd blow my brains out, but I saw no fire arms. The prisoner was the first that laid hold of me. They said nothing at all to me before they threw me down, and laid hold of my legs. I called out to the watch, they got off me and ran away. I got up and took hold of this and another, the other got away. I catched them about 12 yards from where they attacked me, the watchman came to me on the top of the hill.</p>

I had a mistrust of her. I went down stairs, turned my head and saw her take some plates. (The plates were produced in court.) I drew her the cyder, then I turned round in the kitchen and missed two plates; I charged her with them; she laughed at me; she laid down six pence, and I could not disturb my master for change, she said she would go and get change herself; I would not let her go without delivering the plates. She pulled them out from under her cloak. Then I called my master, and he secured her; then she said she only took them to frighten me.</p>

My wife being very ill, and to prevent being disturbed by the children, she chose one night to lie with the maid. The next morning she said to me, the bed was very hard; I said to her, it is pity you should let it be spoiled, I'd have you go up and make it yourself. About 11 o'clock she went up, and after some time she called me; there she found betwixt the bed and the sacking this petticoat. (It was produced in court, turned wrong side outward.) There were stitched to the petticoat 8 silk handkerchiefs, 5 pair of stockings, 4 cotton handkerchiefs, and seven white ones. I said to my wife, say nothing to her, but let us behave to her as usual. The girl was gone out. When she came in again, I said to her, where did you buy these gold ear rings? she said in the Minories. Said I to my man, go along with her, and see whether she bought them there or not. I found she said true. How she came by the money I cannot tell. Said I to her, you talk of going to another place, will you go now and see if the gentlewoman is provided. She went up stairs and dressed herself. I said, stay dinner. We sent her for half a pound of butter; my wife went up stairs, and found the petticoat was gone. After that I let her go out of the door about 50 or 60 yards, then I called her back, and had her searched; there I found the petticoat furnished as it now appears; she then confessed she took these things for her own wear, before my man and some neighbours.</p>

            . On the 10th of June my wife, I, and a man that lodges at my house, took a walk in the fields towards Pancrass. We called upon Mr. Pantelow, the constable of St. George's, Bloomsbury; then we sent for Mr. Campbell, another constable, we agreed to go out on a party of pleasure; as it rained and thundered much my wife and Mr. Pantelow's returned back to his house. Mr. Pantelow charged his brace of pistols. I charg'd three pistols, one the man had with him, one Mr. Campbel had, and one I had. We met another gentleman, he agreed to go with us. There are thieves infest that place, and especially one who has threatened the life of Pantelow, upon the account of his taking up the persons who robbed my lady Albemarle (we had staid drinking at the Spa) Coming back, in <placeName id="t17500711-59-crimeloc270">Pancrass fields</placeName>

Bready kept behind me about 20 yards. I saw three fellows coming towards the wooden bridge (this was about a quarter of an hour after nine o'clock) one of them came up to me, which I take to be Dunkin, and discharged a pistol, it went over my head. I put my hand in my pocket, and my pistol had got through the lining of my pocket; said the man, swearing out, deliver your money. The other I believe to be Brusby, had a hanger. I said, gentlemen, don't use me ill, I have but 2 s. 2 d. which I delivered to them. Mr. Campbell called out to Pantelow, that there was some disturbance. I believe they hearing the name Pantelow made them run. I pursued, and got ground of them, then the person stopped and shot again at me, so I discharged mine at him. I pursued them still, thinking Mr. Pantelow and the others were after me Then he, which I take to be Dunkin, turn'd back and came up close to me, and put his pistol to me, swearing, take it, and shot again, then ran, and I ran, and pursued them still. I ran about 20 or 30 yards; I did not feel I was shot any more than any gentleman in the court; I put my hand in my bosom and felt blood, then I made a sort of a halt, and I called out to those behind, I was shot.

They swore if I came up to them, they'd shoot me. I pursued them round the fields, they got over a hedge. There was a horse, on which one was mounted, and the other was getting up when the apprentice and I got up to them, and took them, and brought them guarded to town.</p>

            . I was going to the Greyhound inn, Drury lane, last Monday was seven-night for lodging, I knocked at the door about twelve at night; there was one Ann Hall was walking at the next door to this inn, being the prisoner's house; no body came to let me in, she came and said I might have lodging there, so I went along with her into the house. At going in I had 1 s. 6 d. in punch, then after that I wanted to go to bed; I went to bed; after we went up stairs we had some more punch, till I could drink no longer; then I went to bed, and my companion Ann Hall along with me, but my landlady, the prisoner, came up stairs before Ann Hall was in bed. I asked her what I must give her for the bed, she said two shillings, I gave it her: after that she came up and asked me if I would not have another eighteen penny worth of punch, I had that. When I went to bed I had laid my breeches under my head, I took the money out of my breeches, and paid her for the punch, and put my breeches there again and went to sleep. In the morning when I awaked I went to see what it was o'clock, my watch was gone; I felt for my money; I had two moidores and one thirty six shill. piece and some silver, when I put my breeches there, but it was all gone. Then I asked the girl that lay along with me if she knew any thing what was become of my money and watch, she said she did not know, except my landlady had it. Then she went part of the way down stairs, and asked the prisoner if she had got it; she came back again and told me it was safe. I staid a while, and she did not come so soon as I wanted her, I bid the girl call her again, which she did; then the prisoner came up and brought the watch in her right hand, and sat down on the bed side, and held it out to me, and asked me if it was mine, I said yes, she gave it me; then I asked her where the money was, she said she did not know, I told her somebody in the house must have it, for I lost it there. She said she did not believe any body had it, except her sister; then I asked her where her sister was, she said she was gone out; I asked her how long she would be before she came home, she said, not before dinner, then she expected her. I went away and came again about the time; I asked her if her sister was come in, she said, no, but she expected her every minute. Then I went to an alehouse opposite that house, and got a pint of beer, and went and asked two or three times, and found she was not come. At last I understood she had no sister there, then I told her I would seek a remedy, so I went away on purpose to do it. I was going to get some money, going through St. James's Park I met this Ann Hall along with a drummer, just by the parade, the man came after me and said the prisoner had the money, she took it out of my pocket; that the first thing she took was the watch, then the money. They asked me how long it would be before I came back from Westminster, I said in half an hour, they said they would wait for me, which they did. Then we came almost to Drury-lane, then the drummer went to the house and asked how affairs stood. He came back and said the prisoner said Ann Hall was not to come home till 10 o'clock, but stay at the sign of the Fox, and if things were clear she might come home. I went to Justice Ledger, he granted a warrant, I took Ann Hall with me, the prisoner got out of the coach, and called me and the constable aside, and wanted me to make it up, I told her I would not. After the justice examined her, he committed her to the Gatehouse for farther examination, which was the next day. Before she was brought some of her friends came to the constable and me and offered me the money. The justice committed her there again; before the justice she denied ever seeing me at her house.</p>
               <p>Ann Hall. Betwixt one and two o'clock on Thursday morning was a week I was walking backwards and forwards near the Greyhound, Drury-lane,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110035"/> the gentleman asked me if I wanted a careless husband, I told him I could not get one; we went into the prisoner's house and had some punch, he asked for a bed, he gave two shillings, he was not sober, which he owned at his first coming in. After we had been in bed both together for about an hour, my landlady came up and took the breeches from under his head, she pulled out the watch and put it into her bosom; then she pulled out two pieces of gold, and some silver I saw, there was a candle in the room. Said she, if you'll not say any thing of this I'll rub out your score, and buy you a pair of shoes; I said I would not agree to it; she called up another girl, and called for a bottle of wine; she shewed the money to the other girl. In the morning the gentleman put on his waistcoat and other things, he said where are my breeches? then he said, where is my watch? said I, it is all safe, and your money too. I went down and called to the prisoner, she did not come, I called on the stairs again, then she came up and brought the watch in her right hand, and asked if it was his; he asked for the money, she said she knew nothing of it upon her honour. Said he, I had so much money and I lost it in your house; if so, said she, you have given it to my sister, and she is gone out. He went out to the Black Dog and staid there, and came over every now and then. At last she went to Covent Garden market to buy some victuals, and bid me go up and lie down upon the bed, and while I was asleep, the man that goes for her husband came up and awaked me, and asked me for my ring, and bid me go out and stay till every thing was quiet, and then come home. She came home and said, make the best of your way up Drury-lane for the gentleman is gone for a search warrant, and if he should search the house and not find you, we will make oath you was a stranger, and made off with the money. And my landlady was to say if he came to take me up, he wanted to have to do with me in an unhandsome manner. I went directly into St. James's Park, and found an acquaintance, I told him the whole thing; the gentleman was coming by, I was in a surprise; he asked me what was the matter, I told him that was the person; said he, I'll go and speak to him. While he was going after him, I said I would speak to him myself, I'll face him as the d - I did the cat. The gentleman said, if you'll tell me who has got the money I'll make you some recompence; I said my landlady was the person that took it out of his breeches. I went to the justice and took my oath to what I have said now. He was fast asleep when she came up and took it. She took a burning glass out of his pocket, and wanted me to put it in again, and I would not, so she put it in herself.</p>
               <p>Cross examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever frequent a brandy shop in the Butcher-row, near Temple-bar?</p>
               <p>Ann Hall. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not there the third of July to change a thirty six shill. piece of gold?</p>
               <p>A. Hall. No, I was not, I never was possessed of a piece of gold of that fort ; I know a guinea, and that is all I know of gold coin.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know no more of it than the child unborn. She brought the watch to me and I delivered it to him again in the morning. Because I threatened to trouble her for the money she owes me, she has brought this thing against me.</p>

I said no; he said, will you go? I said I would not. Then he took me and threw me down, and took my ring, and swored - n your eyes, if you speak I'll murder you. He struck me after he had got the ring. There was a woman came up to me; I told her that man in the laced hat had knocked me down and taken my ring from off my finger; said she, take care, don't go that way, there is a vile gang of rogues, and he is very likely to do it. I went home and told how ill I had been used by this Mayo. The person that came up told me his name.</p>

            . I was coming into the Haymarket on Thursday the 21st of last month, coming home, a little below St. James's street I saw a man and a woman below the Haymarket. I saw the woman knocked down. Words passed between them; I saw the man running away, I ran after him, and saw him go into a house in St. James's street, it was the prisoner at the bar. Afterwards I was informed this was the woman. I did not see him take any thing from her. I went to that house where he went into, and enquired what sort of a house it was, and was told it was a bad house to go into. I then came back again, and went home. He turned round as he was going off. I saw him perfectly, and know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see this woman before?</p>
               <p>Eastoff. Yes, where she lodged in Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you rent two rooms of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Eastoff. Yes, at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not there a dispute about it?</p>
               <p>Eastoff. There was no dispute then, there was afterwards. Mr. Mayo came to me and asked me for his house; I gave him a month's notice, he was to have come at seven o'clock. I looked over the inventory, there were two plates, a flat iron, and a heater missing. I had no key; I desired to go out and leave him in possession of his house, and told him the things that were lost I would make him restitution for. He came the next day, and broke<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110037"/> the house open, and desired me to come down if I would; in two or three days after I heard there was an action against me in order that I should not come to this trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know of any dispute between you and Mayo?</p>
               <p>Eastoff. There was an action brought for 44 s. which I justly owed the man, there was no dispute before. On Friday Mr. Ridgway and one Mr. Noke sent to me, in order that I would take the Prosecutrix out of the way, and they would give me a sum of money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask that witness if he did not rent a house of me at so much a week.</p>
               <p>Eastoff. I rented two rooms of him up two pair of stairs; some of the goods were gone; two blankets, a flat-iron, a heater, and a candlestick, which I offered t o account for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. They have contrived to hang me, because I wanted my money that was my just due.</p>

            . On the 17th of June last, I went to Mr. Eastoff and Mrs. Mears, who said, the Prisoner at the bar had used him very ill. Mrs. Mears wanted to make the Prisoner give up his title to his effects. They proposed to go to Mr. Drinkwater, and consult means in order to punish him; Eastoff and Mears said he, had been guilty of robbing some Persons so I went to Mr. Drinkwater with them. He bid him go to Mr. Branson, his Grace the Duke of Bedford's Valet de Chamber, and say to him, the person who robbed him was named Mayo, and that the watch was to be found at any time. Upon their request I went to Mr. Branson with Mr. Eastoff, we desired to speak with him in a private apartment. Eastoff told him we understood that he had been robbed on the 17th of Jan. of a gold watch, &amp;c. Mr. Branson told him he had not lost any such thing, and particularly, he never had a gold watch to lose; but he said, if any body in the house had lost such things he would make enquiry, so we waited upon him again the next day; then he said he had made enquiry in the family, and could not find any body had lost any thing of that kind. The next day, which was Friday, Mr. Drinkwater was acquainted he was not robbed at all. Then with the advice of him and Mr. Eastoff it was proposed, a robbery should be alledg'd against him. Mr. Eastoff desired I would go home with him and talk to Mrs. Mears his companion, she knowing I had had some trifling correspondence with the Prosecutrix, that she should say, that she had been robbed by the Prisoner of a ring, value 14 s. Mr. Drinkwater said it must have been a wedding ring, and the posey of it (Love, Virtue) this was agreed upon. I took the girl out with me on Thursday, the 21st after dinner, in order to take her from these persons, and desir'd her by no means to be guilty of this; I provided a lodging for her in Hart street, and took her there about 9 o'clock at night. We continued there about half an hour; she then told me, she wanted some clean linen, and said, she was desirous of having it; I went along with her to the Hay-market, the woman was not at home; I desired her to sit down with me at a publick-house the door on this side her house, till the woman came home, she was not out of my sight, she took the linen; I paid the reckoning, then we went to the lodging I had taken for her, where I continued with her that whole night, this was the night this robbery is said to be committed. I lay along with her. I met with her about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and dined with her at Mr. Eastoff's house; I went to several places, she was with me the whole time. Finding a thing, and please your Lordship, of this nature going forward, I was willing to see how far they would carry it into execution; this is the fourth robbery sworn by Eastoff against the Prisoner, and made up.</p>
               <p>On Friday I went about my business; I called upon Eastoff in Mrs. Mears's house, I found Mrs. Mears was abroad; I went to the Prosecutrix's lodgings, I was told she was gone to the King's Head, Holbourn; I met them, that is, Mrs. Mears and the Prosecutrix, near Middle-Row, they said no action had been committed; I carried her home and lay with her that night also. The next morning, she acknowledged Mrs. Mears had used her interest and desired her to go and make an information against the Prisoner at the bar, and that Mrs. Mears lent her half a crown to pay for the warrant. I went the next morning to Mr. Eastoff's house, to ask the reason why she should contrive so wicked a scheme, said East-off, that alone will not do, for there were a considerable deal of money due to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Noke. I am a compositor in the printing-branch. I was offered three guineas last Sunday if I would back a bill against the Prisoner, by Mr. Eastoff.</p>

               <p>- Ridgway. On Thursday the 21st of June, between 8 an 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner called upon me and told me he was going in order to take possession of his house in Park street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175007110038"/> which he had let to this Eastoff; he said he had been there before and found many of his things missing; he advised with me what to do, I advised him to take possession of his house as he could get it, or else I told him they might be wicked enough to make all the things off. We went between 8 and 9 o'clock to another house he had taken in order to go into. There were Eastoff and Mrs. Mears; Mayo asked for the key; there was a good deal of bad language between them. This Mrs. Mears once lived with the prisoner at the bar, and now lives with Eastoff. We staid till past eleven o'clock in order to get possession of the house. Then we went away to the Two Chairmen at the corner of the street, and had some beer. I returned back in order to get the key. She fell down on her knees, and swore she would not give it him. I proposed to her, that I would strive to persuade Mayo to give her half a dozen chairs, and the things they had taken out of the house, if they would quit the house. She still said she would hang him. Then I return'd back to Mr. Mayo at the Two Chairmen; then we came along the Strand homeward; he went to his own house in Goodman's-fields. It was past 12 at night before I parted with him. The next day he came to me in order to know what he could do to get possession; I told him the only way was to get an action against the woman; so she was arrested, and Eastoff too, and he made his escape; he was taken again last Tuesday.</p>
               <p>They did tamper with me. Mr. Eastoff proposed, that if Mr. Mayo would let Mrs. Mears out of goal, he would take care to keep the prosecutrix out of the way, so that she should not prosecute him.</p>

            . On the third day Mrs. Eastoff was in the Fleet, as the prosecutrix and I were going along Fleetstreet, she said she was almost mad, said she, what must I do? I must either go to Newgate or be hanged, or be pillory'd, if I do not go through with it. If they had not given me two or three drams I had not done it, and said how her conscience flew in her face when Mr. Mayo looked at her.</p>

            . I am uncle to the boy, I believe I should not have known any thing of the affair had not a neighbour informed me of it, in a letter the day after he was buried; then I thought it necessary to come up to London to inquire into the occasion of his death. I inquired and found the lad had been very much abused, as to my own knowledge I know nothing at all of it. I happened providentially to go by the door the very next morning after he had been served so. I live at Richmond, and called to see how he did, the prisoner told me he was a bed sulky, I said I hope you have had no words together, no, not in the least, said he, I only touched him with my finger on his hat or cap, and he is gone to bed sulky. I was going away, he faintly said, will you go up and see him; said I, if he is only sulky let him sleep half an hour. Here is the last letter I received from him, dated the first of May, we suppose he put it in the post on Tuesday night; he died on Friday morning about two o'clock. He was a lively active thing, a colour as fresh as a rose, as any body would desire to be.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have evidence here that he died a natural death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Evans. I am an apothecary, I was sent for by his master, he was in a very restless way when I came, nothing would stay on his stomach; he complained of his bowels, no passage downwards, from some great cold he had catched, and he was attended with a scrophulous humor, which might strike in. I was sent for on Monday April the 23d. he had been ill three or four days before, and had had no stool for five days before. I endeavoured to get a passage through him, by giving him oily medicines with glisters, &amp;c. but could get none. His pains continued, and reaching to vomit he brought up his excrements four or five days before he died. There was no bruises about him.</p>
