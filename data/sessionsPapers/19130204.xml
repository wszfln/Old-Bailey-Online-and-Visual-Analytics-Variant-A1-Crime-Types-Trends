I told him I was a police officer, and should arrest him on a warrant for obtaining jewellery valued at £20 by fraud from Messrs. Battersby's on December 16.

I told prisoner he would be put up for identification by a witness from 224, Shaftesbury Avenue, who would pick him out as a man calling for letters in the name of Thompson. He said, "What can I say in the face of that?" pointing to the property lying on the table in front of him, "I will give you all the assistance I can to recover the property. The um<lb/>brella and wallet are from Battersby's, and I am Thompson. You need not bring anybody to identify me. I used the Shaftesbury Avenue address in the name of Thompson, also Crawford Street, and 10, Branford Street. I shall plead guilty. I am sorry for what I have done. I have tried to get work, but could not, and it is because I was nearly starving I committed this offence." I told him there would probably be two other charges of a similar nature. He said, "I admit those two as well. I sent a telegram to the station master at Oxford, giving the name of Battersby, also one to the manager, 2, Princes Street, Oxford, in the name of Pattinson, and pledged for £4 9s. the watch bracelet from Battersby's with Davis, 40, St. Martin's Lane, in the name of Palmer, on December 31, 1912. The other watch from Battersby's I pledged for £5 at the same firm on Decem<lb/>ber 30 in the name of Lawrence Thompson, Weybridge. That is the receipt." Two receipts were lying on the table. "The gold and silver Albert and match-box I pledged at King's Road, Reading, for 14s. on December 17 or 18 in the name of R. Read."</p>

The goods I did obtain, but with no criminal intent as the indictment alleges, for the simple reason that none of the articles left my possession.

               <p>Prisoner confessed to having been convicted at this Court, on March 8, 1910, in the name of Albert Edwin Young.</p>
               <p>Prisoner was also indicted as a habitual criminal. The Common Serjeant said he did not think anything would be gained by trying that charge; the prisoner had, when arrested, given some assistance to the police in recovering the property.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my mother at 33, St. George's Road, Edmonton. I knew prisoner in October and walked out with him till just after Christmas when I told him I did not wish to keep company with him. On January 23 about 7.30 p.m. prisoner came to my home; he, me, my mother, Florrie Saunders, and William Heath went to the pictures; later we went to the "Crown and Horseshoe." Then prisoner walked home with me. He said, "Do you intend to go with me?" I said, "No." He pulled out a knife and attacked me, and I fell down.</p>

I examined the warrant, and said to prisoner, "We cannot give you this money just now; would it be convenient for you to call to<lb/>morrow?" He said, "I must have the money now." I said, "We have not sufficient money." He asked for his bank-book and the warrant. I said we should prefer to keep them. He said he would call again to-morrow. He then made towards the door. I said, "You must wait till we have made further inquiries regarding this account." He stepped out on to the pavement where a motor-bicycle was standing. I could see he intended mounting the machine. I got hold of the under part of the saddle and told him I should detain him on suspicion. He struck me a blow on the left shoulder with his fist. He set the engine going, put his foot on the left pedal, and endeavoured to mount. The motor shot out and got about 15 yards. I got hold of the handle-bar and threw the machine over. I went down with the machine, and called out, "Stop him." I pursued him as soon as I could get up. Several people heard me calling, and tried to intercept him. A constable came up eventually and took him to the police station at Chiswick.</p>

On January 8 at about 11 p.m. prisoner came into my shop and asked for 4d. of fish and 1/2 d. worth of potatoes; she asked me to serve her very quickly as her husband had had a drop of drink. As prisoner seemed very nervous I did serve her quickly. In payment she gave me 2s. piece (produced), for which I gave her 1s. 7 1/2 d. change. Prisoner then flew off. I put the coin in the till; it was the only coin I had in the till. About five minutes afterwards I saw prisoner being taken to the station by a policeman.

At the station Eliza Young said in the presence of the prisoner, "This is the woman who came into my shop and bought four penny pieces of fish." Pri<lb/>soner said, "That is quite right." When charged, and asked if she understood the charge, prisoner said, "I suppose I do not understand it."

               <p>Mr. W. W. Grantham, appearing for the prisoner, stated that pri<lb/>soner had suffered from very bad health, and he attributed these libels to disorder of the mind; prisoner had done splendid work as a clergy<lb/>man in the Church of England; he unreservedly withdrew the charges of fraud which he had made against prosecutor.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant, in passing sentence, said that prisoner had pleaded guilty to atrocious libels, attacking a man with various charges, which he admitted were absolutely false, and endeavouring to take away his character; there was no doubt that he had committed this offence for the purpose of compelling prosecutor to pay blackmail. It was impossible to pass over such conduct.</p>

                  </persName>. I saw prisoner on December 2 at Wood Green Petty Sessional Court. I told him he would be put up for identification as a man having received letters containing postal orders in the name of Hunt, at Muswell Hill, and also in the name of Wise, at 41, Elthorne Road. Miss Lewis identified him. At the police station he said, "I shall want you to make some inquiries for me. The persons who picked me out this morning were correct. I admit having called at their places for letters, but I did it for another man, named Wilson, who used to live at Galsworthy Road, Tottenham, but I do not know the number. He is known by the name of Frank Fox. He is rather a shady character and always on the bust, and goes in for playing billiards with the swells. I used to meet him at the "Bull" public-house, Tottenham. I hope you will be able to find him, for my sake. I asked him why he used so many different names. He said he used different names because he dabbles in all kinds of things. He was often outside the shops when I called for the letters, and no doubt some of the people will remember seeing him with me." He wrote me down several addresses, and I made inquiries. The ex<lb/>hibits (produced) are, in my opinion, in prisoner's handwriting.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner made the statement quite of his own accord. So far as I know he has been a man of respectable character hitherto.</p>

                  </persName>, N Division. On December 19 I saw prisoner receive some letters at a newspaper shop in High Road, Tottenham. I stopped him, told him I was a police officer, and asked his name. He said his name was Smith. Then I said, "I believe you to be a man named Wise, wanted on a warrant for fraud." I asked, "Where do you live?" He replied, "I don't think that has anything to do with you." I took him to St. Ann's Road Police Station and asked him if he had any incubators or poultry. He said, "No; I can get them." He then produced eight letters from his pocket and, at my suggestion, opened them. Six of those letters contained postal orders. When charged he gave the name of William Smith, of no fixed abode. On the 27th he was identified as West, Smith, and Hunt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner asked me to find a man named Wilson, but I have been unable to do so.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a painter and fish buyer. I first saw Wilson in November, 1911, at Club Row, Bethnal Green, where I went to purchase a few fowls. I have kept fowls all my life; it is a hobby of mine. Wilson asked me if I was a judge of birds, and I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040021"/>
               <p>told him I considered myself to be a bit of a judge. He asked me if I would meet him on the Monday, and I met him by appointment at the "Bull" Inn, Tottenham. He told me then he was a poultry dealer and farm agent and was in want of a man who knew something about poultry to go with him with a view to purchasing fowls to supply his contracts, as he had to supply the Jews mostly with poultry for killing purposes. It was arranged that I should receive my travelling expenses and a commission on my purchases. My purchases were to be at the rate of 6d. a 1b., and I was to buy birds by weight for killing purposes. If I could purchase at anything under that figure I was to receive commission on it. He paid me every week for the first five weeks and I was averaging from 30s. to 35s. a week. He asked me to let the next week's money run on a bit because he had not got some of his accounts in. He proposed that I should go into partnership with him if I could manage to rake up £50 and could manage to let the money run on and do a little painting in between. I let my money run on for a little. In February, 1912, he told me he was about to purchase a motor-bicycle, and asked me if I could lend him some money. I had been doing a little work and was not without money, and I lent him £3. He said the motor-bicycle would be a great saving of expense in getting about to markets and sales. He suggested that I should go in for one, but I told him I was not in the position to do so. I told him I should like some of the money I had lent him, and he told me he proposed to sell his own bicycle, and he had others to sell. We put advertisements into the papers. He wrote the one about the ducklings and I copied it on to one of their forms. Both advertisements are in my writing. The reason he gave for using different names was that he did not want to mix up a small retail trade with his wholesale trade. I went to the shops for letters sometimes, and he gave me to understand that sometimes he went. When we went together I always went into the shop, and when I came out I handed him the letters. I thought his business was being carried out in a genuine way. I had no duck<lb/>lings, but Wilson gave me to understand that he had. I last saw Wilson in November, 1912, in Leadenhall Market. The letters that were found on me were mine and addressed to me. I had only two of the Buff Orpingtons that I was advertising because I had sold six on the Wednesday. I was keeping them where I was employed at Edmonton. I asked Wilson for some money, as he owed me about £30, and he promised to let me have some in a few days. I have not seen him from that day to this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Wilson did not let me know where he had the fowls sent to, because then I should have been as much in the know as he was, and I could have fallen into his business. We used to make an ap<lb/>pointment over night as to where I should meet him next day, but our usual meeting place was at the "Bull," at ten o'clock. He should be well known there, but perhaps they did not know him by name. I do not think I have any of his handwriting. When I was arrested and the letters were opened I was surprised to find I had so many postal orders, and, of course, I acknowledged that I could not supply that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040022"/>
               <p>number. I think my mistress will be here to prove that. I have had incubators. I did have three, but since my arrest I think two have been sold. I keep a few poultry, but not to carry on business with.</p>

At 10.20 he came down and asked would I go up and speak to Mrs. Daley. I went up and saw deceased lying on her back on the floor of the kitchen.

There was a contusion over the left ear and over the right temple. At the post-mortem examination I found an effusion of blood on the right side under the scalp. The cause of death was effusion of blood on the brain. I should not think that a blow from the fist would have caused this injury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Deceased was not an ordinary healthy woman; she was suffering from pneumonia. It is possible that she may have died as the result of her falling on the floor. I found no bruises, as</p>

He said, "You don't mean to say that she is dead?" I said, "Yes." He said, "That's done it; I'm done; hang me, burn me, do what you like with me; I'm done; I never thought she would die; I only punched her." When formally charged he said, "I did not think it; that's a dunner; oh, my poor children."</p>

               <p>Mr. Justice Ridley said that he should tell the jury that it would be unsafe to convict of murder; if they found against prisoner, the verdict must be, guilty of manslaughter.</p>

On January 16 about nine p.m. prisoner came into the kitchen where I was and said, "You did not get that, then, you b----cow." I said, "I don't know what you mean; I have not got anything belonging to you." I understood her to refer to a letter that had been missed five months before. She went to the lavatory basin and came back and flung some liquid at me which went on to my blouse; then another lot went over my face and caught my eye and on to my hand; I was terribly burnt. Prisoner had threatened me before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. She had accused me and Lewis of taking a letter of hers. At the police court I did not call any of the lodgers because</p>

My husband came back in about three seconds and said to me, "What have you done to Mrs. Lewis; she says you have thrown something over her." I said, "Good gracious, man, what are you talking about? Here you left me and here I still am." Soon after the policeman came and took me. I had heard no screams.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see prosecutrix at all that evening. Her story is all a lie. I do not know anyone in the house likely to do such a thing. She may have done it herself in order to accuse me. It is not true that I have threatened her; she has threatened me.</p>

I said to him, "We are police officers." I had this cheque in my hand. I said, "You will probably be charged with forging and uttering this cheque well knowing it to have been forged." He said, "Don't say that." He then went on to make a statement. I cautioned him and said, "You need not make a statement unless you desire to do so, but what<lb/>ever you say may be used in evidence against you." He then said, "During the last week I have been working for J. Aaronstein, who oc<lb/>cupies four rooms of a warehouse in Blackhorse Yard. I had to meet Mr. Aaronstein at Aldgate Station this morning at nine o'clock. I met him as arranged. He said, 'Here is a cheque,' at the same time handing it to me, 'go to the bank in Lombard Street and cash this cheque; if they ask you how you want it say £40 in gold and ten £5 notes. When you get the money meet me here at two o'clock and give me the money and I will pay you the wages what you have earned.' I then left him and went home. I went for a walk and then came on to the bank." He was then taken to Cloak Lane Police Station and charged, when he said, "I did not know it was forged." Upon searching him this pocket-book was found. It contains an entry, "10—5—40—gold."</p>

               <p>no work to do next week I could have a job with him for a few days, and I was to come down to his place at Blackhorse Yard at nine o'clock on Monday. I helped him with goods he used to hawk about—hosiery and all kinds of things. I left that day and a few days after he sent me a postcard that I was to meet him again to go on the following Friday to the Cattle Market, Caledonian Road. On Friday night when I left him he gave me instructions to meet him at nine o'clock next morning, when he gave me this cheque to get changed at the bank. While I was in custody I asked Inspector Newell to go to this public-house to ascertain that I have been there with this man, who is known there as Aaronstein. I gave a description of him.</p>

Prisoner called on me last September and asked if I would like to have an advertisement on the curtain of the Alexandra Theatre, Stoke Newington. I said I did not mind. He showed me the space on the plan of the curtain. The price was to be 6s. per quarter. I paid him 3s. as a deposit. He gave the receipt (produced). He wrote it in my presence. I never saw him again until he was in custody.</p>

I asked him what the cost would be. He said 2s. 6d. for 13 weeks. I said I would pay when I saw the advertisement on the screen. He said he must have cash with order, being such a low transaction. I paid him 2s. 6d. He wrote this receipt in my presence. The advertisement did not appear. I next saw prisoner in the dock at North London Police Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I carry on business as Foru and Co., 43, High Street, Oxford Street. We are advertising agents. I first met pri<lb/>soner on August 2 last, when I employed him to go to Fakenham, Nor<lb/>folk, as advertising canvasser. I gave him contracts, a receipt-book, and a plan. Prisoner had no authority to canvass Hart or Farlow.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040030"/>
               <p>He had no authority to canvass for advertisements on theatre curtains He had to see landlords of hotels and get their consent to display tradesmen's advertisements in their saloon bars, for which we pay so much per year.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I first saw you on the Thursday before August Bank Holiday. You called next day. You saw one of my travellers, who asked you a few questions while I sat at the table. You were to work anywhere you liked at 25 per cent. commission on all takings, no salary or expenses. I never heard the name of Fakenham till you mentioned it. You said you preferred Norfolk. I wanted £5 cash security before you left town. You gave an I.O.U. for £5. I got no telephone message from you that day. I did not receive a batch of orders from you. I did not meet you in Southampton Row in Sep<lb/>tember and tell you to make yourself scarce. I did not tell you you could work stationery or anything that would bring grist to the mill. I received no message from you about August 16 saying a lot of money had been made by advertising on picture palace curtains. I answered somebody on the telephone about the middle of September asking if a man had called representing Foru and Co., and I did not reply that I would come down and see him at once.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). Foru and Co. engaged me at no salary, no expenses, and 25 per cent. commission. 15 per cent. of the money was to be left in their hands until £5 was accu<lb/>mulated. That was to safeguard them against anything I did wrong. I did not see the fun of leaving 15 per cent. out of 25 per cent., so I gave an I.O.U. I telephoned him that I could not walk to Norfolk, and as he would not agree to pay my fare I would work London. He said, "All right," on the telephone. I telephoned him several times afterwards and told him what a good scheme it was advertising on picture-palace curtains, and he made the condition that I returned him the first 25 per cent.; thus I was to work about six months without taking a farthing piece. His previous arrangement was I should get the 25 per cent. I kept Mr. Hart and Mr. Farlow's money, who paid the first quarter. One of my men, named Beale, I think, went to the office to try and get some more. He told me Mr. Charlton had got a warrant out for me. I telephoned asking Charlton if that was correct. I said, "It is rather funny, a man came to my place." Mr. Charlton replied, "Hold the man, I will come to the house with a taxi to St. Paul's Road, Canonbury." I think he came by 'bus. I did not want to waste any time. I thought he was not worth working for. I met him in Southampton Row a few days after. He said, "What is all this fuss about, make yourself scarce." He denied that in the box. I leave it entirely to the jury.</p>

On November 16, 1912, at 12.15 p.m., prisoner presented cheque produced for £46 3s. and asked for four £5 notes and the rest in gold. I examined the cheque, scrutinised the prisoner, and spoke to my chief clerk. The cheque produced is on a special form never used by Whitbread and Co. for payments across the counter, for which they use the ordinary form. After speaking to the chief clerk I returned, scrutinised prisoner very closely, and paid him the money. On January 24 at Cannow Row Police Station I picked prisoner out from 16 other men. I have not the slightest doubt he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not ask the chief clerk to look at prisoner so that he could identify him again. I have never seen prisoner be<lb/>fore. I go to Miller's restaurant. I have never had conversation with or seen prisoner there.</p>

(The witness identified the signature of a great number of letters.) We frequently signed letters in the fictitious names of "Nest," "Lest," "Deltout," "Quenhoven," "Stefan," and "Placabi" demanding small sums for expenses. I have seen book produced in the office; it is in Cesar's handwriting and contains a large number of names and addresses, with sums of 11.75, 19.35, 17.50 francs and other amounts, commencing July 17 and ending October 8, 1912. I wrote many form letters asking for remittances of similar amounts. Copy letter book produced contains a great number of letters signed by prisoner. (Upwards of 200 letters, forms, and other exhibits were put to the witness, including alphabetical lists of a great number of persons from whom money had been received as fees for obtaining loans.)</p>

                  </hi>, 17, Station Parade, Muswell Hill, draper. On January 16, 1913, I attended an auction at 6, Duke's Avenue, and bought a safe in which I found documents produced which I handed to Sergeant Grosse.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate: "I reserve my defence."</p>
               <p>Mr. Wippell submitted there was no jurisdiction in this Court to try the case; it was not an indictment of obtaining money by false pretences but an offence under Section 4 of the Moneylenders Act of a false statement or dishonest concealment of a material fact induc<lb/>ing a person to borrow or agree to borrow money; no false statement was made in England; advertisements inserted in a French newspaper induced no one in this country; the agreements, if any, were made in France by French people; prisoner ought to be tried in France where the offence (if any) was committed. Further, there was no evidence of fraudulent intent.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. I think the offence under Section 4 is com<lb/>mitted, if at all, where the false statement is made. Prisoner makes it here, although he may also make it in France. This Court has jurisdiction. There is plenty of evidence of intent to defraud.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant to Charles Chester, pawnbroker, 240, Gray's Inn Road. On January 17 about 7.45 p.m. the overcoat (produced) was hanging outside the shop. It was worth 7s. From what I was told I went outside and found the coat was missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I can recognise the coat by there being two different buttons. There were no marks on it by which anyone might know it had been stolen.</p>

                  </hi>, hairdresser, 50, Calthorpe Street, W.C. On January 17, about 8.30 p.m. the two prisoners came into my shop. I knew them both as being customers, but I did not know their names. Wallace wanted to sell me the overcoat (produced) for 15s. I told him that I did not want it and I had no money. He also offered me a pair of boots and said he would put the two in for a sovereign. I declined. Later Hare came in and asked if Wallace had sold anything and I said "No." Hare then offered another coat for sale for 5s. I did not buy it, but I told him there was a customer of mine who was wanting a coat something after this style, and if he would leave it I would try and sell it. Hare then hung the coat up in the shop. A moment afterwards a police officer called me outside and asked me if there were two chaps wanting to sell me a coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Both Wallace and Hare brought the articles in quite openly.</p>

                  </persName>, 399 G. On this evening I saw prisoners enter Baldwin's shop. Both were wearing overcoats. I went inside and saw the coat (produced) hanging up. I told prisoners I had good reason to believe it had been stolen from Chester's shop. I took prisoners to King's Cross Road Police Station, and neither pri<lb/>soner made a reply to the charge. At the station Hare said, "I was trying to sell the coat for a friend in Rowton House." Wallace said, "Both the coats belong to the same man in Rowton House; we were trying to sell them for him."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I received the information from a gentleman in Gray's Inn Road, who told me that the two men had stolen a coat and run away. He gave me a description of the men.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On this night I was in the "Packington" public-house. A man came in and wanted to sell a coat. He said, "Could you do with this?" I said, "No"; but afterwards I went to the barber's shop to try and sell it. My goods came out of the sale room. Then Hare came into the barber's shop while I was there and tried to sell a coat. He said, "I will sell you this coat for a dollar." The barber said, "All right, leave it here, I have a customer for it in the morning." I also left the other coat and boots on approval.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am a friend of Hare; we have driven commercial broughams together. We did not leave the public-house together; Hare came to the barber's shop about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I had not seen that coat until I was in the public-house. I had had a drop of drink, but I don't think I told the officer they both belonged to the same man. I had not arranged with Hare to go to the barber's shop.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On the night I went to the "Packington" I saw a man who had an overcoat for sale. He asked me if I would buy it for 5s., and I told him I did not want it. He said, "Well, try it on." So I took my own overcoat off and tried it on. It was too big for me. He then said, "Do you know anybody you can do it in to," that is, to sell it. I replied, "If you wait till later on I will take it round to a jobmaster and try." He said, "Keep it on and take it round now." I said, "I am going over to the barber's to have a shave, and I will go there afterwards." I went there and found Wallace trying to sell an overcoat and boots. We got chatting and, as he told me he had asked the barber to buy his overcoat and boots, I said, "Could you do with this for a dollar." He said, "No, but there is a customer of mine who might possibly do with it," and that I should have to go there in the morning. He hung it up there on a nail and soon after that a policeman came in. All he asked me was where the coat was and, before I could reply, the barber's boy gave him the overcoat. At the police station I said the man from whom I got the coat lived at Rowton House, but I did not know his name. I was merely trying to sell it, and might have got a shilling out of it. I am not disputing that it was stolen, but I do not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The man who gave me the coat they call "Scottie." I did not tell the officer that was his name; I presume that was his nick-name.</p>

            <p>Mr. Graham-Campbell, who prosecuted, stated that prisoner was convicted on December 9, and in releasing him upon his own recogni<lb/>sances Mr. Justice Darling warned him that if he in any way molested his wife he would be brought up for judgment and might receive ten years' penal servitude. On January 23 prisoner met his wife in Vaux<lb/>hall Bridge Road and said to her, "Well, I got out of that job all right; it won't be 10 or 15 years next time; I will do the job properly; I think nothing of hanging; it is nothing to me." On January 26, in the early morning, prosecutrix found him under her bed, and she gave him into custody.

                  </hi>. I lived at 137, Weedington Road, Hollo<lb/>way, with prisoner and our two children, Ruby, eight months, and Harriett Ethel, 13 1/2 years old; the latter has been subject to epileptic fits all her life. Prisoner has been attended by Dr. Whitehead during the last three years. On January 2 I noticed that she seemed very strange and depressed. On January 4 I went out to work at 9.15 a.m. At half-past 11 I was sent for and went back home. There I found this paper in prisoner's handwriting: "Could not bear it any longer. God forgive for what I have done." Prisoner was a kind mother, especially to this child, on account of her affliction.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner and I had lived together on most affec<lb/>tionate terms for twenty years. During the last two years there has been a great change in her health; she has complained of pains in her head and noises and loss of sight.</p>

Prisoner said she would take it up herself, and she did so. Shortly afterwards pri<lb/>soner said, "I am going to the doctor's; don't go to Ethel, she is asleep." She also muttered something like "God has silenced those lips." Soon after she had gone out the police and the doctor came. The piece of cord produced used to hang up in the scullery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner was a most devoted mother. Before January 4 I had heard prisoner saying strange things, such as "God has fitted the back for the burden," "There is only One who knows," etc.</p>

Round her throat was this piece of cord, three times tied. The cause of death was strangulation. I think that at the time the strangulation was effected the child was in a fit.

                  </hi>, porter, 16, Highbury Crescent, N. I was in Holloway Road about midnight on January 21, when I was stopped by the two prisoners. James threw his left arm round me; with the right hand he dipped into my waistcoat pocket and extracted my watch, and remarked, "Shout, you b----, and I'll kill you." I snatched the watch back from James and saw the other prisoner im<lb/>mediately in front of me. I broke away from them and, seeing two constables, gave them into custody.</p>

I immediately came out of a doorway. Ransom said, "I give the two men into custody for taking my watch." I took them to the station and they were charged. They had had a glass or two of beer, but they were not the worse for drink. They knew very well what they were doing.</p>

We went into the Horse and Groom, Holloway Road, and stopped there till we could not get any more beer. It was nearly turning-out time. We came out and went up the road to the Swan, near the Highbury Road Picture Palace; then these two constables claimed me, for what I don't know. I thought I was to be charged with being drunk. I was not two minutes' walk from home.</p>

                  </hi>, widow, 21, Sidney Buildings, Poplar. On Decem<lb/>ber 29 at 12.30 a.m. I was in East India Dock Road, by North Street, walking towards the "Dock House" public-house. A man came up to me whom I had never met before and asked me if I knew him. I said, "No, I have never seen you before in my life." Then he asked me if I knew some girl named Carrie. I replied, "I know her and I have not seen her for some time." He told me that two days before he had arrived by the ship "Moravian," and could not find her. We walked on towards the "Dock House," and then I went by myself to my house. As soon as I reached there I went upstairs and he was behind me. I turned off the gas, and he took me by the back way and choked me. Then I fell on my knees and asked him for pity. I do not remember what happened to me after that till I came to about 10 hours later. I was lying on the floor of the bedroom. When the man assaulted me I was in the sitting-room. At that time I had a hand<lb/>bag containing a purse and £3 10s. in money, two pawntickets, a bunch of keys, and a little metal watch. The purse and money had gone when I came round. I had very bad pains and blue marks on my left side, my skin was cracked in a few places. I was very bad. I could not speak or swallow and there were blood marks across my mouth. I went straight to Mr. Taylor's shop at High Street, Poplar, and there found the young lady, Carrie. I was offered a glass of water and I fainted there. She took me to her place and I fainted there, and I was very sick all day long. After I came round at my place I found this handkerchief in the bedroom.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040045"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. When I came round I went to borrow some money, as you had left me none. The girl I had spoken of is Carrie Bennett. I did not complain to the police on the way because I was so sick that I do not remember seeing any. I do not know my neighbours and I had to go somewhere. I did not show you a photo before you left me. About four years ago I rented a room in Harrow Lane, but I never met you there.</p>

When prosecutrix, who I have known for four or five years, came to Taylor's shop she was very excited and troubled, and when I asked her what the matter was she did not answer me. She had a few scratches and a bruise on her throat and bruises on the chin and jaw. Then we went to my place. I went to her place about 11 o'clock next day and afterwards saw prisoner. I said to him, "Hullo, you nice beauty, what have you been up to? Isn't it about time you took over a new life?" He did not answer me, but started to cry. I recollect a man named Sam and an incident which took place of the breaking of some crockery.</p>

He said, "She knows me by going to the 'Railway Tavern' and the 'Dock House.'" When he was put up for identification prosecutrix picked him out with<lb/>out any trouble.

                  </persName>, 601 R. On December 21 Ser<lb/>geant Baker and I went to the Freemason's Hall. I arranged to play with him all the evening as partners. The defendant was in charge. Sergeant Baker purchased a scoring card. We paid 6d. for the minia<lb/>ture drive. There were 16 tables at that. One hand of whist was played at each table. The winning couple went to the next table, the losing couple remained. Each table had a card affixed to it indi<lb/>cating what the trumps would be. We out for deal. The cards were dealt face downwards. The last card was not turned up. After 16 hands were played the score of each pair was added up. The pair</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040047"/>
               <p>that got the highest aggregate score received the first prize. After an interval of 15 minutes we began again with a new scoring card, which cost 1s. 2d. for the two. We played 24 hands. There were three prizes. We went again on the 23rd. The games were con<lb/>ducted in exactly the same way. There were 144 players at 36 tables. We went again on the 26th; there were 18 tables and 72 players. I know the difference between partner whist and progressive whist. In the latter you change partners each hand. In partner drives the element of chance is less than the element of skill. The drives were well conducted. No alcohol was sold. The prizes were useful ones. I used to go as an ordinary player, not as a detective. Sergeant Baker played very well. I am not an expert player. On our three cards we got scores of 148, 157, and 147. In the miniature game we scored 46. We were uniformly unsuccessful. If we had known a little more about the game we might have done better. Hav<lb/>ing a fixed trump does not make it more a game of chance.</p>

He said if we decided to prosecute he would give us facilities to see the game played. I saw him again on December 17 and told him we had no option but to prosecute if he continued the drives.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know the details of a recent partner whist prosecution. Inspector Woodcock saw the defendant before I did. I know defendant has taken up the attitude that he is doing a legal act.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am employed in the Wool<lb/>wich Arsenal. I have played whist some 20 years. It is absolutely a game of skill. I used to organise whist drives on behalf of an asso<lb/>ciation. They presented me with a gold watch in recognition of my services. In October, 1911, I commenced whist drives at Free<lb/>mason's Hall. Ninety per cent. of the players are Arsenal men and their wives. Most of them are expert players. The drives originally were ordinary progressive. Since the case of Morris v. Godfrey I introduced partner drives. I consider them legal. I consider it a game where skill predominates over chance. It increases the skill of the game not to have the trump card shown. In addition to the ordinary prizes there is an aggregate prize. Those that do not win a prize hand in their cards at the end of the evening and they choose their partners for a whole month. At the end of the month the scores are totalled up and the lady and gentleman with the highest score take prizes. The games are conducted in silence and proper time is given for playing each hand. The games are over at 11 o'clock at the latest. The profit for the 14 months of the whist drives and refreshment bar was £58.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040048"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. I ran the partner drive system before the deci<lb/>sion in Morris v. Godfrey. The players are mainly acquainted with each other. They pick their partners from knowledge of their skill. I am in the room and watch their play. I very often inform a player that so-and-so is a good player. I advertised the meetings in the local papers. The profit I make is partly the motive for continuing the drives. The room is open to anybody and everybody that comes is respectably dressed and clean. Some people play better than others. The system of selling the cards determines who is going to play agains. whom. Whether the pair who purchase one card are as good players as the pair who purchase another is purely a matter of chance. I would not agree that the way in which the playing-cards run is the main determining factor. If you take the abnormal the predomi<lb/>nance of the cards would override skill, but not if you take the normal. Two gentlemen playing together have two tricks deducted. I do not agree with the officer who said there is more chance in pro<lb/>gressive whist than in ordinary whist. I agree with the Lord Chief Justice on that point.</p>

                  </hi>. I am examiner of forgings in the Royal Arsenal. I have known defendant since a lad. I know him as a man of unimpeachable character. I have played whist 23 years. I con<lb/>sider it a game of skill. Much is made of the fact that the deal con<lb/>trols the game, but my experience goes to show that the deal or succession of deals only lends infinite variety to the game, and the subsequent combinations of cards affords many problems in conjunc<lb/>tion with your partner's hands which only skilled players can solve. The average player will solve a few, but the average unskilled player will solve very few. I have attended very few of these meetings. They are very respectable people who go, and they are a fair class of average skilled players. I generally play with my wife when I go. I played with her from January, 1912, to January, 1913. In that time we won 26 prizes playing together and four prizes when playing separately. By choosing your partner, if your partner is equally skilled as yourself you have an infinitely better chance of winning a prize or securing a higher aggregate score than by taking a partner lesser skilled than yourself. I think by having a highly skilled partner to play with the game is emphatically a game of skill; in fact, the predominant feature is skill. I have won three aggregate prizes. I think the aggregate sheet is the best test of skill you can imagine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The reason my wife won three prizes and I only one when I had not her as a partner is accounted for by the fact that I was playing at another club and was not able to attend Mr. Bur<lb/>nett's drives. I have noticed the general feeling prevailing between skilled players is such that when one highly-skilled couple meets another highly-skilled couple scoring the odd trick it invariably gives them more satisfaction than when playing against a less skilled couple and getting a matter of 10 tricks. There is an element of chance entering into every sport and every game, but to my mind</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040049"/>
               <p>the deal of the cards, dealing with it in the abstract, is merely an incident in the game.</p>

I have won eight or nine prizes with Mr. Walkden. The players are what I should call the upper set of the artisan class. They are mostly very good players. I consider whist a game of skill. I have won aggregate prizes two months running.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. You do not get prizes for nothing; you have to use a certain amount of skill and you have to think what you are doing all the evening or else you would not get good points.</p>

Four years ago prisoner was manager of our Ruislip branch; 18 months ago he was transferred to our Uxbridge branch as an assis<lb/>tant; two months ago he was sent back to Ruislip as a junior assis<lb/>tant. On January 7, about 6.20 p.m., I was in my office when there was an alarm of fire. In the baker's loft there was a great deal of smoke and in a lumber room adjoining we found on the floor a heap of woolwork and sack smouldering. To get to the lumber room one had to go through the loft. The fire having been got under I asked prisoner if he had been anywhere near the loft; he said he had not.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). Up to this there has been no suggestion against my character. I live with my parents. On January 7 Miss Taylor, the cashier, spoke to me about a smell of fire or "a funny smell"; I said it was the bakehouse hams cooking. Later on Littleworth told me he smelt fire; I told him to go and have a look round; he did not take the trouble, so I said I would have a look. I went half way up the stairs; it was dark, so I came down again. I swear that I did not go near the loft. I had no hand in causing the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know that any of the witnesses have any ill will towards me. There had been a smell of fire all this day; it was made fun of, really. I admit that I said at the police court that I had a grievance against Mr. East in regard to my transference from one branch to the other; I had no grievance, really, but I did not like being shifted.</p>

                  </hi>, 2, Union Street, Pimlico. I acted as housekeeper for my cousin, Miss Mary Constance Lewis. On Christmas Day we went out to go to Fulham; it was raining. At Oakley Street we had to cross the road; before we started to cross we looked over the Albert Bridge and saw nothing. I was on Miss Lewis's right-hand side, my left arm in her right arm. We had got nearly across, about half a yard from the further kerb, when I was knocked down and found myself under a cab; I crawled out and walked to the Pier Hotel, hold<lb/>ing on to the wall. Miss Lewis was a very active woman, with good sight and hearing. My own sight and hearing on the right side are defective. I heard no sound of a hooter. We were taken to the hospital, where my cousin died.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We walked straight across and did not hesitate.</p>

                  </hi>, caretaker, St. Leonard's Mansions, Smith Street, Chelsea. I was standing outside the Pier Hotel when I saw the two ladies walk across Oakley Street; I do not think they were arm-in-arm. When they were within four or six feet of the pavement a taxicab, coming from Albert Bridge direction, knocked both of them down. I heard no sound of a hooter. The cab was going about 12 or 15 miles an hour. Prisoner drove the two women to the hospital; I was there, too. On being told that one woman was killed, prisoner said to me, "This will mean something for me; I tried to pull up, but I could not, as the road was greasy," I saw no hesitation on the part of the women as they crossed.</p>

As the two ladies were crossing the road towards me I saw a taxicab leaving the approach to Albert Bridge, about 25 to 30 yards away; it came straight on, did not slacken speed, and knocked the women down; it was going about 12 miles an hour. I heard no hooter. There was no traffic about. There was plenty of room for the cab to have passed to the right of the women. The road was slightly greasy from the rain. I went with prisoner in the cab with the ladies to the hospital. He said to me, "You had better make a note of that lady's eyes"—meaning Miss Douglas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The women were arm-in-arm. Prisoner rendered all the assistance he could after the occurrence. He was perfectly sober. So far as I know he is a young man of good character and repu<lb/>tation.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have had considerable experience in driving motor vehicles in London, and have never had an accident before this. On this evening I was coming over Albert Bridge. I noticed the two ladies just getting off the kerb in Oakley Street; they were about 15 yards from me; I was going about 12 to 14 miles an hour. I had my foot brake on and was sounding the hooter. The women hesitated, and I thought they had stopped to let me go by; I accelerated a little to pass between them and the kerb; they made a dash for the kerb and it was impossible for me to avoid them. I sounded the hooter when I was quite near to them, and shouted as well.</p>

                  </hi>. On January 7, about 9.30 p.m., I went to 4, Morton Terrace, Pimlico, where prisoners resided, and saw them both. The woman told me that the child James had had a dirty head since Christmas; that since the previous Sunday had had diarrhœa and sickness; and that she had given him some ointment and powder from a chemist's. I saw the child, about four years old; it was in an exceedingly weak condition, moribund. I prescribed Valentine's meat juice and suitable stimulants to revive the child, and said it should go to the hospital. After midnight the male prisoner came to me and said the child was very bad. I went at once, and the child was then dead. I reported the case to the coroner. On January 8 I made a post-mortem examination. The body was in an extremely emaciated condition; the head was covered with lice; there were several ulcers; these must have been in growth for a fortnight before death; any person might have seen that the child was suffering. If it had been medically attended to its life would certainly have been prolonged. The cause of death was syncope owing to want of proper assimilation of food, caused by blood poisoning set up by the vermin on the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. FitzGerald. The woman told me that she had been treating the child's head since Christmas. Poor people very often omit to call in a doctor and go to the chemist in such cases. The child was decently covered, and there was a fire in the room. There were no signs of bruises or violence on the body.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Tully-Christie. At the post-mortem I found that the treatment I had ordered the night before had been carried out. The mother appeared to be greatly concerned about the child She is not an educated woman.</p>

               <p>I noticed that he had a towel round his head; I asked his mother what was the matter; she said he had a nasty sore, and she was afraid he would scratch it. I told her she ought to take him to the hospital. On January 6 I saw them again; I told the mother that she ought to have the doctor in; she said she had no money; I lent her a parcel to raise some money on. That night I saw her; she said she had been to the chemist and got some lotion or ointment; she said she had got 3s. 6d. on my parcel. Next day I heard the boy, and I told prisoner she must have a doctor; she said she would fetch him in presently. Prisoners have been living with me for twelve months; the man is a sober and thorough hardworking man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The mother always seemed found of her children. When I advised her to take the child to the hospital she replied that she dreaded the hospital. The father also was very fond of the children, and seemed much upset when he found how bad this child was.</p>

On January 8 last I went to 4, Morton Terrace; prisoners occupied three rooms there.

On January 25 of 1912 I had called on prisoners; the home was in a very filthy con<lb/>dition; the male prisoner said he would see to it.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a coach-builder's painter, and earn about 37s. 6d. a week; I work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; I am at work on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. I have been continually complaining to and quarrelling with my wife about the condition of our house. Two or three days after Christmas I noticed that this child had a sore on his head, and called the wife's attention to it, and said she had better take him to the hospital; she said she would see to it. I did not know the child was really ill until I came home on January 7 at 10 p.m. The wife said she had seen the doctor, who had said the child was to have Valentine's meat juice; I gave her the money to fetch it. We gave him what the doctor had ordered.</p>

               <p>He made a whiny noise, and the wife went across to him and said, "Look, he is in a fit." I ran and fetched Mrs. Foster and then ran for the doctor; when he came the child was dead.</p>

                  </hi>, linotype operator, Shacklewell Lane, N.E. On December 1 I left my brother-in-law's house, 94, Hoxton Street, between 12.50 and 1 a.m. My wife and little boy were with me. At 12.53 we were waiting for a tram at the corner of Essex Street. I was as sober as I am now. Three men came along from the direction of Stamford Hill and bundled us unceremoniously into the road. My wife remonstrated with them. They turned round. Wetherill said, "Go away you b----cow." My wife raised her umbrella and struck him across the face. There was a slight scuffle and my wife was sent flat on her back. I went to her assistance, raised her to her feet and before I was in a standing position myself I received several severe blows on the head and was knocked to the ground. I could not say positively who struck me, but immediately I got upon my feet Wetherill attacked me like a madman. I endeavoured to defend myself as well as I could and keep an eye on the little boy and his wife. While doing so I saw my wife knocked or pushed down twice by Smithe or Brooks. I saw my wife knock Smithe's hat off. She picked it up and raised it as if to throw it over the hoarding, but realising that the hoarding was too high she dropped it on to the ground. I was then knocked down again by Wetherill. On getting to my feet I saw my wife running after the other two, who were in the act of running away. I followed to the corner of Falkirk Street, but we could not see any sign of the men. We went back and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040056"/>
               <p>found Wetherill searching for a ring he said he had lost. He was alone. I said to him that I did not think much of his pals for running away. I believe he said, "Neither do I." At that time I had no idea he was a policeman. I do not remember seeing a soul pass by. There were only two people got on or off the car that stopped. While Wetherill was searching for his ring a uniformed constable came up. My wife said to him, "I want this man locked up and also the two men that have run away." Just about the same time she spotted one of the others returning. That was Smithe. The constable in uniform did not answer my wife, but began to put his hand on my shoulder saying, "What is the trouble, old man?" I said something to the effect, "It is alright. There is no trouble. I am going." At the same time Wetherill attacked me in a most cowardly manner from behind again. He took me by one arm, Smithe took me by the other. They took me to the station and locked me up. The uniformed con<lb/>stable was present all the time. My wife followed me to the station. When they got me to the station they pushed me into a chair and Wetherill struck me in the eye, blackening it. There were two reserve men, I was told afterwards, there at the time. They were at the other end of the room. Shortly afterwards Inspector Newman came in. I was charged with being drunk. The inspector would not accept that. I was then charged with being one of seven men standing at the corner as they came along, one of whom was supposed to have said, "Here comes two f----g constables, let us down them." And I am supposed to have struck Wetherill in the mouth. There is no truth in that. I never used such an expression in my life. There were no seven men there. Smithe said very little: he just corroborated the charge. He said in the charge room, "This means a month to-morrow for you." I made insistent demands for my doctor to be sent for. They would not send for him. After about an hour the divisional-surgeon arrived and dressed my ear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had one glass of beer with my supper at 8 o'clock at the "Standard" Office. A bottle of beer at a public-house after 10.30, some stout with my supper at my brother-in-law's, and a small drop of whiskey when I left there. I do not identify Brooks as one of the three men who committed the assault. I do not think it was Smithe who struck me; he seemed to be too far away. I saw Smithe and the other man disappear round the corner, then I went back to Wetherill. The uniformed constable did not immediately come up. Wetherill struck me again in the presence of the uniformed constable. I heard what my wife said to the constable. He came straight to me, seeing the condition I was in I suppose. I was placed in the charge room on a chair by the side of the dock. The inspector came through a door near the dock. There is another door that was open the whole time. It is not a small room. The reserve officers were at the other end of the room, walking up and down when Wetherill struck me in the face. They had nothing to do with me. There was another man in uniform, but I do not say I saw him as I was taken in. I could not hear what the inspector said when it was suggested that I was drunk. He shook his head and refused that.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040057"/>
               <p>Next I heard him say, "Not drunk." I gathered he thought I was under the influence of drink. I did not hear the whole of his sentence. Wetherill and Smithe then gave the inspector their account of what had happened. When they had done so I said, "Speak the truth." I did not say a word about having been struck in the station. As far as I remember I did not say at the police court, "I have never stated that my wife was struck." I say she was pushed. To the best of my recollection I have not said she was struck. I may have said so when I was charged, because I was in a very bad state. I did not say any<lb/>thing to the doctor as to how the injury to my eye was caused. I do not remember saying at the police court, "I told the inspector generally what had happened." He said, "You had better not say too much." The last part referred to my persistent demands for my doctor to be sent for. I believe at the time of the assault Wetherill was knocked to the ground by me. He was not insensible. All his injuries were not inflicted by me. When he made the bull-rush at me he might have hurt himself. He certainly defended himself. After he knocked me down I attacked him with my fist. I could not tell you where I struck him. When I received the blow in the police-station I said, "You coward." I do not think I shouted.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The reason I did not complain to the uniformed constable was that I had lost a considerable amount of blood and all I thought about was getting home. The reason I did not complain to the inspector at the station was that I was flabbergasted at the charge. When they multiplied me into seven men it was enough to take the wheel off.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of first witness. I spent the evening of December 1 at my brother-in-law's, Mr. Head. We left there about 12.53, myself, my husband, and my little boy. We walked to the corner of Essex Street waiting for the car. Three men came and knocked us into the road. They were the prisoners. They were the worse for drink and were singing. The middle man was Brooks. I pro<lb/>tested. With that Wetherill threw me down, abused me, and called me a b----cow. I struck him with the umbrella on the face or head. He knocked me to the ground. My husband came up. He said it was hardly the way to behave in the street, whereupon the whole three men struck him while in a stooping position. I called them "Cowards, three men to one." Then my husband seemed to be left with Wetherill. I raised my umbrella and knocked Smithe's hat off. My umbrella was taken away, and broken by Brooks. I was knocked to the ground again. I tried to throw Smithe's hat over the hoarding; it was too high. After that I spoke to Brooks and Smithe. Brooks pushed his face into mine, and said, "Go away." I said, "I do not intend going away until I have had you locked up." Smithe was there then. Wetherill was not. I was again knocked down by Brooks. Smithe and Brooks then ran away down Falkirk Street. I went after them. When I got to the corner there was no sign of them. I came back with my husband and little boy, and found Wetherill looking for</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040058"/>
               <p>his ring. I told him I intended to have him locked up, and should make him give the names and addresses of the two men who ran away, because he must know them. My husband said something about he had two nice friends to run away. After that there was a policeman in uniform there. I told him I wanted Wetherill locked up and two others. I said, "Here is one of the men." That was Smithe, who was in the middle of the road. The officer in uniform said to my husband, in the hearing of Wetherill, "What's up, old man?" My husband was then bleeding. Wetherill came and struck him. My husband said he wanted to get away home, "I have had enough." Smithe and Wetherill got hold of my husband's arms. I said to the uniformed officer, "You allow these men to take my husband after you have seen what he has done?" He said, "I am very sorry, madam, I cannot in<lb/>terfere; they are plain-clothes policemen." My husband was taken to the station by Wetherill. I followed with my little boy to the police station. I had not opportunity of complaining at the station. I sub<lb/>quently got bail for my husband. He was brought up next day and discharged. On December 7 I went to Old Street Police Station and saw 32 men in plain clothes. I identified Brooks. I have no doubt whatever that he is the man. I first picked out another man. It was a very bad light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I said at the police court the prisoners were the worse for drink. I say so now. I was thrown upon the ground three times. The roads and pavements were very dirty. I showed the mud on my dress to the inspector; I heard him deny this in the police court.</p>

The men were drawn up in two lines. The third man in the front line was Brooks. Mrs. Chapman stopped at the third man, looked very hard at him, and passed on. After she got to the end of the line she turned back and stopped at Brooks again. She said, "I am almost positive that is the man, but I would not swear." She then saw the back row. She stopped when she arrived at the man Healy. She said, "That man is something like the man, but not so much as the other."</p>

                  </persName>, G. I was on duty at Old Street Police Station in the early morning of December 2 when Mr. Chapman was brought in by Wetherill and Smithe. Wetherill said at 12.55 he and Smithe were walking along Kingsland Road towards the police station, and as they passed Essex Street they saw seven men, a woman and child standing at the corner of that thoroughfare. As they passed one of the men said, "There goes two f----g coppers." Chapman then said, "If they are two coppers let us do them down," and immediately struck him a blow in the mouth with his fist. He followed that up with another blow on the forehead, which knocked him to the ground. He then recovered his feet and told Chapman he was a police officer and should arrest him. Smithe came to his assistance and Chapman struggled violently and he had to strike him several blows in the face</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040059"/>
               <p>to subdue his violence. He said during the struggle he had lost his watch and chain and matchbox and a ring from the finger of his left hand. Chapman was suffering from a cut and contused left ear. Wetherill added, "I think he is drunk." I said, "No, he is certainly not drunk; he may be under the influence of drink, but that part must be dropped." At this time Smithe was in the charge room outside. He afterwards came in and practically corroborated Wetherill's statement. He said that Police-constable 525, Walker, appeared on the scene in uniform, and could not understand why he was not at the station. I sent for Walker. I said to him, "Wetherill tells me you know some<lb/>thing of this matter." Brooks was not there. He said, "I was in Hoxton Street, when I heard a shouting in Kingsland Road. I went through Essex Street into Kingsland Road. Just before reaching there several young men ran away. I then saw Wetherill and Smithe struggling with Chapman." I asked him why he had not attended at the station. He said, "After I arrived there these men had run away and the man appeared to be going quietly. I did not think there was any necessity for me to come to the station. I went round the beat." Chapman appeared to have been roughly handled. I called in the police-surgeon, who dressed his injuries at 1.50 a.m. and Wetherill's at 2 a.m. Wetherill was on the sick list two days. Wetherill and I gave evidence before Mr. Byron, who dismissed the case there and then. Chapman made no complaint to me nor did he contradict the statements that were made. He said, "What, are you going to keep me? I did not know he was a policeman. I am satisfied and I think he ought to be." Chapman was charged with a common assault upon Wetherill. I saw Mrs. Chapman in the lobby outside the charge room. She said she had been pushed down and her husband had been assaulted. She was in a very excited condition. I thought she was under the influence of drink and I could not get a coherent story from her. If she received the treatment she alleges she received that would perhaps account for her condition. I was in charge at Old Street police station between 10 p.m. on December 1 and 2 a.m. on December 2. Police-constable Suckling, 159 G, was on duty in the charge room with instructions to attend telephone calls and Police-constable Bartle's duty was to stand in the lobby or inside the charge room until 4.30 a.m. I did not call the roll this night. The sergeant did so. It is his duty to report to me whether any men are absent. The single men are not allowed to be away from the station after midnight without permission. Bartle would attend to the cell fires; he is second reserve man. There is only one furnace. He would see to that once in two hours at the most. The doors of the police station are locked at midnight. If a constable wished to get into the station in a proper manner after that time he would have to pass through the charge room. If he entered in an improper manner he might climb the gates. Until Chapman was brought in we had only one prisoner. He was visited every half-hour. I understand from the sergeant that Brooks did not answer to his name that night. If the roll was called and he was not there he must have gone out before midnight.</p>

Before midnight the constables enter by the side door leading from the station to the private quarters. After that they have to come through the principal entrance. I locked the side door at midnight on Decem<lb/>ber 1, and hung the key in the inspector's office. I was on duty in the charge room or the hall between midnight and 6 a.m. During that time I did not see Brooks come in or go out. I attended the cell fire once every two hours.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On Sunday, December 1, I had my day's leave. I obtained extra leave from 12 to 1. At 3 p.m. I left Old Street Station with Smithe. We went to Richmond to visit a relative of his. We left there at 9 p.m., arrived at Mansion House about 10.15, walked to Liverpool Street, where we had a glass of bitter, the only drink since leaving Richmond. We took a bus to Dalston Junction, then walked towards Stamford Hill, and started to come back about 11.50. We got to Kingsland Road, near the corner of Essex Street, about 12.50. We did not see Brooks anywhere that evening. There was no third person with us. At the corner of Essex Street and Kingsland Road I saw a crowd of nine or ten men and two or three women. Smithe and I got out into the roadway to go round them. Smithe was two steps in front of me. I heard someone say, "There goes two f----g coppers." Chapman said, "If they are f----g coppers, let's do them down." I heard someone running behind me. I half turned my head and saw Chap<lb/>man. He struck me in the mouth with his fist and then on the fore<lb/>head. I fell to the ground insensible. I had done nothing at all. On recovering myself I found my ring and watch and chain had gone. When I came to my senses I was lying beside the hoarding. The crowd was still there. I saw Chapman standing on the kerb. I told him I was a police officer and should take him into custody. He struck me several blows about the chest and I had to strike him back in self defence. My forehead and lip were cut. Police-constable Walker came up. At that time a lot of young fellows ran away through Fal<lb/>kirk Street. Smithe and I took Chapman to the station. I did not see Chapman upon the ground. I did not push Mrs. Chapman to the ground. I saw several women, but could not recognise Mrs. Chapman as being one of them. I did not see her doing anything with an umbrella. I did not see Chapman pick his wife up. I did not see Smithe run away. When I got up from the ground he was struggling with six or seven fellows. When we arrived at the police station the inspector said, "What is this?" I said, "Drunk and disorderly and assault." I formed the opinion that Chapman was not sober. It was an unprovoked assault upon me. I have been assaulted in this neigh<lb/>bourhood about eight times by people who have been charged and convicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Having been assaulted before has not made me nervous of being assaulted again. The reason we went to Dalston after leaving Liverpool Street was that we had two hours to spare; we did not have to get in till 1 o'clock. I have not heard that Brooks was near Dalston that evening. I am quite sure it was Chapman who said, "If they are coppers, let us down them." None of the others responded to his invitation. I can suggest no reason why a perfectly respectable man having his wife and child with him should assault me. It is five minutes' walk from Essex Street to the station. I was insensible per<lb/>haps a couple of minutes. I was on the pavement when first Chapman assaulted me. Police-constable Walker arrived almost directly after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040062"/>
               <p>I had recovered consciousness. My first impulse was to arrest the man who knocked me down. I was able to cope with him by myself. When Police-constable Walker came up the others ran away and Smithe came to my assistance. As soon as Smithe came Chapman became very quiet. I cannot explain why Smithe and Walker did not pursue the others. I never saw Mrs. Chapman at all. I cannot explain how her umbrella got broken. I did not see any woman fighting during the disturbance. I was not unconscious during the whole time.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been a constable in the G Division since April, 1909. No allegation has been made against me before. On Sunday, December 1, I went down to Richmond to visit a relative. I agree with the evidence of Wetherill as to our movements from the time we got back till we got to Kingsland Road, and the events that happened. The public-house in Liverpool Street was the only one I went into that evening. No third person was with us. I did not see Brooks anywhere that evening. Until Chapman struck Wetherill and knocked him down neither Mr. Chapman nor Mrs. Chapman had been struck. I went to Wetherill's assistance, when the other six or seven people got hold of me round the arms and by the neck. I could not say if Police-constable Walker then appeared upon the scene. When I went to Wetherill's assistance I saw Walker coming towards us. By that time there was a crowd of about 30 people there. I was under the impression Chapman, was under the in<lb/>fluence of drink. He was not struck in the station. Since I have been in the district I have been assaulted about seven times. On each occasion my assailant has been prosecuted and convicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am quite sure Chapman said, "If they are coppers let us go for them." I have since heard that he is a respect<lb/>able man. I do not know whether Wetherill was insensible after he was knocked down. When I got up to him he was holding Chapman. There was no woman amongst those who assaulted me. There were two or three women there. I do not know how Mrs. Chapman's um<lb/>brella got broken. I did not see what was done with my hat. I did not say at the police court that I apprehended Chapman. Chapman was not so drunk that he did not know what he was doing. It was im<lb/>possible for me to have arrested any of the other disorderly people; I should not have got to the station with them.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I joined the Metropolitan Police in June, 1905. No sort of charge has been brought against me before this. I was not with Wetherill and Smithe that evening. I did not see them at all. After I came off duty about 6.15 on De<lb/>cember 1 I remained in the library at the City Road section house till 9.30. I walked along City Road and got on a tramcar at the tube station, and went to Dalston, arriving there after 10. I had one glass of beer in a public-house at the corner of Dalston Lane, and a second one in another public-house a little way up the road. I came out of there and waited till 11.5 or 11.10. I walked straight up the road to just this side of the Alexandra Theatre. I came back and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040063"/>
               <p>walked slowly towards Old Street Station, arriving there between 12.10 and 12.15. I went to the basement and fell asleep in the lavatory. I intended leaving the station at 12.45, as I had been given some information as to a criminal offence which was going to be committed in the early hours of December 2. I left the station about 12.50. At the junction of Hyde Road and Old Place I met two police constables. I afterwards saw Police-constable Kerridge, who told me I was too late; that the job had been done. I said to him, "If anyone says anything remember you have seen me." I went back to the coffee-stall in Whitmore Road, where I had some cups of coffee. I wanted to find a man named Woolf, whom I wanted for an offence. I went to another coffee-stall at Whitmore Bridge to inquire if he had been there. I got back to the station about 3 a.m. I did not go to bed then. I had my breakfast in the mess kitchen. I had to go out on duty again at 4 a.m. When Mrs. Chapman identified me she said she was not positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I went on duty from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. on Sunday, then went off duty till one. I might have had a half-hour's doze in a chair. I was on duty from one till 6.15. At 9.30 I went to Dalston to keep an appointment with a lady friend. When I got back to the station at 12.15 I had been about 19 1/2 hours without sleep, except for the half-hour. I had no intention of falling asleep in the lavatory. I got the information about the crime to be committed at about 3 p.m. on December 1. I cannot say I saw anyone when I went into the station at 12.15 a.m.; I might have done. I do not remember seeing Suckling. He might have been in the inspector's room. I heard him say he did not leave the charge room. Possibly his memory has failed him. I cannot say it is my duty to get leave after 12 o'clock to go on duty. I have never done it before in a case of the sort; it was a bit of extra duty. I went out through the charge room. There may have been somebody there, but I did not take notice of them. I allowed myself 40 minutes to go a mile. That is not my usual pace, but this particular spot is infested with thieves and I had no reason to go direct. I went the most indirect route. In the report I afterwards made I do not think I mentioned having seen Kerridge, I simply men<lb/>tioned two police-constables. I explained to Kerridge that this lad had given me previous information and I had not acted upon it and he knew it and this time he said, "Don't forget to do the job; I gave you a message before and you did not act upon it."</p>

                  </persName>, 528 G. About 1 a.m. on December 2 I was on duty in Hoxton Street. I heard someone shout<lb/>ing in Kingsland Road. I went down Essex Street and saw a crowd of people between Essex Street and Falkirk Street in Kingsland Road. I saw several young men run away. There were several women there. I saw Wetherill struggling with Chapman. Mrs. Chapman asked me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040064"/>
               <p>who the two men were, referring to Smithe and Wetherill. Smithe was not assisting Wetherill when I came up; he was standing there. He looked as if he had been struggling. I told Mrs. Chapman they were officers in plain clothes. They were taking Chapman into custody then. She did not complain about their conduct. Chapman was not struck in my presence. I did not go to the station at first: I went on my duty. I was afterwards sent for by the inspector.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The first thing I saw after I noticed the crowd was that several young men were running away. I could not say if any of them were like Smithe or Brooks. Mrs. Chapman did not say she wanted me to lock Wetherill up. She made no complaint. I did not ask her why she wanted to know who the two men were. She was a little excited. I said, "I am sorry, madam, they are two plain clothes officers." I did not say I could not interfere.</p>

I was there until after Inspector Newman came in. Chapman was requested to sit in a chair. I did not see anybody give him a back-hander in the right eye. I did not hear him say, "You coward," or anything.</p>

                  </hi>, St. Etienne, Department de Loire, France, ribbon manufacturer. In January, 1910, I had correspondence with Charles Sackman, and appointed him my agent in London. I re<lb/>ceived certain orders which were not executed because we had not the goods required. On August 23, 1911, I received circular headed "Charles Sackman and Co., Agents and Manufacturers, 146, Sandring<lb/>ham Road, Dalston. Offices and showrooms, 453, West Strand, Lon<lb/>don, E.C.," containing two orders, one from Burrage and Tewson, for which we manufactured the goods and forwarded them to Burrage and Tewson, Coleman Street, on November 6; the invoice for £38 being sent to Sackman, as was our usual practice. On November 20 I re<lb/>ceived another order, amounting to £55, from Burrage and Tewson, and forwarded goods and invoice as before. On December 8 I re<lb/>ceived order from Burns, Phillips and Co., 68 and 70, Fenchurch Street, £26, and from Whiteaway and Co., New Union Street, £5 5s. On January 9, 1912, I received order from White, Stevenson and Co., 31. Walbrook, £12. The goods were forwarded to those firms, in<lb/>voices being sent to Sackman and Co. I have received no money for any of them. In March, 1912, I came to London, went to 146, Sandringham Road, but only saw Sackman's wife; afterwards to 453 West Strand, where I saw Rose. He said he was a friend of Sackman, and he could not speak French. I had a friend with me who inter<lb/>preted. I made an appointment to see Sackman at the Manchester Hotel at 3 p.m.; neither of the prisoners came; I then returned to France.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. By letter of January 27, 1910, I agreed to pay Sackman 2 per cent. commission on all orders direct or indirect; "ex<lb/>penses for correspondence to be at our charge." Letters of October 14, 1911, says the goods are sent on "usual conditions, 2 1/2 per cent. if paid in 30 days"—that is the discount to the customer. Sample orders are sometimes given; one of £55 might or might not be a sample order.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant buyer to Burns, Phillips and Co., Limited, 68 and 70, Fenchurch Street. Looking at letter of Sackman to Roux of December 8, 1911, purporting to contain an order from our firm for 1,000 yards of ribbon, we gave no such order to Sackman and Co. On November 22 we received letter (produced) headed, "J. B. Roux, Manufacturer of Ribbons and Velvets, Works, St.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040066"/>
               <p>Etienne. 543, West Strand, London. We beg to thank you for allowing us to send six sets of our sample ribbons which we have on hand. Signed J. B. Roux—Charles Sackman." We replied, agreeing to send on the free samples to our branches. On Decem<lb/>ber 20 we received letter from "J. B. Roux, p.p. C. S."; shortly afterwards we received a case of ribbons, which had not been ordered. We then received letter of December 21, signed "J. B. Roux, p.p. W. Rose," asking us to deliver the case to the carman, to whom it was handed. On February 12, 1912, we received letter from J. B. Roux, of St. Etienne, asking payment for the goods. We wrote to the re<lb/>presentative of J. B. Roux at 453, West Strand, expressing surprise, and stating we had no goods of Roux's. On February 14 we received letter (produced) headed, "54, Lower Thames Street," altered to "4 53, West Strand," apologising for the application for payment by "our people in France respecting the sample bulk of velvet ribbons which were returned to us here as being of no interest to you." We never ordered any goods from Roux, and never paid for any.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We gave Sackman permission to send in six sets of free samples only. We have had one transaction with Sackman in which we bought samples of embroidery.</p>

On January 17 we received letter headed in the same way: "We regret to hear that the ribbons submitted are of no interest to you and as requested send bearer for same"; they were delivered to the bearer of that letter. My firm, in fact, had ordered no goods from Roux or Sackman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We had bought of Sackman three lines of samples at the sample discount 25 per cent., which were paid for. It is cus<lb/>tomary to buy samples in that way.</p>

The goods were delivered shortly afterwards. None of these goods have been paid for to my knowledge. On June 21 I went to 453, West Strand. After waiting eight hours I saw Sack<lb/>man. I asked him if Mr. Sackman was about. He said, "I am Mr. Sackman." I said, "You are not the Mr. Sackman I know, perhaps it is your brother." He then asked me what kind of a man I required to see. I described Rose to him as a man in a blue serge suit and a silk hat. He said, "Oh, yes, that is my brother, but he is away travelling just now." He asked me if I would like to leave my name; I said it was a matter of no importance and I would call again. A carman was sent; he brought back 1 1/2 dozen caps, five coney muffs, four coney cravats, five fur sailor hats, and half-dozen boy's drill hats of the goods we had supplied. They were all our goods except the tweed caps. They were original samples belonging to my firm. Letter of June 29 is in Rose's writing on Sackman and Co.'s paper saying that the goods would be returned. No goods came. On July 4 we received a bill from Sack<lb/>man and Co., "To brougham £3," and other charges amounting to five guineas and also claiming commission on orders of Nathan and Godfrey, Buyer, and Burrage and Tewson. (Witness identified a number of letters to J. B. Roux and others as being in Rose's hand<lb/>writing.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I understood Sackman and Co. were appointed agents. I identify the furs produced as the property of my firm. Rose, whom I knew only as Sackman, had told me he was in business with his brother.</p>

                  </hi>, of C. and H. Finegold, 92, Middlesex Street. On April 12, 1912, I appointed Rose, whom I knew as "Sackman." agent. I ordered a quantity of samples to be given to him, which he was to show to customers, obtain orders, and at the end of the season return the samples to my firm. I never authorised him to use letter paper with my firm's heading. Memo produced directed to "C. Sack<lb/>man and Co." has upon it, "All payments to be made direct to the firm." Rose was not authorised to collect money on our account. We received several orders from Rose and delivered goods to Burrage and Tewson, Gimbrell Brothers, Stephen Frazer and Co. With the exception of £11 10s. received from Burrage and Tewson, we have received no money for those goods nor have the goods been returned to us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoners have not received any commission on the orders obtained. Any commission due is credited to the agent in our books; at the end of three months he sends in his commission account and is paid.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Burrage and Tewson, Limited, Poland Street. I believe Rose is my uncle. My father is a director of Burrage and Tewson, who deal in soft goods. Sackman came there several times. The receipt (Exhibit 42) is signed by Sackman. The money we got for the goods would be put in the bank. We paid Sackman £33 10s. I do not know whose address 52, Lime Street, is. Exhibit 43 is another receipt for money paid to Sackman. I remem<lb/>ber in June, 1912, Finegold's carman bringing a quantity of furs. I signed for them. They were samples for a buyer to see. They came a day too late, so we wrote to Finegold's to take them back. Sack<lb/>man took them away. Exhibit 11 is a receipt in Sackman's writing. Exhibit 10 is Sackman's receipt for 50 dozen caps, which Finegold's delivered to Burrage and Tewson. There was something wrong with them. I did not know the name of the firm Sackman was engaged in. I had never seen Rose.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040069"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. I may have seen Rose when I was very young. Burrage and Tewson are job buyers, auctioneers, and shippers. They do a fairly big business. We have bought furs from other firms than Sackman. We always paid for the goods, and the money they sold for was put into the bank. We did not do business with Roux. Any<lb/>thing that came from him was ordered by us through Sackman. He showed us samples of ribbons, and we ordered them. We did not know where they came from. We wrote to Finegold's the letter of June 10, 1912, "We regret to say that the furs sent in on memo were a day too late," and so on. We also wrote on June 13, saying, "We have written you and written your agents." Sackman came and took the goods away. I knew Sackman was trading as Sackman and Co. Any business done with them has been straight and above aboard.</p>

Goods frequently came to that room. In their absence I signed for them. They carried on busi<lb/>ness in the name of Sackman and Co. There was no name on the door of the room. Once there was a piece of paper, with their name on, on the door for about a week. I signed the receipt on June 4, 1912, for 50 dozen caps, which came from Burrage and Tewson. I placed them in Sackman's office. I do not know how the other signature, "C. Sackman, Agent," came upon it. I should not get a signature afterwards. Soon after that some furs came with Finegold's name on the box. I could not say what became of them. A lot of things went out. Exhibit 17 is a receipt for boxes of caps received by me from Finegold's on May 15, 1912, which I put into Sackman's office. I I helped to carry them down again within two days at Sackman's re<lb/>quest. We put them on a truck. After prisoners left somebody came from Finegold's. I showed him the room. There were a large number of boxes, a few contained furs or muffs. Two or three contained caps, the rest were empty. Finegold's men took away those goods. I saw prisoners once or twice after that in the street.</p>

We took away five boxes of furs, etc., which we made up from 137 boxes. Neither of the defendants were there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We asked to see Mr. Sackman. Towell said, "He is not here; I should like to see him myself." I opened all the boxes myself; they were mostly empty. We went into another room. There was nothing belonging to us there. At Finegold's the five boxes were opened in the presence of Mr. Finegold, Mr. Diamond, and myself.

He said, "Harry Rose." I said, "I know you in the name of Sackman and I have a warrant for your arrest." I read the warrant. He said, "What! those goods—Finegold's</p>

               <p>had them returned to them; I am not Sackman and Co.; what about the others? I have a perfect answer to the charge, I have not swindled anybody and this is only a debt." I took him to the station and he was detained. On October 21 I saw Sackman at 28, Ferncliff Road. I said, "I am a police officer and I am going to arrest you for being concerned with Harry Rose with stealing 50 caps and furs to the value of £56 15s. 9d." He said, "All right; I never had any furs and I do not know where the caps went to." I said, "I must search your place." He said to his wife, "Go and fetch those three sets." His wife brought two sets of furs, which are in court. He then said," That is all I have had out of the deal. I took those to pay for the brougham hire; Rose had the others and the caps and sold them. Well, I must put up with it. I know I did wrong, but Rose had the benefit of the deal. You cannot blame me; I was the can." I showed him two receipts. (Exhibits 10 and 11.) He said, "That is my signa<lb/>ture. "In answer to the charge in regard to Finegold he made no reply. At the police court next day I read the charge in regard to M. Roux to both of them. Rose said, "I have got an answer to it." Sackman said, "So have I."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I became partner with Sackman four years ago under a verbal agreement. We began to trade at 146, Sandringham Road. We also had an office at 52, Lime Street, and about twelve months later removed from that office to 54, Lower Thames Street, E.C. Twelve months after that we removed that office to 453, West Strand. Letters from our Continental manufacturers were always addressed to Sandringham Road. We employed two or three travellers. We did a considerable amount of good business and paid by cheque and draft. The letter of January 27 was the basis of our contract with M. Roux. He afterwards agreed to increase our commission. He sent goods for distribution or sale. We often paid carriage on them. We disposed of job lots to several firms and ren<lb/>dered estimated accounts to Roux. Some goods we only submitted as samples. We rendered accounts to Roux for carriage, but did not receive the money. These would amount to between £5 and £10. He owes us about £100. We have written informing him of this; I also told him when he came to London. He admitted owing the commis<lb/>sion. With regard to the case of Nathan and Godfrey, I informed their buyer that we had a job line of ribbons over; he said he was open to look at them. We sent them as a fair sample. He looked at them. Roux sent them direct to Nathan and Godfrey. They were not approved of; Mr. Savory said they were too dear, would we take them back. We did so, and advised Roux and asked for instructions. We got no reply. The money for goods which Roux sent direct to Burrage and Tewson valued at £55 14s. 6d. was not paid to me. I know now that our firm received it. My partner dealt with all money matters. I was not aware that we had had it till he told me. That was after Burrage and Tewson wrote</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040071"/>
               <p>on February 12, when I asked him about it. I called upon Burns, Phillips and Co., and asked their buyer, Mr. Robinson, if he was open to buy job lines of ribbons. He said yes. I said I should be com<lb/>pelled to send him samples representative of the bulk. He said he quite understood that, and agreed I should send them. I instructed Roux, who sent them. At Mr. Robinson's request we took them back again. This system of submitting samples has been commended by the "Drapers' Record." I do not say the goods were ordered. Some firms would require a sample for each market—it might be six or 12 markets. Sackman wrote to Roux on January 3, 1912, "As you have not informed me in advance that I should sell these articles for ready cash I have sold under the usual conditions. In future, accord<lb/>ing to your desire, I will sell these clearing lines for cash without dis<lb/>count. "Regular goods, we should take orders for from sample; these were not regular goods, but job stuff, small sample pieces, and we must send a sample representative of the bulk. I remember Roux coming over in March. He came with an interpreter. He asked for Sack<lb/>man. I told him Sackman was out travelling. He said to the inter<lb/>preter, "This is a nice thing; I cannot see this man; I want my money. How am I going to get it if he is not here." Understanding what he said, I replied that the best thing to do was to see Sackman and myself. He said, "What about the goods you have got returned to you by the customers?" I said, "We have them; you can take them back with you to France if you like." He said he could not do that because he could not carry them. I said, "If you will tell me where you are staying Sackman and I will call upon you." He said he was leaving about 9 p.m. I went to Sackman's house and told him about M. Roux's calling. We went to the Manchester Hotel, where Roux said he was staying, and found that he had left. We got there about 10 or 10.15. There were no angry words when he called at the office. There were commission and expenses due to us. He said, "We will settle that afterwards. I shall have to come to London again, and you will come round with me and see some of the customers, and we will make a settlement of the whole thing, and, as to the goods which you have on hand, in the meantime, if you can dispose of them for me you can do so, remitting the money as you get it in." I said it would be difficult to sell it all to one firm; I should have to go to various customers, and that the export houses said that the stuff was not worth the money asked for it. As to Roux's contention that we had no right to collect moneys for him he made no complaint till a very late date after we had sent him several drafts. It was our practice to remit to our principals. I have received no cheques since he asked to have cheques sent direct. Mr. Savory, the buyer for Nathan and Godfrey, told me they had received a statement for goods ordered from me which had never arrived, also that Roux had sent someone to collect the account. There are copy-letters to show that we informed Roux of goods being returned from customers. With re<lb/>gard to Finegold's case, we called there at their invitation. They ad<lb/>vertised for a traveller with an export connection for hats and caps.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040072"/>
               <p>After taking some time to make up our mind to accept the agency, they agreed to make a range of samples. They said they were liberal people, and would not stand out about expenses. A question arose about our doing business with retail houses, they contended it would spoil their wholesale trade, and it became a question of invoicing the goods. Mr. Diamond said, "Why cannot you invoice the stuff your<lb/>self?" I also spoke about it to Mr. Charles Finegold and Mr. Hillier. Charles Finegold said, "You get the orders, we have no objection to supplying retail houses if they are big enough." About the Burrage and Tewson returns, I told Mr. Diamond of this. He said he was aware of it, that they had informed him, and wanted to know why they had done so. I said they were not sent in as promised, and arrived too late for their requirements, and asked if he would send to our office for them. He said that would be expense and trouble for them; could I place them elsewhere? I said it was a bad time of the year to sell furs, and he replied, "You might sell them at a little under invoice price." I said we would do our best. I asked him to come to the brougham and see his samples. He came out, saw the brougham, and wished me good-day. With regard to using Finegold's letter<lb/>heads we were calling on Gunball Brothers, Oxford Circus, nearly every other day. It was a fortnight before we could see the buyer. He then said, "We have had your samples, but we do not care to buy through the agents," because the commission has to be added to the price of the goods, and they wanted to buy at rock-bottom prices. I said I would see Finegold's. I saw Mr. Charles Finegold, told him what had happened, and asked him to write, saying they could buy direct from him. He said they had no time, why could not we write? I said, "They won't deal with us." He said, "I will give you some memorandums and you can deal with your own business entirely in your own way. As long as you do business for us we shall be per<lb/>fectly satisfied." He called his clerk, who gave me some memos and cards. I also told him there was an opportunity of selling felt hats to export houses, might I write in their name, asking if we could submit samples. He said, "Certainly."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner on oath) further examined. Receipt for £55 14s. 6d. is signed by Sackman. When I wrote later to Roux say<lb/>ing it would be collected I did not know it had been received; the same happened with regard to receipt for £33 10s. 6d. When I asked Sack<lb/>man he at once told me he had received the money. Sackman had the handling of the money. When this case started the solicitor, Mr. Margetts, acted for Finegold and Roux; it was a private prosecution. Several foreigners have approached me to settle the matter. I have always looked upon this as a civil case. All I wanted was to have my commission paid by Finegold and Roux, when I would have settled the accounts; we have written to both about the commission. I have been in Brixton prison for five months. The case has been delayed on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040073"/>
               <p>account of M. Roux not coming over. I have known goods to be ordered by Nathan and Godfrey, and a bill sent to them, but the goods not forwarded at all. I have acted in this case bona fide as an agent. I have done all I could to push the sale of goods for Roux and Fine<lb/>gold and have spent a lot of money in doing so. I have never tried to hide my address; both Roux and Finegold knew it; I have had two or three visits at Grove Road from Finegold's assistants—they said they came from Finegold; I have written from Grove Road to Roux. Our business was partly carried on from 246, Sandringham Road or Grove Road; in fact, the address at 453, Strand, was merely an office and for showing samples to customers; were were not compelled to keep an office. We did not abscond from any office. At 453, Strand, we had the back room lent to us for keeping furs and other goods in. At the police court the caretaker said he gave twelve boxes of furs out. With regard to the second fifty dozen caps, they were supplied without hooks and eyes; rather than have them returned we offered them to Burrage and Tewson at 1s. a dozen reduction. I telephoned to Charles Fine<lb/>gold about it, and he authorised me to sell them. I have done a great deal of business with various people, of whom I produce a list. (Same handed to the jury.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. One of the addresses at which Sackman and Co. carried on business was 146, Sandringham Road; it was the private house of my father; there was no name up of Sackman and Co.; there was no necessity for that, as it was an agency business. We moved to 453, Strand, on October 25, 1911. Our name was written on a piece of paper on the window. There was the name up of Henry Haggards and Co., a firm in Belgium selling tinned meats, etc., whom we repre<lb/>sented in London. I had authority to sign their name "per pro." We sent Haggards various sample orders during about three months; they consigned goods to us; we had a letter authorising us to act as principals for them—it was a verbal arrangement. At that time we were carrying on business at Sackman's address, 28, Ferncliff Road, and my father's, 146, Sandringham Road; there was no name up of Sackman and Co. 192, Grove Road was described in the correspond<lb/>ence as a factory. It was for making shoes for George Pernaud, Brussels; he also dealt in ladies' underclothing. I had paper printed with his permission, headed "George Pernaud, Brussels. Warehouse and London factory, 192, Grove Road." That was for the purpose of doing business; representing ourselves as manufacturers people would think they could buy cheaply of us. Pernaud gave us authority to have paper printed in his name; so also did Finegold and Roux. We had no clerks or travellers in our employ, no banking account; I kept the books. The ledger produced is one. There were a lot of books and other papers taken at the time of my arrest which are not produced. I wrote all letters from 453, West Strand; 146, Sandringham Road; and 192, Grove Road. All the French letters are in my writing. On August 12, 1909, I took an office in Lime Street in the name of Hiram Rose; I gave Charles Sackman as reference; he afterwards joined me in partnership. I had a banking account at the London and Pro<lb/>vincial</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040074"/>
               <p>Bank, Commercial Street, about four years ago, when my office was, I think, at Devonshire Square. I then moved to 54, Bishopsgate, stayed two months, and had to leave because I could not pay the rent—I gave the office up. Sackman then took 2, Devonshire Square with a man named Gray; he was our accountant. We paid 10s. a week rent. We might have gone there in February, 1910—I have no knowledge of whether we left there owing £4 rent; Sackman always paid the rent; I do not remember at all when we left. At the same time we started an office at 52, Lime Street. I do not know whether we went there in March, 1911, or how long we stayed. I cannot remember what became of our banking account or when it was closed. There may have been cheques overdrawn; I do not remember. There were some cheques dishonoured. I could not say whether there were one hundred dishonoured. We could not get our money out of our principals and so could not pay. We were sold up under a County Court judgment at 52, Lime Street. At that place we were doing a large genuine business. Judgment (produced) of April, 1911, is for a debt of £10 1s. 9d., which has not been settled. It is addressed to Charles Sackman and Co., 54, Lower Thames Street. We went there after leaving Lime Street. We may have left Lower Thames Street in September, 1911, owing £5 8s. rent. They gave us permission to leave. Some money was paid, because we owed more than £5. With regard to goods delivered by Roux, we either received the money or had the goods back, and re-sold them. Some goods we have in our possession; they were in a warehouse; I cannot say where the warehouse is; it may be they have been sold. Goods sold to Harvey and Green-acre were returned to us, value £17 1s. 2d.—possibly they may have been re-sold; if so they have been remitted for. I enclosed bill pro<lb/>duced for £17 1s. 2d. on January 26 to Roux. It is accepted "payable at 453, West Strand, by H. Haggards and Co." That is signed by Sackman; the body of the bill is my writing. It has been dishonoured—that was simply because we wanted a settlement of our commission account. I do not remember, but we may have had the goods back, sold them, and paid for them. On February 1 I wrote to Roux, "I have pleasure in handing you cover for your invoice of Stuttaford and Co., £22 3s. 8d." That enclosed a bill by Sackman and Co. accepted payable at 453, West Strand, in Sackman's writing. The bill was dis<lb/>honoured. (A number of dishonoured bills were put to the witness.) A large number of letters containing orders, deliveries and returns of goods to Sackman and Co., payment for which had not been remitted, were gone through with the witness.</p>

                  </hi>, employed by Harrisons and Crosfield, Limited, 1 to 4, Great Tower Street. There are employed by this firm about 200 persons. I was in the transfer department. The firm acts as secretary for several companies, amongst others being the Rubber Plantations Investment Trust, Limited, and the London and Asiatic Rubber and Produce Company, Limited. Prisoner was employed in the transfer department for about three years. We keep the share re<lb/>gisters dealing with the transfer of shares. I am familiar with pri<lb/>soner's handwriting. In addition to prisoner there was a clerk named Howell employed in similar duties. We have in the Asiatic Com<lb/>pany a shareholder named D. E. Clark, of Hong Kong. There was a dividend payable to him last October; in that company the dividends are generally paid twice a year. The voyage to Hong Kong occupies about three weeks. Howell and the prisoner had the duty of prepar<lb/>ing, issuing and despatching the dividend warrants in that company last October. In the posting of dividend warrants it is necessary to initial the postage book. On October 12 there is an entry to the effect that Howell and the prisoner were witnesses of the posting of the whole of the warrants of the Asiatic on that date, and their names are there in full. The dividend warrant (produced) is for £7 1s. 3d., and payable to D. E. Clark. I cannot say in whose handwriting the body of the warrant is. The warrant is crossed. About 9.5 a.m. on January 9 a letter came to the office from D. E. Clark. I should not like to say the prisoner saw it, but he knew of its existence at 11 o'clock the same morning, because it was passed out into the general office and prisoner would be in the next desk to Howell. I know the matter was discussed. In consequence of the receipt of that letter I made certain inquiries. When dividend warrants are returned through the bank they are compared with the original list, marked off as being paid, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040077"/>
               <p>filed away in numerical order in the filing department. I looked for and found the original warrant (produced), and it appeared to have been paid through Farrow's Bank on October 25. It was quite im<lb/>possible for it to have gone to Hong Kong and back in that time. Other inquiries were made, and on the following day I was shown certain correspondence at Farrow's Bank. I was shown three letters (produced) purporting to have been written by G. E. Williams. I believe them to be in the prisoner's handwriting. They are written in a "somewhat backward" handwriting, and are headed "14, Brixton Road." I was also shown two other letters (produced), one purporting to be signed "Steel," 1-3, Draper Street, and the other "F. Howers," 1, Cullum Street. I believe them to be in prisoner's hand<lb/>writing. I went to 14, Brixton Road, which I found to be a news<lb/>agent's shop kept by Renvoize. I had a photograph with me. I came back to the office and reported to the directors. Prisoner was seen in the presence of the directors, the secretary of the company, and myself, and asked to give an explanation. He said he knew nothing about it. The Chairman said the matter would be put in the hands of the police, and prisoner was suspended for the time being. After<lb/>wards I went with Detective Wagstaff to 4, Kennington Road, a news<lb/>agent's and hairdresser's shop. There I saw some letters addressed to G. E. Williams from Farrow's Bank. Then we went to 18b, Rye Lane, and saw prisoner. I told him I should have to give him into custody with regard to the misappropriation of a dividend warrant for £7 1s. 3d. in the name of D. E. Clark. He denied that he had any<lb/>thing to do with it at all. Then we (including prisoner) went to 14, Brixton Road, and Wagstaff asked Renvoize whether he recog<lb/>nised prisoner in any way, and he said he was the man who had called for letters in the name of G. E. Williams. Just before we left the shop I said to Renvoize: "You know this may be the most serious charge in the world, and I want to be sure there is no shadow of doubt in your mind about it." Renvoize said he was absolutely certain. He turned to prisoner and said, "You know, quite recently, less than five months ago, you grew a moustache, and you have recently shaved it off." Prisoner said, "It is quite right; I did. But you have certainly made a mistake." At Farrow's Bank I found that the account was opened on July 20 last. G. E. Williams, of Ceylon, has some shares in the Trust Company, and I found that his address had been altered in the share register to 14, Brixton Road; that was in prisoner's handwriting. A dividend warrant had been posted to Mr. Williams in July, 1911, and had been returned marked "left Ceylon." The result was that in July of last year we had three dividend warrants in the office payable to him, £1 15s. 4d., £1 3s. 7d., and £1 3s. 7d. We sent them to 14, Brixton Road, and they have been paid through Farrow's Bank. When a clerk goes to lunch he signs a slip, and the slips (produced) have been signed "Howes." In this book (produced) there are entries relating to Thomas Edward Williams, Mrs. Maud Williams, and John Richard Williams. It is in prisoner's handwriting. The handwriting of the body of the reference letter to bank signed "F.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040078"/>
               <p>Howers" is exactly similar; and the signature agrees very well with the writing on the luncheon slips. I have here a paying-in slip to Farrow's Bank for £2, dated July 20; it is in prisoner's handwriting. I produce the diary of work kept wholly by prisoner. The hand<lb/>writing at the dates July 15, 16, and 17 is similar to that on the pay<lb/>ing-in slip and the luncheon slips. I also find two other styles of writing on the same page. The Steel letter from 13, Draper Street is in a disguised handwriting which leans backwards a little, but I am of the opinion that it is that of prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. You strenuously asserted your inno<lb/>cence all through and agreed at once to go to 14, Brixton Road, to be confronted by Renvoize. When he identified you I feel pretty sure he mentioned the name "G. E. Williams" first. I did not say, "Why, he even remembers you having a moustache on and having it off again." It is quite possible that you said you grew it when you went for your holidays on August 9. The warrant payable to D. E. Clark is endorsed in the usual place and, I suggest, in your handwriting; it is disguised and has the appearance of having been written in pencil first. It would be quite well known to you that, as soon as sufficient time had elapsed for the warrant to get to Hong Kong and for a letter to come back, discovery would be inevitable. I understand that the addresses on the envelopes in which the dividend warrants had been despatched had been in the habit of being checked, and about the time of the Asiatic dividend I gave instructions that the practice should be discontinued as the stencils had been checked and it would be a waste of time. They were dealt with by responsible men who had boys under them, and it is a fact that you have complained of the inefficiency of the juniors. It is a fact that one of the juniors you complained of is still in the office. It is true that the staff has been considerably reduced, but not that they have been working at high pressure. The overtime last year came of £13, as against about £150 in other years, but the work has been better organised because we have better accommodation.</p>

Williams, and he called for letters over a period of about six months. A few weeks after he first called he grew a moustache, which he afterwards shaved off. Before I identified him at my shop on January 10 I had been shown a photographic group, and I picked out the prisoner as the man who called for letters.</p>

                  </hi>, deputy manager at Farrow's Bank, 1, Cheap<lb/>side, E.C. On or about July 19, 1912, we received this letter from 14, Brixton Road: "I beg to enclose three dividend warrants from the Rubber Plantations Investment Trust, and, as the same are crossed, I would thank you to clear the same for me and remit the proceeds, less your charges, by postal order. The two old warrants have been verified for payment. Yours faithfully, G. E. Williams." Next day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040079"/>
               <p>we replied that as the warrants were crossed "a/c payee only" we had opened an account in his name and asked him to fill up an appli<lb/>cation form and send a specimen of his signature. These were duly returned to us filled up, together with a letter in which he asked for a cheque-book, and gave as references William Steel and Francis Howers. We wrote to those references and I produce the replies we received. An account was opened and credited with the three divi<lb/>dend warrants amounting to £4 2s. 6d. On October 24 a dividend warrant for £7 1s. 3d., signed "D. E. Clark," was paid into the account. There were other payments into the account and I produce the paying-in slips. Between 11 and 12 o'clock on January 9 we re<lb/>ceived a communication, dated January 8, 1913, changing the address to 4, Kennington Road.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I am inclined to think that the letter signed "F. Howers" is written by the same person who wrote the application form, but I am very doubtful about the other reference letter. The fact that a man wrote to us and asked us to cash a warrant crossed "a/c payee only" would indicate that he did not know what he was about.</p>

                  </hi>, of Harrisons and Crosfield. In October last I was engaged in preparing the dividend warrants for the Asiatic Company, and they were posted on October 14. It was a dividend that we pre<lb/>pared in a hurry. With some juniors I took charge of part of the work and with other juniors prisoner took charge of another part of the work of checking the warrants and putting them up for post. When the warrants had been enclosed in the envelopes and the envelopes had been stuck down and stamped they were counted into hundreds. That took till about 11 o'clock at night, and, as the post offices are closed at eight o'clock, we were compelled to post in pillar boxes. In order to avoid over filling one pillar box we divided the envelopes into more or less two equal portions; prisoner, with one or two juniors, took one lot to a pillar box in Beer Lane and I took the other to a pillar box in Rood Lane. I cannot say who posted the D. E. Clark warrant. I have had nothing to do with the Trust dividend for some time, but I see by the postage book that the entire entry is in prisoner's writing. I was not aware that the G. E. Williams' warrants were retained in the office. I have seen prisoner write a more or less upright, back<lb/>handed, writing, which he told me he did in order to rest his hand.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. In regard to the enclosing of the warrants in the enve<lb/>lopes, it would not necessarily mean that the person who enclosed the warrant had anything to do with sticking down the envelope and sort<lb/>ing it afterwards. There was nothing to indicate where the D. E. Clark warrant was excepting that it would be amongst the "Eastern" ones. If it was abstracted before it reached the pillar box there would be nothing to show which particular person abstracted it. It would be risky to abstract it in the counting. I can suggest no reason why</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040080"/>
               <p>that dividend warrant should be selected, except the fact that it was an Eastern warrant and no information in regard to it could come for at least six weeks. There were other Eastern warrants and some for larger sums.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. On Janu<lb/>ary 10 I went to 18b, Rye Lane, along with Mr. Boyes and Detective Collins. Mr. Boyes said to prisoner, "These gentlemen are police officers. I have made inquiries and ascertained that certain dividend warrants, which it was your duty to post to certain shareholders, have been paid into an account at Farrow's Bank, Cheapside, which you have opened in the name of Williams. Your photograph has also been identified by the proprietor of a newsagent's shop at 14, Brixton Road, as that of a man who has been calling there for some months past and receiving letters in the name of Williams." Prisoner replied, "I have never been to 14, Brixton Road; I have no account at Farrow's Bank; there is some mistake." I took him into custody. We all went to 14, Brixton Road, to see Renvoize. I asked Renvoize, "Do you know this man?" He replied, "Yes, this is the man whom I knew as Williams, who has been receiving letters here for some months past." Mr. Boyes asked, "Are you quite sure of this man being Williams?" "Oh, yes,"" he said, "I am quite sure; I know him quite well. Some four or five months ago he grew a moustache and he shaved it off again about a couple or three months ago." There was some further conver<lb/>sation, in the course of which prisoner agreed that he wore a moustache about that time; he said he grew it because he was having his teeth attended to.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of January 26 I was passing up Red Lion Street with my nephew Cox, when Bowden came across the road and said, "Shake hands" and he attempted to snatch my watch and chain. I tried to stop him and he struck me a violent blow on the face. We went to the ground and a lot of his friends started kicking me. I shouted, "Murder!" I tried to defend myself and they kicked me right and left. I happened to get away and when I got up my watch was hanging down. I ran across the road and they followed me. There were about 20 hitting me left and right. I got into Lamb's Con<lb/>duit Street and a policeman came up. I recognised the two prisoners; I have been knocking about that neighbourhood for years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Woods was kicking me when I was on the ground. I did not see him, but other witnesses did.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in company with my uncle on January 26. Bowden went up to him and said, "Hello," and went to shake hands with the right hand and snatch his chain with the left hand. My uncle pushed him away and Bowden struck him in the face. My uncle fell down and people kicked him. Woods struck me in the face because I was trying to keep him away from my uncle. I could not be sure who else kicked my uncle, but Woods kicked him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Bowden did not shake hands over any argument that happened at nine o'clock. We never saw him till a quarter past eleven.</p>

He promised me a few shillings when he got there. He paid my fare to Liverpool Street on a bus and train fare to Stratford. When near the bank he asked me if I minded going in with it and he would wait outside for me. I went in and this is the result. When I came out of the bank I intended to tell the gentleman I had got to wait. I was called back and went back into the bank. I saw the man in the distance and the bank manager went to look for him; he came back and said, 'I cannot see him.'"</p>

                  </hi>, clerk to Turner and Company, solicitors, 89, Chan<lb/>cery Lane. My firm acted for Mr. Crawford. My duty was to collect the rents of the Maplin Road houses, of which he was the lessee. On two or three occasions Stone said to me that the thieves of the district had been stealing property from some of the houses which were un<lb/>finished, and that we ought to have a caretaker. He suggested he should take over the care of these houses and that in consideration of his doing so he should have a reduction in his rent. He paid 8s. 6d. rent at that time; since then he has not paid anything. He was to have paid 5s.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040087"/>
               <p>The loose stuff and building material were stored in the yard of the house where he was living to prevent it being stolen. That was done by my authority. After the first police court proceedings I had an interview with him at his house 100, Maplin Road. I went to see him about his rent. He asked me to leave the question of the rent over until this charge had been disposed of. He then said, "I admit that I made a mistake in selling this stuff." I said, "Of course you had no authority to do so." He said, "Yes." He said he had left some stuff with Bicheno, who had paid him 4s., of which he had paid Carter, who assisted him in moving the stuff, 2s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Mr. Alston was the builder for Mr. Crawford. He collected the rents on behalf of Mr. Crawford before Mr. Crawford instructed us. He owned the materials. On January 30 I requested Stone to have the things ready for my inspection. I did not know they had been removed on the 13th. It would not have been reason<lb/>able for him to have lodged the materials with somebody else without notifying me, which he could have done by telephone. I authorised him to do up a room in one of the houses, which he did. I have not paid him for it; there is his rent going on. I am setting off the rent he owes us. I understand Mr. Alston made use of part of Stone's pre<lb/>mises, for which consideration he charged him no rent. Stone did not say he had lodged the things with Bicheno and that Bicheno had lent him 4s., he said, "Paid him 4s." I took it they were sold. In my opinion it was the same thing.</p>

Early in January, when I was fitting up my shop Stone asked me if I would care to go and inspect a wooden door at his house. After inspecting it I paid him 3s. for it. I also bought some match-lining and paper. He did not say who he was and I did not ask him. I paid him 3 1/2d. a piece for the wall paper. There were 22 or 23 pieces. I paid him about 7s. for about 200 feet of match-lining. I think I paid fair prices. On January 22 the police came and asked me to give up the property.</p>

I cannot identify the match-lining because it is now in Mr. Roche's shop. I have seen it and the door. They belonged to us. I identify this wall paper as ours. Early in December I was doing some work in Garvary Road. Mr. Crawford was in partnership with me in that venture. I brought a number of fixtures and fittings to houses there. In company with Police-constable Haldy I went to Bicheno's premises in January. I saw five pans and four traps in a shed there. I identified them as our property. They were made specially.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not occupy rooms in Stone's house; I simply visited there. I had Stone's son working for me from about March. When I went away I owed him a few shillings. I said at the police court 50s. would cover the lot. If Mr. Crawford balances up accounts,</p>

               <p>he owes me a little money. I agreed that Stone should pay me 4s. 6d. a week rent. He fell out of work during the dock strike and I did not trouble him for the rent. I used to go there now and again. I had a dinner or two with them. I thought they would take no notice of that. I did not say at the police court, "I owe Mrs. Stone money now." I said I owed money to the son. I was in a bit of a muddle with my affairs, people were asking for money and I was trying to find Crawford and could not. I believe he was a solicitor. I have been to his office and private residence. He was not in. The last time I was at Garvary Road was early in December. There was no necessity for me to go there again, as the mortgagees took it over. There were several people looking after the property that was used for refitting the houses; there is no necessity for divulging their names.</p>

                  </hi>, 148, Butcher's Row, West Ham. I am a fruiterer and greengrocer. About January 15 Stone asked me if I had a barrow to lend him. I lent him my barrow. He paid me nothing for the loan of it. I usually charge 1s. before people take the barrow. I saw my barrow again that evening when I went for it. There were old bricks in it, which I saw taken from a heap in Maplin Road. I said to Stone, "Are these bricks all right?" He said, "Yes, you can have them; I am responsible for everything that is here." There were about 50 half bricks and whole bricks. I should think their value would be about 2s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The hire of the barrow would have been 2d. I did not give anything for the bricks. I asked Stone if he had any old brick; he said "Yes." This might have been January 13, 14, or 15.</p>

                  </persName>. About 7.30 on January 22 I went with Detective Payne to 59, Devonshire Road, Custom House, where Bicheno carries on business. He deals in everything. He is not a marine store dealer. I knocked at the door. I said to Bicheno, "We are police officers and have come to see you about two kegs of paint you bought on the 15th." He said, "Don't you believe it; I do not know anything about it." I said, "I will have a look." I then went into the house. He opened the front-room door. I went in after him and found two kegs of paint behind the sitting-room door. I said, "How do you account for these?" He said, "I am only minding them for a man." I said, "Can you tell me who the man is?" He said, "I do not know his name, but he lives in Martindale Road." I then said, "Have you anything else here that does not belong to you?" He then said, "Absolutely nothing." I told him I would have a look. I went into the yard. In a lock-up shed I found eight w.c. pans and four traps covered with sacks. I said to Bicheno, "How do you account for these?" He said, "I forgot to tell you, but I am minding these for the same man." I then told him I should take him into custody for receiving property. He said, "I cannot help it, you will have to do your duty." When charged he made no reply. The traps produced to-day in court are the traps I found. I saw Stone the same evening and told him I should arrest</p>

               <p>him for stealing the property from the empty houses. He said, "The foreman told me to do as I liked with them; I will tell you where the bulk of the property is; I sold the door and timber to Mr. Roche and the w.c. pans and traps I sold to Bicheno for 4s." When charged he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I served 18 years in the Army. I first went to live in Maplin Road at No. 90. Mr. Alton came to do some repairs there. I did some work for him at the Gar<lb/>vary Road houses. He gave me 10s. at the end of the week. I earned 23s. My son also worked for him. He owed my son a little over 50s. before he went away. He also used to come and have his dinner and tea in the daytime. He owes my wife 12s. or 14s. for that. Up to December 10 he appeared to be in charge of the whole of the material, using it and collecting rents. From December 10 to Janu<lb/>ary 13 I did not know where he was. I sold some things to Mr. Roche for 14s. For close on a fortnight I was out of work and thought I might as well get some money on account of the claim. I and my family had against Alston. I told Mr. Bicheno I was going to shift some material from Garvary Road. He said, "There is the shed, you can put anything you like in there." I received 4s. from him. I told him I wanted a few shillings to go on with. I did not sell him the property. He told me I could always have them back when I wanted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I could not tell you the date when I had the 4s. loan. I knew Mr. Dames had come to manage the property for Mr. Crawford after Mr. Alston left. Alston told me Crawford owed him money before that. I knew I had no right to sell the things to Mr. Roche. I sold them because I was hard up. I did not see the serious<lb/>ness of it at the time.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been a general dealer for 30 years. I am one of the biggest men for 40 miles round. I have been 21 years at 57, Devonshire Road. I had no suspicion there was anything wrong with the goods when Stone brought them. I do not know where he put them. Everybody takes advantage of my field. They push them through as they like, road-sweepers or anybody. I did not pay for the goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I could not tell you if it was on January 15 the things were brought to my premises. I did not tell the officers about the kegs of paint because I had been on a big job at the docks and was confused at the time, coming from hard work. I have £1,000 worth of stuff on the ground and do not know what is on the ground. I put the kegs of paint in the parlour to look after them. People must not go in the shed where men and women are working. There was about £30 worth of paint in the shed. There would have been room in the shed for the two kegs of paint if I had been mug enough to put them there and anybody come and pick them up. I put them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040090"/>
               <p>where I thought I was looking after the poor man's interest. I told the police officer I was asked to mind them for him. He asked who the man was. I said I did not know his name. I did not know his name was Stone till afterwards. I told him he lived in Martindale Road in mistake. I suppose the police asked me if I had anything else that did not belong to me. If I told them "absolutely nothing" I must have been confused.</p>

                  </hi>, tailoress. I know the Scandia Club, Fitzroy Street. I know prisoner, also a man named Harold Wood; they are both chauf<lb/>feurs. On December 7 I met them at the club; also George Berger and two girls. We had drinks; prisoner was slightly intoxicated. About 8.30 the six of us left the club for a ride in a grey motor-car; prisoner was driving. Just as we got over Hammersmith Bridge the car ran over a woman and knocked her down; I saw it happen. I said to Wood, "Oh, Harold, stop the car; Jack has run over a woman." Wood called out to prisoner, "You silly b----, where are you driving to?" Prisoner tried to put the brakes on and the car seemed to skid, and I think it went over the woman again. The car was lighted; I cannot say how many lights; immediately after the accident the lights went out. The car went on at an increased speed and did not stop for about three miles. We got back to the club about 2 a.m. About 4 the party broke up and prisoner said he was going to take the car home to the garage. Talking about the accident prisoner said, "Keep your mouth still in case it might be serious."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am quite clear as to what happened on this night. I first made a statement to the police on December 31. In my statement I said there was only one other woman with us; I afterwards remembered that there were two. (Other discrepancies were put to the witness.) Besides speaking to Wood I called out to Wood, "Oh, Jack, stop the car," and he said, "Keep your mouth still." (At the police court, according to the deposition, witness said, "I did not call out to prisoner at all.") We went on after the accident for three miles without the lamps being re-lit.</p>

He said, "Yes, they are my own." I said, "Suppose they ask me who they belong to?" He said, "Say they belong to you." He also said, "Give a strange address," and he told me the address men<lb/>tioned by the pawnbroker. The pawnbroker asked me if they were mine and I said, "Yes." He said, "Get the receipt and I will let you have a pound on them." I came outside and crossed the road and said to this man who was waiting for me, "He wants a receipt for the chess." He said, "I live at Barnes and have to get back; ask the pawnbroker for the chess back and I will take them somewhere else." I went back to the shop and he said he would detain them. I do not know anything about this burglary and can prove I did not go beyond Sefton treet on that night."</p>

                  </persName>, Richmond. I went to Greenwich on January 23 and saw prisoner detained there. He had been before the magistrate on the charge of unlawful possession of certain tools. A communication was made to the magistrate and the man was dis<lb/>charged. Then I saw him outside and said he would be taken to Rich<lb/>mond</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191302040095"/>
               <p>and charged with taking the tools from a workshop on the night of January 20. He replied, "I did not steal them; that is a physical impossibility; I do not know where the place is. A man gave them to me to pledge; I have known him for years. Of course, I knew the tools were stolen, but I never stole them. I hope you will be able to find the man who did steal them." I conveyed him to Richmond and, whilst awaiting the arrival of the owners of the tools, prisoner said he wished to make a statement. I took this down and he signed it: "About 11.30 a.m. on January 21 I was at Broadway, Hammersmith, when I met a man whom I have known for some years; I have known him by the name of James West. He is a painter by trade. He says, 'Hullo, chum; how are you going on?' I said, 'All right.' He invited me into the 'Hop Holes' public-house, and we had a drink together. He was carrying a tool basket containing some tools. I said, 'Where did you get them from?' meaning the tools. He said, 'I got them from a workshop at Richmond; some of them have got names on, so it will not be safe to run them in; we will go further afield.' When I saw him with the tools I knew they must have been stolen. We then entered a train at Hammersmith and rode to Black-friars and walked over the bridge and went by tram to Deptford High Street. We had some food and slept together that night. I gave the name of Burn and he gave the name of West. He paid the fares and for the food and for the night's lodging. After breakfast we left about 9 a.m. for Lewisham. There he picked out a shop and said, 'That is all right there.' He then left me to go to a urinal. I went to a pawnshop and offered a saw in pledge. The pawnbroker asked me what name I gave. I gave a name which did not agree with that on the saw. He said, 'I will keep it.' I said, 'I will go outside and see what my friend says.' He afterwards came out and called a police<lb/>man. I did not do the robbery, but I knew the goods were stolen."</p>
