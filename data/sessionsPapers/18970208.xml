I am a clerk in the Secretary's Office, General Post Office—I was investigating the loss of this letter from Melksham, containing the cheque for £17 10s.—on January 8th I saw the prisoner at Warmington's, where he was working—I said, "I am investigating the loss of a letter posted at Melksham on December 30th, addressed to Mrs. Burnard, of 134, Ivydale Road, Nunbead, containing a cheque for £17 10s."—I showed him the cheque, and said, "You negotiated it with Mr. Chopping, a furniture dealer, on December 31st; do you wish to tell me where you got it from?"—I cautioned him—he said, "I got it from a woman; I don't know where she got it from; I lived at 34, Ivydale Road, up to Boxing-da?"—I took him to the General Post Office—I there said, "Do you wish to give any further explanation?"—he then made this statement, which I took down in writing; the prisoner signed it: "I met the woman coming down in the train from New Cross to Shoreditch on December 31st, she commenced talking to me; she said she was a married woman, but she had had a row with her husband, and was not on good terms with him. She asked me where I was going; I said I was going to Shoreditch. She told me she had some trust money, and she wanted a gentleman to change it for her; she said it must be a gentleman, and asked me if I should have any time to do it for her, and she would give me something for my trouble. She asked me where she should see me, and I said, 'After I have done work.' She said she would go with me. We went together up the Hackney Road on a tram. She said, 'There is a house, 224, Cambridge Road, here, that has got two rooms to let; you might go and see what the rent is.' I went in, and made inquiries, and came out and told her. She then said, 'We will go down the road,' and took me; she asked me if I would go and buy a carpet and hearthrug and a chest of drawers. She then gave me the cheque, and said, 'If they ain't got any change they can send it on with the stuff.' I then went into the shop and bought the things, and when I came out she was waiting for me. When I told her I had got no change she said, 'Perhaps they'll send it to-morrow; I can't give you anything now, but I will see you to morrow.' I met her on Friday, at Bethnal Green Road, in the evening. We then went on the tram to the rooms, 224, Cambridge Road, to see if the things had come; but they had not. She said, 'We'll go to the furniture place again.' We went, and she told me to ask how it was they had not sent them. They said they would send them the next day. She said, 'Come and have something to drink,' and we went, and had a glass of beer. On Saturday she met me at three o'clock. We went up to the same place again. They had sent the furni<lb/>ture, but not the change, and she said, 'Go and ask them for it.' She then told me that she should not go and live in the rooms, as she had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189702080006"/>
               <p>some better ones. I went and got the change, and she said, 'Come on down here; we will go and have a drink.' I then gave her the change, and she gave me 30s. After that she said, 'If you like to fetch the furni<lb/>niture, you can have it; I do not want it'; and I have never seen her since. I do not know where she lives; she told me her name was Burnard. She said, 'Tell them your name is Burnard. Don't give the particulars where you live, or anything?"—after that I called his attention to the endorsement—he said, "It is not my writin?"—I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Towers, at Pinner—my wife and I have a business in Mortimer Street—a woman named Bridget Gilhooly was in our service as cook for some time—the prisoner was also in our service, as a porter and odd man in the business in 1885—recently he has been, I believe, manager of a public-house in Farringdon Street—I have not seen him there—in our house at Pinner we had a quantity of linen and other articles—on January 11th Bridget Gilhooly went for a holiday—she did not come back that night—next day, in con<lb/>sequence of inquiries, I sent for the police, and they were at the house when Gilhooly returned—after some time her boxes were searched, and in them were found some fifty articles, which I recognised, which should not have been in her possession, linen, and other things—I gave her into custody, and she was taken away by the police—in her box was found a letter—on January 13th I went to the Sportsman public-house in Great Saffron Hill, where the prisoner was employed—I had sworn an information for a search warrant—a police inspector and two officers went with me and my wife, and the house was searched, and three table-covers, six linen tablecloths, two pillow slips, and two pairs of cuffs, these were found in various parts of the premises—I identified them as my property—they were of the value of £5—some of the articles had my mark on them—these two pillows were on the bed, which I presume was the bed slept in by the prisoner—the mark on them has been cut out—this pillow slip has also had the name</p>

               <p>cut out—I recognise these two table-covers—one of them is quite new—it is a special size, and had been specially ordered—the mark on the tape has been removed—after waiting some time the prisoner came home—after the search I remained with the officer—when the prisoner came in he asked Mrs. Marshall, "Have you lost any thing?"—she said, "Yes, a great many, Patrick?"—the officer asked him to open a cupboard which was in the corner of the room—he produced the key; the cupboard was undone; the officers began searching it—the prisoner walked up and down the room, passing jeering remarks, such as "This is lovely"—I think he was sober—he said, "Let Mr. Marshall look in there himself; don't push the things about; he won't find anything there"—then Mr. Weller put these things on the table in a brown paper parcel, and said, "What about these things?" and when the prisoner saw them he said, "I am don?"—the initials on it are our family initials—the officer told him he would be charged with stealing them—he said, "I am a ruined ma?"—he asked the boy in the bar for brandy, which he had, and he offered the officers something to drink, which they did not have; he was taken away—he was afterwards before the Justices with Gilhooly, and he was committed for trial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was in our service something under two years—he left with a good character in December, 1885—he then went to the Aquarium, and then into the London police—this is the first time that any accusation has been made against him—Mrs. Marshall and I went to the Sportsman about half-past seven; we waited outside about half an hour with Inspector Weller, and two other officers—we went inside about eight, and remained there till one, when the prisoner came in—besides the prisoner, I saw Mary Gilhooly in the house—she is the sister of Bridget Gilhooly—Mary is the licensee of the house—the boy was employed there as potman or barman—there was no barmaid—they were in the house when we got there—Miss Gilhooly was serving behind the bar—before the prisoner came in, I and the officers had gone into every room in the house and searched, and the linen in question was produced—there was a room upstairs which we had not seen, because the prisoner had the key—I have no recollection who opened that door—these cuffs were among the linen produced; I don't think they have been washed—they have ragged edges; it is not a clean cut—I had a solicitor at the Court before the Magistrate—I did not mention to the Magistrate that the prisoner said, "I am done"; I was not asked the question; I told it to my solicitor—I know now that the prisoner lived at Kensal Rise, and that he holds an occasional spirit licence there—I thought he was fully licensed for athletic sports—I know that my wife has been in the habit of giving away old articles of clothing.</p>

               <p>and went, with Mr. and Mrs. Marshall and two officers, to the Sportsman public-house, on Saffron Hill—I made a search of the house, and found the articles produced in the front parlour downstairs; the three table-cloths were in the wash house; the three table-covers were in a bedroom upstairs, where the prisoner sleeps—the pillow slips were on the bed, and the collars were in the same room—Mr. Marshall said they were his property—with the exception of these articles there was no other linen in the house—we waited in the house till the prisoner came home, about one in the morning—I told him we were police officers, and said, "Have you received any property from Mrs. Gilhooly at the Towers, Pinner?"—he said, "No?"—I said, "We have a search warrant, and have searched your hous?"—at the same time I picked up these articles, and put them on the table, and said, "These things have been found, and identified by Mr. Marshall, and you will be charged with receiving them, knowing them to be stolen?"—as I showed him some of the articles he said, "I am a ruined man; this takes the cak?"—I made a note of what he said the same day—I think that was all he said.</p>

               <p>called to the Police-station, and saw the deceased there; she was in a semi conscious state, on a stretcher, and the matron was attending to her—I examined her carefully; I was with her about a quarter of an hour—I found that she was wounded at the back of the wrist, about an inch long; it merely divided the skin, nothing more—I then saw the wound in the chest, between the second and third rib—she was certainly under the influence of drink—I failed at that time to see whether it went in the direction of the heart, and I left her, and went into the officer's room—I saw her again about three minutes after—I thought her better—she seemed to have rallied a little, and I consented to her being put into a cell, and I left—I was called to see her again in about half an hour—she was then dead—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and then discovered the nature of that wound—it took a downward direction, and then a lateral direction, and ended in a wound in the left ventricle of the heart—the heart was full of blood, and the wound was fatal—that wound must have been caused by some sharp, narrow instrument, such as the keen, narrow blade of a pocket-knife—the penetration of the heart was less than one-third of an inch—the external wound was about half an inch; that would be about the width of a pocket-knife—if she was in an erect position at the time, it would be between two and three inches from the outside to the ventricle—at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> I noticed that the stomach contained alcohol, and there was a small quantity of solid food partly digested.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The wound that caused death in this case was from left to right, and downward for about an inch, and then glanced off to the right—when I first saw it I had a very strong suspicion that it was self-inflicted; it was very similar to what I had seen in similar cases—after one p.m. I was of opinion that it was more likely to have been in-flicted by somebody else; that was the balance of my mind, and that the wound on the wrist was in attempting to avoid it, as an instinctive act.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sub-postmaster, of 202, Kilburn Road, and am a grocer in a large way of business—the prisoner was in my employ from October 1st to December 1st as post-office clerk—not sent to me by the chief—Pearce and I also interfered in the post-office business—during the week ending November 28th I had instructions to have the letters counted previous to each collection—it was the prisoner's duty to collect the letters out of the box that week—he had the key; I believe he wrote for it, and it was delivered by post—I know he had it—a note was made of all letters posted and collected during the week—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sheet for the week; it is a duplicate entry in the prisoner's writing—the key of the box was in his charge during that week; he carried it in his pocket, as far as I know—on November 24th, I had by my stock-book thirty 15s. orders at the close of business, and thirty also at the close of business on the 25th; so that none were sold that day.</p>

I have never assisted in counting the letters, nor do I think I have ever cleared the box; I did not do so that week, so far as T know; I may have done so while the prisoner was absent at his dinner, but he would sign the slip—as he goes to his dinner there is a collection, and when he goes he could call on Pearce to assist him at any time and in any way—I do not know that Pearce assisted him during the week—I said at Bow Street, "If I was asked for a post-office order, and there was one ready stamped, I should issue i?"—I assume, because he had signed the letter<lb/>slip, that he had done it—these orders were kept in a bovril-box, with no division in it—I frequently looked into that drawer, but the postal orders were divided, and you can turn over the bunch; each price is kept separate by a band—I have not seen orders put in a drawer and cancelled—if you come in for £1 order it should be cancelled by the customer immediately—on the day he left, a 10s. savings bank-book was found, I believe, among some letters—the prisoner did not find it; he found a post-office order in the shop on the 26th, and communicated with the head office, and asked for instruc-tions—when he left I had my house accounts gone through by an officer of the Post Office, and they were found correct—when he left he called on me, and gave me his London and his country addresses.</p>

               <p>January 13th I saw the prisoner at Bishop's Castle, in Shropshire, and wrote down what passed—I said, "I am Mr. Drummond, of the General Post Office, and I must caution you that what you say in answer to my ques<lb/>tions may subsequently be used against you. On November 25th last, when you were employed at the Post-office at 222, Kilburn High Road, a Mrs. Long, of 63, Messina Avenue, West Hampstead, purchased a postal order for 20s., No. O/99 899160, and one for 10s., No. L/78 387669; she enclosed them in a letter addressed to Mr. Lunn, 117, Dulwich Road, S.E., and posted it in the letter-box at the office at the time she purchased the order, between three and five p.m., but the letter was never delivered: Mrs. Long kept a record of the numbers of the orders, and the 20s. order has been traced to Mr. Cox, 41, Douglas Road, Kilburn, who states that he purchased it between seven and eight p.m. on Novem<lb/>ber 25th, at the 222, Kilburn High Road office; the 15s. order has been traced to Mrs. Hollis, of 102, Pring Park Road, N.W., who states that she purchased it between five and six p.m. on November 25th at the same office; Mrs. Hollis asked for a 15s. order, but was told by the clerk who served her that he was out of them, and he gave her a 10s. and a 5s. order; Mrs. Hollis kept the numbers of both orders, and the 15s. order is that issued to Mrs. Long earlier in the day, and the 5s. order is signed by you as the issuing officer, proving that you issued both orders to Mrs. Hollis, where did you obtain the 10s. order?" the prisoner replied, "I know nothing about it; I got it, I suppose, from the box containing the postal orders?"—I then showed him the postal order produced for 5s., No. J/87 318274, and said, "Did you issue this order?"—he said, "Yes, I issued it; it bears my signature?"—I said, "Then, you must have issued the 10s. order, which was enclosed in a letter and posted by Mrs. Long some time previousl?"—he replied, "I did not obtain it from a lette?"—I said, "During the week ending November 18th, all letters posted at the office, 222, Kilburn High Road, were counted; it was your duty to specially collect all letters posted there, count and classify them, and hand them over to the collecting postman when he arrived; you did so on November 25th, and, therefore, the letter posted by Mrs. Long containing the two postal orders passed through your hands, and you only in the office would have access to it, one of the postal orders was subsequently re-issued by you; did you obtain it from the letter?"—he replied, "I know nothing about it; I did not invariably collect the letters that week; Mr. Belsham may have done so on the occasion that Mrs. Long posted her letter?"—Mr. Belsham is the post-master—I said, "Why did you not supply Mrs. Hollis with a 15s. postal order when she asked for it, instead of a 10s. and a 5s. order?" he said, "I cannot remember; I suppose I was out of 15s. orders?"—I took him to London, and gave him in custody.</p>

I am a printer, at 40, Sun Street—I printed the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Who's Who</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Financial Who's Who</hi>—the account in my books is headed "Jacobs," with no initials—I was paid by cheque, Albert Jacobs' cheque, I believe—I printed 5,000 copies a week, and sent them to the Protection Agency Office, 76, Finsbury Pavement—I knew Morris Berlyn Jncobs previously as interested in company matters—I very rarely saw him—I knew he was in the office of the Investors' Protection Agency, with his father—I cannot tell you what his connection with the Agency was, or who the manager was—I printed the papers from 1895—I have printed the letter-heads of the Investors' Protection Agency; the manager is described on them as Morris Berlyn Jacobs.</p>

I began printing the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Who's Who</hi> in May, 1893—I have no name to it in my books; I have merely put "5,000 eight page pape?"—that paper only lasted a few weeks—between June, 1895, and May, 1896, when I began printing the <hi rend="italic">Financial Who's Who</hi>, neither paper was in existence; there was an interval of about eleven months—I never looked to M. B. Jacobs as the person responsible for the <hi rend="italic">Financial Who's Who;</hi> all I knew of him was that he was the son of his father in the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a civil engineer—I know Farmer, and also Marcus Bebro and his sons—I was the vendor of some property that was to be sold to the Bechuanaland Company, and in connection with it Farmer acted as my solicitor—Marcus Bebro was one of the promoters of the company—I know Morris Berlyn Jacobs, and know Julius Jacobs slightly—I often met Julius Jacobs in the waiting-room at Farmer's office, and Morris Berlyn Jacobs I have met there and also repeatedly in the street, London Wall, and Copthall Avenue, and those localities—Morris Berlyn Jacobs has repeatedly spoken to me about the Bechuana-land Company; first in February, 1896, and afterwards six or twelve times in the street—he said a fellow Hebrew had a grudge against Mr. Bebro, and he proposed, before this company should come out, that Mr. Bebro should pay him a large sum for his silence, or take the consequences in his paper, or words to that effect—after February he made statements about what he intended to do, nearly a dozen times—I keep no diary, and made no notes—I considered it unimportant at the time—his first question almost invariably was, whether Marcus Bebro had plenty of money or cash, and he would invariably wind up with some remark, "I intend to make Marcus Bebro stand up before this company comes out, or take the con-sequences"—he always spoke of the <hi rend="italic">Who's Who</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Golden Age</hi> as his papers—the last time I saw him, previous to his being at the Police-court, was at the latter part of September or the beginning of October, at the foot of Copthall Avenue, where a man was standing selling the <hi rend="italic">Who's Who—</hi> Jacobs had a large orchil in his coat, and wanted me to tell him the botanical name of it—I could not, and he finally told me the name,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189702080023"/>
               <p>which I could not pronounce; then the old story began, "Has Marcus Bebro any money?"—I paid, "No," because I wished to avoid any black<lb/>mailing attacks—he said, "You see that paper?"—I said, "Ye?"—he said, "That is my paper; that is the paper that is proposing to make Marcus Bebro sit up and pay me a very heavy sum for my silence?"—I saw Farmer frequently with regard to his acting for me as solicitor—my attention was called to this article, of November 4th, by a gentleman in an office in Mansion House Buildings—I went over to Copthall Avenue and Angel Court, and bought a copy and read it—there was no mention of the name of the company in the article—I knew it referred to ours—I almost immediately went over to Bebro's office, in Eastcheap, and had a conversation with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COCK</hi>. I had known Farmer about seven years, I think, as a solicitor, and had employed him as my solicitor—I had every confidence in him, and in his honour and position—I had many opportunities of seeing him in connection with business transactions—among other matters in which I had been connected with him was the formation of the Bechuanaland Company, in the promotion of which Marcus Bebro was largely interested—Farmer was also largely interested in its success—I think his interest in the successful coming out of the company was about £10,500 in shares and £4,000 in cash—he was very desirous that attacks should not be made on the company (he always expressed himself so), or upon anybody connected with it, which would affect the coining out of the company—I had seen some of the Jacobses at Farmer's office from time to time, and my inference was that he was their solicitor—I first saw this article in <hi rend="italic">Who's Who</hi> on the morning of Thursday, November 3rd—when I went to Bebro's office immediately after reading the article, I saw two or three of Bebro's sons, two, I think—one was Lionel Bebro—they suggested quite a number of very ridiculous ways of treating the matter, they wanted me to point out the Jacobses, and give them a sound thrashing—and exhibited the muscles of their arms and legs—I said that would only lead them into trouble, and it was the height of youthful indiscretion—they asked me what I would do if it was my position, and I said my first thing would be to see Farmer, as he had acted for them, and, being in-terested in the Bechuanaland matter, would be anxious to have the thing stopped—I referred to an article that had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> the previous Saturday, October 31st—I was told there had been a consultation with Farmer, Mr. Aldridge and others, and that they had requested Farmer to take legal proceedings with regard to that article, and that he had declined—Lionel and Godfrey Bebro said, on November 5th, that Mr. Aldridge had already seen the article, and said it was no use taking any notice of it—I thought it would be in the company's interest that some notice should be taken of it; my theory was that this article following on that in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> was the beginning of an attack by all the blackmailing papers, and I thought it would be wise to check it on the moment—I thought the wisest course was to see Fanner, as he might have some influence with the Jacobses to prevent these attacks—after some little discussion the question was asked by Lionel Bebro, or one of them, whether Farmer was at his office—I went to the telephone, and called him up, and the answer came from the type-writer's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189702080024"/>
               <p>office, saying Farmer was very busy, and could not be disturbed—three or four times afterwards, either Lionel Bebro or I rang him up, and got the same response; each time I asked Miss Lytton if we could not be switched on to Mr. Farmer—after twenty or thirty minutes we got switched on to the telephone to his private office—I asked him if he had seen the article in <hi rend="italic">Who's Who</hi>—he said it was on his table, and if I would wait a moment he would open it, and look at it; it had come in by the mail that morning—after a few moments I said, "Farmer, it is a most villainous article, and it is directed against Mr. Bebro, but it does not name either me or the company; it is leading to that point; and all the damage that could be done by this article has been done already; it is suggested that some arrangement be made to stop future attacks?"—he said, "Quite right, old fellow," or "old chap," or something of that sort, and I asked him if he could not see one of the Mr. Bebros, either senior or junior—he said his diary was quite full; he could not make an appoint<lb/>ment then, but he would ring up later in the day—some remarks were then made between me and the Bebros, and I left the office, and went home—Lionel Bebro was in the room from and to which these messages were passing on the telephone, and either he or his brother had the other ear tube—my impression is that it was Lionel, and that he heard all the conversation between myself and Farmer—their curiosity was great to know what was going on—I think, before I left, an appointment was made for 10.15 the next morning—I made a statement as my proof for Mr. Farmer—I received a note from his managing clerk, saying he had been arrested, and was at Moor Lane, and would I call there—I did so, and he said, would I go to his office and give a dictation to his typewriter of the telephone incident—I did so; it was before I heard the informa<lb/>tion read at the Justice-room—an appointment was made for young Bebro to go the following morning, the 6th, to Farmer at 10.15—I did not go the following morning to Farmer's; I was very ill that afternoon, and went home quite early, about two o'clock, and I was in bed the next day—Farmer always expressed himself as desirous, on account of his interests and those of the company, to stop these attacks being made on Bebro—he concurred with me that it was a villainous article, and ought to be stopped—I always believed that whatever he did was done in the interests of all concerned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. I was personally very anxious to stop any attack on Bebro or his Bechuanaland Company, which I was bring-ing out—my profit depended on the successful flotation if it went to the public, but not if it was taken up privately—I was not consulted by the promoters—I had purchased in Bechuanaland a very large concession of about 40,000,000 acres from a native tribe; it was ratified by the British authorities at Cape Colony, and recognised here, and by the German Government; it is nearly equal to the Chartered Company's—I had sold my interest in it to Mr. Spiers for.£250.000—I don't know what his contract was for selling his interest to the Bechuanaland Company—I have heard that he was selling to the company for £750,000—that was a little profit for Spiers of half a million, on paper—the Bechuanaland Company was going <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be brought out with a capital of one and a-half million, half of which was working capital, I think—the company has not come out because the market has been against it—I cannot say if the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189702080025"/>
               <p>exposure in this paper has been against it; it was not an exposure of the company, but of Bebro—I thought it was the beginning of a series of attacks on Marcus Bebro as a promoter, and it might interfere with the company—I don't know that it has done that—the company has not come out, and I have not got my profit, and Spiers and Bebro have not got theirs—I have no animosity towards the Jacobses; I have only come to tell the truth—as soon as this charge was made against Farmer and the Jacobses, Farmer asked me to reduce into writing the evidence I could give as to the telephone incident—I presume I understood I was to be called as a witness by Mr. Farmer and his co-defendants—I gave a statement of the evidence I could give, so far as Farmer was concerned—I did not say a word after the arrest to Fanner, or anyone in his office, about my interviews with M. B. Jacobs—after this prosecution began I gave a proof of the evidence I have given to-day to Bebro's solicitors, at their request; that was after I had given a statement to Farmer, for the purpose of being called as a witness for the defence—I at-tended every day, but was not called by the prosecution—I do not know why they did not call me; I do not know of any reason why they should doubt my testimony—I did not tell them that if I was called I might possibly help Farmer; they were not influenced by that consideration—my first conversation with M. B. Jacobs was in February, 1896—I think the full title of the company is the Bechuanaland Gold and Diamond Fields—in February, 1896, a proof prospectus had been printed for private circulation—I had a copy; I have not got one now—it had got no further by November, 1896; as the markets were all against an issue of any kind in any African matter, and I was not pressing Bebro, it would have made no difference who was carrying it through; I do not think a wealthy banker would have been able to do it—I am not aware that any copy of the prospectus had been sent to the Jarobses—I never told the Jacobses that Bebro was going to bring out this com<lb/>pany—I should say I saw M. B. Jacobs from six to ten times between February and November—after discussing his flower or orchid, he always seemed to drift into the question, "Has Bebro got any money?"—he seemed always anxious to know if he had any money, and I always told him I thought not, because I knew nothing about Bebro's finances, and I did not want to be brought into it—my story was always the same—I never led him to believe that he had any—the last time I saw him before November was the latter part of September, or early in October—I assured him then that Bebro had no money—I had been attacked in one of the earlier issues of this paper; I think the first or second issue—it said that I was going to be dissected by Jacobs—I met him in the street, and told him he would have to take the con<lb/>sequences of the attacks, and afterwards he was always very <hi rend="italic">chippy</hi> and friendly, and he said nothing else except once after that—I intended that the consequences would be a thrashing, or a public cowhiding, or something of that sort—I took a different line in my own case to the advice I gave Bebro, because it would not be a juvenile indiscretion in my case; I think a Magistrate would have justified it—that made us apparently very friendly afterwards; I never sought him—I passed it as an ordinary incident; it did not create ill-feeling on my part—it was an extraordinary incident for me to be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189702080026"/>
               <p>be threatened with an exposure—I make a practice of forgetting those things—I did not know the distinction between the <hi rend="italic">Weekly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Financial Who's Who</hi> till I was at the Police-court—I was shown the number at the Police-court in which my name appeared; I believe I was in the "Black Lis?"—I believe the paper would show it had been registered by M. B. Jacobs; I don't know of my own knowledge—this is the number, May 21st, 1895; it is No. 2 of the paper—my name is mentioned in connection with a Sea Water Company I had never heard of before—the paper was sent me, but not a copy of this i-sue, but one in which I was put in a long black list—my attention was not called to this one till long afterwards, and I had not recalled it till you called my attention to it at the Police-court—I was called at the Police-court by Farmer as a witness for the defence, and I was cross-examined by the counsel for the prosecution; and then I first gave evidence of these alleged interviews with M. B. Jacobs—no one was present at our interview in the street, and I don't re<lb/>call that anyone was in Farmer's office at the time—interviews repeatedly took place in Farmer's office; M. B. Jacobs would take me on one side in the waiting-room, and ask me, "How is the matter going on? have they got any money?I was waiting for you?"—no one was ever present—it was generally said in a low voice; he evidently did not want anyone to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After Farmer's arrest he asked me to dictate what happened with regard to the particular incident of the telephone, and I did so—two, or possibly three, of Bebro's sons were at the office; two of them, Lionel and Godfrey, were particularly interested, and spoke of my pointing out M. B. Jacobs—T dissuaded them from using violent measures—this company has never been offered to the public in any way, directly or indirectly—I was vendor of a large number of claims that had been centred in me; it was a large concession, to which there were a large number of owners and claimants—after dictating the telephone incident, I gave a proof to the solicitors for the prosecution as to M. B. Jacobs, during the prosecution—Mr. Cock represented Farmer at the Police-court, and he called and examined me—I was there, to be called on one side or the other at any time.</p>

I live at 81, Warrington Crescent, Maida Vale, and am twenty years old—I at as secretary to my father, at St. George's House, Eastcheap—I knew Mr. Farmer as a solicitor, and as in communication with my father in reference to a company that was being promoted—I have been to his office in reference to that business—on November 4th I saw the number of the <hi rend="italic">Financial Who's Who</hi> which contained an article upon my father—I think our clerk bought it in the street—I read the article—my father, my brothers, and I spoke about it—on November 5th Colonel McConkey came to the office; I was informed he was connected with this company, and was the vendor of the properties—he saw my younger brother, Godfrey, and myself—we have a telephone in our office—on November 6th I was rung up from Farmer's office late in the evening—until then I had not seen Farmer in reference to these articles in the paper—when he rung me up he said, "Have you seen this paper, <hi rend="italic">Who's Who?</hi>?"—I said, "Yes?"—he said he knew the editors and proprietors of it well, Morris Beryln, and Julius and Albert Jacobs—he said, "It is a great shame, and, no doubt, they</p>

               <p>could be squared, but they would want paying well for it?"—I said, "Do you know anything about them?"—he said he knew them, and he had seen Jacobs some time that day, and he had made an appoint<lb/>ment for me, if I would call at their office about the matter, the next day, at 11.30—I said, if he liked I would see him at his office at 11.20—I had never seen Julius, Morris Berlyn, or Albert Jacobs—when he said he had seen Jacobs that day I had no idea he said Morris—next day I went and saw Farmer at his office at 11.15—I said I did not care to go round to Jaoobses' office, but if they wanted to see me they could see me at Farmer's office—he said, "Very well, wait here for twenty minutes, and I will run round there?"—I waited an hour and a-half before he returned; he then took me into his private room, and said, "I have seen the Jacobses, and they said they were very glady you did not go round there, as they did not want to see you before the matter was settled, as they were too old birds to be caught at the game; the matter had arisen by an inquiry being received by the Jacobses from Paris about a company in which your father is interested, and the Paris people enclosed the proverbial 2s. 6d. for inquiry?"—he further said the Jacobses had replied, asking for further particulars, that the Paris people had sent further particulars, documents, etc., and said they were being supplied with private information from a man who posed as being our friend, and that a stockbroker in the house had supplied them with a lot of old original documents, written or belonging to my father, for several years back; that the Jacobsos had purchased all these, and, with a view to ruining my father they were going to publish all these documents from week to week, and that they would damn every company with which my father was connected; that they would translate these articles into the leading French papers, which the Jacobses influenced; that, they were being backed up by a syndicate, with an M.P. and his brother, who were bitter against my father, aud they had plenty of money; that the Jacobses had orders for as many copies of their paper, while the libels continued on my father, for eighteen week", as they could possibly print, and as they could probably get 100,000 copies printed, it would mean £50 to £100 a week, and the job to them was worth £9,000 to £15,000, and unless my father squared them, they would certainly publish all those articles, and damn every company with which he was connected—Farmer said, "It is purely a matter of business and, to speak plainly, you have practically to lick their shoes, or take the consequences; it is a damnable piece of business, and awfully hard on your father, but they mean business?"—he said it was a very delicate matter to arrange, but the way it would have to be done was this: the three Jacobses would enter into an agreement with me by which they agreed to stop all their attacks for the consideration to be agreed on, but that they would not take the cash with their own hands; it was to come through him (Farmer), and he said that the agreement must be kept in the custody of Farmer, in his safe, in a sealed envelope—he said they would want £15,000 or £20,000, something over what they were offered from the other side; that they would not sign it in my presence, as they were too long at the game for that, and that the agreement would have to be placed in a sealed envelope, and be in Farmer's custody, and in his safe—I said to him, "If we entered into that arrangement, and</p>

               <p>accept the agreement, we would be exactly the same as before, in your hands and the Jacobses'—he said, "No; I give you my word of honour, you would be perfectly safe with me?"—I said, "Suppose there was a breach of faith on the part of the Jacobses?"—he said, "The agreement would, be your property?"—I said, "Suppose you were to die, what then?"—he said, "Then the agreement would be your propert?"—I said, "Would you give a form of receipt acknowledging an agreement dated so-and so, and when the agreement was placed in a sealed envelope, allow me to sign my name, so that it should not be destroyed?"—he said, "Yes;" and he himself would verify each of the signatures of the Jacobses, as they would not sign it before me, and he showed me a letter written by them—I think he mentioned the three Jacobses by name—this was on the Saturday—I was with him for about half an hour—he asked me to call again on Monday—on the Monday I went to his office at 10.45, and saw Farmer in his private office—he asked me whether I was prepared to accept his previous offer from the Jacobses, and I asked him then what they wanted—he said, "Well, it is worth from £10,000 to £15,000 to them from this syndicate; and, as to the papers, they would print weekly for eighteen weeks £900 to £1,800," and that I should have to go something over that—I said, "Will they take shares?"—he raid, "No, they dis<lb/>tinctly said they must have some cash down?"—I said, "What cash?"—he said, "Something over this £900 to £1,800 for the paper?"—I said I could not go over £1,000—he said, "Suppose you put it at £1,000 cash and £15,000 shares in companies in which your father is interested, and I will submit that to the Jacobses?"—I asked him whether I should not bring my solicitor, Mr. Aldridge, with me next time, as I thought I should have a solicitor with me, and he knew Mr. Aldridge—he said, "All right," and he said he would see the Jacobses some time that day, And consult them on that—he said, as to the signing of the agreement, "They won't sign it in your presence, but if you like, you and your lawyer can go to the Jacobses' office, but remain at the bottom of the stairs; then I will go upstairs with the agreement, and get the three of them to sign it, come down and verify their signatures, and hind you a form of receipt on your handing me a cheque, and the agreement to be placed in a sealed envelope, on which you can sign your name, and the Jacobses do likewise, and the envelope to be retained by me?"—he said, after he had seen the Jacobses he would prepare a draft form of receipt and this agreement, and Asked me if I would call again, and that he would telephone and let me know when he had seen the Jacobses—I went then, and saw my solicitors, Messrs. Chinnery and Aldridge, but I found that, Mr. Aldridge was en-gaged all day in the Courts—on that Monday evening Farmer telephoned to know whether I was coming over with Mr. Aldridge—I said I would come over at once—I went to Aldridge's office, and found he was not in; and I went alone to Farmer's office about 6.30, and explained why Aldridge was not with me—he said he had seen the Jacobses, and they thought this amount, £1,000 cash and £15,000 shares in such a company, was not quite enough, and that they ought to have more—I said it was ample—he showed me a draft form of receipt and agreement which had been pre<lb/>pared—I said I could not do anything without Mr. Aldridge—he asked me the best time to see Mr. Aldridge—I said, "I should think about noon"—he</p>

               <p>said, "Very well; I will cull next day, about noon, at Mr. Aldridge's?"—I read the draft agreement and receipt—they were similar to those I subsequently saw at Mr. Aldridge's—Farmer said that, pending these negotiations, nothing would appear in the next issue, which would be on Wednesday, 11th—I left him—I called and saw Mr. Aldridge next morn<lb/>ing, 10th—a little later on the 10th, Farmer came to Mr. Aldridge's, and I and Mr. Aid ridge saw him—Farmer and Mr. Aid ridge had some conversation previous to my coming in—Farmer handed to Aldridge this draft agree<lb/>ment and receipt—they were then simply typewritten, without the ink alterations, which were subsequently made. (<hi rend="italic">The agreement, addressed to Lionel S. Bebro, teas to the effect that in consideration of</hi> £, 1,000 <hi rend="italic">being paid through Farmer to Jacobs, and of Bebro's undertaking to allot</hi> £15,000 <hi rend="italic">in fully paid-up shares in the Bechuanaland Company to the Jacobses, they undertook to discontinue in the "Who's Who," and their papers present and future, the libel and attacks on Bebro, sen., and his companies; the Jacobses undertaking to deposit with Farmer, as custodian for all parties, all docu<lb/>ments relating to the Bebros and their companies. The receipt was an acknowledgment nf the receipt from the Jacobses of the agreement.</hi>) Those documents were shown to Mr. Aldridge, who asked to be allowed to have copies of those, to which Mr. Farmer con<lb/>sented—a clerk was sent for, and copies were made, and the originals returned to Farmer—when I came into the room Farmer said, "I have just been explaining to Mr. Aldridge how the matter is, in the same way as I have to you," or something like that—when the drafts had been copied Farmer said, "This matter should be settled to-night, as the <hi rend="italic">Financial Who's Who</hi> goes to press to<lb/>nigh?"—Aldridge said, "Oh, you can stop any reference being made to Bebro in to-morrow's paper, surely?"—Farmer said, "Oh, yes, I will do that," or words like it—Aldridge said he must think over such a matter, and he would like a day or so to think it over, and Farmer said, "All righ?"—I said, "What is going to become of the old original documents that the Jacobses have of my father? you will let us have them, of course?"—he said, "No, they must be placed with the agreement in the safe," and then he wrote on the type-written document the provision with regard to the custody of the documents, and Mr. Aldridge added those words to his copy of the agreement, in pencil, I think—Farmer said the Jacobses would not agree to let the documents become my property in the case of his death, but that in that event the agreement should be placed in the joint names of the respective solicitors'—the receipt was then altered to that effect—Farmer asked me whether I could see him at 1.30 next day, with Mr. Aldridge, to hear what Mr. Aldridge had to say about it—on that day Mr. Aldridge and I communicated with the City Police at the Old Jewry—the next day, 11th, I purchased a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Financial Who's Who</hi>, and looked through it—there was no reference to my father in it—about 1.30 that day I went to Farmer's office, and saw him in his private office—I said Mr. Aldridge had no suggestions to make as to this draft agreement—he said he would see the Jacobses in the interim as soon as he could, and asked whether I would see him again next day—I said I would at 12.30—on the next day, Thursday, 12th, I got a message from him that 12.30 was not convenient, and the time was fixed for 5.30—in the course of the day I went to the Guildhall Police Court—I and Mr. Aldridge had</p>

               <p>consulted counsel before that—an information was laid that day, and summonses were granted against the three Jacobses and Farmer—about six o'clock I went and saw Farmer in his private office—he said he had just seen M. B. Jacobs, who had returned from Bath, and had been thinking over the agreement, and was a bit afraid to sign it directly with me, and, therefore, he now proposed to do it through Mr. Farmer—I asked what that meant—he said that he (Farmer) would give me a letter, in which he undertook to get a letter from the three Jacobses, in which they undertook to stop all attacks on my father, and to aid him instead of injuring him, for this considera-tion of £16,000, and that the Jacobses would sign that undertaking to Farmer, and that both letters were to be kept by Farmer in his safe—said it was new, and I could not do anything myself; if he liked to see my solicitor, he could—he said, "What time?"—I said twelve—he said he could at eleven, and he told me, as I was about to go, that the Jacobses had had a fresh batch of letters from Paris, and another cheque offered them to continue their attacks on my father—I left—next day, Friday, 13th, Farmer telephoned, would I send over the road to see if Aid ridge could see him—I did so, and heard Aldridge would be there at eleven, and about eleven Farmer went to Aldridge, and saw him in the presence of Howard, Aldridge's clerk, and myself—Farmer went through again what he had told me the day before—Aldridge said, "This is something new, departing from what you said before; suppose you draft what you mean?"—Farmer proceeded to draft something, and promised Aldridge copies—I saw the letters he drafted; they were similar to these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—Mr. Aldridge was called out to see a client, and he whispered audibly to Howard, "Mind you get a copy of those two letters?"—after Mr. Aldridge had left the room, Farmer said he would see the Jacobses, and asked me whether he could see me about 1.30—I said I should be over the road at St. George's House, and he said he would call—he went away, taking the drafts with him, without leaving copies—about 1.30 that day I rang up Farmer through the telephone, and gave Howard, who was there, the other ear-trumpet, so that he could hear—I asked Farmer whether he intended to keep us waiting any longer, or whether he was coming—he said, "Putting one and two together, and between you and me und the gate-post. I do not think I am coming to your office, after a little incident that occurred at Messrs. Chinnery, Aldridge, and Co.'s—I asked him what it was, and he said, "Well, I won't tell you through the telephone; if you come to my office now I will tell you, with no third party presen?"—I went away, and saw Mr. Aldridge for a moment, and he said, "Go over with Mf. Howar?"—I did so—Howard waited in the outer office, and I went into the inner office alone—Farmer said, "I thought it rather funny, when I was there, that Mr. Aldridge whispered in an audible whisper to his clerk, 'Mind you get copies of those two draft letters?"—I said I did not think it was very funny, as he had promised it himself, and I asked him to call in Howard, whom I had brought—Howard was called in—Farmer said the same thing to Howard, and said it was the tall clerk, Mr. Jew<lb/>hurst, who was in the room at the time, and Howard said, "It was me myself?"—Farmer said, "Look here, T am going to protect myself, and I don't care a damn for the others; they must look after themselves; this</p>

               <p>is a very delicate piece of business, and I air afraid?"—I said, "Very well, Mr. Fanner; then I had better say good day; I shall be very glad personally if these dirty attacks on my father could cease?"—he said, "Don't go like that; won't you come back here at 3.45, and see Mr. M. B Jacobe alone personally, or in my or Mr. Aid ridge's (presence?"—after asking it two or three times, I did consent—Howard said perhaps I might—before I left Farmer a lady messenger had been sent from the Jacobses, stating that a fresh lot of private documents had been received by the Jacobses, and some more money offered to continue the attacks on my father—I saw no letters there myself—I went back at 3.45 that afternoon, with Howard, and saw Farmer in his private office; he said he was very sorry that Jacobs could not come over; would I go over with him and Howard to the Jacobses' office, 76, Finsbury Pavemsnt—we three went—I saw on the door then vines of the Investors' Protection Society, and <hi rend="italic">Who's a Who</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Golden Age</hi>—on going in I saw one of the Jacobses, I don't know which—I think he said, "Oh, here they are?"—Julius Jacobs came out, and Farmer said, "This is young Mr. Bebro, and tins is Mr. Howard, the clerk to Aldridg?"—that was the first time I had ever seen Julius Jacobs—he said, "Oh, yes, I know," and led the way through a passage to another room, where he said, "This is my private room," or something like that—we were all four in the room—Farmer said, "I have brought these two gentlemen here to see if we cannot bury the hatchet between you and Mr. Jacob?"—I said, "Excuse me, Mr. Farmer, but I cannot see where the phrase,' Bury the hatchet, "comes in, because my father never certainly provoked the unwarranted libel that appeared about him?"—Julius Jacobs said, "Don't call it libel; call it license of languag?"—I said, "I have come here, Mr. Jacobs, at the special request of Mr. Farmer, and I would like to know if it is true that you or your sons authorised Mr. Farmer to make me the proposal which he did, namely, that for £16,000 cash and shares you and your sons would abstain from publishing anything more about my father in your papers?"—Jacobs said, "That is perfectly true; and is not it proved by the fact that we have specially stopped publishing anything about your father in this last issue, just out, though we threatened we would do so?"—I said, "What would you do if I did not pay anything at all?"—he said, "Oh, well, of course, I would not mind much, but if you did not pay anything at all, we would simply have to continue, because it is worth £10,000 to £15,000 from some friends of mine, who have formed a kind of syndicate amongst them, with a member of Parliament, who is bitter against your father, and we have always orders, for eighteen weeks, for as many copies as we can get out of our paper while the libel extends.; and, therefore, you can see it is a matter of business, and we will have to continue?"—he said he had had an emissary round from Mr. Harry Marks, saying he would be glad to see Mr. M. B. Jacobs in reference to the attacks on my father—I said, "Have either of you seen Mr. Marks?"—he said, "No, not yet?"—he said he had a lot of original documents from Paris, and from a stockbroker, and from a private friend of his; and that if we did not settle with him, he would publish them all, and have them translated in the papers and distributed round the City—he said he would be very pleased if we settled; he would</p>

               <p>destroy all old documents, and put in good words about any companies my father wanted—he came towards me, and said, "As from Jew to Jew, when once you settle, you will never see anything more about your father; it will be all ove?"—I said, "Is it true, Mr. Jacobs, that you and your two sons authorised Mr. Farmer to act on behalf of you in this matter?"—he said, "It is quite true; and anything that Mr. Farmer does for me or my sons we accept the responsibility o?"—he asked me whether I was ready to pay £500 down—I said I was if he and his sons signed this document—he said, "We will not sign till Mr. Farmer signs first, and you have paid him this money?"—I said, "Why don't you take the money yourself?"—he said, "No; we are not going to be caught like tha?"—I said, "Well, may I have those twodocuments for which lam to pay £16,000?"—he said, "Of course not'; we would not be such d——d fools; you are silly to ask such a thin?"—Farmer said perhaps we did not want Mr. Jacobs any more, and we might go over to his office—Jacobs said, "Very wel?"—before I went he held out his hand to shake hands—I said, "I hope we shall be better friends next time/' and did not take his hand—I went back with Farmer to his office, and waited outside, as he had a client, till Howard, who had to go elsewhere, came back after about fifteen minutes—then we went into Farmer's private office, and Farmer signed this document and this receipt, and stamped them. (<hi rend="italic">The first of these documents, addressed to Lionel Bebro, dated November</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1896, <hi rend="italic">and signed "J. H. Farmer, solicitor for the Messrs. Jacobs," acknowledged the receipt of</hi> £500, <hi rend="italic">and an undertaking to pay</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">within a month, and to have allotted to Farmer's nominees</hi> £15,000 <hi rend="italic">fully paid vendors' shares in the Bechuanaland Com<lb/>pany, and agreed to secure the co-operation and assistance of Julius, M.

Upon failing to do this, Farmer undertook to return such money and shares. In the second document Farmer acknowledged the receipt of</hi> £500 <hi rend="italic">on account of</hi>£1,000, <hi rend="italic">as solicitor for the Jacobses, in accordance with the letter of that date, and he undertook to hold that letter on behalf of all parties, with the letter of the Jacobses to be given to him to-morrow</hi>). I then handed Fanner a cheque, crossed "Not negotiable," drawn to the order of "J. H. Farmer or order?"—he said he would send the documents to the Jacobses, and get the other documents signed by them, and would see me in the morning at St. George's House, at twelve or 12.30, I think he mentioned—on the next morning, 14th, Farmer did not come, and I telephoned to him, and went with Howard to him between twelve and one—Farmer said he had sent the documents he had signed and the cheque on to the Jacobses, and asked me to go there with him—eventually I consented to go, and I went with him and Howard—Albert and Morris came out of the private room, and said, "Perhaps they had better come in here," mean<lb/>ing their room—Julius Jacobs came out with a pipe in his mouth, and said we had better go into room No. 10, and we went in there—Farmer went out for a few minutes and spoke to Jacobs alone, and then they came back, and Julius Jacobs, Farmer, Howard, and I were together—Jacobs said they would not sign the document till they had seen the cheque, which I had given to Farmer the previous night, was met, and he said to Farmer, "You were a d——d fool to take a cheque; I always</p>

               <p>take gold or bank-notes in such transaction?"—Fanner did not say anything—I made an excuse to go; they both said, "Don't go ye?"—Farmer left the room—Jacobs chatted with me for a minute or two, and then went out of the room, and came back almost immediately—his face seemed quite livid with rage—I wanted to go—he planted himself in front of me, and looked at the door, and commenced to bhout—he said, "Oh! understand, you don't go yet; that cheque has not been met, and you knew it; I am going to have you both arrested on some charge or othe?"—we did not say anything—he said, "I will have you both arrested for conspiring to bribe me with £500 to help you to promote a swind-ling compan?"—I said, "You know you and your two sons have endeavoured to blackmail me and my father in a most outrageous manner, and, now you cannot succeed, you think you will have us arrested on a trumped<lb/>up charge?"—he shouted, "Oh! Harry Marks put me up to this, and now he is going to be revenged on your father for your father putting his brother in the dock?"—I said, "I thought you had not seen Mark?"—he said, "It does not matter now?"—he continued 60 pace the floor—soon Farmer came in, and Jacobs said he was going to have us both arrested—a policeman was called in, and I and Howard were given in charge, and taken to Kingsland Road Police Station in a cab, with two policemen—before that Jacobs said, as Farmer did not know anything about it, "I am going to have these two young men arrested?"—Farmer did not say anything—he and Jacobs went across the room for a minute or two, and chatted—Morris and Albert came in the room, aud wanted to come to the station with us; but Julius said, "Oh, never mind; you need not come; I can do this alone"; and he and Farmer went in a cab alone—Howard was not allowed to speak to Farmer; Farmer tried to speak to him—at the station, Jacobs said to the inspector that he was going to charge me with conspiracy to bribe him with £500, I think; and I explained that I was being blackmailed, and I said to Farmer, "Is it true I came to the Jacobses' office, because Jacobs would not come to your office, at your suggestion?"—he said, "It was at my suggestion"; and I asked the inspector to note it—Farmer and Jacobs were spoken to by the inspector in a private room, and the inspector refused to take the charge—after that I communicated with our solicitor and counsel, and warrants were granted against Julius and Morris Jacobs and Farmer—Albert was left out—the matter came on for hearing at the Guildhall Police Court—this is the number of the paper of November 18th; I saw it.</p>

On Octo<lb/>ber</hi> 14<hi rend="italic">th, Farmer to Bebro, acknowledging the letter, and wishing success.</hi>) Mr. Speir was also interested in promoting this company—I knew bills were being given in connection with the company—up to October 14th I was on perfectly friendly relations with Farmer—it was important for my father, so far as this company was concerned, that there should not be attacks on it in the papers—before the article in <hi rend="italic">Who's Who</hi>, an article had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi>, criticising the company—my father saw Mr. Aldridge with reference to stopping that, and they suggested they should send for Farmer, as representing McConkey and others having a common interest in the property—Mr. Aldridge was the solicitor to the proposed company—he and my father thought Farmer should be consulted—I began my account on the evening of Friday, November 6th—I had been to Farmer's office that morning at 11.15—I did not call with McConkey at Farmer's office on the morning of the Saturday, 7th; we were both there—Farmer and McConkey left the office together; I don't know for what purpose—a hour and a-half after-wards, after telling me to wait, I saw Farmer, and he told me the result of his interview with the Jacobses—he said they said they were glad I did not go with him to see them, as they did not want to see me till it was settled, as they were too old birds at the game to be caught that way—Farmer told me how the matter arose, and made me an offer from the Jacobses—I understood at that time that what he said came from the Jacobses, as being their terms for the purpose of ceasing to insert the articles—I had no doubt at that time that Farmer's position was that he was communicating to them what he understood me to suggest, and com-municating to me what he understood them to suggest—he said they wanted something over £10,000 to £15,000, and £000 or £1,800 in cash—he put it at about £16,000—he said they wanted £900 to £1,800, and</p>

               <p>a consideration in the company—I asked him if they could do without cash—he did not draft anything in my presence on the Saturday; he said he would see them, and see whether they would accept the terms I suggested—on the following Monday Farmer submitted his draft to me; it was not signed by anybody then—at that time, so far as I understood, it was intended that the Jacobses were to sign this agreement, and address it to me, and upon those terms the Jacobses were to discontinue the attacks—I saw Farmer, and it was suggested that I had better see my solicitor before I completed the arrangement, so that I might be right in the course I took—Farmer made no difficulty about that—the arrangement was then made that Farmer should come round to Aid ridge's on the Tues<lb/>day morning, so that Aldridge might see if I was taking the right course—the alterations were on that occasion drafted by Aldridge, and made by Farmer—Farmer was at that time on friendly terms, and, so far as I knew, as desirous as I that the attacks should cease—I had no reason then for supposing that Farmer was trying to make anything out of the transac<lb/>tion—he was acting, I always understood, for the Jacobsen—I don't know that he did anything in my interest; I know he made this proposal for the interest of the Jacobses—he ineraly offered me the proposal from the Jacobses—I don't know what else he could do but carry our messages to one another—he said I could bring my solicitor the next time, because he knew him, and that he would not mention it—he made it a <hi rend="italic">sine quâ non</hi> that he should keep the documents, and he did not wish me to have copies of them—he did not say it would be better for him to have them; he said he must have them—it was Farmer's <hi rend="italic">sine quâ non</hi> that he held them; the Jacobses would not hand them over to me—I presume the additions in the first agreement of the words, "Severally undertake that we will discontinue in <hi rend="italic">Who's Who</hi>, and in our papers present and future," were in our interest—I could not say who suggested it—a copy was left with Mr. Aldridge, who said he should like to have time to consider it in my interest—next morning I called and said Aldridge had no alterations to suggest in the agreement—up to then Farmer had not given me any reason to suppose he was acting otherwise than on my behalf, as well as of others—the day before Aldridge and I notified to the police—I saw Farmer late on the Thursday—he did not say he had taken it to the Jacobses, who would not approve of it; he said Morris Jacobs was afraid to sign it directly with me, and he accordingly influenced the other two, and they wanted to do it in another form—he told me the form; that the Jacobses should write a letter to Farmer, who should write a letter to me—the letters were not drafted at that interview on the 12th—at that time all that had happened was that he had told me the Jacobses refused the arrangement in that form; but he had made these offers, as I considered, to blackmail his friends, and I think, if he had been acting in our interest, he would not have allowed it—he had not been asked to see what the Jacobses would do—McConkey did not suggest that to me—I did not know that McConkey had asked Farmer to see what he could do with the Jacobses—Farmer had made offers from certain parties whom he professed to be the friend of, and they wanted to blackmail my father, and if he considered himself our friend, I do not think he would have allowed it—he was not asked by us to do it—McConkey</p>

               <p>suggested it without our knowledge—I presume my father is in Court—I did not say then Farmer was making anything out of it—I did not think a gentleman who professed to be our friend would allow us to be blackmailed—Farmer made an offer to me first through the telephone on the 6th—he could have said he would not allow us to be blackmailed, and told us to pay nothing—I am taking criminal proceedings against him on my lawyer's advice, and he took counsel's advice—Farmer, on 13th, said Aldridge could have a copy of the documents—an appointment was made on the Friday for us to see Farmer on the Saturday—he saw my father at Aldridge's office on the Friday—my father was there on some other business, and was in a different room, with one of Aldridge's head clerks—my father came out of the room five or ten minutes after Farmer left, but Farmer had been talking on the stairs for five or ten minutes, and my father passed him—Farmer telephoned to me, saying he had put two and two together, and would like to see me about the matter, and did not like to come to my office, and I went to him—I explained there was nothing in his sus-picious; Howard came in afterwards—I took him to Farmer's office—some time after that, on the same day, the agreement was produced, signed by Farmer, and I handed him the cheque—before that was done he asked me to meet Morris Jacobs at his office; Morris did not come, and he asked me to go to the Jacobses' office, for the purpose of seeing whether what he had been communicating to me was in accordance with their instructions—I was satisfied, and he signed the agreement, and I gave the cheque—the following day the Jacobses were to give a letter to Farmer, undertaking to stop all attacks against my father; and those two letters, the letters from Jacobses to Farmer and Farmer to me, Farmer was to keep—he only gave me a receipt acknowledging there was such a letter in his hand—Farmer said he must keep it—we were not to have any handling of it—Farmer expressed as much surprise as anyone when Jacobs said I was going to be given into custody, and be went to the Police-court.</p>

On November 5th Mr. McConkey came to St. George's House, and saw me and my brother; I did not know he saw my father—he did not' see me with my father; I don't know whether he saw him or not—he was not asked in my presence by Mr. Bebro to stop the article in <hi rend="italic">Who's Who</hi>—I did not have one of the ear-pieces of the telephone when McConkey had the other, speaking to Farmer—Mr. McConkey may be mistaken; I and my two brothers were there, and it may have been one of them—Godfrey was there; I did not see him with the ear-piece to his ear—I would not deny he had it—I should be bound to remember it if I had been at the telephone; it has never occurred to me that if I were at the telephone it was from me, acting on behalf of my father, that Farmer was approached for the pur<lb/>pose of getting him to go to the Jacobses—I was never at the telephone with McConkey—my brother Godfrey might have been there—I heard nothing to the effect that Farmer was asked whether he had seen the article in <hi rend="italic">Who's Who;</hi> that Farmer opened it; that McConkey said it was a violent article directed against the Bebros, and as the damage it could do had already been done, he suggested to Farmer to see the Jacobses about it, and that Farmer said, "Quite righ?"—Marcus</p>

               <p>Bebro is within the precincts of the Court—if it were necessary he would come as a witness; he is quite well—I have heard he had a similar case to this about seven years ago against other persons; I was at school then—it was described as a case of blackmailing—I do not know if my father was a witness then; I do not know anything about it—I will not swear he was not a witness—I know nothing about the tactics there; I don't know whether there was produced a note alleged to be a note taken at the time of all that occurred in his presence—I took a note in this case, beginning it on the evening of the 6th, when I received the telephonic message—my first interview with Farmer was on the morn<lb/>ing of the 7th—no appointment was made, to my knowledge, on the after<lb/>noon of the 5th for the meeting on the 6th—I went on that morning on business for my father; I state positively it was not for this business—it was not a visit on that morning, but a call—I did not make an appoint<lb/>ment in McConkey's presence for that morning—I did not call to keep that appointment next morning—I went on other business of my father's—I have no recollection of the old case brought by my father; I was thirteen years old—I did not read the papers—I never discussed it in the Bebro circle—I may have heard of the case where Claud Marks was charged with blackmailing—I heard there was a disagreement of the Jury—I don't know who were called as witnesses; I understood my father and mother were—that is all I know about it—I have heard the name Rogers, not as that of my father's solicitor; I don't know what he was—I know nothing about the tactics of that case—my note began on the evening of the 6th—I have no note of any communication between Farmer and myself prior to that time—from that evening I went on making notes—I wrote down, after the interview was over, in shorthand, my recollection of the interview, and I have refreshed my memory from my notes between, giving evidence at the Police-court and to-day—I did not call on Farmer, according to appointment, at 10.15 on Friday morning, November 6th—I did not ask him whether, as a friend, he could do anything to stop the articles; he did not say he would see what could be done; I did not call for that purpose at all—I did not say, "Do what you can for us, there is a good fellow, and I will make it well worth your while?"—he did not reply that he would act simply as a friendly mediator between us and the Jacobses, and not in any professional capacity; that is abso-lutely unfounded—I only went with McConkey to Farmer's office on November 7th by accident—McConkey was at our office to see my father—McConkey walked with me to Farmer's office—we did not go to see Fanner together—Farmer did not leave me and McConkey in the office together that morning; Farmer went out, and McConkey went out, and I was left alone, waiting for Farmer—on his return he said he had seen the Jacobses; he did not say Morris Jacobs was away—he did not say any offer of terms must come from me, and that no terms had been mentioned by Julius Jacobs, nor that Julius Jacobs had left the whole matter for him (Farmer) to arrange, as a friend, between the Bebros and Jacobses—he said to me, "What is your opinion? what do you think the Jacobs want?"—I did not say it to him—he did not reply, "I have not the remotest idea; the proposal must come from yo?"—I did not say, "Give me some idea what will satisfy them; we are quite willing to pay well for them to shut up?"—I did not ask him if he thought Jacobs</p>

               <p>would be satisfied with £1,000 in cash and £15,000 in shares, and he did not reply, "I should say most certainly, as it is an extremely liberal offer?"—I did not say, "You can offer them, that but the Jacobses must enter into a formal agreement "; I asked him what they were going to do—he did not ask, "What do you want an agreement for?"—I did not say, "For our own protection; but I do not want to hold it myself, or even to have a copy of it; I have sufficient confidence in you to be the custodian of it between us?"—on November 12th I swore the information, and obtained summonses against the prisoners—I left it to my lawyer, and acted on his advice—I thought we were being blackmailed—we had determined that it was a criminal case—I had never seen Julius Jacobs up to that time—I went to see him, accompanied by a lawyer's clerk, on the 13th, the day after the summonses were granted—I went on the 13th to the Jacobses, to complete the evidence as far as we could—I asked Mr. Howard if I should go, and he said he did not see any harm, and when I went back Messrs. Chinnery and Aldridge advised me—on the 13th, the letter em-bodying the receipt of £500 on account of £1,000, was drawn up, I think—it was not drawn up in the morning—if it was it was after the visit to Jacobs—this draft was only drawn out on the Friday evening after our visit to the Jacobses—on the morning there was a draft of the two letters, but not of this document—the words, "As solicitor for and on behalf of," were not added at my request—the summonses granted on the 12th had not been served up to the 14th, when I made my second visit to the Jacobses' office again at Farmer's request, the criminal prosecution being still in my mind as one I would pursue—Julius Jacobs said, on the 14th, that he would not take the money with his own hands—this cheque is drawn to Mr. Farmer's order, and is marked "Not Negotiable," and is on my own bankers—the charge made against me by Julius Jacobs resulted in my being taken to the station; he saw the cheque was not met—I was taken to the station on the 14th on a false charge, and immediately liberated—up to that time there was no intimation to Julius Jacobs that I intended to take any criminal proceedings against him—I do not think the summonses granted on the 12th were ever served; they were exchanged for warrants on the Tuesday—the Alderman was out of town on the Monday—the prisoners were arrested on the warrants, and I gave evidence against them.</p>

I am confidential manager to Chinnery, Aldridge and Co., solicitors, of Brabant Court—I have acted for some time for Marcus Bebro—prior to November 10th I saw Lionel Bebro, who made a communication to me—on November 10th Farmer called at my office; I saw him alone for a few minutes before Lionel Bebro joined us—I asked Farmer to explain to me the whole facts in connection with the matter—he said, "My clients, the Jacobses, have been going for Bebro in their paper, <hi rend="italic">Who's Who</hi>, and they threaten to continue publishing the libels unless Marcus Bebro will pay them £1,000 in cash and £15,000 in shares in the company that is being formed, the Bechuanaland Gold and Diamond Fields, Limited: they are backed up by a very powerful syndicate in Paris, and they have in their possession an immense amount of information; they have obtained various copies of agreements and original documents that Mr. Bebro has entered into, and also original letters written by Mr. Bebr?"—Lionel Bebro was then announced, and was called in, and Farmer, continuing, said, "I have a draft agreement and a draft receipt, which, it is proposed, shall be signed by the Jacobses; that you and Lionel Bebro shall go with me to their office and wait outside, and I will get the document signed by them. I will verify their signatures; I am to retain the document, which can be placed in an envelope, and sealed and signed by Lionel Bebro if you choose?"—Farmer produced these agreements to me; they were not then in the condition they now are; an addition was made to each in Farmer's handwriting, and at Farmer's suggestion that his clients wanted that addition made; the addition is, "In consideration of such payment, we agree to deposit with Mr. J. H. Farmer, as custodian for all parties, and to remain in such custody during the continuance of this agreement, all docu<lb/>ments relating to yourself, your father and family, and his and their re-spective companies, that are our exclusive property?"—I said I could raise no objection to that—I said to Farmer, "You cannot expect me to approve these documents right off; I should think you had better leave them for a day or so?"—he said, "I cannot leave them, and the paper goes to press to-night, and, therefore, the matter ought to be completed, otherwise the threatened libel will be continued in to-morrow's issu?"—I said, "Surely you can stop that, Mr. Farme?"—he said. "Oh, yes, I will do that; I can do anything with the Jacobses; they will do what I tell the?"—he consented to let me have copies made of these documents, and I took the copies; it was after taking the copies that the additions were made—he said he must take the originals with him—he said, when the documents were completed, they were to remain in his custody on behalf of the various parties—after that interview I consulted counsel, and, as the results, laid the whole matter tafore the police on that same evening—on the 12th I instructed counsel to apply for process against the three prisoners and Albert Jacobs, and summonses were granted against them all—on the 13th Farmer called at my office; Lionel Bebro was present all the time, and Howard part of the time—Farmer said, "I want some change</p>

               <p>to be made; I cannot get these documents signed as they are; Julius and Albert Jacobs are willing to sign, but Morris now declined to sign; he has upset the arrangements; it is all his doin?"—he spoke of his being us artful as a waggon-load of monkeys, and said he had returned the previous night from Bath—I asked him if he had brought other docu<lb/>ments, as he proposed they should be—he said, "No, I have not got them with me—I handed him a piece of paper, said, "Perhaps you would not mind scribbling down something, to give me an idea of what you wan?"—he said the Jacobxes would be; willing to write a letter saying they would assist Mr. Bebro in the formation of his companies if Bebro would give them the £1,000 in cash and £15,000 in shares—I said I did not think Bebro, under any circumstances, would accept their terms, neither did I think he would give them £1,000, or even 4d.—I asked him to write down the proposed new documents, and he began to do so; they were to undertake not to further libel Bebro—I said, "When you have drafted this you will let me have a copy?"—he said, "Oh, yes?"—I was called from the room to see a client, and before leaving I said, in an audible whisper, to Howard, "Mind you take a copy of these documents Mr. Farmer is drafting?"—I did not want the whisper to reach Farmer—on the 14th, I think, I went to the Guildhall Police Court; I went there once or twice, and saw the Chitf Clerk in respect of the summonses.</p>

That was after a suspicious circumstance, as stated to Lionel, had happened in our office, when Mr. Farmer was writing and a liveried officer from the Police-court came and asked Mr. Farmer to see him—he was not being played with; he examined the facts.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWHS</hi>. We were consulted by Mr. Bebro to advise what course should be taken. (<hi rend="italic">Reading from deposition</hi>: "When I was shown the attack of the 4th in the <hi rend="italic">Financial Who'a Who</hi>, I was con-sulted by Mr. Bebro as to the best way of stopping the attacks.") That is substantially true—it is actually true, only we look upon it from a different point of view—I should think the attack would injure the flotation of the company—following our advice to Mr. Bebro, we determined on criminal proceedings on the 10th, after seeing counsel—I have had very little ex-perience in criminal matters—summonses were applied for, and granted, the information being sworn on Thursday, 12th—I asked for time to con-sider the advisability of withdrawing the summons against Albert Jacobs, against whom it was felt our evidence was not sufficiently strong, and to allow the matter to be completed. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I asked that the summonses should be held over in order to give time for the matter to be carried out.") That was not when I made the application for the summonses—I think it was on the next day, the 13th—I think you make a mistake; I did not apply to the Alderman for the summonses to stand over, but to the Chief Clerk—it was to give time—I think it was prior to the supposed substituted agreement that I saw the Chief Clerk—I asked him to stop the summonses, or whether they could be held over, and be said they would not be ready to be served till the Saturday—he said they would take some time to make out—I do not think he suggested what the difficulty was—I have said that I saw Mr. Farmer on the 30th, and he told me one of the Jacobses would not sign that—I asked him to sit down and make another proposal; he ultimately did so, the effect of which was that letters were to be substituted for the agreement—the application for the summonses to stand over was, I think, before I saw Mr. Farmer, but I am not clear about that—I have no memorandum as to that—the reason for the post<lb/>ponement was, partially, that the documents should be signed by the Jacobses, to give them an opportunity of carrying out the matter, not to get better evidence—I did not advise the defendants should be approached with the view of making evidence against them—they had already com<lb/>mitted the offence, and I wanted to give them an opportunity of com<lb/>pleting it, as well as to consider the evidence against Albert, and whether to proceed agninst him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, employed by Chinnery, Al-dridge and Co., solicitors—on November 13th I went to Mr. Aldridge's room, where I saw Mr. Farmer, Mr. William Aldridge, and Mr. Lionel Bebro—I heard Mr. Farmer say he had seen Mr. Morris Berlyn Jacobs, who declined to sign the agreement as submitted; that he was as artful as a waggon-load of monkeys, and had influenced his father and brother to carry out the matter in the following way:—" I am to sign a letter to you that in consideration of a sum of £1,000 cash and £15,000 in fully paid-up shares of the Bechuana-land Company, he would abstain from publishing any articles in the paper concerning your family or the company in which you were interested; further, that he would co-operate and assist in any scheme which your father would put before him; that letter to be sent by me and addressed to you," and that we were to meet Mr. Farmer and obtain a letter from the Jacobses embodying these terms—those two documents were to remain in his own possession—I think he said he further offered not to continue the attack—Mr. Aldridge suggested that. Mr. Farmer should sketch out the terms in writing, and handed him a sheet of paper for that purpose, when Mr. Farmer sketched it out—I then went out of the room in con-nection with other business—as I was going out of the door Mr. Aldridge said to me in an audible whisper, "Mind you get copie?"—when Mr. Farmer had finished drawing out the letters, turn<lb/>ing to Mr. Lionel Bebro, he said he would see the Jacoboes, and come round any time that would be convenient—Lionel said, "I will see you at my office at half-pass on?"—after some further con-versation Mr. Farmer went away—he did not hand me the copies—at half-past one I went to Mr. Bebro's office and waited; Mr. Farmer not coming, he was telephoned to, and I held one of the ear trumpets while the conversation was taking place—Lionel carried on the conversation through the telephone—he paid, "I expected to see you before now, Mr. Farmer?"—Mr. Farmer said, "After what has happened this morning, between you and me and the gate post, I am not coming to your office again; I can put two and two together, and I will have nothing more to do with the matte?"—that was telephoned a few minutes after two on the 13th—we had been waiting about half an hour—Mr. Farmer said, "You must come round, and see me by yourself without any third party being presen?"—I went with Lionel Bebro to Mr. Farmer's office immediately afterwards—Mr. Bebro went in first—I waited outside—when I went in Mr. Farmer said he was afraid to have anything more to do with the matter; he had heard the audible whisper, "Mind you get copies"; it seemed very funny—I told him Mr. Aldridge had given me directions—he said he did not care a damn for the others; they must look after them-selves; he was going to look after himself, and "I will tell you what I will do; I will get Mr. Jacobs across here any time, and you and he within these four walls can fix up the whole matter between you; I can attend on behalf of Mr. Jacobs, and you or Mr. Aldridge can attend on behalf of Mr. Bebr?"—he said they had auother offer we might safely take, and "I had a letter from them since I saw you this morning," and he pointed to a letter on the table—it was turned</p>

               <p>down, I could not read it—I knew the letter heading; it was from the Protection Agency; I do not know about the printing besides that—I arranged to go back at 3.45—as I was going he said, "You will be here, won't you? Jacobs is a nasty man to offend"—we went again at 3.45—I was shown into Mr. Farmer's room—I saw him in his private room—he said he would go over to Mr. Jacobs' place—that is at Finsbury Pave<lb/>ment—there are the names of two papers and the Agency on the door—when we went in Mr. Julius Jacobs came from behind the screen—Mr. Farmer told him who'we were—he took us outside that office, through a corridor, to another room, which I think adjoins the one we were in, although there appeared no connection—"No. 10" was on the door—there were four present—Mr. Farmer opened the conversation—he said, "I have brought these gentlemen to see if we cannot bury the hatchet between you?"—Mr. Bebro objected to the phrase about the hatchet, and said his father had not commenced the libels—Mr. Julius Jacobs said, "Don't call it libels; I can publish anything of public interest in any newspaper of min?"—Mr. Lionel Bebro said, "I presume you are Mr. Julius Jacobs?"—Mr. Jacobs said, "Yes"—Mr. Bebro said, "Is it true that your two sons authorised you to make the proposal to me that in consideration of £1,000 cash and £15,000 in fully paid<lb/>up shares, you would abstain from publishing articles concerning my father, his family, and the company that they were interested in, and would co-operate in any scheme which he would put before them?"—Mr. Julius Jacobs said, in answer to Mr. Bebro, that was quite true, and was proved by the fact that they had specially abstained from publishing matters in their last issue, although they had threatened to do so—that referred to the issue of the 11th—Mr. Bebro said, "Supposing we do not pay you this money?"—Mr. Jacobs said, "Well, as a matter of business, we shall have to continue the attacks, as they are worth from £10,000 to £15,000 to us, and we are being backed up by a rich member of Parliament and his brother, who are very bitter against you and your fathe?"—Mr. Lionel Bebro said, "If I pay this money, can I have an agreement by which I am to give the £15,000 shares?"—at first he said, "No, it is foolish to ask such a thing," then, looking at Mr. Farmer, Mr. Farmer said, "Yes," and Mr. Julius Jacobs said, "Very well, I will leave you to carry out the matter," and he instructed Mr. Farmer to draw out the agreement in that room—when Mr. Farmer had finished writing two letters, one was signed, and a letter was to be sent by Mr. Jacobs to Mr. Farmer—Mr. Jacobs would not sign the other, but said he would carry out the matter at Mr. Farmer's office—then we left the place—we went to Mr. Farmer's office about six p.m.—we were shown into Mr. Farmer's room—he immediately sat down and signed the letter—he also wrote out the receipt for the £500—he said he was going to send on the cheque and the certificates for the shares to Mr. Jacobs that night—at Mr. Jacobs's office, Mr. Jacobs left the room whilst Mr. Farmer was pre<lb/>paring the copies for signature—Mr. Farmer turned round from his work, and said to Mr. Lionel Jacobs, "I have known this man twenty years; you can trust your soul in his hand?"—the next day, Saturday, I went with young Bebro to Mr. Farmer's office—there was some question about the time; I think Mr. Farmer was to be at Mr. Bebro's office about twelve o'clock—I saw Mr. Farmer at his own office about one o'clock—Mr. Bebro</p>

               <p>asked for the production of the letter he had sent in before, which had been signed by Jacobs—Mr. Farmer said he had sent the agreement, with the cheque, to Mr. Jacobs last night (the 13th)—he suggested we should come round and see Mr. Jacobs sign the letter, and that would be more satisfactory—I then went with him to 76, Finsbury Pavement—Mr. Julius Jacobs came from behind the partition in the general office—I saw both the sons in the private room—one of them said, "Oh, here they are"—immediately the four of us arrived in No. 10 room Mr. Farmer beckoned to Mr. Jacobs, and both went out, but came back immediately afterwards together; they did not come to the point at first; then Mr. Jacobs said he would not sign the agreement until the cheque was paid, and "Mr. Farmer feels an objection to taking a cheque in a matter of this kind?"—a few minutes later he sent a messenger to the bank to see if the cheque was all right; he came back in a few minutes—Mr. Jacobs was asked to sign the agreement; he went out of the room—Mr. Farmer was out of the room also—Mr. Jacobs came back a second time, and again sent a messenger to the bank—we began to make excuses to go, because we knew the cheque would be stopped; and when the messenger came back we saw he was aware the cheque had been stopped—he was mad with rage; he danced about the room—he said, "That cheque has not been paid, and you know it"—then, when we tried to get out of the room, he locked the door—he said he had been put up to that by Harry Marks, and was laying a trap to catch us; he would have us one way or the other; it was a charge of conspiracy, to get some £500 to help him to provide a swindling company—young Bebro told him he knew he had tried to blackmail him in an outrageous manner, and because he found he had not succeeded in arrest<lb/>ing him, he had trumped up the charge—Mr. Farmer tapped at the door, and appeared very surprised to find it locked—Mr. Jacobs had called for a clerk, and sent for a policeman—Albert Jacobs also went for a police<lb/>man—when the police came, Jacobs asked Farmer whether he had applied for a warrant or summonses against us—we said, "Let us go, then?"—he appeared to have made up his mind to have us there and then arrested—Mr. Farmer came again into the room, and wanted to speak to me, but the policeman would not let him do so—the other policeman was not there then—we went to Kingsland Road Police Station—the inspector heard what was said, and would not take the charge—I said that Morris Berlyn Jacobs was the registered proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Financial Who's Who;</hi> it should have been the <hi rend="italic">Weekly Who's Who.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a lady shorthand clerk and typist at Farmer's office, 28, Austin Friars—I live at 15, Oxford Gardens, Netting Hill—before November 4th or 5th I had known Colonel McConkey, and I knew his voice—on November 5th I was rung up on the telephone—I replied, and heard McConkey's voice through the telephone—there is one instru<lb/>ment in the outer clerks' office, and also a private wire from the outer instrument into Farmer's private room—in consequence of what McConkey said, I endeavoured to switch the instrument in the outer room through to that in the inner room, but Farmer was engaged, and I could not do so, but after two or three attempts I was able to—I saw a diary of Farmer that afternoon—it was part of my duty to make an entry in the diary if an appointment was made, and Farmer, or any of the clerks, was away—I saw in the diary on that day, in Farmer's writing, under the date of Friday, November 6th, "10.15, Bebro"—from November 5th to the present time I have made no entries in Farmer's costs book with regard to attending upon the Jacobses at the Bebros'—I make the entries of costs.</p>

That entry in the diary is the only ink entry on that page—I think a clerk makes the entries, at the side, of the different hours before the day begins—I think the telephone incident took place about two, or a little after; after lunch, which I go to at one o'clock—I saw the entry in the diary subsequently, some time later in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in Farmer's employ, at 28, Austin Friars—the call-book kept at the office is divided into various divisions with a perforated edge, so that a slip may be torn off, leaving a counterfoil, and the slip and counterfoil bear corresponding numbers—a person calling to see Farmer would have his name entered on slip and counterfoil, and the slip would be taken in to Farmer—I was in charge of this book on the morning of Friday, November 6th—I find entered here in my writing on counterfoil 239, "Bebro seen by H. F. "; that stands for Farmer—it is the first entry on that day; that would imply he was the first caller that morning.</p>

About a quarter-past twelve on the morn<lb/>ing of January 5th I was on duty in the Whitechapel Road, opposite the London Hospital—I saw the prisoner, Wilkins, Hannah Wilkins, and another female now known as Jessie Phillips, all four in company, larking together, on the footpath—I saw their hands go up and close together, and immediately saw a flash, and heard the report of firearms—they were about ten yards from me—Wilkins wheeled round, and said, "I am sho?"—the prisoner was facing the road, and Wilkins was at his back—as soon as I heard the report I ran up and seized the prisoner from behind by both arms—Wilkins at that time was wheeling about the road, and he came up and struck the prisoner twice with his fist while I held him, saying at the time, "I have a great mind to lock you up'—I saw blood running from Wilkins' left hand at the time; another constable came up, and took him to the hospital—at the time I was holding the prisoner he said, "I don't know these people; I am a respectable man, coming along the road with my wife; it is that fellow running across the road; what do you want to hold me for?"—I said, "There is no one running across the road?"—at the time I heard the pistol go off there was no person, man or woman, there besides the four persons; I was the nearest person to them, and I kept my eye on them all the time—I took the prisoner to the station; he was detained until Hannah Wilkins came from the hospital; she made a statement in the prisoner's presence, which was taken down by Inspector Wells, and signed by her—the prisoner was then discharged—he was charged with shooting Alfred Wilkins, with intent to murder—he made no reply to the charge—I examined him; I found that his neck was very much discoloured by the powder, and his necktie and collar were singed on the left side (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I found this ball cartridge in his right waistcoat pocket—I saw Hannah Wilkins at the station—I saw the other woman at the time I ran up; she was close to the prisoner—I have not</p>

I live at Gale's Gardens, Stepney Green Road—I do not know the prisoner—he might have been there on the night of January 5th, but I would not swear to that; I was intoxicated at the time—I was going home that night with my wife in Whitechapel Road—we came to a place called Bakers' Row, and there was a man there that I had had a quarrel with on the previous Friday; indeed, there were two men, there might have been three, and a woman, to the best of my recollection—I asked him what he meant by kicking my wife on the previous Friday—he was not the prisoner—I had a stand-up fight with him and his friend—I had the best of it—he said, "I have been looking for you," and I said, "I have been looking for you?"—he said, "Come up here?"—he had a couple of friends with him—I walked along the road, to the best of my recollection, towards Mile End Gate, and two or three of them kept dodging and crossing, and some women as well, and there was jangling as we went along, and I got shot, and was taken to the hospital—I have no further recollection—I can<lb/>not describe the position we were in; I was shot in a finger of my left hand; I did not know that I was shot at the time; I heard the shot and I felt a kind of numbing pain in my left hand; I have no idea of what was going on at the time—I know he wanted me to fight; I don't know how far he was from me; I was the worse for liquor—after I was shot they tell me that I hit him, and I suppose I did; I don't recollect what I hit him with—I remember being taken to the hospital, and seeing a doctor; nobody came that same night to take a statement from me; that might have been two or three days afterwards; two inspectors came and took a statement from me, which I signed; and I will say now, as I did then, that the man that shot me I could pick out of a hundred men; I am not going to say that this man is the man—I know a man called Don; I have known him two years; I don't know the name of Donovan, I only know him by the name of Don; he is the man that shot me—I don't believe myself that this is the man; I was confused at the time—I really don't know what I was doing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, and live at Hackney Wick—on the night of January 5th I was in Whitechapel Road, outside the London Hospital, with a stall that I keep there—I noticed some persons who passed by my stall; they were the prisoner, Wilkins, his wife, and another young woman who is outside the Court now, I don't know her name—they were a rowing and jangling, and when they got by the stall about twenty yards, I heard a shot—the prisoner threatened to use a revolver, I talieve, but I did not see any revolver—he said he would blow his brains out—I ran up, and the police had hold of the prisoner—I said to the prosecutor, "Go to the hospital, old chap; I will go with yo?"—the prisoner said to the policeman, "Don't take my money away"; the policeman was feeling his pockets—I did not say anything to the prisoner when the policeman had hold of him, not that I recollect—there were two women there when I got up, dodging about, backwards and forwards—at the time the shot was fired I was not looking in that direction; I looked directly I heard the shot—I don't think there was any other person there besides the four I have spoken of; I did not see any man running across the road.</p>

I am a medical practitioner, of 11, Portland Road West—on February 5th I examined the prosecutrix at Netting Dale Police Station about one p.m.—she had an incised wound half an inch on the back of the left side of the top of her head, penetrating to the bone, and a bruise on her forehead over her right eye—the wound on the head could have been caused by a knife like this—the blow need not have been violent—the knife is not very sharp—the woman was not in danger from the wound itself—there was a good deal of blood in her hair.</p>

                  </hi>. I am joint managing director of Batey and Co., Limited, mineral water manufacturers, an Munster Road, Fulham, and other places—fifty-six van travellers are employed at the Fulham factory during the season, not so many in the winter—each traveller has a separate round assigned to him, with a list of customers for that round, and it is his duty to call only on the customers on his round; he takes out each morning what quantity of various kinds of mineral waters he thinks necessary—he orders them overnight, and in the morning his van is loaded, and an account is taken of what is put on his van in the out-book, which is kept in duplicate with carbon paper; one duplicate is left in the book, and one ed to the traveller—the mineral waters, and also the bottles and taxes, are debited to him, except patent boxes and beer boxes—on each dozen pint boxes 3d. is charged, and on each two dozen pint boxes 6d.—nothing is charged on the two dozen half-pint boxes—the bottles are charged 6d. a dozen pints, 3d. a dozen half-pints—when the traveller sells goods to a customer he charges him that amount of deposit on boxes and bottles, and the amount for the goods—we conduct our business on the cash principle; there are very few exceptions—the travellers duty is also to collect the empties from the customers to whom they had been delivered, and give them credit for them; and so the customers over as many empties as possible to save their pockets—there is a very considerable loss of bottles and boxes; they get broken, lost, and used for improper purposes—in the evening the travellers come back to the yard, bringing unsold <hi rend="italic">fulls</hi> and collected empties—the various kinds of empties are delivered at different doors for convenience in washing and storing—Farmer was a checker employed at a door at which pint and half-pint bottles and the boxes were received—that was his main business—he came to us as a commissionaire, at 35s. a week—the vans draw up a little way from Farmer's door, so that the tail-board or the side of the van was convenient to the shoot, which runs from the van to the door—the shoot is automatic, and consists of two parallel iron girders with iron wheels along their length", and one box is placed on at a time and runs into the warehouse—it is not possible to put more than one box on at a time, except that you can put one on top of another; you cannot put them side by side—it was Farmer's business to examine each box for the number of bottles, and to examine each bottle for the name on the bottle, and each stopper for the name on the stopper, so that we got only those lettered in our own name; then he would enter the details in the home book and hand the counterpart to the traveller, and keep the duplicate—he should enter the numbers of gross, dozen and single bottles, and the number of chargeable deposit boxes—a traveller would receive a similar ticket at the other doors for different kinds of empties and bottles; they are really credit notes—the <hi rend="italic">fulls</hi> he brings back are checked and credited to the traveller, but remain on the van, and are again charged to him in the morning, when he starts a fresh account—with the tickets from each unloading door, and his ticket for <hi rend="italic">fulls</hi> brought back, the traveller goes to the office, and Sibley, the cashier, adds up the—total of the credits, which is deducted from the value of the goods debited to</p>

               <p>him in the morning—he gets credit for what he brings back as against the debit for what he has taken out—he pays overnight—if credit is given to an authorised credit customer, the customer's receipt counts as money; there are very few—Worsfold was a van traveller in our employ—his number was 43—he was in receipt of 10s. a week, and commission calcu<lb/>lated on the sales, and on the empty bottles brought home by him—there were different rates for different bottles—he Mould earn, according to the weather, from 35s. to 45s. or 50s. a week—lust October we found an un<lb/>due proportion of emptier coming back, and referred to our figures, and found that we were apparently receiving an unduly large number of empty buttles, very much in excess of those that went out—Murray, the yard foreman, made a communication to me a few days before November 28th—I had given instructions to Murray a day or two before the 28th—on the morning of November 30th Murray made a report to me, and I com<lb/>municated with our solicitors.</p>

               <p>immediately inside or outside the door—Farmer does not make an entry of each case that comes down; he enters up the total that has come off each van—he stands and looks at each box as it comes down, and he calls out the bottles in dozens, two, four, six, eight, ten, and so on, for the benent of himself and the traveller—when he has finished the van, he puts the total down in his book, and, leaving one duplicate in the book, he hands the other to the traveller before he starts another van—Murray is yard foreman—on November 28th we had about fifty-one van travellers—since this inquiry began we have discharged about five or six van foremen, not including the prisoner—I cannot say if we have discharged four van travellers—we have not broken Murray for drunkenness, nor reduced him; he is still yard foreman—I have only had complaint, since this case, of very trivial matters about Murray—he mis<lb/>laid the keys on one occasion—we have put some new lights in the yard, on the other side, since this case, but not in consequence of it—Murray's office in the yard is a movable box, but it cannot be moved—it is about 15ft. away from the shoot where Farmer stood—it is like a builder's box with a window—van travellers are not paid by time; it is to their in<lb/>terest to discharge their goods, and get off; there is no fixed time for them to come—Worsfold had one of the heaviest and best rounds in the busi<lb/>ness—our estimate of 6,000 or 7,000 Cross of breakages a year does not appear in our profit and loss account—Murray is now yard foreman, in the same position as before—he is not unloading foreman, although he sometimes takes a door; he ranks next under Pitt, who is, and was, the head man in the yard—Murray was never yard manager; he occupies the same position now as he did on November 28th, and gets the same wages—Pitt is manager, and Murray is his assistant.</p>

Farmer came into our employ in the first week in July—we accepted Farmer's discharges, and the recom<lb/>mendation of his colonel, as coming from the Corps of Commissionaires, as placing him above suspicion—his discharges showed he had been in the Army twenty-one years, and everything was satisfactory his colonel gave him a high character; there was no blemish on it, from a hat I could under<lb/>stand—he had been a lance-sergeant—he came to us in July, while he was on furlough; his discharge dates from August—he had a sergeant's pension—we made him check foreman at 35s. a week—he was supposed to stand at the door, strictly, inside—it is rather a cumbersome job to get the boxes off the van on to the shoot; the men are not very quick over it—it would take about four or five minutes to unload one-fifth of forty boxes, I should say; it depends how the boxes are placed—the travellers are anxious to get their vans unloaded, so that they can get away; but they cannot go fast, because of the counting and checking of every bottle before it leaves the shoot—every bottle is looked at, but not taken out; there is a mark ou the shoulder of each bottle, and on the stopper—we get a certain percentage of bottles other than our own; the quantity varies very much, it is very small—we send them to their owners from our Kingsland place—it is Murray's duty to send them away—they would not be proper things for him to sell—I cannot say if Farmer checked the stock when he first came there; I think he did—there was no check on him—I believe Murray went to my office, in my absence, on November 28th, about 7.30, I believe—I was there up to about six.</p>

Batey and Co.'s employment for about seven years—on November 28th I was yard foreman—before that, up to about July, I had been loading and unloading foreman—it is the duty of the yard foreman to see that the vans drive up and unload in a proper manner—Farmer was employed at the door where the middle shoot was, and received bottles and boxes—a van traveller drives up to a shoot, puts boxes on to it one by one, and so they pass along—there is an interval between ihe boxes, because the foreman has to examine the box to see it contains no strange bottles; he calls out the number as he passes them, loud enough for the driver to hear—when dealing with a dozen pints he would call out one dozen at a time—when all the empties for that door are transferred to him, he makes out a ticket in the home ticket-book for the amount he has received—the shoot is constructed to take the widest and the narrowest boxes—I never saw more than one put on at a time by the driver; the unloading foreman</p>

               <p>might, if the shoot got blocked, put—one on top of another—about a week before November 28th I was in the yard, and I noticed Farmer receiving and checking some pints off a driver's van, and he made a slip in the counting—he received ten dozen and four, and he counted it as eleven dozen and six—when he had done the load, the driver told Farmer, "The last box you put down was eleven dozen and six," and Farmer immediately agreed with the driver, instead of disputing it—I had heard him count ten dozon and four, and the driver claimed eleven dozen and six, and Farmer allowed it—I said to Farmer, "No; your original count was all ligh?"—he im<lb/>mediately agreed with me, and allowed ten dozen and four—I mentioned what I had seen to Mr. Alabaster, and received instructions from him—on November 28th I was on duty in the yard—the vans begin to come in at about 3.30, and go on till seven or eight—I was on duty during that time till eight—Farmer was on duty at his door that night—I use the box in the yard as a kind of office—it has a small window looking towards the shoot at Farmer's door—there is a gas lamp and small gas stove in the office—when vans were coming in on the 28th I watched the unloading at Farmer's door—I know Worsfold—he was a van traveller on round No. 43—when he drove up on that night, at about 5.45, I was outside the office at the corner; it was dark—I could see what was going down the shoot; I was five yards from it; it was the shoot next the box—I saw Farmer receiving bottles and boxes from Worsfold in the usual way—I could count the boxes as they were put on the shoot—no box was put on top of another; only one box was put on the shoot at the time, and there was the usual interval between one box and another for the examination of the bottles—I made a memorandum at the time of the bottles that Worsfold put on the shoot—Farmer received twenty<lb/>six pint boxes, hold<lb/>ing one dozen bottles each, and one patent box, holding two dozen, assuming each box was full—that represented two Cross and four dozen bottles—threepence a box is allowed on deposit boxes, and nothing on the patent boxes, so that the allowance for boxes would be 6s. 6d.—the allowance on the bottles would be sixpence a dozen, which came to 14s., so that the total credit to Worsfold on that night for what he passed in was £1 0s. 6d.—two or three minutes before Worsfold's van came in that night I had checked the counting of Cosford's van—he is a van traveller, in a similar capacity to Worsfold, on round 23—he unloaded eighteen pint deposit boxes—I was outside the box, in the same place as I checked Worsfold's from—Cosford's boxes repre<lb/>sented one Cross and six dozen, and his credit would be 9s. on the bottles and 4s. 6d. on the boxes, amounting to 13s. 6d.—I checked four other van travellers (six altogether) outside the box, and then went into my box—the gas in the box was out, and the gas in the stove was turned down, giving sufficient light to show figures—from inside the box I could see the shoot through the window just as well as I could outside, and I was the same distance, five yards, from it—I could not see Farmer's door without turning ray neck and head, but the window was right opposite the middle of the shoot—I saw Churchley unload two gross and two dozen of half-pints in thirteen boxes (no charge is made on those) and four pint; deposit boxes—he would be entitled on the half-pint bottles to 6s. 6d., and 2s. on the pint bottles, and 1s. for the boxes, making his total credit 9s. 6d.—I checked other vans that night—on the morning of</p>

I am yard foreman now, as I was in November—Mr. Pitt, the manager, is my immediate superior; he is in the firm's service now—he was in the yard on November 28th—I have no doubt he was in the yard keeping observation when I made this count—I see him every night in the yard—he was in the yard, to my knowledge, on the night of November 28th—I saw him after I took this note—I spoke to him after I saw the unloading, not after I took the note; he is here—the van traveller is the driver—in some cases there is a van-boy; every driver does not have one—I think Worsfold always had one, I could not swear—I cannot recollect if he had one on November 28th—they pick up a van-boy outside sometimes—Farmer called out, in the hearing of the travellers and van-boys, what numbers went down the shoot—there is a light in the yard outside the building between the two shoots—there is a wooden box immediately under the lamp, and a reflector at the back of it—there is a second light immediately inside—there is a light inside each door—I swear it was not a wet night on the 28th—I made all the entries on this paper the same night—these figures, 236, in metallic pencil, have nothing to do with it; I could not say when they were made—very likely it would be on the paper before I began to make my memoranda—the first part of my memoranda I made outside, and the latter part inside my office—those I counted outside I noted outside, and those I counted inside I noted inside—the bottles were empty; full bottles are never unloaded there—I could not tell from my observation whether the boxes were full or not—there is nothing to prevent boxes being put on the top of one another and sent down the shoot, only that the foreman cannot check them—it was not done, and never is—only one box can be put on the shoot at a time—I did not keep watch on the 29th or 30th—I do not know that on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday observation was kept on the prisoners, and not a single bottle found to be wrong—on the Thursday the prisoners were discharged—outside and in the rear of these premises, in Minister Road, Fulham, there is a plot of ground which has been an orchard, and upon which they are building—I believe it is easy for people to climb up from the orchard over our walls and into the yard—inside the office is a desk—I looked through the window, turned round, made an entry by the light of the gas-stove, and then turned and looked through the window again at 5.45 on a dark November night, with the lights I have described—I was not mistaken—it was a rule that if anything was wrong in a man's account on Monday, he would not be allowed to go out on Tuesday till it was cleared up; but I have nothing to do with that.</p>

I am a widow—I have been living with the prisoner for six years—on Sunday, December 20th, we were living at 15, Tower Street, Hackney—I have a boy named Albert, aged about fourteen, and three others, the eldest being three years and nine months—about ten that night I and my three children were in bed—the prisoner was out; about ten minutes past ten I heard him coining up the stairs—he tried to open the front bedroom door; I was in the back bedroom—I asked him if I should open the door for him—he said, "Yes, if you lik?"—I had not slept with him the night before—he helped to open the door—he was</p>

I am an inmate of the Strand Union Workhouse at Edmonton—on Sunday, January 24th, about a quarter-past four, I was in the young man's hall at the union; the prisoner was there, and others—he was talking about imprisonment and penal servitude, and said he was going out; he had given his discharge for Monday morning; he had done eight, and seven for using a knife on board ship; that the last fire was not much of a one, but there might be a bigger one yet, before he went out—there had been a fire in the store-shed, and he spoke about having revenge on the <hi rend="italic">two joints</hi>, meaning the two labour-masters—later in the afternoon, about twenty-five minutes to six, I saw him going in the direction of the store-shed; I was behind him, and afterwards I saw him going up the stairs, and I saw the labour-master coming down with a hose—an alarm of fire had been given—I slept in the same dormitory with the Prisoner—about half-past ten that night I heard one of the masters say to the witness Kelly, "Get up?"—the prisoner turned round on his side and said, "Are you going to <hi rend="italic">copper?"</hi>

At 11.55 p.m. on January 22nd, in consequence of information received, I went to 45, Sydenham Terrace, St. John's Wood—I found a quantity of paraffin oil and broken crockery on the staircase, and oil on the stair rail—from what I was told, I searched, for the prisoner—all the stairs were scorched, and about five feet of the staircase wall, leading from the first to the second floor—failing to find the prisoner in the house, I found a trap-door leading to the roof, and, accompanied by a constable, got on the roof; there were two or three inches of snow on the roof, and it was very slippery—we searched the roofs of the fourteen houses in the block; then we searched the interior of several houses—I was compelled to call up several persons to do so—while searching No. 29, I heard some person scream in No. 31—I rushed up, and found Constable Waring with the prisoner, between the ceiling of the top floor at the roof—I took him into custody; several persons rushed into the house, and the prisoner said, "I will go quietly?"—in the street he said, "Is the house burnt?"—I took him to the station—he was charged with wilfully and maliciously setting fire to a dwelling-house, several persons being therein at the time—he made no reply to the charge—I afterwards inspected the house, and found the damage I stated—it is not very great.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was very excited and nervous—he was threatened with violence, and I had some difficulty in getting him to the station—he is a Bohemian—he speaks English fairly well—he was cross<lb/>examined at the Police-court, and made a statement—he was a very hard<lb/>working man, in respectable employment, at about two guineas a week—the wife told me he had been a good husband in every respect, except his violent temper—she had not been living with him for two or three days—she had left him.</p>

I lived in the kitchen at 45, Sydenham Terrace when this tire took place—I am a gilder—the house was let out separately in apartments—a man, his wife, and children occupied the parlours and first floor back, an old gentleman and lady the first floor, and the prisoner, his wife and child the second floor—on January 22nd, Hard<lb/>ing came to help me move a box belonging to Mrs. Cernik from the first floor—she is my wife's sister—I believe the box had boen moved from the second to the first floor by the mother a day or two before—when I got on the landing I heard the prisoner say, "What you do with my things?"—as we were about to bring the box down my friend was struck on the nose or in the face—I thought it advisable to come down, when things were coming down one after the other.</p>

When I arrived at 45, Sydenham Terrace, at 11.30, Harding complained of being assaulted—inconsequence of what he said I went into the house with him and upstairs—I saw the prisoner standing on the top landing—he threw a piece of coal, which struck me on the shoulder—then he said, "You don't come up here?"—I said, "I am a police constable: I want to speak to yo?"—I made a second attempt to go up to him—he threw this paraffin lamp, lighted, which struck me on the shoulder—it was extinguished as it came down; then he emptied paraffin from a two-gallon can on the staircase, took a match, lit a piece of paper, and set fire to it—he said, "I will set fire to the plac?"—the paraffin caught fire and set light to the staircase—I then saw the</p>

At a quarter to twelve by my clock I heard someone open the door downstairs, I got up, and saw a light downstairs, and saw lodgers on the landing. On the first floor I saw a box on a man's shoulder, going downstairs. I saw several things on the floor. I said, 'Fred, what are you doing with my things? If you don't leave it alone I will burn you.' My wife said, 'All right.' I went and put my things on. I could not find any matches, and did not get a light. I looked down again, and saw no one there. I said, 'Leave the things alone, and keep quiet in the house. They went for a policeman. I went to my front window, and waited till the policeman came. I said to the police<lb/>man, 'Do not let the people in; they want to take my things.' I told him to keep order; if they wanted anything they should come to-morrow morning. I said, 'If you do not do that, I am ready with my knife; I will burn the house and myself.' They all came into the house, so I took the paraffin, about a pint, and put it on the stairs. I said, 'If you don't keep quiet, I will fire it.' I took a piece of paper and a candle, and lighted the paper; I put my feet on the paper, and put it out. I saw the witness Harding on the stairs, and I threw a jug of water over him. He said, 'You b——b——, I'll show you.' I took a poker, and struck him with it. I heard a voice say, 'I want to speak to you.' I said, 'What do you want?'He said, 'I am a policeman.' I lighted the paper again,"</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Dawe's Discount Company, Limited, 11 and 12, Clement's Lane—on September 26th I received this letter—I sent an answer, and got this letter of September 29th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "I now enclose two acceptances; if you can do these for me satisfactorily, write, and I will call and endorse them.") This bill was enclosed in that letter—I returned the prisoner's two bills, which is a rule when we don't keep them—I then received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated September 29th, and asking for an answer about the two acceptances.</hi>) I had made inquiries about Blackwood and Co., and, being satisfied, I said that I would do it for £64, as it was an ordinary trade bill, and I drew this cheque for £62 18s. 2d.—he took it, and made no complaint—I then got this letter of October 9th. (<hi rend="italic">Thanking him for the discount, and stating that</hi> 15 <hi rend="italic">percent, would be a prohibitory price in future.</hi>) I kept the bill, up to the full date—on October 23rd I got this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he called last Monday</hi> re <hi rend="italic">Barton's acceptance</hi>, £71 3s. 6d., <hi rend="italic">which he understood was satisfactory, and asking for a cheque next morning.</hi>) On December 5th the bill became due, and it was returned dishonoured, and noted—this is the prisoner's answer: "December 5th, 1896. Dear Sir,—We are in receipt of yours. Messrs. Black wood's acceptance has been dishonoured. If you will wait till Monday I will call and take it up?"—he called on me on December 5th; and said, "I am Blackwood and Co?"—I declined to discuss the matter further, and wrote to the solicitor next day to withdraw the writ—I sued both the prisoner and Blackwood and Co.—the prisoner was both drawer and endorser of the bill—on December 17th I learned for the first time who was the drawer and endorser; after that the matter was left in the solicitor's hands—when I parted with the cheque for £16 19s. 2d. I believed the signature of Blackwood to be genuine—I would not have, discounted it if I had known Blackwood and Co. was E. S. Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have an average memory—Day said that it was an ordinary trade bill, to the best of my recollection—I think I used the word "ordinary" before the Lord Mayor; I will pledge myself that he used the words "trade bill?"—Mr. Burchett is the book-keeper; it is possi<lb/>ble that Day may have said, "I have called about the two bills you have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189702080075"/>
               <p>under consideration?"—I did not say, "Oh, I have passed those on to Mr. Birt?"—I may have said, "You must see him; he will report about Black<lb/>wood?"—whatever subsequently occurred was not between Day and Birt—I remember the word "ordinary?"—we have no call book—I think it was December 17th when he told me that he was Black wood; it was the day of writing the letter, I think—we wrote to him, "If the money is not paid by twelve o'clock to-morrow, we shall place the matter in the hands of Mr. Newton, of Great Marlborough Stree?"—I am bound by his letter; I am not content—I admit that it was written on behalf of the Limited Company—the prisoner is a Frenchman, and did not understand; he would understand the meaning of the English language: he was suf<lb/>ficiently paramount then to write a letter for the company without instruc<lb/>tions from anybody—first of all civil proceedings were adopted, and discontinued when I found he was deceiving me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a publisher, of Beechfold, Barnsbury—the prisoner came to my place of business, and gave his name Ernest S. Day, and said, "Somebody has written to you about m?"—that was Scasey—there was a negotiation about the sale of my business—the price was £3,000, £400 down and bills of £100 each on the 16th of each month—the £400 was paid on July 6th, between four and five o'clock—the first bill became due on August 16th, and was met a day or two afterwards—the next was due on September 16th, and was not met, but he gave me a cheque for £41 on September 29th, and the balance in bills—the cheque was paid, but one of the bills was bad—the next came due on October 16th, and he paid me a cheque for £4 14s. 5d. and other bills to make up the amount—one of them is not due yet—the bill of November 16th was not met, nor were any of the others—besides the £400, I received the bill of £100, and the £41, and the balance of the third bill, £4 14s. 5d.—he said that the business was to be carried on in the name of James Blackwood and Co., as before; he wanted to be known as Ernest J. Day—I learned that his name is Southgate.</p>

He told me he was going to conduct the business in the name of Ernest Southgate, but I objected; he told me if it was known by other publishers, he might not be able, as Day, to do business with other houses on the Continent with whom he was dealing—I gave no authority to anybody to accept that bill—I know the writing of the acceptance; it is drawn by Day, and accepted by him as Blackwood and Co.; I know them, because I have seen him write both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> In the agreement the defendant was to have the right to use the name of J. Blackwood and Co. in the business; he was to have the plant, copper plate, etc.—I made inquiries about July last; they were very favourable, and I then carried the negotiations further; Mr. Casey first opened these negotiations with me—I introduced Day to the City Bank; I wished him to open an account.</p>

I live at 46, Doddington Grove, Kenning<lb/>ton Park, and am a builder's manager—in the early morning of Thursday, January 28th, I was walking home up Kennington Park Road, smoking a pipe, and with my hands in my pockets—I was about sixty yards from my turning when I was seized by the throat from behind with a hand, and then from the front I was struck on the mouth, and my pipe was knocked out of my mouth, and my teeth broken, and I had another blow under the ear, and my trousers pockets were rifled, and turned inside out—they then struck me on the jaw, and knocked me down—in the struggle my hat and the hat of one of the men were knocked off—one of the men ran about three yards, and picked up a hat—I got up, and picked up a hat, and ran after them—both the men ran in the same direction, towards the Elephant and Castle—they turned up a passage by a public-house, and I dared not go up there—eight or nine fellows were there—I found the hat I had picked up was not mine; it was two or three sizes too small—I identify both prisoners—Johnson was the man who turned my pockets out, and Parsons was the man behind me—I saw their faces—I next saw my hat on the Saturday morning at the Police-court—I there picked the prisoners out from among other men, at once—I have no doubt in my own mind about their being the men who attacked me.</p>

I am a postman, of 15, Ray burn Street, Brixton—on Friday, January 29th, at 12.45 a.m., in Kennington Park Road, I heard a man call "Oh!" and I saw the prisoners walking from the direction of the man—they crossed the road, and I lost sight of them for a minute—I believe the prisoners are the same men—I followed them for three minutes—I did not see their faces very well; it was very dark, but the prisoners are about the stature and description of the men; they were wearing caps.</p>

I live in a turning out of Mason Street, Old Kent Road; I don't know the name of the turning—I am a water-side labourer—you are my son—you are nearly nineteen—you live with us—we occupy two rooms in the Peabody Buildings—on Wednesday night, January 27th, you came home between eleven and twelve—we live nearly two miles from Kennington Park Road—I was in bed when you came home—you had supper, and went to bed—you sleep in the same room as I do—I get home about five, and have tea and a smoke—I don't go out, as a rule, once in a fortnight—my daughter comes home between ten and eleven.</p>
