On September 23rd, about 3.30 p.m., I went with Sergeant Grey and Lawrence to 44, Pannett Street, Commercial Road—the street-door was open, and I saw the prisoner Anderson—I went up to the first-floor front room with one of the officers, and Grey brought Anderson up—the other two prisoners were in the room, and I told them we were police-officers, and suspected them of making base coin—they said nothing—we searched and found 20 counterfeit florins in an earthenware basin on the sideboard—I also fvund some hot metal, some antimony, copper wire, a portion of a battery, whiting, and files, and all the stock-in-trade of a coiner; also some glass, with the impression of coins on it—I said, "To save trouble, tell me where the mould is"—Jackson said, "Have not you b——s got enough?"—she became very violent in her language and actions—they were all taken to the station and charged, and made no reply—I returned to the room, and in a cup-board found this mould wrapped up behind a loose brick—I returned to-the station, and told them I had found it—Anderson said, "I hope you are satisfied"—Turner said, "It is a b——y shame you did not find £100."</p>

I am an oil and colour merchant, of 26, Newcastle Street, Strand—on September 20th I left the premises at 8,30 p. m.—I locked the front door—there was about two shillings' worth of q. coppers in the till, and three three-penny pieces—I went there at 9 a.m. r. next morning, and found the place in confusion; all the drawers were s. turned out, the till was on the counter, and the contents gone, and a t. large bowl which we keep coppers in was filled with the liquor from a u. bottle of pickles—this tin of salmon, these tools, these powders, and a v. bottle of rat poison (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)were taken—I went Co Bow Street Station.</p>

I am the deputy at the common lodging-house at 1 and 2, St. Mary's Buildings, Wych Street, Strand, called Waterloo Chambers—I Know the prisoner as a lodger—on the nights of Wednesday and Thursday, September 20th and 21st, I saw him in the kitchen shortly after midnight; he did not pay for his lodging then—the lodgers who are going to stay the night have to pay for their lodging before they go to their rooms—I said to the lodgers, "Those who have paid for their beds go upstairs, and those who have not get outside"—the prisoner went up<lb/>stairs—I stopped in the kitchen to see them all out—the prisoner was not entitled to stay in the lodging-house, because he had not paid—I next saw him next morning, about 9 o'clock, in his room; I was with the inspector—I heard the prisoner tell the inspector that he had come in at 12 o'clock the night before—I told him he was telling an untruth—I found these articles on the roof of my room, which is on the ground floor; it has a skylight—I sleep there when I stay the night—the door has an ordinary latch—it can be opened from the inside—when I went into my room I found marks on the bed, and a suit of clothes had gone—the sky-light had been opened—a pane of glass had been taken out—I had left the room shortly after 1 a.m. the night before—I saw the prisoner produce a number of coppers—his boot exactly corresponded with the marks on the bed—I have not got the sheet with the marks on it now.</p>

               <p>received a second message, and, in consequence, I went to the prisoner's room on the second floor, at 95, Shaftesbury Avenue, where I saw the body of a child on a bed, dressed, and prepared for its coffin—I listened to its heart and lungs; there was no sign of life—the body was warm; roughly, the child had been dead about two hours—I arrived there at 8.15; the prisoner was present, his wife and Mrs. Singer—I said I could not give a certificate, as the child had not been seen by me alive—I had come out only half dressed, and I told them I would return later—I went home, and returned between 10 and 10.15—the child was still on the bed; they had laid two cloths over it—the prisoner and the two little girls were in the room then—I asked the father to undress the child—he did so after completing the toilet he was then performing—I then made a complete external examination of the child's body—I found there was over the left eye and cheek a big bruise—it extended right over the cheek<lb/>bone and over the two eyelids—I formed the opinion that it had been inflicted within two days—over the breast-bone there was an abra sion—that might have been caused by the child itself—on the inner side of the right thigh, above the knee, I saw two marks—it looked as if the child had been gripped by the fingers—I think the injury had been in<lb/>flicted about a day—there were three bruises on the highest part of the forehead, and another bruise about 1 in. behind the front limit of the hair—they were old injuries—there were some injuries on the right upper arm and right hand—on the left lower arm and left hand there were bruises—they might have been caused anywhere between one and three days—they were probably caused by one blow for each bruise—I examined the buttocks of the child—on the upper part of the right buttock there were six cuts into the skin, about 3 in. or 4 in. long—they looked to me as if they had been caused by a thin cane or whip, or the ribs of an umbrella—on the left buttock there were two. bruises parallel to each other, each about 1 in. long, caused, probably, by a broader stick or cane—each might have been caused by a single, blow—they might have been caused anywhere within 48 hours—there was a bruise on the right ankle, caused, I should say, by a blow; it might have been done a day or two before—there was a large bruise over the left ribs about the size of the palm of a man's hand; it was quite recent; within four hours, I should say—from my examination, I took the ribs to be fractured—on the vertex of the skull I found a large bruise, and on the back of the skull, slightly to the right side, there was another bruise—. the one on the top of the skull was the larger—they were quite recent, a few hours—there were other signs of bruises and abrasions—I think the bruise over the left ribs was inflicted during life, and also the ones on the skull—the bruise over the ribs was probably caused within a few minutes of death, and the ones on the head within a few hours of death—while I was examining the child the prisoner was standing over me; he could see what I was doing—I called his attention to the bruises I discovered then—he said they were caused by the child falling out of bed, and his ex planation of the marks on the breast-bone was that the child had scratched itself—his wife was present during the first examination at 8 o'clock, but not at 10.15—she told me in the prisoner's hearing that the child had been weak ever since its birth, and had been specially is for about three days, during</p>

               <p>which time the child had had no doctor, as they thought the illness was due to teething; that the child had been brought from France six weeks before September 14th, when it had six teeth, now it had 12; that during its illness the child had vomited, and had coughed; Dr. Mitehell, the Divisional-Sur geon, was present when I made my subsequent examination, which was about 8 p.m. of the same day—I noticed the child was well nourished—on opening the chest I noticed the ribs were unnaturally movable—the heart was normal except for a clot in the right ventricle, and I afterwards found worms—the clot had nothing to do with the child's death—I found the lung was adhering to the eighth and ninth ribs; the left lung was lacerated, corre sponding to the ninth rib; on the left side of the chest the ribs were broken from the fourth to the ninth, inclusive, each being broken in two places while the cartilages were intact; there was also congestion of the base of the left lung; it bad nothing to do with the cause of death, in my opinion—the child had had bronchitis and pleurisy, the pleurisy being on the left side—the fractured ribs corresponded to the bruises on the left side—on the right side the ribs from the fourth to the twelth, inclusive, were broken, each in one place; the right lung was congested at the base; there were signs of bronchitis; there was no external bruise on the right side—the weight of the body was 14 1/2 lb.; the mother said its age was two and a<lb/>half years—the normal weight of a child of two and a<lb/>half years would be 23 lb. to 25 lb.—the cause of death was due to shock following these injuries to the ribs and lung—the injuries to the ribs on one side would have been quite enough, but both sides may be taken in—the left side would have been quite enough, where the injury to the lung was—a childof this age would lose consciousness almost at once upon receiving the injuries on the left side, at the outside I should say two minutes, and it would most probably have died within three or four minutes, at the outside seven minutes—they must have been inflicted with very extreme force—the violence was done over the bruise on the left side—the fracture of the ribs on the right side was probably occasioned by counter<lb/>pressure against an unyielding object,. like an uncarpeted boarded floor—I do not think the injuries could have been caused while the child was on a bed; the bed would have been too yielding—mere pressure might have caused the fracture, but it would not have caused the bruise over the ribs—the bruise might have been done by a blow or a kick—the lines of fracture on the ribs were about 1 1/2 in. or 2 in.—I take it, all in all, that the child's death was due to violence, which was done to the child while alive by some other person—I noticed that there were two beds in the room—the height of the bed in which the child was supposed to have slept was 22in.—in my opinion, it was not possible for the child to have inflicted those injuries by a fall out of that bed—I cannot say that I noticed that the room was uncarpeted, or that some nails were protruding; I will take it as a fact that there were—I see on this plan that the nails protrude from 1/16 in. to 1/32 in., and the places are 2 in. at the nearest, and 5 in. at the farthest part—the injuries to the buttocks could not have been caused by the child falling on the floor—the stripes on the buttocks were only 1/2 in to 2/3 in. apart—they were parallel, except one of them, and that branched. off from a previous scratch—the nails are said to be 2 in. apart, and a child would not move to one side and scratch itself again probably—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230023"/>
               <p>the scratches ranged from 3 in. to 4 in. in length on the right buttock—the area of the six were within an area of about 3 in., at the outside 3 1/2 in.—on the left the area was about 1/2 in. to 2/3 in.—after the injuries had been received to the skull the child would not cry out or scream—it would pro bably lose consciousness—the child could not move itself after receiving the injuries to the ribs—I think the bruise over the left breast was about 3 in. back from the breast-bone—about two teaspoonfuls of blood were effused in connection with the fracture of the ribs on the left side—the cuts on the left buttock were just deep enough to cause a little effusion of blood—a few hours after I had made my <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> Dr. Mitchell called on me, and he went and examined the body, and I took down his notes as he dictated them—it was practically a separate examination, and at a. different hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was admitted to the profession in January of this year—I started practice almost immediately—I have been in practice be tween eight and nine months—that is the whole of my experience as a qualified doctor—this is the first case in which I have given evidence—I express these opinions to the best of my knowledge—I do not know Dr, Pepper—I did not see the prisoner's wife the first time, or the woman who was with her—when I went to the prisoner's room I did not notice what the prisoner was doing—the child was on the bed—the prisoner was not fully dressed—I did not notice him crying—when I went in the second tinie I think the prisoner was putting his tie on—I did not notice any signs of emotion in him—he answered my questions; he made no object tion—when I said that such and such an injury was caused two hours or two days, and so on, previously, I was going according to the colour of the bruise and the amount of blood I found effused afterwards—the bruise over the eye was blue, and had not changed colour, so I should say it was a matter of hours—I said that the death occurred within two hours of my seeing the body, and I said at the Police-court that the bruises on the left of the ribs were caused about an hour and a-half before I saw it—I am afraid I made a mistake there—when I speak of a fractured rib T mean that the bone is actually broken—the fracture of these ribs was about 2 1/2 in. from the breast bone—I examined the child's brain—I think it has occurred that, by its coughing, a child has detached the cartilage from the ribs—I have never known a case—a child could not have broken the rib from the cartilage if the fracture was. 2 1/2 in. from the cartilage—if the child was on the floor on its right side, and the other side was punched by the fist, that would be sufficient to smash the ribs on the right side—it might have been stamped by the foot; it would not then have had marks on the right side—it would not necessarily break away the whole structure of the child—if you received a blow, and had a perforated lung, I should not give you more than. half an hour to live—I think the child must have received the injury after the priest left—on the right buttock the skin was broken in sir places—I suggest that a blow from a whip would cut through the flesh—it is possible that the child might have caused the wounds on the buttocks by dragging itself across the floor, but not probable—worms would emaciate the child, and teething would also—the child also had bronchitis I do not think that would emaciate it—it also had pleurisy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was nothing in the brain showing the cause of death—a child, however violently it coughed, could not inflict such injuries as these on itself—I think that all these injuries could have been caused by one blow; supposing the child was on an unyielding object, one act of violence would have been sufficient to cause the injuries to both sides of the ribs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D., a Bachelor of Medicine, and a Master of Surgery—I have been in practice over 26 years—I am Divisional Surgeon to the C Division of Police—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased on September 14th at St. Ann's Mortuary, at 8.30 p.m.—Dr. Munday took some of my notes for me—I have heard his evidence, and I agree with it—my impression is that as soon as the blow was struck the child suffered from shock, from which it did not recover, and probably died within a few minutes, if so long as that—I do not think it could have lived more than 10 minutes; it would probably have died within a few seconds—in my opinion, the cause of death was shock, resulting from direct violence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> An adult with a perforated lung might recover; it is not necessarily fatal; but this child died from shock—I saw the body alter it had been dissected by another doctor—there was very little blood effused, showing that the child could not have lived very long—if the ribs were broken after death they would present a very different appear<lb/>ance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not think these injuries could have been caused by The child falling about, or by its falling out of a bed—I think the whole of the injuries to the ribs might have been caused by one act of violence, and that that act must have been caused by some other person—one blow would have been sufficient—it must have been violent—the ribs of young children are very elastic, and unless the violence had been very great the ribs would not have been fractured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Master of Surgery, a Bachelor of Medicine at the London University, and F.R.C.S.—and a lecturer of surgery at St. Mary's Hospital—I was not present at either of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examinations—I have read the depositions in the case—I entirely agree with the evidence of the two doctors—I should say that the outside limit that a child could have lived after receiving the injuries would be 10 minutes, possibly 15 minutes, but I do not think so much—I think the probability would be that the child would die immediately—I think it would become unconscious immediately—the injuries could not have been self-inflicted—the greatest height that it could have fallen would have been 28 in.—I think the injuries could not have been caused by the child falling out of the bed—if it had fallen on the floor the ribs must have been driven in—it is probable that the child's right side was in contact with some hard, broad substance, but it is not necessary that it should be—it would have to be very considerable force to break the ribs in two places—a blow with the fist would account for it if the child was against a resisting substance—I do not believe the child would recover in the slightest after receiving the injuries; it must have been an immense shock, And it is in the region of the heart—the blow might have been sufficient to kill the child; it would lose its power of breathing, of crying out,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230025"/>
               <p>and of moving—it would be in a state of utter collapse—I think that the injuries on the buttocks could have been caused by the fingers; there is not sufficient evidence to make me say that they were caused by a cane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was consulted since the committal—I did not have a conversation with Dr. Munday or Dr. Mitchell—I have never spoken to either of them until to<lb/>day; I base my views on the depositions before the Coroner, and what I have heard in Court to<lb/>day—I absolutely exclude the possibility of a child of this description falling and injuring itself like this—I am speaking from a very large experience—a child falling from the height of 22 Inches on to the heel of a boot could not cause these injuries—an adult falling like that would not fracture his ribs—I think the child must have been on an unyielding surface—the punch might have come from the side—it would have only taken a little force to destroy the child's life by a pinch round the throat—the weight of a person getting out of bed on to the child would account for the injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The injuries might have been caused like that in the dark or by accident—a person stepping on the child would cause them—of course, if the legs of the person were hanging out of bed it would make a difference—to cause the injuries you must jump out of bed on to the child.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. MITCHELL</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). There were five or six stripes on the buttocks of the child; six, if you count the double one running almost parallel about half an inch apart, and fully three inches long across the upper and outer part of the buttock—three went through the skin, drawing blood—those stripes looked as if they had been inflicted by deliberate blows—there was no scraping as if. by the finger-nails, or by the child dragging itself along the floor—on the left buttock there was an abrasion half an inch square, and two stripes somewhat smaller, but wider, passing off to the left side, on the right buttock—those could not have been formed by the finger-nails.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Further cross-examined.</hi> I described them as stripes, not as cuts—I think the stripes were caused by a man with a whip or an iron rod striking the child six times.</p>

I am staying at Gower House Hotel, Euston Road—in July last I joined the British Royal Mail steamer Ormuz, taking a passage for London—I was carrying Bank of England notes value £315—I live in Melbourne, and had come to England for a holiday—the notes were sewn up in a piece of canvas, and pressed tightly in my pocket—Wolstenholme was a steward, and Maunder a pianist—the notes were safe the evening before reaching Colombo—I missed them the following morning about 5 a.m.—I had gone to the smoking-room, sleeping there—I reported the matter to the purser one or two hours afterwards, as soon as he was up, giving him a list of the stolen notes—I left the vessel at Marseilles, and came on to London four or five days before the Ormuz, and gave information to the police at Scotland Yard at once—a warrant was obtained at Bow Street—I have identified the notes (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)as part of my property; I have compared the numbers—the police have in hand about £100; the rest has been passed through, except about £65 or £60, which is still out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Maunder.</hi> I retired to the smoking-room about 11 p.m.—there had been a farewell concert to passengers leaving the next day—two other passengers were in the smoking-room—I did not leave the smoking-room to get bottles of beer; I had some beer in my cabin.</p>

She said, 'You are a dirty beast; I have got no shilling belonging to you.' I said, 'Why don't you let the woman alone?' Then he challenged me to fight, and struck me in the nose, and I fought him. There are a lot of Jews there, and I ran away." <hi rend="italic">Turner says</hi>: "I am not guilty of it. I did not take any money off the man, and did not strike him.

Thoghill's—we were getting ready to go to the theatre—the deceased commenced to wash herself before going to meet the prisoner—we left her—she waa not able to wash herself properly—she was the worse for drink—then we left her—I saw her next at the mortuary.</p>

               <p>sold it to a man—he was about the height of the prisoner—he said he wanted a 1s. pocket-knife—I showed him a smaller one than this—he said, "That one is not heavy enough; I want a much heavier one"—I showed him this one—he said it would do, and he paid is. for it, and went Qut—it was a new knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We do not make these knives—they come from Shef<lb/>field; they are made for us by the dozen—we might order three dozen—it is a common knife—I think I was first asked about this the day after the murder—I was not asked to give evidence before the Coroner—I fix the time at 8.30 because one of my daughters was going to a meeting, and I went to serve that knife just before she went—the gas was alight—my daughter was not in the shop; she was in the parlour; nobody was there—I have not got the first knife I showed the man here—a good many customers come in to buy knives—the man made no impression on me.</p>

I am a daughter of the sub-postmaster at the Post-office, 244, Dalston Lane, and assist in the postal business there—it is also a shop, and there is a telephone office near—I know Barker—I took in these "Radoo" telegrams from him about 1.50—I had not seen him be<lb/>fore—he said, "Send them at once"—I began to Send them—he was writing—he asked me how many I had left—I told him four or five, and he said, "Give them me back"—I handed them to him, but did not see what he did to them—he handed them back—I saw someone speak to him in a whisper—he said, "Send them with the others"—it was my duty to re<lb/>code them, but I did not, as I did not know the rule—the 9th tele<lb/>gram is addressed to "Norman," and signed "Goodyear"—it was sent off at 2.16—the 10th, addressed to "Doyle," was sent off at 2.19 the 11th, bearing the name of "Butear," was sent off at 2.11; and the 14th, bearing the same name, at 2.25, addressed to "Chippy"—the "Little Eva" telegrams of November 5th were handed to me, and I should have not only to code them but to transmit them—the first was sent out at. 1.17, and the 7th at 1.26—one is addressed to Barker, a bogus telegram, I and one to Chandler—this one contains the name of "Little Eva"—the 13th, the only one purporting to be signed by Bubear, was sent off at 133, addressed to Tylie, and is £2 to win.</p>

I am a commission agent, of 121, Queen Street, Ham<lb/>mersmith—I have known Bubear for many years, and he has backed horses with me for the last four years—the bets were made by note, telegram, or personally—the bulk by note delivered to me at Broadway, Hammersmith, about two miles from his house, the White Hart—the stakes varied from 10s. to £2—on October 29th I received a telegram backing Radoo—I have destroyed my copy—"Radoo" is written in spaces left for two words—it was handed to me very near the time of the race, and had taken a long time to come—on November 5th I received this telegram, "Little Eva"—this was also put in late, and took a long time to come—Monday was usually settling day—I then saw Bubear in Broadway, Hammer-smith—when I settled with him I said, "I cannot receive any more telegrams like that," as I thought it too near the time, and they took too long to come—he said, "There is nothing wrong in them"—I said, "I don't say there is, but I cannot accept any more like that"—he said, "I will alter my name, and put 'White Hart,' so you will know they come from me"—he said they had been sent him by a friend that he had met at the whippet race; "I was introduced to him by a friend, and he gave me some very good information"—I did not ask who he was—he said he sent him wires, but they were too late for him to get on, and his friend asked him whom he did business with, as he would send the messages direct to the man he did business with, and they were sent direct to me—he said he had limited him to a couple of sovereigns each way; £4 on the telegram—I said I would not accept any more telegrams unless they were put in 20 minutes or a quarter of an hour before the race started—I then paid him the balance, £12; but for the "Radoo" telegram he would have owed me money—I afterwards consulted my solicitor, and received. some information—I spoke to Bubear, and he said, "I would rather give you the money back if you think there is anything wrong"—I told him I believed some proceedings were being taken, and I could not do anything—I did not accept it—I cannot give an approximate date for that con<lb/>versation.</p>

                  </hi>. 1 am a bookmaker, of 46, Portland Square, Chelsea, and have known Bubear about 20 jears—I was betting with him by note before the middle of November last to the extent of 10s. or £l, some<lb/>times £2—I saw him on November 15th, when he left £20 with me as a deposit, as he said he might want to back something by wire—the same day I got a telegram from him backing Duaraia for £20 to win—this is the copy (<hi rend="italic">Poduced</hi>)—it was 49 minute<lb/>coming—I saw Bubear the next day, or the day after, on the Victoria Embankment—I said, "What have you got to come?"—he said, "£220"—I said, "I don't think so"—he said there were two or three others in it—I told him I had been up to the General Post Office, and found out it was not straight—I said, "I don't care if all Putney is in it; you won't get it"—he went away—nothing was said as to who actually sent the wire—he came down the next day or day after—we had a drink, and he asked for his £'20 back, which I gave him, except he might have left £1 or £2 on a horse—we had a large bottle of champagne, for which he paid—he never asked me again for the £220.</p>

I am a betting<lb/>man of Melrose Villas, St. Margaret's—I have known Bubear for, I think, 20 years—he had not backed horses with me before November last—early in November, when his race with Haynes was coming off, he asked me if he could wire to me about a horse now and then; I said, "Yes"—I asked him to hand them in in plenty of time—about November 9th I got a wire from him: "Wasp filly, Phcebas Apollo, £2 to win. Bubear" (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it purports to be handed in at Poplar B Office (East India Dock Road Office), 1 25 p.m., and did not reach the Richmond Office till 2.5; it was for the 1.30 race—on November 15th, I think, I got the Duamia wire: "Duamia, £3 each way. Bubear"—I noticed it took a long time to come; it was handed in at 2.55 (the 3 o'clock race); it reached Richmond Post-office at 3.41—I also got this, "Sherborne, £3 each way"—there was a space left; t the beginning of the telegram, and Sherborne was the winner—there was £6 on Wasp filly, 3 to 1; Duamia, £37 10-.; And Sherborne. £15; £58 10. if they were genuine bets—a day or two after ihe Sherborne wire Bubear and a Richmond chap I know called on me—Bubear asked me about ray luck—I said it was not very good—he seemed to be pretty lucky—I told him he would not get any money from me fur being lucky—I had seen a gentleman from the Post Office; he said he could not understand it, and he told me he did not send the wires—I said I authorised no one else to send wires in his name—he told me he had told somebody he could send wires in his name—I did not ask him who he was—I told him, if I were in his place, I should not send any more</p>

I am a sporting reporter, of the <hi rend="italic">Sportman</hi>, and live at Ranelagh Villas, Hove, near Brighton, and have filled that post for 15 years—it is part of my duty to attend race meetings and report the results of horse races—I attended the Hurst Park meeting on Satur<lb/>day, October 29th, 1898—I compare my notes with the report in the paper, and if correct I destroy them—Radoo was entered to run at 2 p.m. on October 29th in a handicap—the starting price as to Radoo for that race was 100 to 8—Little Eva was entered for the 1.15 p.m. Plantation Mid-Weight Handicap at Gatwick—according to our paper of November 7th, that race started at 1.18—the odds as to Little Eva were 6 to 4 against—Wasp filly was entered for the 1.30 County Stand Plate, at Liverpool, on November 9th—that race started at 1.44—the odds with regard to Wasp filly were 3 to 1 against—the race, very frequently, does not start for some minutes after the advertised time—it is much more difficult to get the horses off for a short race—Fosco was entered for the 12.45 Steward's Cup Plate, at Liverpool, on November 10th—the odds against Fosco were 7 to 1—at Leicester Races, on November 15th, Duamia was entered for the 3 p.m. November Handicap—as far as I know, Mack had not arrived at Leicester the night before the race; it was not in the list of arrivals—Mack was in training at Lam<lb/>bourne—Mack was entered for the race, but not marked with the little "a," showing it had arrived—the race started at six minutes past 3—Mack did not start; he never arrived at all—the Market Heaton Stakes trace, at Derby, on November 17th, was timed to start at 2.10; it did not start till 2.13—Sherborne was entered for that race—the odds against Duamia were 10 to 1—it depends on possession of the wires whether you get the result of a race up quicker by wire or telephone; the latter will often beat the former.</p>

I reside at 39, Aden Grove, Stoke Newington, the garden of which backs the garden of 63, Winston Road—I was in my kitchen on the 13th inst. between 2.30 and 3 p.m.—I was alarmed by two men coming from the garden through the scullery—there is a wooden fence between the gardens—one of them said he was looking for a man who had nearly killed a woman—they hurried to get out—when they got along the passage I said, "What do you mean by coming into my house like that?"—the prisoner turned and said, "It is all right: I am a detective"—the door has glass panels—the light was good—I noticed he had brown <hi rend="italic">spats</hi> on, a light hat, and very much the same colour coat he is wearing—these remuants of a hat are the same colour as the hat he was wearing—these are like the <hi rend="italic">spats</hi>—I saw him before the Magistrate, and recognised him—I noticed his face when he came through the kitchen—my lodger, Mr. Holloway, was at home.</p>

I was in the house, 39, Aden Grove, between 2.30 and 3 p.m. on October 13th—my attention was attracted by a noise downstairs like a scuffle—the landlady called out, "There's two men run through the passage"—I looked out at the window and saw them going out at the gate—I rushed downstairs and followed them—they were.30 yards off, and turned up Spring dale Road—I went the other way through Green Lanes, as they would come out that way; it is a triangle—I saw the same two men coming out at the top of the road—I got on the top of a tram, and kept them in sight till I saw a policeman on point duty, when I got off the tram and told him—he joined in following—we were 70 or 80 yards off them—they turned, and saw us close behind, and started running when we were about 20 yards off—the policeman blew his whistle—they were surrounded to a certain extent—the prisoner was brought</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of 191, Balls Pond Road—I first saw this baby on the evening of September 17th, when I was called to the prisoner's lodgings—it seemed weakly and ailing, but I could not find anything definite the matter with it—I asked the prisoner what she fed it on—she said, "Sterilised milk and barley water"—thai would be perfectly proper food, hut she said the child could not take it—I told her to use condensed milk, and feed it from the bottle—I next saw the child on the 23rd; the prisoner brought it up to my house for me to see between 2 and 3 p.m.; she was not sober—the child seemed delicate and thinner than when I saw it on the Sunday previous—I asked the prisoner if she had fed it as I had told her; she said No, because it was tongue<lb/>tied, and could not suck from the bottle—I examined it, and found it was not tongue<lb/>tied—I told the prisoner so, and that there was no reason why it should not be able to take its food—I told her she should feed it every two or three hours—I did not see it again alive—I saw its dead body at 10.30 on the 27th—I made a post<lb/>mortem examination—I found it emaciated; the total weight was 4 lb. 2 oz.; the normal weight of a child of that age would be about 8 lb.—there were sores on the buttocks and sides—I attributed that to the napkin not being changed often enough, and being left on wet—there was no fat on the body—there was about two teaspoonfuls of milk and water in the tomach; I cannot say how lonsg that had been there, but the digestion had not commenced—it is quite possible that if Mrs. Knowles gave it some food about 5.30, the child, being in a weekly condition, had not digested it—in the lower part of the intestines there were some small lumps, and in the lower part there was some slime, which indicated that the child had not had sufficient food—I cannot say how long it was since it had had food—I could not discover any actual traces of disease—there was nothing to account for there being no fat, or for its small weight—the child being left alone, and nobody to look after it, would be likely to cause injury to its health.</p>

                  </hi>. From August to June, last year, I was in the employment of Prym and Co.—about October or November I inserted an advertisement for a traveller—it was answered by a man named Bamberger—he was engaged at a salary of £2 10s. a week, and a com<lb/>mission of 5 per cent, on his sales—of course, that would be when the goods were paid for—Prym and Co. are hook and eye manufacturers of Germany, and also deal in type<lb/>writing ribbons—he commenced to travel for us on November Ist or thereabouts—on November I7th I</p>

               <p>received this letter, asking for samples, and, to the best of my belief, that letter was brought by Bamberger, and given to me—it is from F. Wallace and Co., Featherstono Buildings—I cannot say definitely whether he said anything aboat the firm when he handed me the letter—I delivered a portion of the goods on receipt of this letter, to the value of about £2 or £3—the goods were sold on monthly credit, less 2 1/2 per cent.—about the beginning of December, before the credit had expired, I received another letter from Wallace and Co., asking for samples and prices of our needles and pins—that letter was also handed to me by Bamberger, to the best of my belief—I wrote letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), giving list of prices—throughout December Bamberger brought in one or two orders from Wallace and Co.; we supplied the goods, but I cannot definitely state the amounts—the value of the goods supplied to Wallace and Co. while Bamberger was travelling for us was just over £200—we never received a penny in payment for them—we received a reference from Coombes and Co, of 11, Borroughs road, Kensal rise, as to Wallace and Co.—this is the lettler (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), dated November 19th, 189S—I stated at the Guildhall that this letter was brought to me by Bamberger, but, afrer thinking the matter over very carefully, I do not remember exactly whether that was so, or whether it came by post—I asked Bam-berger to bring Wallace and Co. to see me, after the account had been overdue some time—I had already put the matter in the solicitors' hands, Messrs. Osborn and Osborn, and Mr. Osborn was present at the interview ith them—this was some time in January—Hayes and Waugh came—Hayes said, "I am Wallace, and this (<hi rend="italic">Waugh</hi>)is my partner"—Hayes was the spokesman—they did not pay the money, but offered us a bill for £60—the solicitor said it was worthless—I received orders from other firms through Bamberger, but never executed them; Macdonald Bruce, of 20, Cheapside, was one—I also received an order from William Hayes, of Hopsell Road, N.</p>

I heard this screaming in the street on this night—the deceased was brought to the station, and after<lb/>wards taken to the hospital on the ambulance—I remained at the hospital until she died at 9.15 that night—I returned to the station a little after 10, and said to the prisoner "Edgar Smith, the woman, Martha Apple-yard, is now dead; the died in West Ham Hospital at 9.15; anything you say will be taken down in writing, and may he used in evidence against you; you will be charged with the murder of her on September 7th"—he made no reply—I found on him part of a razorcase and about 5s. 8d. in money.</p>

I am House Surgeon at West Ham Hos<lb/>pital—I was there on September 7th, when the deceased was brought in—she had an incised wound on her neck, and another on tlie back of her neck; she was in a very faint condition—I called in Dr. Grogonaugh—we did everything that could be done for her, but she died that night—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination—the wound on the left bide of her neck was 4 in. in extent, and the one on the back of the neck 5 in.—they could have been caused by a razor—the cause of death was loss of blood, resulting from those wounds—on her ring and middle fingers, and on the upper part of the ball of the right thumb, there were small incised wounds—I should think they were caused in a struggle, perhaps catching hold of the razor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of Police at West Ham, and Senior Surgeon at the West Ham Hospital—I saw the prisoner on this night—he was perfectly sober, sane and quiet—I examined his clothing, and found blood-stains upon his cuffs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I spoke to him, and he answered me—this was about 10.15—J asked him what he had been doing previously—he said he had been working at the Borough Theatre—I said, "Where did you stay last night?"—he said, "Two nights ago I left my sister's house;" but he did not say what he had been doing since—if persons suffering from delusion are not looked after, it may develop into something very serious, and if it goes on for some time it may develop into melancholia, and persons luffering from melancholia may do some very sudden and rash act—they might commit suicide or murder—often when suffering from such a malady they may recover suddenly—a person who has committed a murder may be found afterwards to be quite same—if a person imagines that he has got a disease that does not exist, that is also a delusion—absence of food would not make a man stronger, and so would affect the malady, but it would depend on how Long he had been without food—wandering about at nights would also tend to affect the malady—another symptom of the malady is when a person gets a book, and holds it in his hand for an hour without reading—it would be a sign, also, if he did not answer when spoken to, and then, being tapped on the shoulder, would jump up with a start—that would not show that he had been wandering; it would be sudden surprise—he might be feeble minded, but not insane—people suffering for years from melancholia may sometimes recover.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in the prisoner's company for about half an hour; that was at the Smiths' house—the father is about 60, he may be more, he may be 70—I do not know what the illness was that he had; he was laid aside from work for a long time—it was not from an accident; it seemed to be an entire mental collapee—during the half-hour when I saw the prisoner my conversation was with Mrs. Smith—I only said, "Good afternoon" to the prisoner—that was when I first went into the room—I said, "Good afternoon" to each of them separately—I had heard some<lb/>thing about the prisoner from his mother—I had not heard that he had left his work, or that he was under the impression that he had got some disease.</p>

I am Medical Officer at Her Majesty's Prison, Hollo<lb/>way—the prisoner was received there on September 8th, the day after the murder—knowing the charge against him, I kept him under observer<lb/>tion; with that view, he has been kept in the hospital infirmary—I have had interviews with him—I have found no traces of delusions—he has eaten well, and, as a rule, slept well; he was always rational and coherent—I do not find anything in him to suggest that he did not know the difference between right and wrong—I do not find anything to suggest that he did not know what he was about—he has conducted himself in a rational manner—I have talked with him about the crime; I led up to the subject with the object of testing his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When T described his movements up to the time of the act, he said he had no recollection—he came under my observation within 24 hours after the crime—I always examine prisoners in murder cases—cases are reciveed in the books that where a man has delusions,</p>

               <p>as to being arrested and followed, when he 18 arrested those delu<lb/>sions cease; it is possible to have been so in this case—the prisoner has always answered my questions fairly readily—when he put his hand to his forehead I thougat it was a mere nervous trick, I did not attach much importance to it—the blood did not run to his forehead—I have heard the evidence in this case—nervous debility might be an early symptom of melan<lb/>cholia—I do not think that the suffering, by continuing; tor some time without check, would develop into melancholia; it is possible, but not usual—persons suffering from nervous debility or nervousness ought to have treatment—a person sud'eting from them might commit a rash act.</p>

               <p>of the brain, from the result of which he died—the conclusion I came to was that a blow at the angle of the jaw caused the fracture, by driving the condyle of the jaw into the base of the skull—there was a scalp wound on the back of the head, which might have been caused by his falling on the ground, or by a blow—it is not uncommon for injury to the brain to be caused by such a blow or a fall on the point of the chin.</p>

On Sunday, September 3rd, I was selling shrimps and apples round Martin Road, Clever Road, and Hooper Road, with a pony and cart. I went home about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I had my dinner. I took the horse out of harness, took it on the fields, and came home again at 3.30. I stayed indoors the rest of the day. There is only me and my wife lives at the above address. I did not go out in the street. I had beer on the window<lb/>sill. I saw Richard Fry in the evening wich Mr. Shaw, coming down the street. He asked for two or three shrimps, and I gave them to him. I saw Bowers about six o'clock at night. Richard Fry was not drunk when I saw him. I saw three men and three women go down the street. I was sitting on the downstairs window<lb/>sill. I did not hear anyone speak to them. I did not see anyone attack them. I saw a crowd. I went out to see what it was about. My sister-in-law said, 'There goes Richard; go and fetch him back again. I went and got hold of him, and pulled him back. He was running along hollooing out for his missus. He was not touching the party. Some boys said, Your brother is in a bit of a row.' He had been drinking. I left him in Frederick Road. I came home. I then sat on the window<lb/>sill again, and then my brother went after him. I went out again to fetch him back. He said,' My wife's gone down here, and I want her.' He was in Frederick Road against the chapel, by himself. There was no one else there. I saw three men and three women coming along. I don't know if he spoke to them, or they spoke to him. I saw a scuffle. I don't know who it was. I got hold of my brother and pulled him out. Icy was there; I did not see Eagle or Nelson there.

This bankruptcy was in 1884—my firm had the conduct of the proceedings, and it was at my instigation that a warrant for his arrest for non<lb/>attendance on his public examination was taken out, no doubt—I had not seen Mr. Singleton since 1884 until I saw him at the Mansion House, when I was asked to identiiy him—I have not tried to find him at the address given in the warrant; we are only London agents, and we have to obey instructions—I did not, after 'obtaining the warrant, attempt to find him at the address which was given by him at that time, and which was in the warrant—I do not think he was living for 10 years at the same address, from 1884 to 1894, or there abouts—we ceased to make inquiries after a few years; from 1884 up to 1890 we could not trace him.</p>

I am Chief Clerk of the Bxchequer at Bdinburgh—I act for the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies—I produce the file, as it is called, of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Cor<lb/>poration, Limited—the company was registered on August 18th, 1892—the memorandum of association was registered on that day; it shows that, amongst other objects of the company, was this: "To confirm and carry into effect, with such modifications as may be agreed upon, an agreement between A. F. Baker and a trustee on behalf of the corporation"; and under Clause 5 of the memorandum, the capital of the corporation, £102,000, is divided into 10,000 shares of £10 each, and 2,000 founders' shares of £l each, with power, subject to the provisions hereinafter con<lb/>tained, to increase or reduce such capital—the shares are divided into the following classes: 10,000 ordinary shares, 2,000 founders' shares—the,. rights of the shares are stated to be that "the ordinary shares are entitled to a preferential dividend at the rate of £7 per cent per annum, and to share in the remaining profits of the corporation as hereinafter mentioned; the founders' shares are entitled to one moiety of the remaining profits of the corporation after the payment of the 7 percent—interest (non-cumulative) on the ordinary shares, the remaining one moiety of such profits being distributed amongst the holders of ordmary shares, such remaining profits or any part of such profits being subject to the formation of a reserve fund, as the directors or managers may think fit; (6) dividends may be paid in cash or by the distribution of specific</p>

               <p>assets, shares, stock, or otherwise;" then follows the list of seven sigma. tories—each of the seven signatories subscribes for one founders' share—the witness to all the above signatures is "Oliver R. Mason. Waroford Court, London, E.C., manager to a public company"; then follows: "This memorandum is registered without articles of association.—A. F. Baker, agent for the said bank"—the second document on the file is the duty stamp form; the third is an agreement dated August 19th, 1892, between the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, Limited, of one part, and A. F. Baker of the other part; that recites certain matters, and then makes over 2,000 £1 fully<lb/>paid founders' shares to A. F. Baker—it is signed, "For and on behalf of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, Limited, Leonard Barker and William Osborne, directors," and also by A. F. Baker—the next docu<lb/>ment is a return of capital up to September, 1892—it shows that the seven signatories are still existing shareholders, Braoley, Clark, Cook, Drew, Osborne, Williams, Barker; and in addition to their seven shares there are share warrants to bearer, 2,000, making altogether 2,007 shares issued at that date—that is signed, "A. F. Baker, Secretary"—then there is another return at the end of the year 1892 to the same effect; seven signatories with one share each, and then the 2,000 share warrants in addition; that is made up to January 30th, 1893—the next document is dated June 16th, 1893, a notice of address—there is another documen t dated June 16th, 1893, giving the address of the company as 6A, George Street, Edinburgh—so far as I can teil, that is the first address of the com<lb/>pany that I had for registration—the next document is a petition filed on February 10th, 1894: ia petition to the Right Honourable the Lords of Council and Session; that is the Division of the Court of Session in Scotland—that is presented on behalf of John R. Blackiston, Inspector of Schools, of Peyton Lodge, Sheffield, for rectification of register by the removal of his name from the list of shareholders—the petition itself shows that the ground for that application was the appearance of the name of a Mr. Scrafton in the list of governors—"The petitioner has learned, and now avers, that before the said shares were allotted to him the said Robert Scrafton had intimated to the company and to the other governors named in the prospectus that he withdrew his consent to become a governor of the company—on April 10th, 1894, I got a letter from F, J. Baker, the secretary, giving me notice that Mr. Blackiston's name had been removed from the list of shareholders; it is dated April 10th; it would be received on the 11th—the next document is a notice of change of situation from George Street, Edinburgh, to 23, St. James's Square, Edinburgh, as the registered office of the company—the next is the summary, showing the number of shares which had been issued and taken up, to December 24th, 1894—that shows that in addition to the 2,000 fully paid<lb/>up shares, 2,529 shares had been taken up to that date; the 2,000 being the 2,000 fully<lb/>paid shares previously referred to, I presume; there are seven subscription shares, and 1,993 others—the summary further shows that the total amount of calls received up to that date was £24,760, and the total amount of calls unpaid £530—then follows a long list of shareholders; and then I find the very last entry on the return, "share warrants to bearer allotted, 1993"—that would be the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230115"/>
               <p>2000 less the seven original signatories' shares—the next document is a petition dated December 13th, 1894, for the winding<lb/>up of the company presented by Mr. M'Gill and Mr. Barr; they were the petitioners—among the names mentioned there I find the names of Messrs. Davidson and Syme; they were the solicitors for the petitioners, Mr. M'Gill and Mr. Barr—the Court made an order for the winding<lb/>up of the company on January 16th, 1895, Mr. Richard Atcheson being appointed liqui<lb/>dator.</p>

The memorandum says: "To promote any company or companies for the purpose of acquiring all or any of the property and liabilities of this corporation, or for any other purpose which may seem directly or indirectly calculated to benefit this corporation "; and under lett r p.: "To remunerate any person or company for services rendered, or to be rendered, in placing or assisting to place, or under<lb/>writing or assisting to underwrite, or guaranteeing the placing or under-writing of any of the shares in the corporation's capital, or any debentures or other securities of the corporation, or in or about the formation or promotion of the corporation, or the conduct of its business"—in Clause 5 it is stated that "the capital of the corporation is £102,000, divided into 10,000 shares of £10 each, and 2,000 founders' shares of £1 each, vith power, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained, to divide such shares or stock," and, a little later, "by resolution to increase or reduce such capital"; there is power to increase or reduce—Clause 6 says: "Dividends may be paid in cash or by the distribution of specific assets, shares, stock, or otherwise"—at first, when the registration took place in August, 1892, they were registered without articles under Table A—there was just a memorandum alone; but later I find that on February 15th, 1893, articles were filed with me, and a special resolution was passed, altering Table A in the shape of special articles according to the resolution.</p>
               <p>On December 14th, 1894, the 2,000 shares are referred to there at fully paid—it is quite clear that there are 2,000 founders' shares of £1—that is 1893, and then the seven signatories' shares make up the rest.</p>

I am housekeeper at 80, Coleman Street—I have been there about 10 years—I produce an agreement (No. 171) between the landlords, of 80, Coleman Street, and Thomas Bernard Lawrence, of 100, Harrow Road, Middlesex, whom I recognise as Charles Singleton—so far as my memory goes, the Empire Finance, and a longer name, was up at the office—I remember Miss Rich, a lady clerk, being employed there, and Mr. Baker and Mr. Coley—I know Beall by sight—I have seen him at 80, Coleman Street, from time to time, going into the room, which Mr. Lawrence occupied.</p>

W. Smith, a solicitor, next to Mr. Lawrence; Mr. Davis, a solicitor there, was not on the same floor, but in the building—I cannot give you the dates when I sa him during that time—I pledged myself to having seen him six times—during the whole of the tenancy I had no reason to pay any parti<lb/>cular attention to Mr. Beall—many others used to call on Mr. Lawrence—there are a lot of people I do not know by name; I knew Mr. Beall by</p>

Beall and Co., of which this is a copy: "4, Copthall Chambers, March 23rd, 1897. Gentlemen,—I under<lb/>stand that you act for Mr. J. Lloyd Morgan, who held an office of me in this building.

Both Mr. Saunders and Mr. Scrafton consented to join, and I need not now refer to the reasons that may have actuated them in adopting the course that they have done, which, to say the least of it, is as unbusi<lb/>nesslike as it is ungentlemanly.

               <p>Lambert drew my attention to it, and said, "You see your name all over London," and T believe that was the day it appeared—that was March 8th, so far as I know—there was nothing between me and the corporation or Lambert till the day I called at his office—it is quite news to me that the company had been advertised from the 8th to the 17th—I had never seen the advertisement nor the prospectus till my attention was called to it by Mr. Lambert; the momins: I called on him; the morning after I came to town—I came to town the night before, and I saw him on the next morning, and he told me that my name was all over London—I have said that he put a daily paper in my hand—it says on the prospectus that the list for applications will close on Saturday, March 11th, for town, and on Monday, 13th, for the country—Mr. Lambert said either there was going to be a board meeting that day or the following day, "Will you meet me there I"—it was not a week after—I was not in London a week, it was within a day or two—I tell you it is nearly seten years ago, and I cannot say if it was the same day or the next for certain—there were three or four days' delay in communicating with Lord Eiibank—when you talk about this l)oard meeting, I heard no minutes read over or anything of that sort—on March 17th, or whatever the date was, I saw Mr. Lam<lb/>bert together with soine other gentleman—there was no conversation there about the fact of my name appearing as one of the trustees on the prosp ctus—I think I had made up my mind on that meeting of March 17th that I was not going to continue as trustee—at this distance of time it is very difficult to recollect to a few days, but t say that if my first interview with Mr. Lambert was on the 8th, and I did not go down to the bank till the 17th, in the meantime I had communicated with Lord Elibank with a view to withdraw—if Lord Elibank had had, "I am con<lb/>tent to go on; it is a most excellent concern," I would have gone on—on the 17th I do not think Lord Elibank's name was mentioned—pro<lb/>bably on March 17th, when I called, there was some conversation about my name having appeared on the prospectus, and I was told, "Oh! it will be all right"—I have no recollection of writing to Mr. Lambert six and a-half years ago.</p>

J. Baker and Coley, in the summer of 1892—I remember going to Coleman Street, and seeing F. J. Baker—I did not know Mr. Beall then, except by reputation as a City solicitor—I remember meeting Lawrence later on in the day at the office in Coleman Street—he spoke to me about a company—he wanted it registered as quickly as possible to secure the title, for fear some other rival association should get the title; I think that was the reason given, speaking from memory—he asked me to be one of the signatories, and to get other signatories as quickly as possible, if I could secure the names, the proper gentlemen—he told me later on that the name of the company was the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, Limited—I signed Exhibit 3 at the office in Coleman Street—Mr. Singleton was present—I see that I undertake to take a founders' share in this company—I was to have one share—I never paid for it—they were £10 shares—I made no agreement whatever—people came in the room and went out again, but Mr. Mason was not present, I do not know him—that is my signature in the document of August 19th, 1892, which says: "For and on behalf of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, Limited,—Leonard Barker, William Osborne, Directors"—I did not know that I was a director of this company—I did not know the contents of this document—I did not read it before I signed it—I see it is signed by A.

Since 1893, when the affairs of this company were before me, a good many other matters have parsed through my hands—there was no particular reason why I should remember the affairs of this company any more than any other—I had been a signatory before and since many a time—I was first spoken to about the affaire of this company just a little before the examination at the Mansion House during this) ear, so that from 1893 to the summer of 1899 I had no reason</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230129"/>
               <p>to think about the affairs of this company—I told them at the Mansion House that I thought it was all dead and buried, and so it was, as far as I was concerned; I had got nothing out of it—I wanted a profit out of the printing—it is usual to act as signatory and take one share, to apply for one share, and to have seven signatories, who each sign for one share when the company is formed before it is issued to the public; I would do it to-morrow; there is nothing wrong about that, as far as I am aware—I think I signed about half-a-dozen documents; the memorandum, I think would be the first—my impression is that I was never at a meeting but what all the other signatories were present except one, and, therefore, I cannot understand that the other signatories were not there—I will not swear to that—at the meeting on March 17th we were asked to appoint, and did appoint, the directors of the company who were to succeed us under the articles:;, and from that date we ceased to be directors, and these people took our places—until March 17th I had no communication of any kind with Mr. Beall—I had not been doing any printing work for a month, or more than that, previously; in fact, I had never done any printing work for Mr. Beall—I will qualify that answer by saying, not knowingly.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 77, Lothian Road, North Brix<lb/>ton—I am an accountant—I knew Mr. Beall before 1892, also Mr. Fred Mason—I remember Mr. Mason bringing me a memorandum of associa<lb/>tion to sign—this, is, my, signature for founders' shares—I did not pay anything, nor get any certificate for the share—I did not know Baker, or Singleton, only Air. Beall—after having signed that memorandum I got a notice to attend a meeting—I met some gentlemen I did not know, except Mr. Robert Clark—resolutions were passed—I attended more than one—there were small fees, which increased—I think the first fee began at 5s.; it was increased to a guinea and a<lb/>half—I think Mr. Clark took the chair on one or two occasions—a Mr. Baker, I think, took the chair at the last or last but one meeting—I am very near<lb/>sighted, I cannot distinguish him—I saw him at the Mansion House, in the dock—I think Mr. Beall took the chair on one occasion—the name of the company was the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, Limited—I read the memorandum and articles of association—there was a list of applications</p>

I have been secretary of several public companies—before becoming a signatory to this memorandum I was well acquainted with the process of the formation of companies and company work—I did not see anything to find fault with, complain of, or to excite suspicion, or I would have resigned at once—the minutes I signed were correct minutes of what had taken place—I should say at all the meeting which I attended there were agenda papers put before us, and upon that agenda paper the business was discussed according to the order in which the business appeared—there was discussion in some cases, and the resolutions were passed as appears in the minutes—I had known Mr. Beall in a friendly way for years before this—I did not know Mr. Beall was interested in the matter until I attended this meeting and saw him there—when gentlemen become signatories to a memorandum of associa<lb/>tion and attend meetings of the signatories they expect to get something for it, and they do as a rule—signatories are not asked to pay for the shares for which they sign in the memorandum of association when they sign for one or two shares like that; you do not expect to.</p>

F. Baker," for and on behalf of that company—the date is November 23rd, 1892—he took the agreement away and brought it back, signed by Milner, and witnessed by E. Wilson—when I went to 31, Lombard Strit. in the first place I wed to ask for Mr. Milner if he was in, a lady clerk would introduce me to the gentleman I knew as Baker that is Singleton—I said at the Police-court that the North British Company occupied the premises for about nine months—I was trusting to my memory, and unfortunately it misled me—they there nearly 18 months, and when they left they owed nine month rent.</p>

We are now only waiting for the definite appointment of the Scoich board. As soon as the elections are over it is proposed to publicly advertise the company. Should you desire to take a few of the remaining founders' shares, please let me know at your earliest convenience. I cannot reserve more than 15 or part. Some attempts are being made to secure these shares by brokers and others at far below their value, I hope you will not be influenced by these outside and not quite disinterested people. Personally I am of opinion that the intrinsic value of these shares is nearer £50 than £10.—I am yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">A. F. BAKER</hi>"—I also received a circular letter about that time. No. 113, undated: "I have the pleasure of enclosing you an advance proof of the prospectus of the above undertaking. The company is to be shortly launched under the best auspices, and will bo controlled by influential gentlemen, both in thefinan<lb/>cial and social world. The yearly increase in almost every branch of com<lb/>mercial business gives evidence of there being ample room for such an undertaking. As has become customary, it is proposed to adopt the usual course of giving the subscribers for the first founders' shares the right of acquiring these shares without the obligation of taking any of the ordinary capital, the first contributions being used to defray the preliminary expenses relating to the formation of the company, and with these objects it has been decided to issue only 100 founders shares at the very moderate sum of £10 each. No other founders' shares will be offered except where the subscriber takes at least £300 in ordinary capital. The advantage of this arrangement will no doubt commend itself to you, and, having regard to the present price of founders' shares in some of the bestmanagedcom<lb/>mercial undertakings, it will be seen that the issue price is low, and that within a short time of the public launching of the company they will become of considerable value, and will yield a handsome profit should you wish to realise. As it is only proposed to have 1,000 founders' shares, and in the firstinstance to issue £250,000 capital, half to be called up, should the profits only suffice to pay 12 per cent., the profits on each founders' share would be equal to 32 1/2 per cent, per annum. If you desire to secure any of the founders' shares on the above terms, your application ought to reach me during the current week on the enclosed form,—Yours obediently, A. F. BAKER, Secretary"—also another letter dated August 29th, 1892, enclosing the scrip for founders' shares—I handed them all over to Mr.Davis, the solicitor, and all myotherpapers—I got another letter of December 29th, 1892 (115): "Dear Sir,—I have the pleasure of enclosing you herewith slip showing the number of additional names we have secured.

Dear Sir,—I beg to herewith enclose draft for £100, as per enclosed allotment form, due for 40 ordinary shares in the London and Scottish Banking Corporation"—I then received letter 122, dated March 15th: "Dear Sir,—I have your favour of 14th inst., enclosing draft for one hundred pounds (£100), being the allotment money on your forty ordinary shares, cashier's receipt for which I enclose herewith. I will see that the scrip is made out in the way that you mention"—that was in the joint names—on April 29th I wrote letter 123: "Dear Sir,—I herewith enclose bankers' receipts for £121, and Bank of England note, value £100, eleven pounds over and above what is required for forty £5 paid-up shares, and one founders' share.

P.S.—Please give me the name and address of your Manchester agency"—I never got the name and address of the Manchester agency—I did get a letter, acknowledging the receipt of the £124 I sent—I subse<lb/>quently sent the second half, and in letter 126 got an acknowledgment of it—as far as I can remember, I wrote and asked if Icouldpay £5 per per share up to that time—then I got a letter from the bank, No. 129, saying: "Dear Sir,—Your letter of 10th inst. to hand, and the directors have agreed to your proposal to pay your shares up on August 1st next—</p>

               <p>Yours faithfuly, F.

J. Baker, of October 10th, 1893: "Dear Sir,—Thanks for your letter and kind wishes of 17th inst., enclosing cheque, value £9 2s.11d. We have placed this dividend to your deposit account"—in March, 1894, I re member getting two circulars which refferred to a syndicate—after reading the circulars I wrote letter 136—the first lines of document 276 are: "Dear Sir, we have had oftered to us the opportunity of contributing to a limited syndicate, the object of which is to form a company to ac-quire and work Livet's Patents for London and 20 miles round; and, although the terms proposed are of a very remunerative character, my directors do not see their way to entertain the proposal in its entirety, it not being what could be properly termed a banking or discount trans<lb/>action. My directors, however, have made inquiries as to the value of the patents, and also personally had an opportunity of inspecting the installa<lb/>tion at Halifax, and of seeing the results, and are so satisfied with the great value of the invention and the bona fides of the undertaking, that they individually have joined the syndicate to form the London company, and have pleasure in bringing the. matter under your notice, believing that a very handsome profit Will accrue to those who participate in the advantages offered to the subscribers. I enclose particulars, which will give you full information. Your application should be sent direct to the secretary of the syndicate. The money subscribed will be under the con<lb/>troll of my directors, and will be lodged at our bank"—I read the circular; I cannot say positively whether this was the one I got or not—that was the subject matter of the circular—I wrote this letter, No. 136, of March 1st; "I write to thank you for sending me forms, ete., of a limited syndicate to form the company to work Livet's Patents, which appears to me a very good thing, but am not in a position to speculate just at present. I may say that.I have lately lost money by taking up shares in new companies limited. Trusting our bank is doing well, I am, yours sincerely, <hi rend="smallCaps">R. J.

The brokers, of course, are entitled to charge whatever they like"—at the end of the year 1894 I wrote some letters as to the price which I paid for the founders' shares; one is dated December 22nd, 1894: "Dear Sir, we have your letter of the 21st inst., with post<lb/>card to fill up, but before doing so shonld like an answer satisfactory to my query <hi rend="italic">re</hi> founders' shares. I have written you twice, and given a full explanation when and how I paid the £30 for three founders* shares, and I received a reply from you to say that you have known founders' shares to sell at £11, which is nothing whatever to do with the question.

Trusting to have a satisfactory reply at an early date, &amp;c."—I received this letter from F. J. Baker: "Thanks for your letter, but I don't think you have paid the amount for the founders' shares to the company"—I wrote on January 3rd, 1895: "Sir,—I have yours of the 2nd inst.

This one was allotted to us on taking 40 ordinary shares, and the other two we took previous, sending £20 to A. F. Baker. Now, I have written you three times on this matter, but cannot get a satisfactory reply, and I cannot conscientiously sign any paper until this matter is cleared up to my satisfaction."—the reply was of January 7th, No. 145: "Dear Sir.—It is not unusual for this class of shares to be issued at a very large premium. If the petition falls to the ground, and we are allowed to continue business, the dividend due to you on your founders' shares will make these, even at the price you paid for them, more valuable than your ordinary shares.

No. 113 does not refer to the London and Scottish Bank, nor to the writer's experience as a banker, but merely gives the history of the various institutions it refers to; but the book was "by its author, A.

Baker," written on it—I knew the company was about to be registered, and that what I was going to subscribe to the first founders' shares for, was to help find the registration and formation expenses, and for that I was to get founders' shares; also that if the com<lb/>pany, when formed and launched, proved a failure, supposing it had not gone to allotment, founders' shares would have been lost—I know very little about forming companies; I knew by the book, and by the state<lb/>ment in this letter, that it was a good thing—as to founders' shares I never got any statement—I thought they were valued at£10—learnt that they were £1 shares, which they were valuing at £10 at a late stage—it was never stated in any pamphlet or paper I saw; that they were £1 shares at £10 each—this was not the first company I had invested in—all I got was the provisional scrip; a provisional certificate—I did not notice that the form produced is addressed to Mr. A. F. Baker, and is "To procure for me (so many) founders' shares at £10 each"; that is not an application to the company, or anyone, for so many shares of £10 each, but a request for shares of £10 each—A.

Baker (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—about the name time I received a prospectus and a document accompanying it; this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the prospectus that I received—I read it through—it is headed "Proof Prospectus—Founders' Issue"—this document. No. 25, accom<lb/>panied it—this is the actual document I received; there is my india<lb/>rubber stamp on it—it is a printed paper headed "Banks and Banking' Extract from the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi>, July 30th, 1892"—it begins: "Mr. Baker has published a little work on the above subject"—there is a</p>

               <p>passage: "We understand this gentleman, who evidently has a practical as Well as a theoretical knowledge of banking, is associated with a very influrntial group of financiers who are to be responsible for the London and Scottish Banking Corporation, with branched in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and London,' and a final paragraph: "Both classes of shares in the London and Scottish Bank should prove a remunerative and lasting investment"—after receiving those two documents and reading them I wrote to A. F. Baker to the address given upon the prospectus, 5, Copthall Avenue; I got this dated October 21st, 1892 (saying that the issue price of the founders' without the obligation of taking any ordinary shares was £10, and after the public issue of the prospectus they would not be allotted except where £400 worth of ordinary capital was applied for ', that they were their own bankers, their clearing banks being in London and Sco land; that the company had been registered, and they expected to advertise the prospectus in the course of the next fortnight or three weeks; and should I desire any founders' shares I was to fill up the enclosed application form and return it at my earliest convenience—the application form was something like this document—I am not quite clear that I applied for 10 founders'shares—this is the cheque with which I paid, drawn to the order of the London and Scottish Banking Company, and endorspd "London and Scottish Banking Company, A. F. Baker, Secretary"—it was paid through the Metropolitan, Birmingham, and South Wales Bank—it has got the bankers' stamp across—I got then letter 29, and enclosed in it there was the share certificate No. 30. "November 3rd, 1892. Dear Sir, Confirming ours of the 1st instant, I beg to hand you herewith scrip for 10 fully paid-up founders' shares in my bank. Kindly acknowledge receipt of the same, and oblige. Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">A. F.

I beg to enclose you here<lb/>with scrip for these 25 shares, and shall be obliged by cheque for balance in due course. Yours very faithfully, pro A.

F. Baker (<hi rend="italic">Asking whether the witness or his friends wanted any further shares as they had a final meeting for the following day to settle the prospectus prior to its public issue</hi>)—on February 25th I sent a further cheque for £40, in payment for the founders' shares I had applied for, drawn and endorsed in the same way—I got a letter (39) acknowledging the receipt of the cheque for £40, dated February 25th, 1893: "Dear Sir,—I am in receipt of your esteemed favour of 24th inst, and thank you for the very kind expressions therein contained, and I shall have very great pleasure in reading your communication to our directors at their next meeting. I thank you for the cheque for £40, which shall be placed to your credit as you desire. As regards the additional founders' shares, I should be only too glad if I could fall in with the suggestion you made, but, having regard to the fact that no founders' shares can be reserved without the obligation of taking ordinary shares after the public issue of the prospectus, I am afraid it will be impossible for me to fall in with your suggestion. I my<lb/>self would be only too glad if I could with a payment of even 20 per cent. obtain the control of any of the founders' shares within the next three months, as I am satisfied within that time they will be changing hands at nearer £30 than £20; indeed, I only heard yesterday that some of the brokers who could only get parcels of twos and fives are selling them at about £12. With reference to the additional 15 founders' shares, I enclose you an application form, which kindly fill up and return to me at your convenience. The amount at present standing to your credit is £65, on account of 40 founders'shares at £10 each. Yours faithfully, A.

"Dear Sir, I am indebted to you for your favour of 28th ult., and while you may rely upon my doing all I possibly can to meet your wishes, you must not forget that it is impossible for me to make arrangements with reference to subscriptions and payments different to those affecting others. I think I explained to you that no founders' shares after the public issue of the prospectus could be subscribed and paid for, unless the applicants also undertake the obligation of subscribing for at least 40 ordinary shares in respect of each founders' share. As regards the payment, of course, this is a matter that does not in any way personally affect me, and I would suggest, so that I can say that they have been definitely taken and paid for, that you should remit a further cheque for, say, £150 in the course of the next few days, and send your acceptance at six weeks for the balance. In that event, I can send you the scrip in the proportions that you ask for, and thus enable you to keep faith with your friends, and also at the same time enable you to collect from them their proportions for their respective subscriptions. Yours very faithfully, A. F.<hi rend="smallCaps">BAKER</hi> "—I had mentioned those founders' shares to some of my relatives—then on March 2nd I got another letter from A. F.

Please accept them in the ordinary way, payable at your bankers, and kindly let me have them by return, so that I may report the matter as being completed. Your cheque for £150, I presume, will reach me in the course of the current week. Please wire me how you want the scrip made out"—No. 44 is my cheque drawn to the London and Scottish Bank, and endorsed by them, A. F.

I have also your further confirmation by telegram this afternoon, agreeing to make the acceptance two months for said balance, for which I also thank you. Seeing I have now taken the responsibility for all the shares, I will instruct you in a post or two in whose names to make out the set ip for. Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN W.

F. Baker, dated March 9th, enclosing my five certificates for founders' shares made out according to my instructions: in the names of myself and family—these are the share warrants, all signed "A. F. Baker"—the serial number is altered to V 102 to 106; the previous ones were B—these are printed, the others were in ink—then I got letter No. 56 from A. F.

               <p>respect to the interest upon deposits, of course, you must be aware that it occasionaly varies, but for the fixed period of three years we could allow 4 per cent. Anything beyond this I should not like to promise. If you will let me know if this rate of interest: which' for any sound bank is considered somewhat high: would suit your friend, I could then definitely let you know. Of course, you will understand that I do not bind myself to 4 per cent. Yours faithfully, A.

I enclose you herewith four prospectuses, with the necessary application forms, and I shall make a note, so that I secure you an allotment for your friends. You will be pleased to hear that the bank is going wonderfully well."—No. 59 is an application form for ordinary shares which I received, but did not fill up—I did not apply for any, I had my quantity then; I thought I had paid enough—that letter follows my contract—I sent up to London money in the shape of cheques for £180 5s. 2d., and a deposit receipt for £250 of Mrs. Haley's: that comes to £430 5s. 2d.—the letter of May 11th is an acknowledgment of the receipt of those moneys, signed by F.

As regards the acceptr ances, I find on reference to the books that they were passed on to the advertising agents some time ago, and I am sending on to them to know if they are still in their hands, and will write to you in the course of post. In the meantime, I have sent on the cheque for £430, asking them to protect one bill, and also to arrange with them for the renewal of the other"—Mrs. Haley, my wife, had sent up £250 on deposit, through me, in order to take up one of those bills for £430—I used her deposit money in addition to my own cheques—I had written proposing to take up one bill for £430, and asking to have the other renewed—letter 61, recites what I did: "We understand that Messrs. de Renter have the bills, and the writer will call upon them to<lb/>morrow to take up the one that we have in hand of yours, and also to try and arrange the other; although, in the absence of Mr. A.

Haley and S. M. Haley, in addition to mine, for such I can, of course, send you; and to say such is not satisfactory would be to admit a bad state of things for our shares. I should think, however, even if you submitted the same offer to the holders of the bill, they would accept readily, but under the circumstances I consider you should recognise you are dealing with honourable people who have gone into this matter as an investment, and, under the unforeseen circumstances of the present strike, endeavour to oblige, and charge a conscientious discount for so doing. However, I shall rely upon you doing so at three months."—I wrote another—letter next day, No. 65: "Dear Sir,—I am in receipt of yours ofyester<lb/>day's date, eovering cheque £430 4s. 9d., which I return herewith in accordance with my telegram to<lb/>day, in consequence of the two bills having been presented and returned unknown to me by my bankers yesterday. You would also be aware yesterday when writing me they had been sent here, and I am astonished to find you had not retired one of them as directed, and holding cash in" hand in full for that purpose. Such a proceeding is most unwarrantable, apart from the injury and reflection cast upon myself as a commercial man in the estimation of my bankers and others, and it is not surprising Messrs. Renter declined to renew anything of mine, as you infer, when you failed on my behalf to redeem one of the bills, and my honour and status thus far sacrificed, and you actually held the money for such. If it should resolve itself into any<lb/>thing like a writ by Messrs. Renter, then I can only say to the extent of one bill of £430 you must be held responsible, as it is no fault of mine you failed to retire that; but why should Messrs. Renter have any voice or control in any renewal that I ask from you to favour mc with, and both bills be presented, when it was your duty to retire one and held payment in hand for the same? However, I am asking you as the London and Scottish Bank, and not others, to renew the one unpaid for three months, to favour me accordingly a: a reasonable charge for the same (which is part of your operations, I believe), and hold security as offered, which I think you should not object to do now, and have my grateful appreciation for"—I got an answer, No. 66.

I did attend at Messrs. de Reuater's, the holders of your acceptances, but they point-blank refused to let us retire one bill without the other. Personidly I know very little of the matter, as it was an arrangement made by Mr. A. F. Baker with Messrs. de Reuter. Mr. A. F. Baker is not expected at the office until next week. Do not think for a moment it is out of any disrespect to you, and I will do all I possibly can to arrange the matter to your satisfaction, and only regret that personally I am unable to do anything"—then I got No. 67, signed F. J. Baker, and dated May 17th 1893: "Dear Sir,—I have your letter of the 16th inst, which crossed mine of yesterday. I thought I had informed you that I had personally tendered Messrs. de Reuter your two acceptances and cheque for £430, and they were not disposed to renew one without the other, and that the manager could not say anything definitely until he had taken the instructions of his board. I did all I possibly could, and am writing them a copy of your letter today. I do not think you need worry yourself; I have no doubt it will all come right in the end. I don't think we shall see Mr. A. F. Baker until Thursday in next week—before the next letter Messrs. Reuter served me with a writ in respect of both bills, for £860—I wrote this letter. No. 68, on June 2nd, 1893, to A. F. Baker—the stationery of the bank says I am to address all communications to the secretary—I had had no intimation that Mr. A. F. Baker had ceased so to be; it was put "Assistant Secretary," so I imagined that Mr. A. F. Baker still held the office; "Having defended Messrs. Renter's action, I take it that the matter is now in your own hands as to the settlement of my matter, and I would, of course point out against your observation of going judgment for the bills that you already hold payment of £430 for on of the two bills, and the other only seems to be a matter of arrange<lb/>ments, as you feel disposed; but, firstly, there is a discrepancy in your letter as to there being two of £230 each by way of renewal. There is one £200 and another of £230, which together covers the one of £430 un<lb/>paid. In asking you to accept the same in renewal, I am only asking you do what you are advertising for, and also as the business of the bank, and, surely, as one of its proprietors, and holding a large stake in shares, £1 250, you cannc t have anything better to approve of as security for the time being, and payable business into the bargain. Your advertisement must really go for nothing if you decline, and especially for one of your largest proprietors. What do you think?

J. Baker: "Dear Sir,—In reply to your inquiry, I have much pleasure in informing you that the bank is doing a very satisfactory business, and it is under the consideration of the board to declare a dividend for the first half-year's working next month on ordi<lb/>nary shares. The founders' shares are not freely dealt in at present, but when this announcement is made, it must, of course, increase their value very much"—I did not take any more founders' shares—on October 4th, 1894, I wrote letter No. 73—this is the last paragraph: "I congratulate the management of the London and Scottish Bank on earning such a satisfactory dividend of 7 per cent, for its first half<lb/>year's existence in bad times"—I had received a balance sheet just before the liquidation of the company; not at that time—I knew about the 7 per cent, dividend by a postcard—I only held founders' shares—later on, in 1894, I felt some anxiety about the bank, and in consequence I wrote No. 75 on October 30th, 1894: "Dear Sirs,—Whatever you attempt to explain fully to mine of the 25th inst. Cannot possibly justify the evasion of issuing report and balance sheet and your misrepresentition of facts concerning the same. You wrote me in April, May, and June, asserting every time the auditors were auditing preparar tory to issue of the balance sheet: but why four months to audit your accounts?, and in August, extending the audit to six months, you wrote definitely, the accounts were finished by the auditors and the balance to follow in a few days. A month after this you fiatly contradicted this statement and all the previous correspondence, and that such was not true, but were then being audited, and a satisfactory report would come to hand in a few days. That again is nearly six weeks ago, and there is no report yet or summoned meeting, and your further reply of the 26th evades the matter again altogether. Common sense, of course, tells the merest novice what all this means, and that there is something radically wrong, and evidently mismanaged, and you must not suppose people as shareholders to swallow anything you like to write, neither can you be surprised that the whole of your correspondence on this matter is being submitted to the Board of Trade, and further action beingtakenother<lb/>wise.—Yours, etc., <hi rend="smallCaps">J.

When I was communicated with about the bank, with the object that I should take founders' shares in a concern which was about to be started and which might or might not prove a success, I did not take it to be speculative, I took it as an iovest ment—I did not think they were like debentures in a railway—with founders' shares I could not get anything in respect of them until the ordinary shareholders had got their seven per cent.—I knew I was subscrib ing to a company which was going to be formed and issued to the public—I did not understand that I was contributing to the expenses of forming a company—I got document 24 which I have identified—it came by port—I did not get with it the circular explaining what it meant—I have no recollection of seeing it before, only at the Mansion House—I think I did say that—there was nothing at all to show what the nominal value of the founders' shares was to be, only in subsequent correspondence—the basis of the scheme was, whoever applied for ordinary shares was to get one founders' certificate allotted to him—no person who applied for ordinary shares in a subsequent issue would have the right, with his application to have ordinary shares, to get a founders' share allotted to him—the profits were to be divided, half going to the holders of the deferred or fonnders shares and half to the holders of the ordinary shares—then by a later pros<lb/>' pectus 1 ascertained that that allotment of one founders' share meant an allotment of one founders' share at par, which I should have to pay for at par, whatever par might be—I accepted it that it was £10—in the subse<lb/>quent prospectus it is stated that the allotment of founders' shares to me, if I applied for ordinary shares, is to be an allotment at par—there is no statement so far as to what par is—upon the same prospectus there is the statement, "Brokers, Clayton and Bullock"—I did not know who Clayton and Bullock were—the appearance of the name on the prospectus which says, "The subscriptions to some of the deferred shares will defray the registration, legal, and other expenses, as prescribed by the agreement of March 10th, 1892, between the above corporation and A, F.

               <p>in the next fortnight or three weeks, and if I desired founders' shares I was to fill up an application and return it at my earliest convenience and that the issue price of the founders' shares was to be £10 to any person who wanted to takefounders' shares without taking ordinary shares—it was upon that that I subscribed—as the founders' shares were £10 I subscribed £10, believing they would be of the value of £10 in the bank—Ithought I was not onlygoing to get value for my money, but that I was going to make agood deal of money out of it—it was represented so—that was my object in applying—if at the time I applied I was paying this 10 per cent or 15 per cent., for an application for founders' shares, and if I deferred my payment for founders' shares for some time and then sold my founders' shares in the mean time at a good profit, that would enable me to take up more founders" shares than I actually had money to pay for and make a profit on it, but I did not buy them to speculate in that way; I took them for an invest<lb/>ment—I took it as an investment, so that it would repay me in my older days when I could not work—the first batch of shares that I applied for for myself was 10, I think—the £1,250 I invested was to form a provision for my old age—it was all paid by me eventually—there are my cheques fo it—the next lot was in the name of my wife, for myself—I suppose I should be quite justified in doing that in any company—that is a family matter—I paid the money—Mrs. E. Haley is my wife, and S. M. Haley is my widowed mother—there was only one lot in the name of S. M. Haley; all the others. were in the names of my wife and myself, I think—15 were mine, 25 were S. M.

Haley—I got a letter on February 9th, 1893, in which reference is made to the fact that there is to be an issue then of the prospectus for ordinary shares, inviting applications for ordinary shares; and it is pointed out that I could have a few more fonnders' shares without the obligation if application was made before the public issue of the prospectus—I got a letter from Mr. Baker, dated March 19th, 1893, it which he says, "I am in receipt of your esteemed favour of yesterday's date, but really I do not see how we can offer more than 4 per cent, upon deposits"; and on April 17th, 1893, he wrote this letter to me: "I am desired to inform you that we are now in a position to undertake banking business," etc.; and on May 8th, 1893, I received this: "Notice is hereby given, that the interest allowed," etc.—with regard to what took place as to Renter's is that there were two bills for £430 each, which I had given on account of money I had to pay for the founders' shares, and when the time came I wanted one renewed, I was prepared to retire the other, and for that purpose I sent up the £430, including the deposit—then, as a matter of fact, they told me that they could not get that bill back, because those bills had been lodged by them with Messrs. Renter for the advertising in connection with the company, and that they tried to get the bill back by the payment of the £430 I sent, but as they could not do it, they sent me back my cheque for £430, which I had sent up, and which had not been used, but I received that too late to meet the bills—in the result, Renter's, who had the bills when they fell due, issued a writ against me to recover the money on the bills—the bank, through Mr. Baker, undertook really to defend the action, and see what he could do—in answer to my letter to settle the matter—he did settle with Reuter's;</p>

               <p>shares—I also received a circular similar to 189 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)enclosing the advanced proof of the prospectus—the winding up says, "To secure any founders' shares your application ought to reach me during the next few dajs on the enclosed form"—I received also letter similar to 190, enclosing a list of the names of the proposed officers of the bank, dated in Decem<lb/>ber, 1892—191 is the list of the names of the proposed officers, etc., which was sent to me—I looked through the names of the proposed officers—among the governors I find "W. J. Carruthers Wain"—I had three separate lists—they came at different times, I think—I also received the circular letter dated December 15th, 1892 (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 192) (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), begin<lb/>ning "I am desirous of keeping within as few hands as possible the founders' shares of our bank, believing that apart from their intrinsic value, they will command a very large premium within a few weeks of the public issue. Of the few founders' shares remaining to be subscribed (without the obli<lb/>gation of taking ordinary shares of the minimum amount of £400), would you care to take up 30, or any part thereof, at the issue price of £10, giving me the option at the end of three months of re-purchasing these shares at £11, or £1 premium, so that in the event of the shares not rising to £11, or a bigger figure, you would be netting a profit of 10 per cent, for the three months, or at the rate of 40 per cent, per annum? The scrip will, of course, remain in your possession. We are making every arrangement to publicly issue the prospectus next month, and our bank premises in Lombard Street, London, and Paris will be opened to commence business for the year"—having received those letters, I decided to apply for some founders' shares for myself, and I went up to the office at 35, Lombard Street, somewhere about March, 1893, I should think; I cannot quite remember—I found the office with the name up—I asked to see Mr. A. F. Baker—that is the name of the secretary on all these documents—I saw A. F. Baker (Singleton)—I told him from the result of communications I had had from him in different letters, I thought it would be a good investment to buy founders' shares, and I proposed to buy the 12—I paid him for them; if not on that particular morning, within a morning or two—I gave him a cheque for £150, out of which he gave me £30 change—it was drawn on Messrs. Saville Brothers, brewers, Stratford—after I had done that, when I got home I received the letter (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> No. 193) (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), dated January 23rd; my interview was prior to January 23rd: "I enclose you herewith scrip for your fully<lb/>paid 12 founders' shares in the above corporation"; then the number of the scrip is given—about March, 1893, I went up again to the office with Mr. Birchall, where I saw Singleton—while in the office Mr. Beall came into the room—Singleton said to me, "Allow me to introduce you to Mr. F. J. Baker, our new secretary"—shortly after that date I was attending a meeting of the shareholders of the Cassidy Hill Gold Mines; a gentle<lb/>man got up to speak, and, to my astonishment, he was Mr. Beall; there was a shareholder in the room, and I asked him, and he said,</p>
               <p>" Edward Beall"; I said, "Why, it is the same gentleman who was introduced to me as the new secretary of the London Scottish"—I think it was on that identical morning that Mr. Birchall suggested to me that he should change the whole of these ordinaries into all founders' shares on the recommendation of A. F. Baker—he pointed them out as a good</p>

In these two prospectuses I produce, the name of Wain does not appear—those were the prospectuses on which I applied for my founders' shares; those or similar—my last application for shares was about January, 1893; I should not like to bind myself to one day—it was just before the letter of January 23rd, from A. F. Baker, in which he says; "Dear Sir,—I enclose you herewith scrip for your fully-paid 12 founders' shares in the above corporation"—I do not think I applied for any shares on the prospectus of March, 1893—Mr. Birchall's shares were exchanged from ordinary shares to founders' shares—the first time I ever saw Mr. Wain was about April, 1895, at his office in Finsbury Circus—if Mr. Wain said that he never heard of my name until that time in 1895, I should not contradict that—when I saw him, and had told my story, he did not tell me that what I was telling him related to events which had happened before he had become director of the company—what he told me at the interview was practically the same as what he told me in the letter produced—if it be a fact that Mr. Wain did not become a director of the company until March 17th, that would be true, because all that had taken place between us with regard to the founders' shares was before March 17th—the correspondence that I had was with Mr. A.

               <p>ending September, 1893"—then I saw that the governors were Carruthers Wain, Octavias Stokes, Harrison Lambert, and Eden Erskine Greville; but I took very little notice of that, because I did not know any of the parties—I see at the third paragraph on page 3: "The dividend of 7 per cent, per annum just paid as the result of the bank's operations during the past six months is sufficient evidence of the profitable nature of its business "; but I never received anything—accompanying the prospectus I think there was an application form for shares, but I got mixed up a little bit with Mr. Lloyd Morgan—having read the prospectus through, I deter<lb/>mined to take some shares, and I wrote the letter No. 84 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)of October 31st, 1893: "Dear Sir,—Enclosed please receive a cheque for £12 on application for 12 £10 shares in London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, and for which I enclose the application form filled up.

Lloyd Morgan and Co., Stock and Share Dealers. Telegraphic Address,' Physically,' London. 4, Copthall Chambers, Throgmorton Street, Lon<lb/>don, E.G.

                  </hi>. I was a licenced victualler, I am out of business now—about the beginning of March, 1893, I received by post a copy of the prospectus of the London and Scottish Banking Corporation—I think I can identify which one it was; a similar one to that (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 5) it gave the names of the governors, W. J. Carruthers Wain, Robert Scrafton, Octavius Stokes, T. Harrison Lambert, and Eden Erskine Greville—I had an enclosure from the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi> some<lb/>where about the time I received the prospectus in 1893—I read the prospectus and the enclosure—I noticed some of the names of the brokers; one name I know; Messrs. Clayton and Bullock, the brokers for London—I received at the same time a copy of the little pamphlet or book on "Banks and Banking "; the author of it was A. F. Baker, I think, the secretary of the company—that made an impression on me, because when I read the pamphlet I thought it was an excellent thing for the bank to have such an efficient secretary who had written a work on Banks and Banking—I tought it was a most excellent addition to the bank—I noticed that these gentlemen, Carruthers Wain, Lambert, and the others were called governors; that impressed me, because I thought of the meaning of the word governors, and the Bank of England having governors, I thought it was a substantial bank—I take the <hi rend="italic">Daily Graphic</hi> in—I could not say if they sent it co me—they might have sent it to me—I took it in at the time—one was something similar to that—it had four views: three or four—I thought it looked very grand—in conse<lb/>quence of reading all those documents, I applied for 40 ordinary shares, which would entitle me to one founders' share—I sent £21—I got a receipt for the money and the certificate in course of time—I saw the common seal of the company which is affixed, May 13th, 1893—this is a</p>

               <p>certificate for the founders' share, and why I took the 40 shares Was because it was represented to me as very valuable—prior to getting my certificates I got this letter (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit No.</hi> 8) dated April 17th saying they were in a position to undertake any banking business with which I might be pleased to favour them, because of the scale of interest—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) I paid altogether in the aggregate £401—in the first instance I paid up £201; that represents £5 per share—I afterwards got the circular (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 11) dated May 19th, 1893; that suggests that I should pay up in full—I was asked whether I would sign the form; it very much upset me when I read this—I cannot remember whether I signed the form; I remember I wrote and told them I could not pay the balance; I was not in a position to do it—I wrote this: "In answer to yours of the 19th, in accordance with the prospectus, I shall be unable to pay up my shares in full"—I got this letter on May 31st (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 12), saying: "In accordance with the circular letter addressed to you on the 19th inst., I am desired to inform you that at a meeting held on the 30th inst. it was resolved that in accordance with the request of a number of shareholders, the remaining £5 per share can be paid up on or before July Ist next. I am desired to remind you that interest will accrue from actual date of payment"—in answer to that I believe I wrote, suggesting that I should like to see the secretary of the bank—I got an answer, saying that he would see me at one day's notice—that is the letter I received—I believe I did see the secretary after that; I do not see the secretary here—he was a short man—I think A. F. Baker was the first secretary; F. J.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230156"/>
               <p>—that Mr. Wain would pay my expenses, or my expenses would be paid to go down—I did go to Edinburgh; I can not say the date; it was on a Sunday night I travelled, to be there on Monday morning—I did not go to any place—when I got to Edinburgh on Monday morning I did not know the place; and I was walking up the square, some place where the meeting was to be held, and I met Mr. Wain—I did not know where the bank premises or offices were supposed to be—there were no bank premises there, not of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Company—I met Mr. Wain in the street—he took me to an hotel; I wanted some refreshment, travelling all night—I ultimately got to a place called Dowell's Rooms, where the meeting was held—the room was crammed; there might be 60 people there, or there might be more—Mr. Wain, I believe, took the chair—I knew no other officials—I was totally unacquained with the officials of the bank, except the secretary and Mr. Wain: the secretary, F. J. Baker, not A. F. Baker—it was very stormy indeed; you could not hear anybody speak—they made an attempt, a dozen at a time—I have been to a good many meetings, and I never went to one more noisy than that—I cannot tell you what they were speaking about—they were making a noise about the chairman's speech; they would not believe in it; they made all manner of remarks—there was a very great disturbance; I heard that—it was during the meeting that the noise was—it did not begin at once—there was a rush into the room; they broke into the room—they were to be excluded, I believe, but they got into the room by breaking the door open, and they all rushed in pell mell—They said the bank was a swindle and a roguery, and Dickens knows what they did not say—the Scotchmen would not have it at any price<lb/>copies of the directors' report and balance-sheet were produced at that meeting; I had one sent me—I will not be positive whether that was, but I think so—I am not very much used to reports, but I thought it was a very good one—I saw in it that the net profit for the year amounted to £39,183 17s. 11d.—I can not tell you what became of the resolution! had gone down to second—I did second it—I was more towards the door, and the hall was packed full—I was asked to do a certain thing, and I did it according to the best of my ability—I can not say if anybody heard it—I am satisfied I seconded the resolution, but it was on the statement of the profits the bank had made, and people trying to wreck the company; I thought it was a very unjust thing—there was a tremendous row and bother—they closed the meeting the best way they could—I did not come back with Mr. Wain: I went alone and I came back alone; the only gentleman I knew by sight was Mr. Wain—I got expenses for going up there after a little trouble—a gentleman took me round the corner to a refreshment shop and paid me £3—he was a gentleman out of the bank, not at Edinburgh—I think it was some time after, the latter end of January or February; I think it was some time in January—I had applied several times for my expenses; about two or three times; the third time I got it, I think; I got £3—I could not say if it was a clerk in the London and Scottish Bank who paid me; I was totally unac<lb/>quainted with the officials, but he took me round the corner and paid me three sovereigns—he gave me no reason for taking me round the corner rather than paying me over the counter; he said, "Come along with me</p>

Morgan"—the circular says it is from Lloyd Morgan and Co,—in the autumn of last year, 1898, I became acquainted with Mr. Joseph Davis—I think it was a little before then—under his advice I commenced an action in the High Court against Beall and Singleton to recover back my money—when I was paying my money to the company for my shares I never dreamt that Beall and Singleton had anything to do with the company; I never had the slightest idea—I knew nothing of them before, only by reading about them in the public papers; I never knew them by sight, only by name—that case came on for trial before the Lord Chief Justice—after one or two witnesses had been called on my behalf, the defendants, through their Counsel, submitted to judgment for the full amount—the full amount claimed, with costs, was given—I never got anything from my judgment, not a penny—the defendant, Mr. Beall, filed his petition within 24 hours—I knew them before the bank was in existence, only by reading of Beall and Singleton in the newspapers—I knew them by name before this; I knew them before the Scottish Bank was started—I knew them by name, reading in the newspapers about them—if I had known that either of them was connected with this enterprise I would not have parted with my money, not a farthing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. I have been in business ever since I was a boy; I have had to work—I was a licensed victualler in the country and London—I mean that I had had some dealings in shares in various companies—I never had any dealings with Clayton and Bullock, but I knew they were gentlemen on the Stock Exchange—we look upon every man on the Stock Exchange as a gentleman—I am proud of saying that; I am not a member of the Stock Exchange, nor of the bar—a member of the Stock Ex<lb/>change is always very cautious of allowing his name to be on a prospectus unless it is very sound—I take it for granted that Messrs. Clayton and Bullock would not allow their names to be on the prospectus unless the company was a sound one, because they were members of the Stock Ex<lb/>change—I got that prospectus on or about March 9th, 1893—I cannot say within a few days—it was as nearly as possible about that day—my solicitor has the original prospectus of mine: perhaps the Treasury might have it now; I think the Treasury has all my papers—I have the original prospectus—I did not get any other prospectus at this time, only one—when I received it I made up my mind to make an application—I took a few days to consider it—this picture in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Graphic</hi> did not in<lb/>duce me to apply for these shares, because I believe I had my shares be<lb/>fore the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi> was issued, but it might have an influence on my having a good opinion of the bank, but it could not have had an influence on my applying if I saw it afterwards—I cannot give you any opinion about whether the pictures of that bank were a fraudulent representation; it would not dp, perhaps, for me to answer yes or no on that point—I cannot say it was a misrepresentation—these things have a pleasing influence—this picture (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Graphic</hi> of March 11th</p>

               <p>fairly represents the outside of the premises; the first customer it had was me, I think—I said in my evidence that I was induced by the state<lb/>ment that there were governors of the bank; I did not know any of them, only one person—my humble experience always taught me that the governors of a bank were directors—when I came to find the governors' names on the prospectus it conveyed to me that they were directors of the bank—when I saw the names of Lord Waterpark and Lord Elibank as directors of the bank I thought it was a sound concern—I saw Lord Waterpark; I did not know anything about him—I saw the name on the prospectus; I considered he was in office, and that he was on the pro<lb/>spectus as a trustee—this is my writing (<hi rend="italic">His application</hi>)—I called at the bank in 1894, about going up to the meeting at Edinburgh—the chairman made a speech, but I could not hear with the noise—there was not much of a noise when I got to the meeting before the chairman began to make his speech—there was a very great amount of dissatisfaction among them—the balance-sheet and report had been circulated before the meeting—they were dissatisfied with the balance-sheet and the report; there is no doubt about it; and then the chairman spoke and tried to explain—I cannot tell you anything that the chairman said, if I could have heard it at the meeting I should remember some portion of it, but it was com<lb/>pletely drowned because of the disturbance—the Scotchmen, I tell you, fairly broke into the room; they came up with the reserve forces—I was up at the commencement, but I did not second it before the chair<lb/>man tried to speak—I had notice when to second it, and I did—I mean to say that the notice was given to me, and I got up and said I seconded it—I got up and seconded what I had never heard at all, because it was my duty to do so—I was asked to do it, and paid to do it; I was paid to go there to second the resolution, and I carried it out—I was not going to see the bank knocked into a cocked hat when it couid pay 125 per cent.—there might have been a discussion about the balance-sheet or about the report; how can I say if I did not hear it?—I got against the door because I thought that was the safest place—I could not distinguish very well what was being said—not being able to distinguish what was said, and not knowing what was done, I got the signal, and got up and seconded it—when I left that meeting I got dissatisfied; my mind was a little un<lb/>hinged soon after I left Scotland—I could not find the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation; that upset me a little; I thought of finding a fine building—I was a stranger in Edinburgh, but I could not find the bank there—I went to look for it at the address, George Street, I think it was—I got that address from the prospectus, and the meeting was to be called at Dowell's Rooms—I was not aware that the bank had given notice, of change of address, and had given a proper statutory notice to Somerset House—between the time I came back and the time I brought my action nothing was done by me, except keeping my papers; I got everything in course of time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. A. E. GILL</hi>. In bringing my action and making my claim I made no claim against Mr. Wain—I think the suggestion about my going to Scotland came from Mr. Wain; I had nothing to do with making any arrangement for Scotland; I was asked to go down, and I said I could not afford to go; they said they would pay my expenses—I am speaking of a conversation with Mr. Wain; I think I saw him at the bank; I do not know any other gentleman—I said that I could not afford to go down—he did not say, "Well, I will see what can be done;" he said, "I will pay your expenses," and I went on the understanding that my expenses would be paid—I did not know Mr. Lambert; I was totally unacquainted with the gentlemen at the bank, <hi rend="italic">bar</hi> Mr. Wain, and I had no idea the bank was going wrong, because they sent me so many letters—the few words I said at the meeting I believed were right, and I believed 1 was speaking the truth—I went down because I thought it was the best thing for the bank; they had sent me so many of these things that I could not believe but what the bank was right—I cannot say that Mr. Wain may not have had the same feeling that I had, I am not answerable for Mr. Wain; I should be very sorry—I made no com<lb/>plaint against Mr. Wain at the meeting in 1894—I did not say before the Alderman at the Mansion House, "I make no complaint against Mr. Wain "no more I do—when Mr. Wain asked me to go down he told me to second the resolution, nothing else that I know of—he always praised the company, always said it was earning good money, and was able to pay dividends, and all that sort of thing—if I said before the Magistrate that Mr. Wain said that the company was not prosperous it was wrong, because he had always said it was a prosperous bank—he has always praised the bank up to me in writing and in words—this is my signature to my deposition, immediately under the words: "Wain did not tell me if the company was prosperous or not; he simply asked me to go. <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY NORRIS</hi> "—I do not see now that there is much in the meaning of those words; he did not tell me; Mr. Wain might not have told me, or he might have told me—he has always told me the company was prosperous—he did not tell me if the company was prosperous or not, but simply asked me to go—he might have asked me to go; they put questions to me, and asked me whether he said that—I am satisfied with the signing of that—at the meeting in Scotland I could not hear what Mr. Wain said—those that were close to him I daresay could; shorthand writers are generally underneath the chairman's voice—if a shorthand writer was near the chairman he could hear what was said, or most of it, I should think; they do not sit at the other end of the room where they cannot hear, not as a rule.</p>

All I said was, "As a large shareholder perhaps one of the largest, I beg to second that"; those are the words—I holloaed that across the room—I discussed with Wain the affairs of this company on other occasions than the particular one when he asked me to go to Edinburgh, but I think only on one occasion; it was some time before the Edinburgh affair—he spoke very highly of the bank; I had it with the greatest assurance from Mr. Wain—it was shortly after Lord Waterpark and the noble Lords resigned, and I thought there was some<lb/>thing wrong, and I went to Mr. Wain, and he assured me; I either had a letter from him or I attended on him personally, but he assured me faithfully that the bank was sound, and was doing good business, that my I money was invested safely, and I need not worry at all—it was in conse<lb/>quence of hearing of Lord Waterpark's resignation that I went to see Wain, or I had a letter from him; I will not be positive which, but I had an assurance from Mr. Wain.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. Mr. Le Ruey had been in the City in business for many years—as this was his business, I suppose he knew a good deal about companies—he was going to place some shares, both founders' and ordinary, and get a commission—that commission was for placing shares, not an additional payment for sending out these prospec<lb/>tuses—I should not think our chairman would attempt to place shares in a company in which he did not believe at the time—whatever was due was paid—the commission that would have to be paid was paid in cash, not in shares—in all there was a commission of £310; that was paid, and also all the account, whatever it was, in respect of the distribution of prospectuses, was also paid—we should get these prospectuses from the printer, and then we should send them out—we dis<lb/>tributed practically the bulk from March 6th to March 8th—I do not remember who the printer was who sent them to us—our firm has known Mr. Beall many years—in the ordinary course of business we have done, one way and another, a good deal of business with him, and have always been paid—so far as I was concerned, or our com<lb/>pany, there was no distinction to be drawn in what was done in respect to this company and any other company for which we were acting—I should think that it was quite usual, especially about this time, 1892 and 1893, to issue founders' shares with a view to provide the preliminary expenses for the formation of a company—when a man is going to form a company and to issue it to the public the expense is very considerable if he wants to advertise properly—in the ordinary course of issuing a com<lb/>pany and inviting a large amount of capital there would be nothing un<lb/>usual in £6,000 or £8,000 being spent in preliminary expenses—one of the first things to be done would be to provide the money to pay for the preliminary printing and advertising of the prospectuses, and then subse<lb/>quently for the registration of the company when sufficient money is in hand—you have first to get sufficient money in hand, and when you have got sufficient money in hand for advertising and printing, the usual thing is to register the company—it is quite a usual thing for clerks, mere nominees, to sign as signatories, one for each share, so as to make the seven signatories necessary for registration.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We pursued our ordinary course in declining to send out the prospectuses until we were paid—I cannot tell whether Mr. Le Ruey placed any shares in this company; I had nothing to do with the matter.</p>

B. for £50, and under the dates of March 6th, llth, and other dates, payments to persons called Wheeles and Wholes and Whales—I also produce a certified extract from the bank ledger of the account of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, Limited, with our bank, ranging from March 22nd, 1892, to December 31st, 1894—I also produce what is called the order-book of our bank—on page 277 I find that our bank was appointed the bank of the Scottish Corporation by a resolution—any orders we may receive to open accounts for public companies or orders from customers are generally put in the order-book—the resolution is signed by four directors, W. J. Carruthers Wain, Octavius Stokes, Eden E. Greville, and Thomas Harrison Lambert, dated March 16th, 1893—I also produce a certified extract of the account of Messrs. Beall and Co. (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 303) with our bank, ranging from November, 1892, to January, 1895—on October 5th, 1894, there is a cheque drawn to Singleton for £5, and at the very commencement of the account there are a couple of cheques to Meeking—those cheques were cashed by our bank by the bank-notes which are also shown in the second column of this paper—document 325 is a certified extract from the cashier's counter-book; and supposing a customer paid in bank-notes to his account, those notes would be numbered in the cashier's counter book—this extract shows that on August 22nd, 1893, £100 was paid in £10 notes to the credit of the account of Messrs. Beall and Co.—the number of those notes are 51,861 to 61,870, and are the proceeds, or part of the proceeds, of a cheque for £250 which is mentioned in the earlier <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 324, drawn oh August 21st—document 326 shows that on May 9th three £10 notes were paid into the same account of Mr. Beall—the numbers of</p>

No cheques on the Scottish bank's account would be authorised by me unless signed by two directors, and countersigned by the secretary or the assistant-secretary—for the purpose of my knowing the signatures of the directors and so forth, the signatures in the book are recorded there next the names—the names I have here as persons entitled to sign are W. J. Carruthers Wain, Octavius Stokes, E. E Greville, Thomas Harrison Lambert, directors; and F. J. Baker, secretary—that makes it clear that Beall had no right to sign or have anything to do with that account—I have brought two letters addressed to me, of March 21st and March 23rd, 1893—there are two apparently of March 21st; the first is: "Herewith I send you the authority of Mr. A. F. Baker, and shall be glad if you will transfer at his request, under the direction of our directors, the sum of £3,477 10s. from his account. Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">F. J.

Baker's account to the account of the London and Scottish Bank—on March 23rd we got a letter from the London and Scottish Bank: "To the Manager of the London and Midland Bank, Limited, March 23rd. Dear Sir, We are aware of the fact that Mr. A. F. Baker has paid into his account at your bank, for the purpose of clearing, cheques drawn to the order of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, limited, and we beg to say that this had our sanction, inasmuch as at the time this was done our corporation had no clearing bank, and Mr. Baker did so merely to facilitate the encashing of the moneys on behalf of the corporation.

F. Baker for some time—we never paid in the bank's cheque to Mr. Baker's account.</p>

The offices were nicely fitted sp as a proper banking establishment—I went to the Anglo-Continental, and was there a year—from that time I had nothing whatever to do with Mr. Beall—after I left the Anglo Continental I went to a Mr. Wright's, a relative of mine unfortunate'y—I was with him for about two years, I think—then I went to Southsea—Mr. Mason was a gentleman whom I knew, and who knew my signature, I should think—when I was asked to give evidence about this case, it wan about June, 1899—from the time that I ceased to have any connection with this bank at all I never troubled myself about the bank's affairs—I left when everybody else left, when it came to grief—I remained there as long as I could—during the whole time I was there there was nothing in the slightest degree to excite my suspicion that this was not a bona fide busi<lb/>ness carried on in the proper way; I saw nothing to make me think there was anything wrong—I see that I signed the agreement on August 19th 1892—I do not know if I could have signed that without seeing it; I may have known it was an agreement, I cannot say—I see that certainly, but I do not remember signing it—I do not suggest that it was concealed from me that it was an agreement; I simply say my memory is defective on the point—I thought the agreement was a mere form gone through, and that I had to sign any documents I was asked to—I knew that I was acting as a signatory, and, being a signatory, I was also a first director until the others came on the scene, but I understood that they took the respon<lb/>sibility for what we did as signatories; in fact, I know that the directors did take that responsibility on March 17th, when they first came—I thought there was a difference between a signa<lb/>tory and a director—I did not know that I was a director for the time being; I thought I was a signatory—what I mean is that I thought there was a difference between the first directors and the other directors—I do not know that the application forms that came in accord<lb/>ing</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at 140, Fenchurch Street, and sell cigarettes and sweet<lb/>stuff—prior to 1892 I knew Mr. Singleton and Mr. Beall—I first heard of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation soon after the start, I think—I asked Singleton if there was any room in the bank for me; if there was any position—he said that he would ask the directors, and see if there was room for me, and a few days afterwards he told me that there would be probably a place for me, a position in the bank as a bill discounter, a bill clerk discounting bills—they told me that they required an inspector of agen<lb/>cies—they put the matter before the directors, and Mr. Stokes recom<lb/>mended me also to the directors that I was qualified for that position, and they engaged me there at £200 a year, and he introduced me to the directors generally, Mr. Wain and Mr. Lambert and the others, and I was then appointed inspector of agencies, and bill clerk also—I cannot exactly remember the date; it is so many years ago now; I believe it was entered in the minute-book when they engaged me—it was in March, 1893—the minute of March 17th, 1893, is "Proposed by R. Clark and seconded by W. Osborn, that Mr. F. J. Baker is hereby appointed assistant secretary at a remuneration to be hereafter agreed upon"—I was not present at that meeting; I knew Singleton at that time by the name of Singleton, but he had a different name in the bank; Baker they used to call him—I did not know him by any other name—I never heard of Jacob B. Morrison and Co. till this case came on—I never had a cheque from Jacob B. Morrison and Co.—in the year 1892 I did not have cheques from Jacob B. Morrison and Co.—I was appointed inspector of agencies soon after I entered the bank, and I went and saw several people in dif<lb/>ferent parts of Scotland, and told them that we had started business, and that we were open to receive proposals from them to do business with them—I used to report everything I did, to the directors—the copy-book shows the business done with or by the agents—all the letters written to the agents used to be copied in the copy-book—beyond the copy letter-book</p>

               <p>I used to have a small book to show the different names we had; the people that I had called upon—I did not keep any books at all; the books were kept by the clerks—the copy letter-book showed any business done with the agents; nothing beyond that, I think—I must tell you that I had rather uphill work while I was in Scotland; all the Australian banks had smashed—theagents proposed several businesses to the directors; the directors had to do direct with them; of course I had nothing to do with them—it was my special department; I had to report everything to the directors—there was some bill business done—there were some pro<lb/>positions for business—the agents proposed business to the directors; I do not think it was accepted—no business was, in fact, done with the agents as far as I remember—I went to Scotland once to see agents—I got instructions as to what I was to do from the direc<lb/>tors, and sometimes Mr. Beall, who was the financial manager there—towards the end of 1894 I remember the name of the Atlas Contracting Syndicate—I had something to do with that—I do not quite recollect who spoke to me about it first; either it was Mr. Beall or Mr. Cooper; I think it was Mr. Beall, as far as I remember—it was in 1894, about a month or so before the company was registered—he told me that I should become a director, as he was going to bring out a refuse destructor—I had studied the subject—this is my signature to the memorandum of association of that company—I was going to have one share when I signed it, but at that time I did not have anything at all—Mr. Cooper had given me £2 or £3 when T attended the meeting, but I did not have anything at the time I signed it—I had my fees, £2 or £3, for attending the meeting as a director, as far as I remember—I do not think I had anything before that—I do not remember having a guinea—I made a mistake at the Mansion House; I told Mr. Bodkin at the time—I do not quite recollect what I said at the Mansion House—I apologised at the time—I became a director afterwards of the Atlas Contract Syndicate—the offices were at No. 39, Lombard Street—it was not at the same place as the London and Scottish Bank; it was 31, Lom<lb/>bard Street—I believe Singleton used to be in the same offices—I did not know his business at all—I did not know his name; I always addressed him as Singleton—I saw no name there at all—there were three rooms, or two rooms, I think—I do not remember whether the name of the Lon<lb/>don and North British Discount Company was up there—I know it was the Atlas—there were three doors, or two doors—the name of the London and North British Discount Company was not on the same door as the Atlas Contracting Syndicate—I do not recollect whether it was on the outside door—the business of the London Contracting Syndicate was to bring out this destructor; the letters patent—we did bring it out—I understood the object of the syndicate was to find the money in order to bring out the other thing—there were never more than seven shares taken in the Atlas Syndicate—there was the signatories' £7: that was all the money the Atlas Contract Syndicate ever had, as far as I remember—this company was called the London Refuse Company—I have seen the installation of the "London Refuse Steam Generator and E'ectrical Power Corporation, Limited "at West<lb/>minster, and several other places—I have seen the very furnace itself; the</p>

               <p>destructor itself, and a splendid thing it was too—the company was brought out, and it did not take—it was issued to the public—the London and Scottish Bank found the money for paying for the advertisements—they were going to get the money back—the arrangetnent was, allotting to them so many shares in the Refuse Company, as compensation for the money that they advanced—I cannot tell you the exact amount spent in advertising; it was a very large sum, I know—I believe there were some subscriptions which were sent back again—I cannot recollect now, so many years back—it never went to allotment; it did not take—I have seen a Mr. John Sheridan come into the bank, but I did not know him personally—he had the patent of the Atlas Syndicate—he was the person who proposed the patent—I am not certain of the man, there were two Sheridans—he had the patent of Levett's atent Destructor—that is the same destructor as I have been talking about—he proposd to sell it—I believe, as far as I remember, he was going to sell it to the company—I had two or three pounds for my attendances as a director—Mr. Cooper, the secretary of the Atlas Con<lb/>tracting Syndicate, paid those; they had a banking account at the London and Scottish.</p>

I have carried on business at the same offices in Fenchurch Street over 20 years—I speak English, and a good many other languages—I never kept a shop in my life; I am much above that—as a general merchant I used to do a large business in the Levant—I came into the bank about March, 1893, I think; before that I knew Mr. Stokes, one of the directors—he was a great friend of my friends in the Levant; in Roumania—he was the General British Consul in Roumania, and he knew a great many of the people with whom I was connected over there—he knew that I had been employed in a dis<lb/>count company before in a large way—I was 12 years in the General Credit and Discount Company, 7, Lothbury—we used to turn over about a million a day—my business there was connectied with bills, and the sorb of work that would come to a bank, except paying money over the counter—I was also introduced by Mr. Stokes to the other directors; he told the other directors that he had known me as a gentleman who had been employed at this General Credit and Discount Company for a number of years, and recommended them to employ me—there was some little discussion, and they were going; to consider it, and they did employ me—I had a small room at the bank in which I sat—I acted chiefly as discount clerk, bill clerk, and, besides that, I was appointed inspector of agencies—my relatives are bankers in Constantinople; my father and uncle and I have been brought up there—I knew Mr. Brandon as the solicitor to the company—the proposal that I should visit Scotland was confirmed—the general object of my visit was to see the various people whose names were upon the prospectus as the agents in Scotland—I was to go round and pay a visit to them, tell them that the bank was starting business then, and see whether I could get them to do any business with it—I went to see what business I could get from them—the people I was to go to where the people who had already agreed, according to the prospectus, tobe the agents—I went to them as the agents of the bank to see them, spoke to them, and proposed business with them; and, if they had any</p>

V. and J. R. Orr—they are very good people—we bad a meeting at Messrs. Orr's office—they were going to write to the directors to inquire and settle up the different things they wanted to know—they were people connected with the banking business there; I met them—it was with the object of discussing the question of what business they were going to do with us—they told me they were writing directly to the directors—when I came back from my tour in Scotland to the bank I looked after the business there in the ordinary way—I went to Edinburgh, Inverness, and Aberdeen, and met with a good deal of difficulty on account of the competition of the banks there—it was just the time the Australian banks were failing; there was a great commotion at the time; I was there in Scotland, because it was the time of the collapse of the Australian banks—all the Scotch banks were jealous of us—it was not only the collapse of the Australian banks, but the Scotch banks did not want the new competition to be starting, and the Clydesdale Bank took the lead in that opposition, I believe—the main object of the business I had to discuss and dispose of was the making of advances and discounts, and so on, for business people, for trade pur<lb/>poses; and, as I suppose we were to go into competition with much older banks, we should have to put up with business which was, perhaps a little worse than the Londonand Westminster Bank would get—the London</p>

               <p>Refuse Company was to be promoted to work the licence of a patent of Mr. Livet, who had invented a process by means of which refuse could not only be destroyed, but could be utilised as a force; that is, as a motive power in generating steam when you burnt it up—that was shown to be a thing which could be done very much more cheaply than it had been hitherto done—there was a trial of that at Halifax; an installation was fitted up there—this is the prospectus—the directors are Mr. H. Seton<lb/>Karr, M.P.; Sir Oriel Viveash Tanner, K.C.B.; George F. Priestley, Wheater White, T. Harrison Lambert, and J. Evelyn Williams; the secretary is Mr. Cooper, and Mr. Eden E.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. My connection with the company was a purely formal one—I have been about 11 years with Messrs. Brandon and Nicholson, solicitors—I am still with them—they acted for the Sheridans in various actions about this time—they were also acting as the solicitors at this time for the London and Scottish Bank; and they acted as solicitors for the London and Scottish Bank during 1893, and up to April or May in 1894—during that time they had a large number of actions and various matters entrusted to them by the London and Scottish Bank—either actions by the bank or against the bank—I cannot tell you if this miatter of the British Refuse Patent was first introduced to the London and Scottish Bank by Messrs. Brandon for Mr. Sheridan—I do not know that Messrs. Brandon and Nicholson were acting for Mr. Sheridan in this matter before it was introduced to the London and Scottish Bank—Mr. Sheridan was at our office nearly every day—Mr. Greville was there a good deal—that was before the introduction of this British Refuse Steam Generator Company to the London and Scottish Bank—I think when the company was formed it was registered by our firm, Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am an accountant—early in 1894 I became secretary of the Atlas Contracting Syndicate—I was asked to do so by Mr. Beall—he said it was for the purpose of promoting the London Refuse Company—my first duties were to go down by a special train with the Press to Halifax, and explain the methods of the London Refuse Com<lb/>pany—Iwas to explain to the Press the methods of this particular de<lb/>structor—I read them up after Mr. Beall had spoken to me about it—I cannot describe the documents I read, but they were documents explain<lb/>ing the process—I explained it all to the Press the next day in the special train—the offices of the company were at 31, Lombard Street, I think—I believe that was Singleton's office; he was in it—after our journey to Halifax, and my explanations to the Press, there were a number of notices in the papers regarding this process; the notices were not from my explanation—we went down to see a demonstration by the engineer at Halifax, and it was from that that the Press took their notices—I think it was about February 13th, 1894, that we went, perhaps a little before then—the item in the accounts of the Atlas Syndicate, "Hotel expenses, February 18th, £195 18s. 3d.," was for dining car, refreshments for all the members of the Press and the managers of the vestries who went down; refreshment expenses in the train down, and lunch and dinner at the hotel afterwards—I was installed at the office as secretary—the directors who attended to the business were Mr. Oram and a Mr. Pappadaki, two directors of the Atlas Syndicate—those were the only two—Mr. Oram kept the book—I did not as secretary, because the secre<lb/>tary does not keep the books, the ledger and the cash-book and the journal, as a rule—a director does not, as a rule—there was a share</p>

I cannot account for—I signed that under a misconception, it being the first I had ever signed—the printed heading is, "List of Persons Holding Shares in the Atlas Syndicate at June 14th"—I signed that as a list of persons holding shares up to that date, thinking it meant signatories only—the meetings of the London Refuse Company were held in the first place in the board-room of the London and Scottish Bank, and afterwards in the board-room of the registered office of the company at 18, Eldon Street, Mr. Wain's offices—the London Refuse Company never earned 6d. during its existence—this (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 255) is in Mr. Oram's handwriting, and signed by me as secretary: "This is to certify that the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, Limited, of 35, Lombard Street, London, E.C., is the pro<lb/>prietor of 30,000 shares of £1 each in the London Refuse Steam Gene<lb/>rator and Electrical Power Corporation, Limited, numbered 125,618 to 155,617, all inclusive, subject to the articles of association and regulations of the company, and that the sum of 20s., has been paid in respect of each of such shares.

St. Margaret's, Westminster—the Shoreditch Vestry did not take it 1902. during my time, but they now have what is practically the same thing; 1903. they were some of the men who attended in the special train—this is a 1904. letter of mine to the present liquidator (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—no business was ever done; never, except that one.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. I had known Mr. Beall before I was employed as secretary, or he would not have employed me; he acted as solicitor for me afterwards—the item for £195 for hotel expenses does not include the special train; it is for hotel expenses—there were perhaps 70 who went down; I cannot recollect at this time—there were three corridor carriages full; I do not know how many a corridor carriage holds exactly; it depends how you pack them—people from the vestries also went down—when we got there a test was made, and an explanation given by Mr. Glaskin, the engineer—I believe Mr. Cheesewright, the engineer, was also there—the test was perfectly satisfactory; everyone, so far as I knew, came away believing it was a very valuable thing—I cannot say that the articles which were found together in the form of a pamphlet were articles that were written by the Press after having seen it; as comments, and not as advertisements—a certain amount was paid for advertising—I should say they were simply comments written by men who eame down by that special train—I think I can safely say that they were not advertisements at all—the payment of £75 to the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> was for the purchase of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> with the illustrations and comments in it, and they were distributed all over the place—I do not know if the syndicate bought 3,000 copies; I know that very large quantities of illustrated papers were bought because they contained the pictures of what had taken place at Halifax, and it was done to show what could be done and what had taken place at Halifax at the test—I paid visits to the vestries for the purpose of getting this system adopted—I think I went with Mr. Glaskin and Mr. Cheesewright at different times for that purpose—there was an illustration at Keighley, in York shire; I cannot say whether it was by a vestry—afterwards there was an installation at Westminster—I believe that contmues to the present day; and after the time I have been talking of tiiere was an installation by the Shoreditch Vestry—I believe the British company owned patents for the United Kingdom; T had nothing to do with the British—I knew that the British company were the holders of the patents for the United Kingdom, because the Atlas bought them of them—I think there was an action threatened by Mrs. Livet against the London Refuse Company, which was then stopped—it was for the purpose of preventing the shares being distributed except to her;</p>

I think I have some know<lb/>ledge of City matters—I am not a chartered accountant; I am an ac<lb/>countant of some years' standing—it is the usual practice in the City for a syndicate consisting of very few members to be formed for the purpose of floating a larger company—one share in the syndicate represents a very large holding in the company when it is floated—you most have seven signatories in order to register—this Atlas Syndicate was floated for the purpose of floating the London Refuse Company—I honestly believed, and I do now, in the London Refuse Company as a fine under<lb/>taking—the Atlas Syndicate endeavoured to float the London Refuse Company, and they put it out to public subscription; there was a public subscription, but Lambert did not think the public subscription was suffi<lb/>cient, and they returned the money—that would be immediately after the issue of the prospectus, within two or three weeks, which was at the commencement of 1894, not the tirst two months, but before June—there was no allotment to the public, but the syndicate still exists, and they have still got any rights they have acquired over the patent, and if part of those rights had to be paid for, or were to be paid for at the time by the issue of certain shares, they would still have the right to hold those shares as fully paid<lb/>up shares, apart from the public allotment—in proportion as you reduce the number of shares allotted to the public the greater becomes the value of the shares held by the syndicate—the only property was in the patent—many fortunes have been made out of a patent without any other assets—I have seen Lambert in connection with the London and Scottish Bank—he was a director Of my company—in my judgment Mr. Lambert did nothing as a company man that was wrong in that company.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Kilbum now—I am not in any employment now—I came back from Australia in 1889, and meeting a friend, learnt from him of the firm of Messrs. Morrison and Co.—I went to the office of J. B. Morrison and Co., where I saw a person that I knew as Mr. Morrison—that was Singleton—I took employment from him at £1 a week, and acted as a clerk in the business of J. B. Morrison, which was the business of an outside broker's office—I was engaged in sending circulars, and addressing envelopes and prospectuses—Singleton used to give me the names of the people to whom to address the envelopes—Mr. Stewart gave me his name when I had been there some eight or nine weeks—after I had been employed there for a little time I got to know a Mr. F, J. Baker as a clerk in the same employ—during the time I was there I used to go up to Beall's office; Singleton sent me—sometimes I would take letters up and cheques, or anything like that—I think there was a Miss Rich employed at Morrison's; the latter part of the time—I recollect Morrison and Co, moving to Copthall House—the name at the Copthall House premises was J. C. Hanson, the Metropolitan Stock and Share Agency—the J. C. Hanson of that establishment was Singleton—a little while after, we removed to 80, Coleman Street—the name up there was Lawrence, and the name of the business was the Empire Finance and Stock Corporation, I think—Lawrence was Singleton—those three difierent businesses and names were successive; they were not going on at the same time—they were all of the same class, outside stockbrokers' offices—I first heard of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation towards the end of the Lawrence time, in 1892: I won't be quite certain—I think Singleton spoke to me first about it; it might have been Beall—it was one of the two—I was told that I should be employed as cashier in the bank—we were all up at 5, Copthall Avenue before the bank came out—I cannot say if the name of the bank was up there—I remember the bank taking some premises at 35, Lombard Street—we sent put circulars from 5, Copthall Avenue, for the London and Scottish Bank, before the premises were taken at 35, Lombard Street—we used to write</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230185"/>
               <p>envelopes from lists—Beall provided the lists; they were sent out in very large numbers, I think—my fellow clerks were employed in the same way—Miss Rich was there, I think, too—Singleton used to pay us—in the be<lb/>ginning of 1893 we moved to 35, Lombard Street—Singleton moved there as well; he was there as Mr. A. F. Baker—Miss Rich and F. G. Baker went, too—I met there a man named Leonard Barker—the first two or three months of 1893 we were employed at the bank addressing circulars—I noticed some prospectuses being distributed in the early part of 1893 of the London and Scottish Bank—in the early part of March or the end of February I remember having a conversation with Beall about my position in the bank—I said I did not understand cashiering or keeping books—he said, "Oh, you will manage it all right"—I had not had any previous experience in book-keeping—I had been with Messrs. Day and Martin as loading clerk before I went to Australia—that was loading up the parcels on to the vans—I do not remember receiving any written appointment as cashier—I have seen a Mr. Drew; I did not know him to talk to—I do not know Mr. Williams at all; I never saw the man in my life that I know of—they proposed and seconded me for the position of cashier—I do not remember ever speaking to Mr. Drew in my life—I remember the bank starting and the distribution of prospectuses and the applications for shares coming in—Wain came once or twice before the bank really started; that was the first time I ever saw him—I was appointed cashier—I took up my duties as cashier, and commenced the keeping of a cash-book—this was the first cash-book I kept (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—kept it on my own system—in the middle of the book I started the customers' accounts—that one book is the cash-book and the customers' ledger an well—in addition there was a petty cash-book kept—I entered on one side the sums I received, and on the other side the sums I paid away—I made a cross entry of having paid away the sum which on the other side I acknowledged to have received—it is a cash-book between me and the London and Scottish Bank—I find here an account of Beall and Co.'s No. 1, and on folio 90 I find Beall and Co, No. z—Beall had two accounts there—I think one was a business account, and the other more of a private account—I cannot tell which was which—there were four directors when I commenced my duties: Mr. Stores, Mr. Greville, Mr. Lambert, and Mr. Wain—I used to put the cash-book on the board-room table at every board meeting—I find on the face of the cash-book the initials of either Wain, Lambert, or others of the directors, showing that they had seen my account—the petty cash-book was likewise put before the directors to look at—I find a number of cheques entered in my book between April 18th, 1893, and June 4th, 1894, as having been paid,—these cheques (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)are drawn by the directors and counter signed by the secretary of the London and Scottish Bank, and the amounts of them are entered in the establishment expenses account—the first one is April 18th, by cheque £500"; the second, May, £200, is entered—the bodies of those cheques and the counterfoils are in Beall's handwriting—most of them are in his; some of them are mine—they are signed by two directors and the secretary, drawn on the London and Scottish Bank forms, but drawn on the London and Scottish Bank's account at the London and Midland Bank—I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230186"/>
               <p>the duty of cashing them from time to time—I got the money from the London and Midland—I used to send the commissionaire round to the London and Midland sometimes, or go myself—I have paid Mr. Beall some of the cheques—I do not remember giving some of the cheques to A. F. Baker—most of them are drawn to numbers, and all of them are B. to bearer—after the first few weeks of the Scottish Bank doing the C. business, I very seldom saw A. F. Baker at the premises—there were D. some customers of the bank who kept accounts in addition to Beall—I kept E. their accounts in my cash-book—there was not sufficient always to employ F. me in the daytime—I used to fill up my time by addressing envelopes G. from lists—I had an assistant cashier to assist me in my duties as cashier H.—after the bank started business Mr. Barker used to get the lists—he got I. the money to pay for the lists from me—I got the money from the till J.—I made entries in the petty cash-book of the moneys which I handed to K. Baker—I find several entries in the petty cash book of "Lists L.B., L." "Expenses L.B.," that being the money I paid for the getting of the lists M.—I continued as chief cashier up to the liquidation of the bank, and at N. the end of 1894, or January, 1895, I remember seeing Mr. Aitcheson, O. when I handed over to him £1 0s. 8d., which was the cash in hand at the P. time—in the bank premises there was a safe upstairs, and one down—Mr. Q. F. J. Baker kept the keys of the safe—Mr. Beall kept the duplicate keys R. of the top safe; the other one downstairs we used to keep the books and S. letters in, and all manner of things—Beall was there nearly everyday—T. I used to take orders from him—there were directors' meetings, some U. times once a week and sometimes once a fortnight—Mr. Baker kept the V. minute-book and the records of what went on there—I remember Mr. W. Baker going up to Scotland; in December, I think—after his return I X. remember his making some inquiries about some papers and books—I had Y. seen Mr. Beall going to the safe while he was away—my back was to Z. him, but I could see him take some sort of papers—he took them in the board room—I never saw them afterwards—I see in this cash-book No. 2 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)that I debit myself with the receipt of a cheque for £200: BB. "To cheque Beall and Co. account, £200"—on the other side I find an entry with regard to the same cheque: "To cheque Beall and Co. account, £200, establishment expenses"—in the establishment expenses account I find entered a cheque for £200, credited to the account of March 1st, 1894—in Beall and Co.'s account I find there, under the date of February 28th, £200 credited to Mr. Beall's account—I should say that £200 is the same sum that is entered in the second of these books.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. At the bank, whilst I was there, there was a ledger kept in the ordinary way and a journal; Mr. Baker kept them, a cash-book and a bill-book—there was not a cash-book besides mine; there was a petty cash-book—pass-books are usually kept, paying in books with slips, and there were cheque-books of the London and Scottish—the books were kept in a safe downstairs; that was a safe to which everybody in the office had access—in the morning, when the office was opened, the sergeant would generally open this safe and take the books out, and when the business was done in the evening, and everybody had gone, it was his business to put the books back there—I do not know that there was a lock to the safe with a code word; there was no secrecy</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230187"/>
               <p>about these books in any way—it was the habit of anybody who wanted to find anything that was there to go to the safe and get it; that was the strong room, the bottom safe—I should say it was about five or six yards long and about three yards wide—the safe upstairs was just behind Mr. Baker in a corner in the clerk's office—different papers were kept in it that was not open during the day when business was going on—if any<lb/>body wanted to go there, if Mr. F. J. Baker wanted anything out of it, or anything like that, we had no access to it at all—Beall had not been to the upstairs safe many times; I have never seen Mr. Beall go more than two or three times to the safe—the safe where he went was the place where the clerks and everybody were going in and out; he went there in the daytime when I was there, and the sergeant—I knew that at that time he was acting as solicitor to the company—there were two Beall accounts, one with no number to it and one called Beall account No. 2—it was my practice to make out a balance every week for our board for the purpose of showing whether there was a debit or credit, and how much to each particular customer; I usually included in that the Beall accounts—there were one or two instances in which I did not put it in—I used to take them into the board<lb/>room and put them on the table; I used to make up the account myself—when it was passed by the board I do not remember if it was initialled—I sent the balances quite separately—I did not have anything whatever to do with the agenda—I could not say if there is anything wrong or suspicious about making out a cheque to a number—I think that every one of these cheques, except one to A. F. Baker, is made out to a number—there is one, which is not, "Cashier 10 guineas"—the second counterfoil in this book of counterfoils is May 2nd for £200, For establishment expenses further on account in pursuance of resolution"—that is in Beall's writing—these cheques were placed to Beall's credit—it says on the counterfoil that the £200 was drawn out for establishment expenses—the next counterfoil says the same thing—on each counterfoil it is stated that it is in pursuance of a resolution that the money is paid—that is carried through to balance account; I will not say with regard to all—I was at the bank the whole time—I put the money that I received on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> side of the book, and the money that I paid away on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> side of the book—I never kept books before, so I really do not understand book-keeping at all—when we were going through the books I was called in two or three times by Mr. Weller—except for one small item, there was no dispute with regard to my account, and my accounts were quite right; there was no dispute at all—the question of £15 error which appeared in the amounts was made the subject of discussion in the board-room, and appeared on the minutes—I have got a receipt for the £15.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Albany House, King's Cross Road—I am on the Press—in the middle of 1890 I answered an adver<lb/>tisement, and in consequence came to be employed by Jacob B. Morrison and Co.—Singleton is Jacob B. Morrison—while there I did not see Beall on the premises, but while in that employ I saw him—I used fre<lb/>quently to go to his offices while at Morrison's—I prepared the monthly circular that he used to send out dealing with stocks and shares—then we went to St. Stephen's Chambers, and then to Copthall House, where he became Mr. Hanson, and there I met Colee, Miss Rich, and other clerks; and afterwards to 80, Coleman Street, where Morrison was T. B. Lawrence—I saw Beall a few times at Coleman Street; not often</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230189"/>
               <p>—in the case of Morrison and Co. the correspondence was done by hand; the letters which came to Lawrence at Coleman Street Singleton took—I did not go for any answers to them to any place; it was all done through Singleton—in 1892 Baker was in occupation of 5, Copthall Avenue—a Mr. Fred Mason was there, but I had seen him before then—about the middle of 1802 I remember being spoken to by Beall—I was authorised by him to find seven signatories, if I could do so, for the London and Scottish Bank—whilst doing that I met Mr. Mason, and found one signa<lb/>tory only—evidently Mr. Mason had the same instructions that I had—in 1892 I saw a pamphlet called "Banks and Banking"—I had charge of writing the envelopes—they were sent out in large numbers, some thousands—in every case the lists came from Beall; whilst at 5, Copthall Avenue I knew of some prospectuses being sent out of the Scottish Bank—I remember a paper called the <hi rend="italic">Financial Critic</hi>—I think it was extinct at the time; it had been used before that—I remember a paper coming afterwards called the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi>—I wrote for it; generally criticisms on prospectuses or balance-sheets that had appeared in the public press—I recollect, with some earlier prospectuses which were sent out from Copthall Avenue, what purported to be an extract being sent out as well from the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi>—there was another sheet attached to this (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 25) when I saw it before (<hi rend="italic">Product</hi>)—I was away at the end of 1892, and came back again in January, 1893—then I was employed at 35, Lombard Street—I sent out proof prospectuses there, and circulars—I kept on my journalistic duties fer the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi>—I used to write these things more for practice than anything else in the evenings at home—this document No. 5 (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)purports to be an extract from the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi> of February 11th—I see here an article headed "Joint Stock Banking Prospects, the London and Scottish Bank, extract from the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi>, February Uth, 1893"—I am responsible for a portion of this; it is a reprint from the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi>—I wrote some portion of it for the <hi rend="italic">Financial Gazette</hi>; not in this form—I wrote it by instructions from Beall—at the beginning of 1893 I knew of founders' shares in the London and Scottish Bank being sold—they were distributed in the autumn of 1892, and after that up to 1893—coming backwards and forwards to the bank, I saw Wain and Lambert, probably a couple of months before the company went to allotment—I was assistant secretary at the bank after allotment—I remember some conversation between Beall and myself one afternoon—he simply said that he had arranged that I was to be assistant secretary—I agreed to it—I had no experience of secretaryship before that, or of banking in any way or shape—with the possible exception of Mr. Pappadaki, none of the staff of the London and Scottish had any experience of banking, to my knowledge—Singleton simply remained with the bank until the arrangement was made with the London and Midland—the money that came from the public in answer to the general distribution of prospectuses went straight to the company itself—the money originally sent with the applications went to the bank itself—there were no bankers on the prospectus; applications with cheques came straight to the company itself, and the cheques were received by Mr. A.

The directors fully appreciate the advan<lb/>tages to be derived from the general adoption of the course suggested, inasmuch as it would place at their disposal more capital to be profitably employed, and that dividends would be payable on the amount actually paid up. I am, therefore, instructed to ask you to signify your views on the enclosed form, and return the same to me at your earliest convenience. I am pleased to inform you that the bank premises have been opened at the above address, and that the directors have been able to secure very profitable business. The Paris office is also completed, where the usual hanking business is transacted. Branches are also being opened at Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, and negotiations are now pending for the establishment of branches in Birmingham and Manchester under the superintendence of experienced managers. Yours obediently, [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] Assistant Secretary")—then follows a form for the shareholders to fill up; this has reference to ordinary capital—I know that a circular did come at that time in May; I cannot say at this date; I have no reason to doubt it was that—from the commencement of the bank Mr. Beall used to superintend the correspondence—he undoubtedly composed the letter of April 10th, 1893; no one else had the power to do anything of that kind—he was there daily if he was in town—the letters were simply placed before me; except formal ones—I did not attend the directors' meetings—I did not attend the board meetings; I was in touch if I was sent for—Mr. Stokes and Mr. Greville resigned in April, 1894, February and April respectively, or something of the kind—after that Wain and Lambert continued to be the two remaining directors—the directors' fees "were five guineas a meeting—before the meetings, agenda papers were got out in the usual way; we made up the agenda paper in preparation for the board meeting—I kept the minute-book—those are minute-books 1 and 2—I kept them from the agenda paper which was before the board—votes were made upon the agenda paper of what had been done, and those were handed to me, and then the minute-books were written up, and at the following board meeting the agenda was compared—in consequence of that minute I opened an account called Establishment Expenses Account; I had instructions to do so—this is how I opened it: "1893, April 10th, amount due, A. F. Baker on promotion account, as</p>

               <p>per minute of to<lb/>day's date, £6,909; less deduction from agreement dated March 10th, 1892, £2,132; leaving a balance of £4,777"—then," Amount paid by A. F. Baker on account of establishment expenses previous to accounts being taken over by board, £18,555 £3,632 is the total, which was discharged by the various cheques appearing on the other side of the account—this item of £1,855 is a cross entry; there is an entry on the other side exactly balancing it—that must be the sum deducted by A. F. Baker when he handed over the amount to the bank, I take it; roughly speaking, I take it so; I may be wrong—there is a cross entry appearing on each side; it is there for a purpose, undoubte—I have had no access to the books for many years; I have no knowledge of it—Mr. Beall had two current accounts at the bank. No. 1 and No. 2—in June, 1894, Mr. Beall's No. 1 account was overdrawn £341 19s. 8d.; that overdraft went to liquidate the debt of the bank—we had a liability to the promoters of £4,777, and Mr. Beall liquidated that liability in this fashion, so that part of that liability was discharged by £34 10s. 8d. being credited as against Mr. Beall's overdraft on No. I account—No. 2 account was overdrawn to nearly £1,249 10s. 4d.; it is £1,215 really, and that overdraft wiped off in the same way by a transference of £1,219 10s. 4d. from the establish<lb/>ment expenses account—those two items, £346 10s. 8d. and £1,219 10s. 4d., balanced the establishment expenses account—in the bank's ledger I find those two sums entered to the credit of Beall's No. 1 account and Beall's No. 2 account, and then overleaf I find the other one—in June, 1893, some debenture prospectuses were sent out; it must have been drafted in the board-room or submitted to the board—no clerk in the bank drafted it, to my knowledge—No. 264 is a print of the debenture prospectus as finally settled—the bank were interested in some promotion accounts that some people in the City had made some advances to—they had assisted some promoters, and certain bonus shares were to reach the bank, and there wore others besides those—I cannot give you any invest<lb/>ment which the bank had in June, 1893, upon which the bank were to be secured; "investment" is not the word, certainly—some thousands of those prospectuses went out, and there was one application, that was all, Mrs. Tilton's; this is it: "Having paid to your bank the sum of £10 as a deposit of 5 per cent, on £200 debenture stock, I request you to allot me that amount, and I agree to accept the same or any smaller amount that may be allotted to me on the terms of the prospectus dated June, 1893. I engage to pay the further instalments upon such allotted amount as the same shall become due, in default of which all previous payments shall be liable to forfeiture. <hi rend="smallCaps">ISABELLA TILTON</hi>, Stonehouse, Gloucester<lb/>shire, Widow.

Id., and the net profits of £1,269 13s. 4d. It was resolved that an interim dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum be paid on all shares £5 paid for the past half-year, and also on all amounts for fully paid ordinary shares paid in advance"—I was further instructed "to insert an advertisement in the principal daily and financial papers, that the transfer books and register of members of the corporation would be closed for the 12 days from the 4th to the 16th October, inclusive. It was further ordered that notice of this be given to all shareholders, agents and officers of the corporation, and that printed notices be ordered, Proof of circular letter was submitted and ordered to be printed, also circular letter to all shareholders as to opening current accounts"—and then later on, "The secretary was instructed to draft a new copy of a share prospectus with a view of issuing 20,000 or 30,000 copies"—the account which is referred to in the minute here is the account which I prepared; the one that shows these figures—it was quite a rough draft on the profit side; the state<lb/>ment was made of different discounts and sums that had reached us—on the other side there were the expenses, salaries, directors' fees and rent—something was added by the board for any profits to be earned—no note was made, it is simply a rough draft; it was not entered in the</p>

               <p>books, but something was added in the shape of bonus shares, which would reach the bank for financial assistance they had given to the pro<lb/>moters—then as to the payments that had been made, it was agreed by Beall and one of the directors, Mr. Wain, the chairman, that they should not be charged to the first year's working, and after an account had been made out in that way, the net profits brought out were these £1,269 13s. 4d.—it must have been so, or it would not have been entered in the minutes—I make out my amount of discounts from the discounts that had been carried through—there is a ledger here to prove that, the dis<lb/>count ledger gives a record of the different discounts that have been carried through; this must be my loan ledger in which the discounts would be entered—I take it this would be the ledger—a record could be made from this undoubtedly; this book covers that period; I must have used it; the facts were placed on paper before them, undoubtedly—there were several slips in addition to the sheet I made up giving particulars of the different items; the dates are all here—I took into account Colonel Schaffer, the first discount we had, £60, and March 30th, the date of the discount, and a further £60 on August 2nd—that was on the renewal of the bill, which was still running at the time I prepared my account—Colonel Schaffer had deposited collateral security—that was not taken into account in arriving at my total; simply the bonus shares—I can give other instances from the loan ledger; on that account was this dividend of 7 per cent, declared—the amounts before me give a total gross profit of £12,000—I cannot say what I make the total of these discounts to be—I have had no access to the books for years—I know I prepared it in this fashion; a debit and credit account—several slips were prepared and given to each member of the board showing the items—it was agreed that certain sums that had been paid away should not be charged to the first year's working, such as stationery—stationery had been paid for and had not been used, and they considered it unfair to charge the first year's working with that, and then they took into account certain bonuses that were to be taken into account which I had not taken into account—I know there was some £1,500 or £1,800 we considered as being a proportion which the first half-year's working was entitled to—that was on arriving at the profits for the first half-year—£1,500 or £1,800 was added to the figures I handed to the board—it did not show a profit when I presented it to them—if the directors' fees and salaries were taken into account with rent and sundry payments it amounted to more than we had received in the way of discounts, but the directors upon that day declared, and subsequently drew, a cheque for the 7 per cent, dividend which is mentioned in this minute—this is the cheque—it is drawn by Harrison, Lambert, and Stokes, as directors, countersigned by myself as assistant secretary, and it is for £472 19s. 10d., and dated October 16th, 1893—this is the printed prospectus as it was circulated—this draws attention to this state<lb/>ment, and in answer to this prospectus, about 59 shares were applied for and allotted; I think four or five shareholders did reply; something of that sort—I knew that there was a branch of this bank at Paris, No. 20, Rue St. George's; and at the end of June, 1893, that branch ceased to be a branch of the bank; we had a lot of trouble with it—so far as I know,</p>

               <p>no business was done there at all—I knew Mr. Brandreth was discharged—by the loan ledger there were two persons with whom the bank had accounts, named John and Fordyce Sheridan—I find on folio 20 an entry in my writing which shows that the bank discounted an acceptance of John Sheridan for £600 on May 17th, 1893, and the bank charged him for that discount, £50—it was a three months' acceptance; this is simply a record of the transaction; there is another ledger that gives the full par<lb/>ticulars of it apart from this—that advance to Mr. John Sheridan was followed by another advance of £125 on July 19th, 1893; and then I find an entry here referring to some shares in the London Refuse Company—that loan was never repaid—the entry is: "Our charges as per above agreement, under which we received 30,000 fully-paid shares of £1 each in the London Refuse Steam Generator and Electrical Power Company"—that is carried out at £30,000—there was an agreement, of course, which covered this charge; this ledger entry is in my writing—I had in<lb/>structions some long time after this while the Sheridan matter had gone on; we had some litigation with the Sheridans, and this ledger entry was made in this fashion at that time, during the litigation, some time in 1894—it does not say that we got £30,000 for discounting a bill of £600 and a bill of £125; it says, "as per the above agreement"—then there is a farther entry here, folio 47, by which I find that the bank discounted an acceptance of Fordyce Sheridan's on August 18th, 1893, for £500—that was a three months' acceptance—the sum was £60, but the charge amounted to 16,500 shares—the entry is: "Our charge <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the above as per agreement, under which we receive 16,500 fully paid shares of £1 each in the British Refuse and Steam Generator and Electric Power Company, Limited"—that is carried out at £16,500—in February, 1894, the bank advanced money for the promotion of the Atlas Contracting Syndicate—ledger cash-book No. 1 is the account of the Atlas Syndicate in the bank; I see three cheques here, £500, £600, £700, are Nos. 219, 220, 221—these are the three cheques that are debited to that Atlas Contracting Syndicate account—each of them is drawn by the directors of the London and Scottish Bank, but yet cheques are debited to the account at our bank of the Atlas Contracting Syndicate—the first one is for £651 10s., and the counterfoil shows registration fees, No, 220 is for £510 drawn to the London Share and Debenture Corporation for stamping and address<lb/>ing envelopes, and the third is for £750 in favour of Messrs. Vickers advertising contractors, for advertising the company—all three of them bear the word "Atlas" on the counterfoil; so that our bank, the Lon<lb/>don and Scottish, paid those three sums, at any rate, towards the pro<lb/>motion of the Atlas Contracting Syndicate—I remember this circular being sent out: "February 22nd, 1894. Dear Sir,—We have had offered to us the opportunity of contributing to a limited syndicate, the object of which is to form a company to acquire and work Livet's Patents for Lon<lb/>don and twenty miles round; and although the terms proposed are of a very remunerative character, my directors do not see their way to enter<lb/>tain the proposal in its entirety, it not being what could be properly termed a banking or discount transaction.

Yours faithfully,—Secretary"—that circular referred to the Atlas Syndicate Contract, Livet's Patents—the company that the Atlas was to promote was the London Refuse Company, 30,000 of whose shares are referred to in the loan ledger under the heading of John Sheridan's account—I remember a statutory notice being put up in the bank—document 277 is in Mr. Barker's writing—I recognise the lower portion—it remained up till the time of the liquidation, till the time Mr. Aitcheson took possession; it was up at that time, so far as I remember—we have no reason to recognise that this is correct, but I re<lb/>member the lower part of it—I know it was there shortly before the bank went into liquidation—I have no reason to suppose that Mr. Aitcheson did not have it—it was by the side of the sergeant's box—I will not swear this is not the paper—I recognise the lower part of this as being exactly like one we had in the place, and higher up I see £24,000—that represents the amount subscribed for capital; that would be right—in the autumn of 1894 Messrs. Abbott were employed to audit our accounts—the books at the bank which had been opened and kept by me were at their disposal—I do not remember Messrs. Abbott sending in their report; I was in Edinburgh at that time, preparing for our annual meeting—there was a difficulty about the wording of the certificate; I was up in the north then; I do not remember the circumstances, there<lb/>fore—the financial adviser, Mr. Beall, sent me up there—we knew at that time that several of the shareholders had been anxious to have the annual meeting held for some time before that; we knew there was a chance of having some trouble at the meeting, and I was told off to interview them, and try to make them as friendly as possible—Mr. Beall told me to pro<lb/>mise the shareholders a cash dividend—he told me that several of the bonus shares we had; some 65,000 shares we had; he said nego<lb/>tiations were pending whereby a number of these shares would be dis<lb/>posed of for cash, and a dividend would be paid; negotiations with some City house; I do not know which—those are the words he used—I went to Scotland and saw some of the shareholders—I promised them a cash dividend—I took some money there with me—I was running between Edinburgh and Glasgow; our largest shareholders were in that neigh<lb/>bourhood—I saw a friend of mine in Glasgow, and in consequence of that I interviewed a number of Glasgow persons—I had instructions as to that before I went to Scotland from Mr. Beall—I was to make every arrangement I could to carry the meeting through without any disturb<lb/>ance, if possible, and employ some men to attend the meeting; practically, make them friendly shareholders for the moment, just to support the chairman—I interviewed those persons in Glasgow, and gave them some money, and arranged for the meeting to be held on Monday morning,</p>

Aobott's report was read at that meeting—it was printed and distributed; it con<lb/>sisted of a report and a balance-sheet and a certificate—the report was posted from London, after I had gone, to the shareholders; the balance-sheet No. 20—I know the accounts were before the shareholders when they were at the meeting, but the trouble arose over the wording of the certificate—I cannot identity this document (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I was not in London when it was sent out; I was in the North—it is to my knowledge that each shareholder who attended the meeting had a report and balance-sheet in his hand—I can speak for the accounts, not the other; the one with the figures in the balance-sheet—I cannot identify that re<lb/>port—they had one, but I cannot say that it was this one—the report in the hands of the persons there was a printed report—I identify the figures on the balance-sheet—this is No. 20—after the meeting a petition was presented to wind up this bank—the shareholders held a meeting after we had left the room, and instructed Counsel to proceed—this document is signed by me; Mr. Beall drafted it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—that is the circular that was sent out—I saw it at the Mansion House, a long printed report of Mr. Wain's speech, and all that took place at the meeting—that was circulated with it—when I come up to London from Edinburgh I went to the bank pre<lb/>mises</p>

We had, on the whole, a very pleasant passage, and thank you for your kind inquiries. I found every-thing upside down, and shall have to devote the afternoon and some few hours to<lb/>morrow in putting things straight. I will take an oppor<lb/>tunity of discussing matters fully with Mr. Baker, so as to write you in detail on Monday, and send you copies of all necessary doouments. I suppose you do not suggest, owing to the time it will take, writing to any of your banking friends on the Continent to put their names on the prospectus.—Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">E.

When these papers are ready, if you will kindly send them over, I will get the secretary to execute them and the seal of the company affixed. The gentleman I mentioned to you, who I think might join the Comité Etudes, is. Vicomts E. de la Panouse, and I think his address is Rue Saint Dominique. The other gentleman is Le Comte de Hedonville. I hope in the course of post to receive from you the prospectus, with any sugges<lb/>tion, and, at the same time, the names of the gentlemen you desire to act on the committee in Paris. I have had an opportunity of seeing Mr. Baker with reference to the terms of working arrangements, and the only thing that he takes exception to is the expense of the offices at £40 per month. I have told him that this will not accrue before everything is definitely arranged and they commence to work, when the bank's trans<lb/>actions should be able to pay this. I hope to have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Wain this afternoon. and I will write to you again to<lb/>morrow.—Yours faithfully, E, <hi rend="smallCaps">BEALL.

Will you also let me have the names of the gentlemen that we can put on forming the committee in Paris?

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. My position was plainly a continuation of what it had been before, with Beall and Singleton there were no directors at that time—the office wad at Copthall Avenue, with "London and Scottish Bank" on it—we continued there—it was my duty to prepare the agenda paper and put it before the board after allotment—I assisted Mr. Beall in preparing the agenda paper; I had permission from him to assist in doing it; I did not compile it, but I assisted in it—I was authorised to put anything on it that I thought the directors should deal with, and I wrott up the minutes from the agenda paper, and from the notes on it of what had been done—it was from that that all these minutes were written up—these minutes contain a record of what had been done fit the board meetings from the notes made on this agenda paper when I saw them—they were written up from week to week, and compared with the agenda paper, and signed if they were found all right—the minutes of the previous meeting were confirmed—I take it that the minutes contain very full records indeed of the business done, so far as the staff knew; so far as we could see what was going on—the business was known to us, but none of the staff knew what went on in the board<lb/>room—first, there was a balance submitted to the board at every board</p>

               <p>meeting, showing what there was on current account and what there was on deposit account—every cheque that was drawn appears on the minutes as authorised by the board, and whatever business was done of other kinds, loans and so on, appears on the minutes generally—the first minute is March 17th, 1898; Mr. Stokes, Mr. Wain, Mr. Gre<lb/>ville, and Mr. Lambert were present—that was when they entered on their duties as directors; Mr. Brandon, solicitor for the company, was also present—then the minutes of the meetings of the signatories to the memorandum of association of March 13th and 16th were produced, and the same were duly read and agreed to—that was what the signatories had done previously to that, and the minutes were all approved at this meeting—then: "It was proposed by Mr. Stokes and seconded by Mr. Greville, and resolved. That the London and Midland Back be appointed one of the clearing banks to the company, and that the necessary resolu<lb/>tion and papers should be sent to the office, and that all cheques and drafts bo paid thereto." "Secretary to report as to staff to be employed in head office, to arrange for them to be guaranteed through the Provident Clerks' Society. Resolved, That the agreement with the manager of the European company be adopted"—that was the agreement with the European company by which the furniture of the European company was sold to the Scottish Bank, and the office was taken by the Scottish Bank in Paris—the financial manager was instructed to negotiate with re<lb/>ference to the appointment of a manager and secretary in Glasgow, and to submit the names and credentiak at the next board meeting; and also with reference to the offices in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and to conduct the necessary correspondence and general business of the bank, with the assistance of the committee—that relates to what Mr. Beall was to do, and at the meeting the minutes of the Paris committee were read—Mr. Schaffer's proposal was submitted—that was a business matter; that was the first discount matter that came before the board—Mr. Braudon, solicitor, appears to have attended right through, very frequently—it was reported that the following cheques drawn on account of the Paris office have been presented and duly honoured—they all came before the board—it was reported that the lease of the premises, 20, Rue St. Greorge's, Paris, has been duly transferred to the bank, and that the com<lb/>pany has been duly registered in Paris—the company was registered there—apparently the £330 was made up of £240 for furniture aud £90 for rent—"The secretary is to have £100 petty cash; the balance over that now in his hands to be paid into bank; secretary to present state<lb/>ment of disbursements every board meeting"—it was quite early that that resolution was passed—I never presented anything personally to the board; it was simply made up in the form of the agenda, but it went before the board—I did not walk in with it in my hand, but right through it says: "The secretary reported and presented this and that"—it was down on the agenda—I was not there in person—the appointments and salaries were under that minute—the total salaries were at the rate of £13 10s. 6d. per week—not including Mr. Pappadaki's—at the next meeting:—"The minutes of the previous meeting were read, confirmed and signed. Colonel W. F. Schaffer's loan on his acceptance of four months with the following collateral securities, viz., 200 shares District Messenger Company, £1,000</p>

Cheques ordered to be drawn for £750, £104, £104, £114, £400, £28, and acceptance completed for £782."—"Standing advertisement; approved ": that was the standing advertisement of the bank—"Estimate to be obtained of cost of advertising in journals as per list submitted. It was agreed to provide door plates, stationery and postages for Scotch agents. The question of remuneration for same was deferred for further inquiries and consideration"—then "Mr. F, J. Baker's appointment was confirmed. The offer as to underwriting contract in the 'Perfect Kiln,' Limited, was considered and declined"—Mr. Brandreth was authorised to arrange for office staff for Paris branch at a cost of not exceeding £18 per month"—that was apart from himself; all he was entitled to charge was £18 a month—"Bank pass-book produced and balance of £4,802 14s. found correct. Cheques were ordered to be drawn in pay-ment of rent £104 15s. 6d., and electric light fittings £64 3s., also £20 petty cash for Paris branch. It was ordered that Mr. Pappadaki and the other clerks be guaranteed"—then on April 6th, 1892, the minutes of the last meeting were read and signed—there were present Mr. Stokes, Mr. Wain, Mr. Greville, and Mr. Lambert, and "Mr. Brandon, solicitor, again attended"—he was there frequently—"the financial manager attended and reported that he had visited Paris" (that was Mr. Beall) "in accordance with the requisition of the last board meeting, and was present at a meeting of the Consultative Committee in Paris, on Wednesday, April 5th, at No. 20, Rue St. George's, at which meeting Mr. Verneuil was present"—Mr. Vemeuil was an official of the Credit Lyonnais in Paris, I believe—"The French prospectus was submitted and approved. The duplicate of the lease of the office in favour of the bank was also produced, also the assignment of the furniture. A long discussion ensued with reference to the French right" (that was some question about a railway) "and the proposition of Mr. Lorimer" (he was a gentleman apparently who was proposing some business with regard to this railway)—part of the premises were sublet to another company in Paris—"Bank pass-book was produced, and the balance found to be correct." The petty cash-book was produced, showing the balance in hand £2 14s., 5d. The rough cash-book balance, £66 15s., was also correct"—"It was agreed that estimates be submitted to an early board meeting from a list of French journals for advertising for six months at a total cost not exceeding £400"—that again was advertising the business—then "The proposal re Theatrical Trust, Limited, for £400 loan on mortgage (instead of £500 us previously agreed on) was sub<lb/>mitted and approved of. Cheque for £400 was ordered to be drawn"—apparently from that there were various proposals, among them two were specifically dealt with: the French Kighi and the Theatrical Trust, Limited—I think they get longer as more business was done, but substantially the minutes were carried out in that form—on April 11th "Current accounts were opened by Mr. E, E. Cireville and Mr. Brandon"—that was Mr. Greville, one of the directors, and Mr. Brandon, the solicitor—we had Mr. Brandon and Mr. Lorimer from Paris there more than once—then "The following cheques were drawn"—and after the checiues came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230203"/>
               <p>this: "The cashier's book was produced, showing balance on hand £211 38. 4d. The petty cash-book was produced, showing balance on hand £3 1s. 5 1/2 d.": that was carried through at each meeting—then "It was reported that the remaining shares held as security for Colonel Schaffer's loan in District Messenger Service and News Company, Limited, had been lodged, and transfer executed in favour of Mr. Lambert and Mr. Stokes, and duly registered at the company's office, Mr. Grant's application for Manchester agency was considered. This gentleman was interviewed by some members of the board. Mr. John<lb/>ston's application for a Scotch agency was referred to Mr. Greville"—so there is not the slightest doubt when I refer to these minutes that at this time they were carrying; on a <hi rend="italic">bonafide</hi> business, and were trying to do a bigger business—Mr. Lorimer came over irequenily, and just about the time they went to allotment—Mr. Dupont was another—Mr. Verneuil was a correspondent of the Credit Lyonnais; there was some correspondence about it—the Credit Lyonnais is well known here as well as in France—whether it was expected at first from what the French people had said that there would be large subscriptions by them is a matter the staff would Dot know anything about—I did not know it; I knew ir was under dis<lb/>cussion at the board, certainly—I knew that the board was disappointed because they said the promises of the French people had not been carried out; that was true, I know—that was after they had gone to allotment in England—the bank in London expected a great deal from their Paris branch; they were disappointed there, I know—it can be shown that they went to heavy expense with regard to the Paris branch, aud as an inducement to the French people to do business it was eventually arranged that they should have 15 per cent, commission on whatever the people in London received on business the French people could intro<lb/>duce; there is a minute as to that—on May 16th there appears this minute, "The report of Messrs. Wain and Lambert on their visit to Paris"; they had been over to Paris, apparently—"It was agreed to approve of the remuneration to the French committee at the rate of 40f. each per meeting, with a commission of 15 per cent, on business introduced by the French house, payable in such manner as the bank may be paid through trade transactions carried to a successful issue initiated and carried through by the French office. The sum of £400 was ordered to be placed to the credit of Paris branch at bank to pay for advertisements on the Continent"; so that whatever the bank over here got in consequence of an introduction by the Paris committee the Paris committee was to get 15 per cent, for—Mr. Pappadaki had nothing to do with the bank account books—Mr. Weller, a friend of Mr. Pappadaki, had; he came in—he was a bank accountant; he came after we had gone on a certain distance with the books we had before that, and he suggested certain additions to the books—the books were opened by myself first, and Mr. Weller came in afterwards and suggested further books, and they were kept in the way Mr. Weller showed they should be kept till Mr. Abbott came on the scene<lb/>—Messrs. Abbott complained of the system—I mean from the time I opened and dealt with the books under Mr. Weller's suggestion they were carried on in that way, and were properly carried on, to the best of my ability, till Messrs. Abbott came on the scene, and suggested that there should be a different system of book-keeping; they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230204"/>
               <p>refused to give their certificate till they had authority to open a fresh set of books—they differed from the way Mr. Weller had opened the books—they objected to the way they were made up, and would not certify them until they were written up in the way they wanted—Mr. Weller, the bank accountant, carried out the audit subsequently; that would be in 1894,. under the supervision of Messrs. Abbott—Messrs. Abbott had nothing to do with it except give the certificate; they were chartered accountants; Mr. Weller did the work—I under<lb/>stood that the liquidator got a fresh set of books; I did not see them—Messrs. Abbott and Co. gave the certificate in December, 1894, but we never saw the fresh set of books—they would be written up then at Messrs. Abbott's offices; they never came to the bank—it was that question of writing up the books that led to a considerable delay in the preparation of Messrs. Abbott's accounts—they were there three or four months, and I at times, under the direction of the board, was pressing Abbott's to hurry up—the only question that arose between the books that were kept under the suggestion of Mr. Weller and the books that were ultimately written up by Messrs. Abbott was as to the system—there was no question that I had not included everything—when Mr. Weller came in to make the audit, the books had been used before; they contained entries of everything that had gone on before then; but they objected to the system—the share warrants were made out to bearer, but only for the founders' shares—Mr. Brandreth did not suggest that the shares should be made out as share warrants—I think a form was printed—the shares in England would be registered shares, but all the founders' shares were share warrants—the principal distinction between the share warrants and the ordinary certificates for registration is that the share warrants pass by delivery to bearer—I do not require a register of shares with share warrants—the bearer is the holder—I have here the account of the establishment expenses—they begin to be entered on April 18th, 1893—that entry was made in pursuance of a minute on April 18th passed by all the directors, and according to that entry we start by this, that the amount due to A. F. Baker on promotion account is £6,909—on April 11th the matter was referred to a committee of Mr. Lambert and Mr. Stokes to consider the expenses which were brought in by Mr. A. F. Baker, as having been incurred as establishment charges and report upon them, and then apparently they sit as a committee and consider this matter, and on April 18th the matter is brought before the board, and there is the minute: "Having been submitted to Mr. Stokes and Mr. Lambert these gentlemen reported that they had been through the same and were satisfied with the amounts and that the same were in order, showing that the sum of £6,909 had been paid by the fouuders, thus leaving a balance now due to them of £4777. It was agreed that the agreement dated March 10th, 1892, so far as cash payments are concerned, should be reduced, and in lieu of the amount therein men<lb/>tioned the aforesaid sum should be accepted," that is, £6,909—on March 20th a banking account had been opened at the London and Midland Bank of the London and Scottish Bank by a payment on credit of £3,700 odd from Mr. A. F. Baker's account to the London and Scottish account with the Midland; that was taken over—the exact amount was £3,400, I think—that was the difficulty between the auditors and myself when they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230205"/>
               <p>came in—on April 8th certain amounts had been received and paid into A. F. Buker's accounts, and they were received by the founders and promoters, and had not gone into the London and Scottish Banks account; and those amounts had to be accounted for therefore—the copy of the account spoken of in the minute as presented by Mr. Lambert and Mr. Stokes to the board I never saw; we simply had to go by the amount—it was agreed that the establishment charges were to be £6,909—as against that there were payments that had been made by Mr. A. F. Baker either for the account of the London and Scottish or to the account of the London and Scottish Bank, for which Mr. Baker was entitled to be credited in the accounts between them—that was the question that arose with Messrs. Abbott and the liquidator—this account contains the ex<lb/>penses made made out by me from the minutes—it was agreed in the fninutes that the sum to be still paid to the promoters was £2,477, not because the agreement of March 10th was to be altered, but because they had had that amount already; that was the position—my explanation is this: the sum of £4,777 was paid by the directors after the company went to allotment; then sums had been paid before that—Messrs Abbott make it out that some £8,000 was spent in establishment and promotion expenses; that is in the balance-sheet—this £4,777 represents a sum that was actually paid after the company went to allotment, by the promoters—the sum of £3,000 was paid before that—I made in the ledger these entries from the minutes—I must have had some instructions, because it says here, "Less deduction from agreement, dated March 10th, 1892"—I never saw that agreement—I opened this account soon after April 18th, and then I entered those other payments as they were made, but that agree<lb/>ment of March 10th, 1892, never reached me; I never saw it—what I entered in the book is what I thought it was, from the minutes, certainly—it was agreed iu the minutes that that sum of £4,777 was still to be paid; then the auditors, when they came to examine the account, found that instead of taking £3,477 over from A. F. Baker they should have had over £6,000—they found that he had received the application money and certain sums paid into the bank on allotment—that is the only explana<lb/>tion I have to give—I can explain that entry—Birtwhistle had sent £200 to Mr. Beall, or somebody connected with Mr. Beall, in 1892, and he wanted ordinary shares—it appeared that the matter was quite forgotten, and after the company went to allotment Mr. Birtwhistle wrote and asked whether he had been allotted his ordinary shares—then this amount was traced, so that it had to be accounted lor—it was pait of the money of the company; that was the view I took of it—I debited them with that £200, under instructions, so Mr. Beall said at once, "Oh! this matter has been overlooked"—the £4,777 which was still to be paid is made out paid by the two credits of transfers from Beall's account Nos. 1 and 2, and the sums granted by the board periodically—the cheques paid out by the board were always in pursuance of resolutions—Mr. Beall never overdrew more than was due to the promoters—in order to get all the accounts square he had been paying himself in that way, and then the accounts were transferred so as to finish the. whole thing up, the £4,777—the amount which had been actually overdrawn by Beall on Beall's account No. 2 was £1,215, but in order to square up the whole of this account they debit him with the exact balance, which happens to be £4 10s. more</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230206"/>
               <p>and the result of that is that the whole account is wiped off and then the promoters have been properly paid the £4,777, which was still due—the £3,477 was the payment over by Baker—the next sum, £526, was a shareholder's cheque payable on allotment—they are receipts from no one else but shareholders—the next is £917 10s.; that is a number of cheques than had reached the bank and were placed in one payment in that fashion—they were a portion of the allotment; they were maue payable to Baker—Messrs. Abbott, I may mention, always complained that the establishment expenses account had nothing to do with the promotion account—I have got the establishment expenses account before me—the cheques as granted by the board are in consecutive order, but other entries, such as the balancing entries, are simply the totals; they could not be in this ledger—the last three entries were made when the amounts were found to total to £4,777—I see Beall and Co. No. 2 account closed in July, 1894—as soon as the entry was found to total the entry would he made—it may have been a month or so afterwards, but there were no further payments made—in the account of Beall and Co. No. 1 the latest entry may he August 15th, 1893; in No. 2 account a transfer is made in December, 1894—that is the balancing entry—I have only got the totals here; I cannot speak as to details—those figures were arrived at by current account over the counter paid away by Mr. Colee, the cashier—Mr. Beall was provided with London and Scottish cheque-books, and he drew the money over the counter, so that those figures were taken from the current account, and had nothing to do with the directors at all—in May, 1893, the debenture prospectus was about to be issued—from March 17th or 20th until May 25th, 1893, the bank was discounting bills and doing the best business it could with the money it had—at that time there was not much money to work with—if with a small capital they could earn a fair amount in discounts and commission, the more money they had to use the better—on May 25th, 1893, Mr. Stokes, Mr. Lambert, Mr. Greville, Mr. Carruthers Wain, and Mr. Brandon, the solicitor, attended the meeting (<hi rend="italic">The minute was here read</hi>)—the debentures were to be the security of whatever the bank had—from time to time the debentures were to have the security of a floating charge—the agreement was signed for the offices in George Street, Edinburgh, which had been taken on agreement in May, 1893, at a rental of £80, and on that day the insurance for the guarantee of the staff in the office was increased from £1,200 to £2,000, £500 apiece for four of us (<hi rend="italic">Further extracts from the minutes were here read</hi>)—no business resulted from any<lb/>thing the French committee put before the board, and in the result Mr. Brandreth was discharged—a dispute arose with regard to the furniture at the office in Paris—an action was brought by certain people, on behalf of the debenture-holders of the European Contract Corporation, in which they claimed that the furniture on the premises at the offices of the London and Scottish Bank belonged to the debenture holders, and thereupon the London and Scottish Bank intervened in the action, to protect the furni<lb/>ture, their own property—Mr. Brandreth obtained about that time, or some little while afterwards, a judgment against the London and Scottish Bank, ejecting them from the premises—that judgment the London and Scottish Bank asserted was fraudulently obtained by Mr. Brandreth—I think that was the tone of the proceedings—in my affidavits I stated that</p>

               <p>Mr. Brandreth had fraudulently obtained this judgment behind our backs, in order to get the benefit for himself and to oust us, and thereupon the action proceeded, the London and Scottish Bank claiming to have the offices and the furniture—we had paid for the lease at that time—they were desirous of going on with their business there with somebody other than Mr. Brandreth—as a matter of fact, the directors and Mr. Brandon went across, to take forcible possession of the premises, so as to oust Mr. Brandreth from the fraudulent possession which they said he had taken; and they got possession—it is the fact that from June, 1893, until the end of September, 1893, the company continued doing the same business, the discount business and banking business that they had, to the best ad<lb/>vantage, according to their capital—in October, 1893, or the end of Sep<lb/>tember, this question arose with regard to the preparation of a statement, 80 as to show what the position was for the six months—I was instructed to make a rough balance-sheet, a rough draft, to show what profits had been made for the six months—I proceeded to do that, without the assis<lb/>tance of the board in any way, but by the assistance of the staff; and the board interfered in no way whatever with that until the thing was com<lb/>pleted—there was not a great deal to do; I think I did it all myself—none of them had it until it was ready for the use of the board; there had not been a great deal of business done up to that time, and it was a simple matter to do it—all I had to do was to find out what had been the outgoings and the incomings, the receipts and the expenditure—the first item was to ascertain how much had been received by way of discount and commission—there was no other source of revenue at that time—there were shares which they had received, and that was taken into account after I had presented the statement—suppose there had been shares which could have been sold in the market at a profit of £1 apiece, they would have to come into account in ascertaining what the profits were, and against that I should have, to take into account what had been the working expenses of the company, salaries and rent and other payments, directors' fees—I cannot remember the figures; it is quite im<lb/>possible, I have had no access to the books for five years—a detailed statement of what had been received in that way was annexed to the statement I have drawn up; it was added to it—I cannot remember what the totals were; I presented a statement to the board and gave all the details—one of the items of which I gave details was this amount of commission and discount—I cannot tell you the balance within £1 or £100 at this date—it would not take long to find out from the ledger—it was well on for £1,000, I believe, the amount that had been received—it was not a balance at all; it was simply a statement of either side—no balance was struck—it showed a statement of receipts and expenditure; that is all—the question of pro£t was not taken into account at all, be<lb/>cause the payments were spread over a certain period of time; for instance, a payment was made of £64 for electric lighting—I could not take the whole of that into account for the first six months—the board dissected the accounts afterwards—in the account which I prepared I did not put on one side all the items that had been paid out, regardless of whether they were for the six months or twelve months, or longer: but the current slips prepared for each of these entries would show everything—it would not be so much as £ 100,</p>

               <p>but if there was an account of £100 for stationery, and I had £70 or £80 worth in stock at October, 1893, I should only take into account what had been used, and then again stamps had been paid for by the board for cheque books and other things, and the stamps were still there—when I prepared the minute I knew very well what the statement was for—it was in order to see whether the profits had been sufficient to enable them to declare an interim dividend—I am not clear that the statement as prepared by me was in the hands of the board, and considered by them for some time—I remember Mr. Wain and I and Mr. Beall going through the account afterwards—you may call it a committee from the board—it was not considered by the full board—the committee of the board met, I suppose, before we came to a final settlement of the account—I was brought into the board-room, and certain suggestions were made, and they were carried out—the official half-year ended on September 13th, so that I had from then to October 3rd to prepare this account and adjust it—I was instructed to take certain items out, and to spread them over—that is to say, items such as those I have given you—it was considered unfair to charge the first half-year's working with these items—the decision they arrived at was that the whole of the preliminary expenses could not possibly be debited against the trading for six months—right through to the end you will find "the secretary presented a statement"; that is simply a minute in the book; he did not do so; I simply handed it in; I was not there when it was presented—"The secretary presented a statement for the financial half-year ending September 13th, showing gross profits £2,785 48. 1d., and net profits £1,269 13s. 4d."—I wrote that minute from the agenda, of course; not that day, the minutes were always written a week afterwards, not on the day, but at the time I entered this up I had no reason to doubt that it was right—the figures were arrived at after the board had dissected the accounts—I never presented any such account with those figures—there is no account made up after the figures were dissected by the board—the figures wore "added and the additions were made afterwards, and it was left in the board-room—I did not make the additions—I did not make the alterations—the statement was simply altered and retained by the board—it was in the possession of the board, I know—I saw it afterwards, certainly, but only the totals from the agenda paper, which was always signed by the chairman, and from that I entered up the minute—if the chairman was not there on the day, the chairman who officiated for the day would sign it—it never came back into the outer office—I did not make the altera<lb/>tions—I made the minute from what I found on the agenda—in February of 1895 I was examined before Lord Stormonth Darling in Scotland in the liquidation proceedings of the London and Scottish Bank (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 258, <hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I was being asked about the statement which I had referred to as having been presented according to this minute, showing aprofit of £1,269 13s. 4d.; it is the same statement in an altered form—my answer then was: "It was in the hands of the board; it was presented duly to the board"—I say so still, undoubtedly, but in an altered form; it was not altered outside at all; it was altered in the board-room—the minutes were altogether wrong when they say thai the secretary signed it—I say I presented a statement; it was altered by the directors at the board room, and I never saw it—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230209"/>
               <p>I cannot see that there is much in not saying that when I was being examined in Edinburgh; but it never came out of the board-room—I said, "So far as I know, it is in the hands of the liquidator; it was amongst the other documents "; so far as I know, it is still—I said that it was pre<lb/>pared by ray instructions; I believe I did it myself; I may have had some assistance from the other members of the staff, but, speaking at the pre<lb/>sent date, there was not much of it, and I do not see why I cannot have done it all myself in one day—I was asked about a number of questions—I know I presented a statement to the board; it was altered in the board-room, and never came out—I did not give that answer then; the question was not pressed in Scotland in the way you are doing it now—I am practically of the same mind that I was then; I say it may be in the bands of the liquidator now; it never was in my possession—it is misleading to say that the secretary presented it; that is right through the minutes from beginning to end, and it is mis<lb/>leading—I wrote it all from the agenda paper; it was always done in that fashion—I did not present it personally—my explanation is that the statement was handed into the board-room; it never came out after; it was altered there—it was never presented by roe or any of the rest of the staff after it was altered—I said, "None of the directors took active part in making up the account"; I say so still—it is only that one account that is dealt with; then I said: "It was submitted to the board (Q.) Prepared by you and submitted to the board?—Prepared by me and the staff. (Q.) Did the four directors, before they authorised the payment of this 7 per cent, dividend, take any means to satisfy them<lb/>selves that the profit had really been earned?"—they may have done so—the chairman, before the dividend was paid, may have had the statement in his hands for a week; I do not remember it now—I have already told you to-day that it was a committee of the board which passed the account finally—it was not on the same day—whether before they authorised the payment of a 7 per cent, dividend they took means to satisfy themselves that the profit shown on that statement bad actually been earned is not within my province—the directors had the opportunity to satisfying them<lb/>selves that the statement prepared by me was correct; they had the slips of paper which contained the details of each entry along with the statement—Mr. Beall was questioning me; he insisted on being in Court—the statement, as prepared by me, contained the then value of the securities the bank held, and their various assets; the value of the deposits that we had negotiated, and the sum that had accrued to the bank; we held it as security, undoubtedly; if we discounted a man's security that was our security—the statement contained the then value of the securities which the bank held; in this statement that I prepared, for instance, you will find that Colonel Schaffer had a discount of £782; that was down in the statement, and what had accrued to the bank in discount for the same—the man's bill would be the only security we had—I was asked, "Can you say from your own knowledge, as an ac<lb/>countant and secretary of this company, that the directors were entitled to declare a dividends and I said, "Yes, it neemed all right;" it was a qualified reply—it goes on, "The sum to be expended on dividends is not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230210"/>
               <p>a large one"; that is a qualitiod reply—they passed it, I did not pass it; I had nothing to do with it except to fill in the minutes from the agenda paper afterwards; so far as I was concerned, it ended there—I took no responsibility at all—it was put to me, "It was not bonus, but it was earned?" and I replied, "Yes, according to the statements submitted to them, and they satisfied themselves about it"; that is altogether mis<lb/>leading—I did not submit any statement that warranted a dividend being paid; I could not have said so in evidence—I remember the cir<lb/>cumstances perfectly well; there was a strong discussion between the chairman, Mr. Beall, and I as to whether the directors' fees should be taken into account—they were taken into account on the statement I made; that was a most important item; it was the largest item in the account—it was taken into account in that statement—I cannot remember what the directors cut out—I did not say just this minute that they cut it out; I said there was a discussion on that point; it was talked over in the board-room between the chairman, Mr. Beall, and myself; that was the largest item to come against the profits; it amounted to £21 per week, about £480; it was the largest item I know of in the account as I drew it; against the net profit—there was a strong discussion on that point, but I know the ac<lb/>counts were cut up in such a way, they never reached me afterwards—whether I have ever made the statement in any affidavit or in any ex<lb/>amination that you make to-day and that you made at the Mansion House, is impossible to remember—I know tliere were a great many affidavits being made—from beginning to end there was litigation right and left while the bank was running—I cannot remember having talked over this matter at all with anyone—I have got a fair grip of the matter yet—I do not think I said anything in 1895 that I could not practically verify to-day—an interim dividend of 7 per cent, was declared, which took some £400 odd—if the net profit was £1,269 138. 4d., which paid away £470 odd in dividends, supposing they had made that profit, or anything like that, they had done wonderfully well with the little capital they had had; they had a small amount then; therefore, the more capital they did get the better thoy would be able to do, if they could get it on moderate terms—so far as that prospectus for further capital was con<lb/>cerned, that was a further issue of 50,000 ordinary shares; at a little premium if I recollect right—what had happened with regard to the ordinary shares was that none had been issued at all until March, 1893, when the first issue of 100,000 shares was made—then in October they did as they had power under the articles to do; they issued a further 60,000—I cannot say whether the two Sheridans were clients introduced by Brandon and Nicholson, the solicitors to the bank—it may have been so, but I do not remember at this dare—Brandon and Nicholson acted as solicitors to the Scottish Bank until April, 1894, I should say, roughly speaking—they acted for about 12 months; that would cover the time—it was during that time that the Sheridans were introduced—Brandon and Nicholson were also solicitors for the Sheridans in certain proceed<lb/>ings; I am not sure whether they were solicitors for them all through—I think Mr. Greville, a friend of Mr. Brandon's, acted for Mrs. Sala—he was a solicitor, and was also a director of the Scottish Bank—the Theatrical Trust was either Mr. Greville's or Mr. Brandon's business—I believe they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230211"/>
               <p>also acted for the British Refuse Company; Greville was the solicitor to that—Mr. Beall may have been averse to the trafisactions being entered into with the Sheridans—there may have been conversation on the board, but we did not know anything about that; we cannot say one way or the other—I cannot remember at this date if the bank was advised by Brandon to advance this money to the Sheridans—it may have been the case—that is six years ago, and I am not clear upon that point—wheu because they took away certain documents—I know we claimed certain documents from them—there was litigation—I cannot remember at this date if I swore this: "In the month of August, 1893, under the advice of Jocelyn Brandon, of the firm of Brandon and Nicholson," etc. (<hi rend="italic">Beading to the words</hi>). "and that the security was a valuable one"—if the affidavit is there, of course, it had been made—I was in the habit of making a lot of these affidavits at that time—they were all prepared for me—it is within my knowledge that Messrs. Brandon and Nicholson haveactedfor the Sheridans recenily, and it is possible that they did at that time—if Bran<lb/>don advised that this would be a valuable security, that was done by the board; that wasnot within my knowledge—the London Refuse Company's shares were, in the view of myself and the staff, at that time a very valuable security; we looked upon them as being very promising indeed right up to the finish; up to the end; I think, really, Mr. Beall did—when I went to Scotland he told me that a lot of these shares were going to be knocked into cash immediately, and I quite believed him—I thought they were very valu<lb/>able, and so did he—in pursance of what I heard in regard to it I sent out the circular which states, "We have had offered to us the opportunity of con<lb/>tributing to a limited syndicate, the object of which is to form a company to acquire and work Livet's patents for London and 20 miles round"—it says, "My directors, however, have made inquiries as to the value of the patents, and also personally had an opportunity of inspecting the. in<lb/>stallation at Halifax, and of seeing the results, and are so satisfied with the great value of the invention, and the <hi rend="italic">bonafides</hi> of the undertaking, that they individually have joined the syndicate to form the London com<lb/>pany"—the particulars which were sent with it were to show what Livet's patent was to do—I remember there was an enclosure went with that cir<lb/>cular—when the accountants came on the scene, that is Abbot's, we were urging them to complete their accounts; chey were there for three or four months—the directors told me to hurry them up, and I did try to hurry them up to get the accounts finished; they were a nuisance in the place—the first conversation with regard to what I was to do when I was going up to Scotland probably took place a day or two before December 6th; I know I left on the 6th—it took place in the board-room of the bank, I presume—we had only two directors at that time—I do not think they were both present; it must have been Mr. Beall, the chairman, I think, I am not clear on that point—I know Mr. Beall was there, and one of our directors—it is within my knowledge that Mr. Wain was there the night I left for Scotland; he came there that afternoon; that came to my knowledge the day after I was examined at the Mansion House—my view of my instructions was certainly not that I was to go up to Scotland to commit a fraud; to bring a lot of people into a meeting to pretend</p>

               <p>that they are shareholders when they are not is a thing done every day in London—it is certainly not what should have been done: it is done 80 often here that you get quite used to it—I am not personally so often entrusted with messages of that sort that I get quite used to it, but I hear so much about it—I had never done it before—it did not strike me as a very extraordinary thing that I should be asked to do it—I did not go to Scotland for the express purpose of carrying this out; that was a detail—I carried it out, but the chief duty I had to do was to interview shareholders and make them friendly to the board, and I did so—there had been an opposition going on to the board for some months before then—as soon as I arrived in Glasgow, the first man I interviewed told me they had been holding meetings—there was already considerable agitation—I had £25 in my hands to go to Scotland—I was to go and engage the room, not to see the shareholders and stop there till the meeting; I was running about between Glasgow and Edinburgh—I was to stop in Scotland till the meeting—I went on the 6th, the meeting was on the 10th—I received instructions two or three days before I had to go, about the 3rd—I knew I should have to stop there a week, any<lb/>how; I did stop a day or so, and I had to stand treat; a little detail—I got there on the morning of the 7th; I travelled all night—the first thing I did was to interview, before 11 o'clock in the morning, a share-holder in the western end of Glasgow; one of our largest shareholders—I went to Glasgow first—I wired to London the result of the interview with that gentleman—he gave me some particulars of what had been going on—I next saw another shareholder in Glasgow—I went to Edin<lb/>burgh n the afternoon, and saw some more shareholders there—on the Saturday morning I took the room—the office I had was not large enough to hold a meeting in, and I took Dowell's room—I paid either two or three guineas for it, and I had to get a commissionaire also to assist me at the door, whom I also had to pay—I stopped at an hotel in Edinburgh—on the Sunday afternoon, the 8th, I was running backwards and forwards con<lb/>tinually—I went between Edinburgh and Glasgow possibly three or four times, it is only about an hour's journey—I put up at relatives, at Glasgow—at Edinburgh I had to stop at an hotel—I was instructed to make the Royal Hotel, Edinburgh, my headquarters for letters from London—the first day I tried to get these non-shareholders to come over from Glasgow was on the Saturday—the meeting was held on Monday, the 10th—I did not see these various people personally, and make the arrangements with them—I told someone to get a lot of men for the purpose: his name is Leopold Rombach—I had known him years before—as a matter of fact he had a large boarding house, and a number of men in the place were made useful for the purpose; they were quite willing to go over to Edinburgh for the express purpose at the rate of 10s. each—I. believe I said 15 or 16 yesterday came over, but I am more inclined to say that there were 18 or 19—I had to pay all their fares, and 10s. each—that was the instruction I had before I left—my friend was simply one of the men—he was the leader of the band—I cannot tell you personally whether or not any of these people I say were present voted; I was at the door; I am inclined to may that they did; their instructions were to do so—Mr. Rombach was one of those scattered about the room inside—the principal part of my occupation was to stand at the door to prevent the</p>

               <p>Press coming in, and shareholders who had decided practically to break up the meeting—there were some people coming in who were not share holders—I could not stop the shareholders coming in—what went on at the meeting I could not attend to very particularly—I stood ia an ante<lb/>room by the door, just to keep the passage clear, and the meeting was going on inside the room—those people I brought over from Edinburgh at 10s. each had a full dress rehearsal the night before, and they know what to do—they were not brought over the night before and stayed at Edinburgh, they stayed at the house where they lived; they came on by the 8 o'clock train in the morning—I could not attend to two duties at once, and I did not see that they did what I hired them to do—beyond Rombach I do not think I know the name of one of them—Bombach lived at Homehead Street—I do not think he is alive now; I heard of his death recently—one of the men who voted at the meeting met me in the Strand the other day; he remembered me—there is one man who can corroborate the story I have told—I forget his name for the moment—I remember him at the meeting—I do not know his address—they were strangers to me—I cannot tell you the name of any single living person who saw me pay that 10s. a head to them—I did it in Princes Street, Edinburgh, after the meeting was over, in the street, where everybody could see, if they had chosen to see it—it was the main thoroughfare—the whole 17 or 18 did not march in a band after me; they grouped at a certain place, and as they came up I paid them—I handed the money to Rombach, and—he looked after it—I do not recollect swearing the affidavit which Was to be used in the liquidation proceed jugs—a petition was presented for the winding up of this company in Scotland; it was carried through, and I made an affidavit in answer to it, very likely; I do not remember now—this meeting was packed by more people than myself—the opposition also hnd the meeting packed; it was to counteract the influence of the other side—the instructions I got were to counteract the influence of the other side; I was to get as many friendly shareholders as I could—I never drafted an affidavit; it was drafted for me by the then solicitors for the company, Beall and Co.—it it was sworn by me—those were the figures that were given to me—I was not in the room—I knew a Mr. John Stewart Gowans; he was not a shareholder; he was an accountant, who came in and acted against the board—Mr. Archibald Oliver was also not a shareholder—those two had the most to sty at the meeting—Mr. Gowans proposed an amend<lb/>ment to the resolution which had been proposed by the chairman—I cannot tell the wording of it, but it was hostile to the chairman—the affidavit was not drafted by me—if it has been sworn, I certainly have sworn it—if I also said: "Messrs. Gowans and Oliver were also accom<lb/>panied with other persons who forced their way into the meeting, although they held no shares; the votes in favour of the directors by proxy were far in excess of those held by Messrs. Gill, Gowans, aud Oliver"; that was also from figures supplied to me—the directors could carry whatever' they liked, but the proxies might not be at the meeting—the proxy is given lor the purpose of being used, but if you hold a proxy it is not as good as having the men there themselves—if you have a lot of hostile people against you, yoii have a lively meeting, but the people in London did not want a disturbance; they were not hostile; they supported the</p>

Abbott's report was provided to the shareholders; they came to the meeting with a copy of the accounts in their hands, and a report—I take it to be Abbott's; they passed me at the, door with a report and accounts in their hands, and it was that report that made them hostile—during the last year or two there have been disputes between me and Mr. Beall.</p>

Baker"—I am absolutely prepared to say that, that is not in writing—the thing is certain—I tilled it up, but did not see it signed—I cannot remember where I filled it up—I do not remember the document at all, but I know the signature is not mine—I see my own filling up—I do not know what I did with it when I had filled it up—up to the time of my hearing of the proposed flotation of the Scottish Bank I had never known Mr. Singleton to use the name of Baker, I do not think he did—I cannot explain why he adopted the name of Baker, which is my name, and with one of my initials transposed, or why he forgot what the initials were later on—on one occasion he signed "Arthur Francis," and on another "Alexander Frederick," but up to the time of the hearing of the proposed flotation of the bank I had never heard him use the name of Baker; that is true—when I heard of the proposed flotation I may have asked him to do his best to get me appointed secretary—I do not remember I have said that Mr. Beall approached me on the point—they were continually together in 1892—I do not suppose I ever asked for the position of secretary; I may have asked Singleton to get me a billet, to get me appointed to some position, and ultimately I was appointed to the post I held—I was in hopes that this bank would be something of a permanent nature, that something good would turn up, and up to the tune of my appointment there was nothing to raise any suspicion as to the proposed bank—after March 17th, 1893, Mr. Singleton did not take any substantial part in the affairs of the bank—he was there probably from eight to ten days, until we got a clearing bank arranged for—he occasionally came to the bank after that; we saw him frequently—I was assisted by him in performing the duties that I undertook—that was previous to the allotment—he did give some suggestion as to how I should open the books, how I should do it as a clerk in the bank—that is all he did; he had no duty in the bank at all after the company went to allotment.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MARSHALL HALL</hi>. I have been connected with this company from its inception in 1892—I had known Mr. Beall a couple of years or so prior to that—I had been working with Mr. Singleton, who was acting for Mr. Beall—I knew nothing of Mr. Lambert at all until I first saw him in connection with the matters of this bank—it is not to my knowledge that Mr. Lambert was introduced to Mr. Beall by Mr. Humpage in February, 1893, but I know Mr. Humpage used to come about the bank at that time—about a month before the signa<lb/>tories appointed the directors I first saw Mr. Lambert there—he acted as a director, and attended a large number of meetings—he was put down for Wednesday at 12 o'clock, and Mr. Wain for Thursday, to attend at the bank for any business that might be wanted, not board meetings, and Mr. Lambert did attend to that part of the work—I was very seldom brought in touch with Mr. Lambert at all, but he knew that I was acting as secretary, because my name appeared—I saw very little of him indeed—he had nothing to do with the correspondence—you may exclude Lam<lb/>bert from the direct instructions—the first founders' account of any im<lb/>portance was that of the April 18th minute—Mr. Stokes and Mr. Lambert</p>

               <p>were appoiuted a hub<lb/>coninjittee to go into the accounts—that was a sub-committee for the purpose of vouching the accounts as presented by the founders—I have no reason to doubt that, as far as they were able to vouch them from the figures, they did so vouch them, and found them correct—I happened to be in the board-room the day the accounts were presented, and Mr. Stokes and Mr. Lambert handed these things over, and said they had found them practically accurate—that being so, assuming the document of March 10th, 1892, was a binding document in favour of the promoters, the minute which was the sanction for the pay<lb/>ment by Limbert and Stokes was less than they were legally entitled to—there has been a big deduction; so that, so far as the entry of the company or the shareholders is concerned, the passing a resolution in favour of passing the accounts was in favour of the shareholders, according to the agreement—Mr. Stokes was late Her Britannic Majesty's Consul—I have not seen him since he left us in 1895; I do not know if he is alive or not—Mr. Greville is a solicitor; he is alive; I saw him the other day—you could make poor Mr. Stokes practically do any<lb/>thing he was wanted to—Mr. Greville was there pretty frequently; he acted for several of the clients with whom the bank carried on discount operations—the next item of account is that furnished for the purpose of declaring the interim dividend; the figures were before the board for some time—I do not know what part the board in a body took—when I gave my evidence before the liquidator there was no question that I was liable, either civilly or criminally—four or five years have elapsed, and now a very serious question has been raised, imputing criminal liability to there people in the dock—I have been seen by the Treasury authorities and by Mr. Gray and others—I am trying to do my best to give you a true account of what took place in October, 1893, when this account was presented—it is more probable that I should have been more accurate in my memory in 1895 than I am in 1899—I was asked, "Did the four directors, before they authorised the payment of this 7 per cent, dividend take any means to satisfy theinselves that the profit had really been earned? (A.) Cer<lb/>tainly. I know the chairman before the dividend was paid had the statement in his hands for a week. (Q.) Can you say whether any investigation was made? (A.) I understand there was investigation. (Q.) What investigation? (A.) I cannot throw my memory back so far;"so far as Mr. Lambert was concerned; I never received any difficulty of any kind whatever from him as to the answering of any figures in this account—I cannot say how far Mr. Lambert knew of the figures, but I received no instructions from him—I was satisfied that at that time, at any rate, he was doing his duty as a director to the Scottish Bank; the staff knew that he was connected with other companies, and we looked upon him as quite a Martinet—it was Mr. Lambert that I had to deal with on its staff being guaranteed—there was some delay in the guarantee going through—Mr. Lambert applied to me week after week to see if the Guarantee Society had accepted the proposal; finally, Mr. Lambert instructed me to take steps to have each man of the staff separately guaranteed—we had a directors' attendance book—I know he did not attend the meeting in Edinburgh—it was his intention to go to Scotland, but it may have oeen illness that stepped in—he did not go—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230217"/>
               <p>I heard from Messrs. Abbott that Mr. Lambert said it was not a question of valuation by the directors, but a question of taking the securities at their par value, and it ought to be stated; that was Mr. Lambert's intention, I know—I know there was a very strong interview between Mr. Lambert and Mr. Abbott on that—Mr. Wain resigned on December 14th, according to the minutes—that would of itself have dissolved the board, because there would be only one director then—I do not believe there was after December 5th a properly constituted board meeting—those letters that were written after the Scottish meeting were written; without Mr. Lambert's knowledge—I do not remember that some cheques were submitted to Mr. Lambert about that time for his signature which he declined to sign—the letter from me in which I offer founders' shares for sale was a private matter of my own—I do not suggest that Mr. Lambert knew anything about that; I was not selling the shares privately; I was assisting the promoters, of which Mr. Lambert was not one—we used to send letters out frequently, but they were written on the instructions of the promoters—Mr. Lambert had nothing to do with them; he had nothing to do with the founders', and the founders' had nothing to do with the bank; because all the founders' were allotted to Baker and his nominees—so far as I knew, Lambert never received any money at the bank in any way except for directors' fees—anything he had from the bank has been repaid, and in addition he had lent the bank money—the bank were his debtors at the date of the liquidation; he had nothing whatever to do with my going to Scotland, or anything of that kind—I have had a great deal to do with this company, from start to finish—I will admit that I had a great deal more to do with it than ever Mr. Lambert has had—so far as I know, there has never been any proposition made to include me in a criminal charge with regard to this matter.</p>

Mr. Wain had nothing to do with the issue of founders' shares, to my knowledge, or with the correspondence with the persons who pur<lb/>chased shares—that was a matter between the promoters and the persons who bought—Wain came on other occasions beside the board days—he used to come in occasionally when he was passing in the neighbourhood—I cannot say that Wain never received a shilling of promotion money in connection with this company—the signature in this letter to Messrs. Abbott (<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 238) is not mine—it is <hi rend="italic">per pro</hi> Mr. Colee, the cashier; I was in Scotland at this time—it was written by Mr. Colee for me, who was acting as secretary in my absence—I see in Messrs.

               <p>certain payments which the bank had made on behalf of the European company—I cannot remember that now, but the minute says so—I do not remember receiving this letter (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I did not open the whole of the correspondence—it is addressed to the secretary—it would be received at the bank, but I did not open the correspondence in the instructions to me; it is dated August 1st, 1894—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sirs,—The asuditors have seen me to<lb/>day.

Please have all securities ready for production, register of debentures, and everything the auditors may require, including the paying<lb/>in book cf the London and Midland Bank, and the 'Founders' Shares Numerical Register'")—there was no such book kept in the office as the "Founders' Shares Numerical Register"—the founders' shares belonged to the promoters; the bank had nothing to do with the numerical list; that would be in the possession of the promoters—I know Mr. Wain went to America in 1894; I cannot say if it was in September and October—he was away for a considerable period about the time that the auditors were examining the books—I thiuk it was two or three days before December 6th that I went to Scotland to attend the meeting—it was not done in a hurry—I did not get instructions in the afternoon and leave that night—Beall gave me instructions—there was a second party undoubtedly there at the time, but I cannot identify him at the time—I was asked if I could provide a number of men in Edinburgh; I said I was a stranger there, I did not know anybody in Edinburgh, but I could do it in Glasgow—I knew that Wain was going to be the chairman of the meeting—I had some conversation at the hotel on the 10th with Beall on the landing, that was right outside my door—he came at 7 o'clock in the morning—with regard to what took place in the breakfast<lb/>room, I am giving my recollection after five years to the best of my ability, as to what I said to Wain—I said I had a number who would support him, and we talked about the interviews I had had with shareholders as well—I called upon shareholders in Scotland and promised them a cash dividend—they were present undoubtedly; they intended to be present whether they had seert me or not—nothing was said about 130 per cent, cash dividend—there was quite an uproar when the chairman spoke about 125 per cent, in shares—my instructions were simply to call on people who held 40 shares, the larger holders of shares—40 was about as many as are issued to anyone, and I called on six or seven of them in Glasgow—they were all present—I remember that a report was read—the shareholders came to the door with a report and balance-sheet in their possession—I did not hear Wain's speech—I was busy at the door—as to the interim dividend of October, 1893, any alteration that was made in the account upon which that was baaed was made in the board-room—it was prepared by me and handed to the directors—it was not a report—it was a rough draft of a balance-sheet, simply figures; it did not show a profit—I never suggested that any alteration had been made by Wain or any other director—I caunot recollect what I did say, but I know what took place perfectly well—I did not prepare a document showing the valuation of</p>

Carruthers Wain, £103 13s.—that is how by those dates the £469 for promotion expenses is cleared off—when the persons came into the room they had reports with them—I cannot say what they were like—they came with two papers, but I did not examine the papers—I did not take the papers from their hands and read them—they satisfied me, by having those papers in their hands, that they were shareholders, and I did not read the documents—before I went up to Scotland I had instructions from Beall—Wain was at the office on the day I had those instructions—the cashier was called into the room and instructed to give me £25—in the cash-book it is "December 6th, by cheque, F. J. Baker, £30"; I had £25—it was not a cheque; it was cash—the affidavits that were sworn by me were drafted by whoever was solicitor for the com<lb/>pany at the time—during the existence of the bank there were three firms of solicitors that acted for us—I went away on the even<lb/>ing of the 6th, and I got that money that afternoon—the affidavit was prepared by Beall—Brandon and Nicholson are the solicitors here, but it was prepared by Beall; his notes are here—both these affidavits were prepared and settled by Beall—when Mr. Stokes and Mr. Greville resigned I think it was early in 1894—I always believed the share-, in these London and British Refuse Companies to be valuable from the general conversation in the office—we knew Mr. Cooper, who had treat faith in the future of the company; we were in the habit of meeting him generally from the board—I had no knowledge of the matter—njy opiuion was merely what I heard—I see in the minute of</p>

J. Baker—I had been up once before; I was formally appointed liquidator—I did not collect any books before I was formally appointed—I only came up once for the purpose of collecting the books—I had the assistance of a clerk from the office of Clarke, Rawlins and Co.—I was not acquainted with the English style of doing business, so I got the assistance of a clerk—I made a list, which is—<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 252, of tho books which I had possession of, and which I after<lb/>wards handed over to the Director of Public Prosecutions; it was a list made when the books were sent up to him—the letter-books which I got began with letter-book No. 3—I never saw letter-books 1 and 2—letter-book No. 3 commences with March 14th, 1893—I never had any share-holders' ledger, or a list or account of any sort of the holders of founders' shares—I never saw any account of the founders' shares at all—I never saw any minutes of the meetings of the signatories prior to the appointment of directors or governors or any agreement of March 10th, 1892—I did not find among the papers any account showing the position of the company at the date when the 7 per cent, dividend was declared—the petty cash in hand was £10s. 8d—at my instigation the directors and F. J. Baker and Mr. Beall were examined in Scotland b fore Lord Stormonth<lb/>Darling in February, 1895—shorthand notes were taken of their examination—I was present the whole time of their examination, and I have since checked the transcript of the shorthand notes—I do not say that that transcript produced is a correct transcript of the evidence given by Lambert, Wain, and Beall—that is the actual transcript I checked, and it is certified by Lord Stormonth<lb/>Darling as correct—I did early in my appointment communicate with Messrs. Abbott, who had audited the books—I obtained from them a copy of their report and balance-sheet, and also some books—I prepared from the books and from Messrs. Abbott's balance-sheet a bal<lb/>ance-sheet up to January 16th, 1895, the date of my appointment—<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 253 is the balance-sheet which I prepared, with a profit and loss account from March 31st, 1894, to January 10th, 1895—the profit and loss account shows £2,739 odd—my profit and loss account shows that the total amount earned in that, period was £152 1s.—I think there was tid., toomuch, and did not go back over the older account; I took Messrs.

               <p>that—that was the total amount earned by interest, discount, and commission—during that period the directors' fees on the other side of the account amounted to £389 odd; salaries, including the financial manager, £l,012; law charges, etc., £698; and the rent and other expenses are divided up—the financial manager does not take all the £1,012; It is divided: office staff £687 6s., and financial manager £325; then there is rent and other expenses, making a total of £2,891 13s. 8d.—I did accept Messrs. Abbott's balance-sheet up to 1894 as correct, and, taking Messrs. Abbott's balance-sheet as accurate up to March, 1894, my balance-sheet shows a total loss during the working of this corporation of £11,755—the total loss on the whole working is £11,755 14s. 4d.—from my examination of the accounts I could find no justification whatever for the declaration of this 7 per cent, dividend or any other dividend—I saw that a total sum of £29 10s. had been received in the shape of premiums on the second issue of shares, and that second issue was at 10s. premium, so that that represented over 59 shares—with regard to the debenture stock I found traces of one person only, a lady, having applied for deben<lb/>ture stock—that was to the amount of £200—I found among the docu<lb/>ments the certificate that has been produced for the 30,000 London Refuse shares, and also the certificate for a further 15,000 shares in the London Refuse Company—I did not receive or collect at all any certificates of shares in the British Company—having collected the documents which represented assets of the company, I made a valuation of them in the first place—all these shares, I think, I valued at £50—my valuation of the total of the assets was £786 odd—the shares I put down at £50—that included some other shares besides the London Refuse and British Refuse Companies—<hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 251 contains a list of the assets of the bank, and in the result I realised £336 4s. 9d. from the whole of the assets, which includes calls unpaid on shares which I got in—I tried to realise these shares in the Refuse Company—I could not get anything at all for them—I found among the shares which were represented as assets some Buenos Ayres Tram shares—I found that those shares had been deposited as security for a debt—those were not properly included in the list of bonus shares—they were, in fact, included in the list of bonus shares representing a total of £48,000—that particular loan had been repaid before I was appointed—I find 100 £5 shares in the Lam<lb/>bert Collieries; received from 0. Hendrof £250—they were not properly included in the list of bonus shares, because J was informed afterwards that they were divided between Mr. F. J.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ISAACS</hi>. I came up to London before I was appointed liquidator, on December 26th, on an order of the Court—there was a petition presented on the Record before the Court, and on that there was a conflicting opposition, and then the Court ordered me to go down to the bank and make some report—I came up here in order to inquire, and when appointed liquidator I employed Messrs. Clarke and Rawlins, the solicitors, to act for us in London—I had nothing to do with Messrs. Davidson and Syme, and I had no solicitors at all when I came up the first time—I first went to the bank on the 27th—it was closed on the day I came up, the 26th—I went there in the morning, and stated what I had come for—I saw Mr. F. J. Baker—I was informed that Mr. Beall was away at Brighton ill—I got a certificate from his doctor in the beginning of January—I had no reason to doubt that Mr. Beall was at Brighton ill—in January he came back—it was about January 23rd that he came back—in December, 1894, when I was in Scotland, I was told that the persons, that is, Mr. Glaskin or high officials in connection with the London Refuse Destructor, would be asked to meet me to explain what had been done and what was being done—Mr. Glaskin was the con<lb/>sulting engineer in December—I did not see them; I was told that they were there, but I did not want to see them; I made no engagement with them—I understood about this balance-sheet of Messrs. Abbott; I knew that one of the assets which, at any rate, the Scottish Bank claimed to have were the shares in these Refuse Destructor companies—I was making inquiries in other quarters as to the balance-sheet—it did not occur to me that those were the best people to tell exactly what was being done with regard to it, as I wanted an independent witness—so far as these shares were concerned, there was no market value or Stock Exchange quotation—my reason for not seeing the people who were actually working the thing was that I wanted evidence outside the directors of the London and Scottish Bank—I never did, in fact, see either Mr. Glaskin or Mr. Cheesewright—I saw Mr. Cooper about it at his office, and I saw Mr. Wain about it—although the certificate did not come into my hands, I satisfied myself as to the title of the Scottish Bank to the £16,500 British; that is to say, that the Scottish Bank was entitled to the shares, although they had not got the certificate in their hands—ultimately I got all the books and papers except a shareholders' ledger—I know-a shareholders' ledger was kept, and I am almost sure I must have seen one iu December; when I came and took possession it was not there—so far as the ledger is concerned, it would be a register of ordiuary shares—the shareholders' ledger was of this importance, that I could" not tell who were in arrear, it is only to ascertain who had not paid the calls; I got £23—I had to get my clerk to make up a complete statement of the calls, and I found several inarrear—I came up later on in January, and employed Messrs. Clarke and Rawlins as solicitors—when I came on the scene in January, 1895, I</p>

               <p>found the balance-sheet, wbich had been made out, and upon which the litigation had arisen which had given me the appointment, and, so far as that was concerned, which had been made out by Messrs. Abbott and certified by them, I accepted that as correct; then, as they had only worked up the figures to March 31st, 1894, dealing with the year previous, to it, I set to work to see what the figures showed from March 31st, 1894, to January, 1895—I found that the interest, discount, and commission amounted to £152 only—the discount, commission, and interest from March 31st, 1894, to January, 1895, were considerably less than they had been after the corresponding period of the previous year, which showed that that part of the business was less from March, 1894, to January, 1895; there was no money to lend—the greater part of the money left had been used with regard to the Atlas Syndicate—£2,885 had been used by the Atlas Syndicate in the promotion of the London Refuse Destructor, and instead of having liquid assets fo work with, what they had got were these shares which they had received instead—this item, "Auditor's fees, £126," was paid to Messrs. Abbott for writing up the books and preparing the balance-sheet, I understand, then there are other items which bring the figure for that nine months up to £2,739 loss—the loss for the whole period was £11,755, made up of three items shown in the balance-sheet, which give no credit of any kind for the bonus shares, but if I took that £11,459, which was apparently the cash loss for the year Irom March 31st, 1893, to March 31st, 1894, I show a cash loss of £11,459; with the dividend it makes up the £11,755, which is the loss; that is how I got at it—as to these Buenos Ayres Tr urns, Abbott's ledger states: "100 shares Buenos Ayres Tram Ways Company and charges on interest on 2,000 shares in the London Metallurgical Company (in liquidation), J. Stewart Boyle, liquidator, received from C. A. Reeve," and there is another one here: "45 shares £5 paid preference in Buenos Ayres Tram Company, received from J.W. Clarke"—that is the one I was referring to—it is Clarke's account—there are two lots of shares, amongst which there are 45 Buenos Ayres Trams—the whole lot realised £800—the entry I have just read and some other shares are taken in <hi rend="italic">en bloc</hi> without any sum being put to them—some items are estimated, and some are not, and the whole amount alto<lb/>gether is taken in at £1,700, which is composed of the figures which are inserted in the columns against the shares—Messrs. Abbott have taken Wallace's acceptance into account at £300—that is their figure down here—it was they who did that from the books.</p>

Faithful! Begg and Co.; they are members of the Stock Exchange—they valued the whole shares—I could not ask the stockbroker to go and value each thing separately—I have not sold the Grappler shares; I could not, they did not belong to the company—I did not say at the Mansion House that I sold them—I never had the certificate—I took the shares as appearing in the list of assets; Abbott's list—he said he had satisfied himself that these belong to the company—this valuation is by Faithfull Begg and Co.: Mr. Begg, M.P.—I made further inquiries—"which would take—considerable time and involve corresponding expenses, which we are-not justified in incurring without definite authority. We are of opinion that a lew hundred pounds at the very outside is the utmost that could be realised by the sale of the whole of the securities. The majority of them we regard as absolutely without any value whatever"; now my point is this, how could I have sold those 300 Grappler shares for between £1,460 and £1,500 when I had not thecerti<lb/>ficate?—that is the very reason why I got these directors to Edinburgh, to-get the certificate—I brought an action to get it—I had the directors before the Scottish Court—I asked Mr. Lambert where the certificate was—I never communicated with the Grappler Tyre Co.—I did not write to the Grappler Tyre Co. and ask them whether this corporation were on the register of the company as the proprietors of these shares, after the explanation made by these directors in Edinburgh—it was informa<lb/>tion I got from Mr. Beall and from Mr. Baker—Mr. Lambert was asked for information generally—I cannot say I asked specifically—any<lb/>how, I never communicated with the company with regard to it, because after the information I got there was no occasion to—both Baker and Beall were asked about the Grappler—it was simply a security; they never got it registered—I understood it had been a security for a loan, which loan had been repaid, and therefore they were no longer entitled to the shares—I looked up the statement with regard to Beall at the time—Mr. Lambert was in Court, and if he considered the Grappler shares were in existence he should have said so—we had him up there for this very purpose—the directors were examined on February 26th, 1895—it was before that that I submitted these shares for valuation to Faithfull Begg and Co., for the purpose of my report in December—what good was it to go or send to Dublin to ask for information from the Grappler Company, when I was told they were security for a debt?—the directors were there, and if they did not consider it right they should have said so—anyhow, I have never realised those shares, and I never made any inquiries about it—I made inquiries about the other shares other than getting this valuation from Faithfull Begg and Co., from the</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of William Abbott and Co., chartered accountants—about July of 1894 I was communicated with by a Mr. Weller, and attended at the London and Scottish Bank for the purpose of auditing the accounts—I received instructions when I got there from the directors and Mr. Beall—we saw Mr. Wain and Mr. Lam<lb/>bert, and Mr. Beall, from what I remember, and commenced, with the assist<lb/>ance of our clerks, an examination of the books—I found from the books the receipt in the shape of subscriptions for the ordinary shares; March 31st was £21,706—I should say, less £2,000 for founders' shares, which I see are treated in the same item; I did not notice that at first—if I put it at £19,706 that will be the correct answer—we found that the moneys first received from the subscriptions, £6,969 10s., had been paid into A. F. Baker's account; that is all in respect of ordinary shares; and payments to the corporation made by Mr. Baker were £5,325 19s. 9d. leaving a balance of £1,642 10s. 3d. unaccounted for—I made inquiries of either of the defendants as to what had become of the balance—we inquired of all of them, I believe—the explanation given by the secretary was that this amount was payments made on behalf of the London and Scottish Bank on pro<lb/>motion account by the promoters—we asked for vouchers to show those payments, but never saw any—we asked for an account of The items of these payments; that we never received—the establishment expenses ac<lb/>count was put before us; I believe this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—this would undoubtedly be the book from which it appears to be taken—that was in the book at the time we audited—the itein on this account, "Birtwistle, £200," appears in the book when we first examined it, I imagine—that was an amount which had been paid by Mr. Birtwistle for shares—I see our journal note on it is that it was an amount received by Mr. Beail from Mr. Birtwistle for shares in this company prior to the company going to allotment, and it was omitted in the account of the allotment—the money had not been handed over—I cannot remember now; I know it was carried to establishment expenses after I came on the scene, I think—I said I did not quite remember, but I think it might have been so, from the reason that we allude to it in our accounts and owing to the journal entries—in the establishment expenses account 1 find at the end these two items: 'Beall and Co., No. 1 account. £346 19s. 8d.; ditto. No. 2 account, £1,219 10s. 4d."—at the time I came on the scene I found, ac<lb/>cording</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230227"/>
               <p>to the general ledger, that Beall's account No. 1 was overdrawn to the amount of £346 19s. 8d., and that amount of the overdraft of Beall's account has been transferred to the establishment expenses account—according to the figures before me, Beall and Co. No. 2 account is overdrawn £1,219 10s. 4d.; from the figures in the general ledger, it appears tu be £1,193 138. 10d., or Us. 10d., and in the ledger that is balanced by transferring that overdraft to the establishment expetses account—the account is not ruled off here at all; it is not finished off, but that is the result—the result is to balance it; that is how it was treated—I inquired of Beall himself, and of all the directors, I believe, that is Mr. Wain and Mr. Lambert, and the explanation given to me was that it was to be transferred to the promotion expenses account, for payments made out by Mr. Beall—we had no vouchers before us to show those payments made—it was transferred because it was assumed that the balance appear<lb/>ing on that account tobe due to Mr. A.F. Baker was, in fact, due to Mr. Beall—the accounts of Mr. Beall and Mr. Baker were apparently one and thesame almost—we had to take those figures as we found them in the book—we had to work from that minute; we had to take the figures given in the minute that a certain sum had been expended—by the minute of April 18th, when the promoters' account was admitted, "It was resolved to admit the account at the above figure," that is £4,777—this is our note: "No account showing how this amount has been arrived at has been shown to us, although asked for, and we have been simply guided by the minutes "; that is as to the £4,777—I do not think I have the whole of the minute here; this is our journal note—this minute is April 18th—I have an account of all the moneys—we simply started with the balance of £4,777, and then we may have worked out the payments from that, but I do not see that we have got any account to show the difference between £3,409 and £4,777—I cannot make the figures fit, and I do not think, as far as I know, that any of the Counsel have succeeded in doing it—I do not know whether it is important or not, but it is a mystery—I did not say that I accepted this figureof £4,777 balance, and deducting that from the £6,909, I got the other figure; we have nothing to do with the £6,909—the de<lb/>duction of £2,132 is by an agreement dated March 10th, 1892, as I understand it; "less deduction from the agreement dated March 10th, 1892": that is the figure they arrived at themselves—we accepted the figure £4,777 from the minute as the balance j we had no means of check<lb/>ing it—so far as our figures are concerned, that £2,132 is merely arrived at by subtracting the £4,777 from the £6,909, and by an agree<lb/>ment with the directors and the promoters to do so.</p>

               <p>say that that figure of £48,200 would not be given to us until after we had dealt with the loss, but we should, of course, come across the securities at the time we were going through the account all along—we never put any value upon these securities in the accounts until after we had submitted our draft profit and loss account—after we had submitted our profit and loss account we got the value, the figure of £48,200, from the directors and Mr. Beall—by "the directors" I mean Wain and Lambert—I described them as bonuses because they were received as bonuses for business done, as rewards for certain advances and that kind of thing—we thought it fairer to describe them as bonuses than to use the word "securities"—I have got the copy of our balance-sheet as we sent it in ultimately to the directors—the item occurs in two places at the right-hand side of the balance-sheet, "By bonuses subject to realisation, £48,200"—I have not got a print of it—the print is not as we sent it in; I have it here as I sent it in—I will tell you how it is as we sent it in—it was "By bonuses valued by the directors, but which are subject to realisation," and in the profit and loss account it was repeated—it is the fourth item in the balance-sheet, and in both places in the balance-sheet and the profit and loss account I sent it in with those words—the result of bringing in that £48,200 was to show a net profit of £39,183, subject to the realisation of the bonuses credited <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi>—we added in the certificate, "We have examined the foregoing balance-sheet of profit and loss account, and find them to, be in accordance with the books of the corporation in London, and subject to our report of this date, we believe them to be a correct statement of the corporation's affairs"—I did not underline the words, "subject to any. report of this date"—one item is "By investment" in the balance-sheet "£425"—I have detaih to show what those investments are—there are 200 fully paid shares in the District Messenger Company, taken over at £2 each, and in the Union Newspaper Company ordinary shares are taken ovw at £25; that makes the £425—we took them at the price at which they had been taken over, not at what they were worth—I made a stipulation when I sent in this report, with Mr. Wain, I believe, that our report was to be read at the meeting—he promised that it should be done—this letter (231) dated September 2nd, 1894, is addressed to F.

We shall be pleased to meet the direc<lb/>tors hereon any time on Wednesday morning"—that would be the same account practically, but leaving out these bonus shares, but it is so long ago—I do not remember whether I had put them in by that time or net—No. 233 is the next letter, November 2nd, addressed to Baker, secre<lb/>tary (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—I then received the letter of December 8th, which has been read by Mr. Arthur Gill—(<hi rend="italic">Further correspondence was put in and read</hi>)—we gave Messrs.

Birtwistle, 40 shans, £5 paid"—all the entries above that are by cheque—"By Birtwistle, 40 shares," shows that 40 £5 shares had been credited, instead of handing the money over, and that I found in the book when I came there—I believe the two items of the overdrawn account are not our entries—I did not find the account balanced up in that way; I am inclined to think this is one of our clerks' writing; it is not my own—I found a minute of April 18th, which stated that the sum of £6,909 had been agreed, to, and that from that sum a balance of £2,132 had been subtracted in order to make the £4,777, and that the figures making up those items had been before a committee of the board, Lambert and Stokes—when I oame on the scene and inquired into these matters was some time in July, 1894—when we came on the scene we raised a great question, but that was the position in which we found it—I do not re<lb/>member the date our report was delivered; the papers show it, you have a receipt there showing the date—I do not think we had a cheque, I think cash was paid—we were paid, any way—they brought notes, I think; there was a receipt given by Mr. Pappadaki for the accounts, which was put in—that fixes the identical date—a receipt was put in at the last meeting, I think—it was put in at the Mansion House—I have given it to the Treasury (Produced), signed by Pappadaki, December 7th, 1894—I do not remember that I knew the date for which the meeting was called, at the time—a question arose with regard to the preliminary expenses to start with, and we agreed that it would not be right to debit the whole of the preliminary expenses in the one account, that that would be spread over a term, and therefore in this account I think we debit them with a third of the preliminary expenses; we deal with it in our report—the word "bonuses" used by us on both occasions represents either securities or shares; something other than cash that had been received, and some-thing, therefore, that would have to be realised before its proper amount could be ascertained; that was not our object in using the words in our report, "subject to realisation"—we did not know they were worth £48,200, or anything like that; we put in "bonuses valued by the directors, but which are subject to realisation," so that any one might see it was an uncertain figure—we did that for our own protection, and the protection of the shareholders—at the end of our balance-sheet we say, "We have examined the foregoing balance-sheet and profit and loss account, and find them to be in accordance with the books of the corporation in London, and, subject to our report of this date, we believe them to be a correct statement of the corporation's affairs"; so it would be perfectly clear to everyone who got this balance-sheet that there was a report, of this date of ours, and that the certificate was made subject to it—I forget whether this shareholder of whom I have spoken was Mr. Hedger—I could not say he was not, but it was some share<lb/>holder, or someone purporting to be a shareholder, on behalf of whom Messrs. Lewis and Lewis asked us to supply a copy of our balance-sheet and report, and we supplied them with both—one would be useless with<lb/>out the other, I should imagine—that was after the balance-sheet and</p>

Lewis and Lewis were acting as solicitors for the <hi rend="italic">Financial Times</hi> in a libel action in respect of the affairs of this bank—I might have heard rumours about it, possibly; if so, it has entirely gone from my memory now—I represent that the directors saw these accounts in the form in which they are drawn up now before December 7th; that is to say, document 224; that is our balance-sheet, with the certificate appended—I do not represent that the directors ever saw that before December 7th, as they were drawn up there at the finish on December 7th—they were corrected right up to date—we were working at it right up to November 30th, when I attended at the bank with the completed accounts, etc., and then I asked for a cheque—the accounts were then in the com<lb/>pleted form as they were eventually produced on December 7th—I attended with them all ready, but wanted cash or a cheque before I would hand them over—I did not hand them over till December 7th—I do not say they had not seen the figures, because we had had interviews right up to that date with the directors and the secretary right along, but they did not get these identical accounts, I mean; they had not got these actual signed documents, but they had seen the figures—by November 30th they had seen the figures, with the exception of trifling alterations—what I mean is, the accounts were not new to them; they knew the main features of them, no doubt—all the things Mr. Baker specially refers to in his letter are things that are in our report, and not in the balance-sheet—they had not seen the report; they had seen the accounts—they had seen the draft of this profit and loss account and balance-sheet, or very similar ones, practically identical, I think—they had not seen the report he means.</p>

Baker—beyond that, I do not remember having any communication with him during the whole time I was preparing the report—I do not believe I asked for F. J. Baker; I asked to see Mr. A. F. Eaker I think, about the items in the promotion account—I did not have much conversation with him; it was more my clerks than myself—it would be about that item of £4,777—I think I inquired from him about the minute, or one of the minutes, of April 18th, 1893—a portion of the minute is: "The founders' account having been submitted to Mr. Stokes and Mr. Lambert, these gentlemen reported that they had been through the same, and were satisfied with the amounts, and that the same was in order, showing that the sum of £6,907 had been paid by the founders, thus leaving a balance now due to them of £4,777; I believe that is what I inquired about from Singleton; it was a very long time back—I had had this minute before me, and I had read it, and I considered it as audited—I understood him to be the pro<lb/>moter, and then I believe I wanted information from him as to that portion of the minute of April 18th, 1893—he gave me no informa<lb/>tion; what we were asking for were the items of that account—beyond</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HALL</hi>. I know Mr. Lambert by sight—I saw him, I think, about half-a-dozen times during the four months—I believe I had an interview with him with reference to the valuation of these securities—I cannot say that he objected to the words, "as valued by the directors," saying that it was not his valuation at all—I won't say that he did not—the difference, from a shareholder's point of view, be<lb/>tween bonuses subject to realisation and bonuses valued by the directors, but which are subject to realisation, is that the directors are responsible for the value—I cannot say whether Mr. Lambert refused to be respon<lb/>sible for any such valuation; I have no recollection of his ever having said such a thing to me—the date at which this report was actually delivered was December 7th—I suppose the directors would rely on my requiring the vouchers, and seeing that they were in order—the vouchers are not in the hands of the directors, but in the hands of their servants, and important documents I should expect to find in the manager's hands—I did not prepare this list of the assets of the bank—it is our clerk's hand<lb/>writing—I believe, as a matter of fact, it came from Beall really—I do not believe that Mr. Lambert told me anything as to the assets of the bank; he was asked, like the others, to produce the vouchers—he knew they were not forthcoming, and it was not for us to find them—the people who had the custody of them would have to produce them and satisfy me as an auditor—in 1894, when we prepared this report, I suppose we were satisfied as to these securities being the property of the corporation—I really forget now; we put the matter exactly in our report as to what we thought then—it is true, as stated by Mr. Wain in that letter, that I declined to part with the report until I had a cheque, and the directors were pressing me pretty strenuously to get the report.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. A. GILL</hi>. If it be the fact that Mr. Lambert did not value these shares at £48,000, I suppose it would follow that the statement in the balance-sheet as we sent it out, that they were valued by the directors at that amount, was not true—that sum of £48,000 was not exactly meant to represent their face value—it is a little different; that was the value arrived at by the two directors—we were requested to put them in at that value—I cannot remember who requested me to do it, but it was by the directors, or we should not have put it in our report, and I take it to have very likely been done at a meeting of the board; from what I remember the values were put on them by Mr. Beall, and they were supported by the directors; they were corroborated by the directors—I think he supplied them with the information—those words in the drafts, "As valued by the directors," were put in the final settlement of the draft; they were discussed with the directors—whether they agreed with them, they knew of my intention at the time—I am prepared to swear that they knew those words would go in; I would not take it in any other way—I had discussed them with Mr. Wain many, many times before that—there was an opportunity of discussing the final draft; he could have discussed it after he got it, on December 7th—he could have done it; I do not say there was any discussion after the 7th;</p>

               <p>there was nothing to prevent his discussing it—I do not know what date the meeting was—I did not know that it had to go to the printers that very night, I have forgotten—if my report were read to the meeting, and also the description in the accounts not altered, that would, I believe, clearly show what my position in the matter was with regard to the valuation—very likely I got information that the securities I wished to see were in the possession of Mr. Beall—the next letter is dated August 27th, and is addressed to Mr. Wain: "We have now got the papers connected with your audit so far as we can near completion, but we shall be glad to have your decision as to the writing up of the books, more especially the cash-book"—Mr. Wain may have gone away on his holiday on the next day or two after receiving the letter from me of August 27th—he may have been away the greater part of September—this letter says that he was going away the next Friday—letter 245, of December 1st, says: "I have never expressed any opinion that you were interested in the promotion."</p>

J. Baker, said they held them—we saw what they could show us, and formed our own opinion about them; how we should deal with them—we saw the direc<lb/>tors on them—the directors were only Wain and Lambert, and we saw sometimes one, sometimes the other, and sometimes both; but mostly, I think, as the correspondence shows, Mr. Wain, and, of course, frequently we saw Mr. Beall, who was the financial manager—while Mr. Wain was away we saw Lambert; we saw them occasionally, all three—I cannot re<lb/>member which first asked me to bring the bonus Shares into account as profits—I know it was at the request of all—from what I recollect, the figures were supplied by Mr. Beall, the financial manager; he put the figures on them, and the directors took his figures in the usual way.</p>

               <p>Mr. Beall's office and took possession of a number of his papers—they were brought to my department, and I have been through them since that time—I had in my possession for some time, from the Solicitor to the Treasury, the books and documents of the London and Scottish Bank—I have been through the books, and examined them closely—I agree with Mr. Abbott that they are not properly kept—the cash-book kept by Colee is not a proper cash-book at all; it is not a proper cashier's book—it does not give you sufficient information—it starts after the first moneys dealt with by Singleton—that was not Mr. Colee's fault; it does not start with that balance that should havo been in hand; and as to the keeping of the book, it is impossible to ascertain from merely looking at the book which are receipts and which are payments, because they are dealt with in precisely the same way—for instance, if the cashier receives £100 from Mr. Jones, he puts on the debit side of the account "Mr. Jones £100," and on the oilier hide of the account there also appears "Mr. Jones £100 '—if he pays Mr. Jones £100, he draws a cheque to Mr. Jones, and on the debit side appears "Mr. Jones £100," and on the credit side "Mr. Jones £100," and therefore, without tracing it through the bank pass-book or by some other means, it is impossible at a glance to see whether it is a receipt or a payment I do not suggest that it is an intentional concealment, but from the system it is impossible to trace it—I am able to get at what was done with the pass-book, and so on—the cash-book is not a record of cash received by the company, but only of cash received bv the cashier: there are omissions from that cash-book of money paid by the public for shares—I have noticed from time to time in that cash-book a I the initials of the directors, including those of Mr. Wain and Mr. Lambert, and also in the petty cash-book; the first petty cash-book being missing, in the second I find similar initials—I think in cash-book No. 4, folio 85, there is the establishment expenses account—I do not find among the bank's papers or any of the bank I ooks any parti<lb/>culars of or vouchers for the sum of £6,909; the only reference I can find is the minute of April 18th—I have read Mr. Abbott's report, and notice in it he states that a sum of £1,642 10s. was not handed over by Mr. A. F. Baker to the London and Scottish Bank—I cannot say if that is a cor<lb/>rect figure—I have not checked it; I have no means of checking it, because, in the absence of the shareholders' ledger, I cannot say what was received by the promoters prior to going to allotment—Mr. Abbott said there was a shareholders' ledger, but I have not been able to verify his account—I find in the establishment expenses account a deduction from the £6,909 of £2,132—I have not been able to find in the books of the bank, or among its papers, any particulars of or vouchers for any items going to make up that sum of £1,232; there is no record of any date anterior to the company going to allotment—I find in the establishment expenses account an entry of the amount paid by A. F. Baker on account of the establishment expenses previous to account being taken over by the board, £1,855; I cannot give you any information as to how that figure was made up—I cannot tell how that contra entry, "Payments made to A.

               <p>the date is March, 1893—I cannot verify that item from the com<lb/>pany's bank pass-book—in the establishment expenses Beall's accounts, Nos. 1 and 2, are ordinary drawing accounts—there was no item of esta<lb/>blishment expenses through that account, that I am aware of—in the books of the bank, in the cash-book, I find also an account of the Atlas Contracting Syndicate, opened on February 7th, 1894, and continued until November 30th, 1894, and kept in that part of the cash-book which was apportioned to customers' account; and, so far as the book is con<lb/>cerned, that appears to be a customers' current account—from my exami<lb/>nation of the London and Scottish Bank cheques, I do not find that the cheques which are drawn according to the books on the Atlas Contracting Syndicate account were really drawn by the directors of the London and Scottish Bank in every case; the large cheques were, including Nos. 219, 220, and 221, in the exhibits, which were in payment of the Atlas promotion expenses; and in addition to those three, there are a number of others of larger amounts—I also found a directors' attendance-book; and, looking at that, I find that Wain attended 69 meetings and Lambert 71—loose in one of the books of the bank I found what purports to be a re<lb/>solution signed by all four directors, Wain, Greville, Stokes and Lambert—it shows first of all a list of 151 shares applied for, then it recites that 2,485 shares had been previously allotted—I do not know if 2,485 was the number of shares previously allotted by the signatories—there is a register, which gives the date of entry as a member—I find from the books of the company that Lambert held no sharps at all—there was no qualification—Lambert held no shares at any time in the company accord<lb/>ing to the register; I can find no trace of any—Wain is entered on the register under the date of July 17th, 1893—the first payment made in re<lb/>spect of shares was August 25th, 1893, £10 according to the books—he is entered on the register for 20 shares, and in the cash book, on folio 60, the entry is: "To cheque, J. W. C. Wain, for shares, £10"—I find on December 7th, 1894, that Wain's account is credited with the sum of £170 13s. 4d.—other entries in the books show that that was a credit for directors' foes, and the book shows that £100 of the £170 13s. 4d. was credited to his share account—the £10 paid on August 25th, 1893, and the £100 apparently credited to his share account in December, 1893, is the total amount that I can find that Wain ever paid for the shares, and I see a pencil note in the share register as showing that those are the amounts paid by him; I do not know who made the pencil note; it was made before the register came into my possession—there is no record of founders' shares in the books, or of the number of founders' shares actually issued—no counterfoil book has come into my possession—it would not be possible without a record of how many founders' shares were issued to properly declare a dividend or distribute a dividend—the ordinary shareholders would get the preference—I find an account opened headed "W. J. Carruthers Wain," promotion account, in the book pre<lb/>pared by Messrs. Abbott for the purpose of the audit—I find that that book credits Wain, as due to him from the bank, with £469 5s.—March, 1893, is the date—August 16th, 1893, "To cash, £100,': is the first entry of payment of any part of that sum—J remember in Mr. Abbott's account that he sets out as due to Mr. Wain the sum of £313 13s., on the promo<lb/>tion</p>

I have included an item of £60 as interest earned in regard to a loan to Colonel Schaffer—Colonel Schaffer's bill was eventually dishonoured, and the loss<lb/>on Schaffer was £357, because the bank held certain securities—the minute appears here—the £837 10s. 8d. is the outside they could have earned for interest, if everything had been paid—I do not wish to be understood as saying that they ought to have known on September 13th that the loss would be made—I have also in this account, at page 316, referred to the expenses relating to the Paris branch, the prospectuses and agency charges of the promotion, which comes to £11,790; and then there are two small items added, which with those would amount to £1,671, and altogether they show a loss up to September 13th of £13,471 2s. 6d.—I have made no allowance for bad debts in the account; it is without making allowance for bad debts and charging the whole of the promotion expenses up to that time—on September 13th, 1893, in our judgment, and according to my account, there was no justification for declaring any dividend at all—in Messrs. Abbott's account, <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 224,1 find an item of £425 investments—I find that Colonel Schaffer was a borrower from the bank upon a bill—the total amount of the advance to him was £782, but there is interest de<lb/>ducted, £120—the date of the original transaction was March 30th, 1893—it is the first transaction of the bank—Colonel Schaffer deposited as a security for that loan 200 £5 District Messenger shares, and also 1,000 Union Newspaper shares—I find that the bank took over those shares, the "District Messenger" and the Union Newspaper, at £425—Colonel Schaffer never repaid the amounts which he borrowed; so that the bank</p>

               <p>would appropriate the security which he deposited—that £425 was a collateral security against an undischarged debt—I have been through the list of bonus shares—leaving the London Refuse Company and the British Refuse Company for the moment, I find on the list the Grappler Tyre shares, £300—that was received in regard to a loan to Mr. Cottam—it is entered in this list of bonus shares as of the value of £300, as if it was received by the bank from Mr. Cottam—I find, too, 100 Horton Ice anl five Globe Debenture shares, by looking at the minutes of the company; I find that they were deposited as against a loan to Mr. J. Hunter Steven-son—they were deposited as security for a promissory note on June 21st,. 1893—I find also a list of bonus shares, 20 Elmore Copper Company and 45 Buenos Ayres Tramway Company—they were deposited as against an advance to a Mr. Clarke to secure a bill dated May 24th, 1893, at three months, renewed August 26th at a charge of £10—the loan was repaid—it was finally met on December 10th, 1894, after several renewals—on payment of the bill the security was returned to Mr. Clarke—the bill was finally met on December 10th, 1894—then I also find a further 100 Buenos Ayres Tramway Company shares, deposited as security against a loan to Mr. Reeves on Mr. Reves' promissory note for three months—that loan was not repaid—it was subse<lb/>quently collected, I think, by the liquidator—I find among the Buenos Ayres shares 105 Olympic Music Hall shares deposited as against a loan to Mr. Shenton—the minute is: "It was reported that an advance of £90 had been made to Mr. Shenton at the request of Mr. Greville on his acceptance of two months date for £100, the security he lodged being 100 ordinary shares of £1 each in the Olympic Music Hall and five founders' shares of £20 each"—I find a further minute at page 118: "he George Shenton's loan," on October 3rd, when all four directors were present: "The secretary reported that this gentleman had been adjudi<lb/>cated bankrupt. It was also stated that a petition had been presented to wind up the Olympic Music Hall, Limited, and that on inquiries being made as to the value of the shares, no offer could be got for them. The solicitors were instructed to appear in both cases"—on page 124 of the minutes there is a reference to it: "The secretary produced a copy of the petition to wind up the Olympic Music Hall"—I find at page 161 of the minutes: "<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> George Shenton's loan: The secretary reported that this gentleman had been adjudicated bankrupt, and the first meeting of his creditors was to be held on the 24th inst.; proof of our debt had been lodged"—the last in the bonus list is an acceptance of a Mr. Wallace for £300, and, looking at the minute of May 24th, 1894, I see they say they will not discount the bill because the inquiries are unsatis<lb/>factory, and, further on, they say that Mr. Wallace's acceptance is no use, and afterwards they returned the draft on September 9th—it was eventually discounted because they got judgment on the bill—that acceptance of £300 was not met at all; Mr. Wallace became bankrupt—I was not his Official Receiver, it came through the department—I find that John Sheridan, by the loan ledger, folio 20, borrowed a sum of £600 from the bank upon a bi 1 of exchange—this agreement, dated July 17th, 1893, was found amongst Mr. Beall's papers, signed by John Sheridan; it is directed to the directors of the London and Scottish Banking and</p>

Beall and Co., dated July 16th, 1894: "Here-with I send you a transfer undated, to the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corporation, Limited, of 30,000 shares in the London Refuse Steam Generator and Electrical Power Corporation, Limited, which shares are to become transferable and registered only in the event of an allotment of shares being made by the said London Refuse Steam Generator and Electrical Power Corporation, Limited.—Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN SHERIDAN</hi>"—in regard to Fordyce Sheridan, I also find some documents in Beall's possession—Mr. Baker borrowed a sum of £500—he discounted a bill—here is the entry: "Our charge <hi rend="italic">re</hi> the above, as per agreement, under which we receive 16,500 £1 shares in the British Steam Refuse Company=£16,500"—in the papers of Mr. Beall I find document 318, dated August 19th, 1893: "Livet's Patent, No. 10,092, June 13th, 1891. Gentlemen,—In consideration of your advancing to me the sum of £400, I hereby agree to pay to you, or to your nominee or nominees, the sum of £1,500, in cash or shares of the company formed to purchase the above patents, as and when and in the same proportion as I myself shall receive the same from the said company; and I authorise and direct the directors of the said company to pay to you direct whatever sum or sums, either in cash or shares or in cash and shares, as may become due to you by virtue of this agreement, and I empower you to give a valid receipt for the same, which shall be as binding upon me as though I myself had given it.—Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">FORDYCE SHERIDAN</hi>"—that is the only advance, that £500 to Fordyce Sheridan—the next document is 318, dated December 6th, 1893: "Gentlemen,—I have no shares that I can place with you as further security, but if your board will renew the bill for three months, adding to the present amount thereof the interest, I will do my best to meet the same upon maturity"—No. 314, dated March 7th, 1894: "It is hereby agreed between the undersigned that in consideration of Fordyce Sheridan assigning 6,500 shares in the British Steam Generator and Refuse</p>

We are perfectly well aware that the shares will not be allotted until about November 30th next, and that, therefore, no legal or complete transfer can really be executed until afterwards. Under these circumstances we would ask you to kindly hold the transfer as our trustee upon the understanding that you are only to hand the same to us after allotment of the shares to Mr. Sheridan.—Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">E. BEALL</hi>"—the result was that the London and Scottish Bank gave for such rights as they had to these British Refuse shares and the London Refuse shares advances to John Sheridan of £725, and to Fordyce Sheridan £500, and approximately £2,000 was spent in promoting the Atlas Com<lb/>pany—then they altogether parted with £4,225, or thereabouts—I have had before me the banking account of J.

W. Haley to Baker: "I am pleased to inform you that Mr. A. F. Baker has satisfactorily arranged your matter with Messrs. de. Reuter"—in bundle 197 there is a cheque for £90, dated July 8th, credited in Beall's account No. 2 on the same day—198 is the acceptance for £-230 with which Mr. Haley discharged part of his liability—Beall's account No. 303 at the London and Midland Bank is credited on August 19th with £230—that bill is providea for by another smaller bill and some cheques; it was presented through Mr. Beall's bank, and then it was discharged by various, smaller amounts and a bill—of those cheque two of them passed into Mr. Beall's account, and one of Mr. Haley's subse<lb/>quent bills for £100 was met by some further cheques and two of those further cheques also passed into Beall's account—I have not found any trace anywhere in the bank's books; letter-books. or papers of any shareholder having asked Baker to dispose of his fully-paid up founders' shares, except one, before the bank came to an end—there is a note on <hi rend="italic">Exhibit</hi> 261, "48 sent from allotments list, April 10th, 1893"—that was taken from the guard-book, and there is a pencil note on it-the copy Baker produced was taken from the guard-book; that has, no doubt, a direction on it to send off similar letters—a guard-book is a covering book in which notices are pasted which have been sent out from offices; if circulars are sent out a copy would be pasted for reference in the guard-book—it contains copies of all circulars sent out—things we send we put in the Press copy-book; they are prints mostly, and they could not be pressed—this is the actual guard-book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—it is a memorandum of the number of these things that are sent out; that is what it looks like; I do not regonise that writing—among Mr. Beall's papers I found <hi rend="italic">Exhibits</hi> 97 and 98, 97 puporting to be an appointment of the directors or governors by the signatories, undated: "We, the undersigned, being the signatories to the memorandum and articles of association of the London and Scottish Banking and Discount Corpora<lb/>tion, Limited, hereby appoint the following gentlemen—W.J.

               <p>The secretary was instructed to send out the necessary letters of allot<lb/>ment"—then I find No. 306, which is an extract from the minutes of April 11th, 1893: "An account was produced showing the sum of £l,284 3s. 1d. paid on behalf of and debited to the company. The matter was referred to a committee (Messrs Stokes and Lambert) to examine with vouchers, etc., and report thereon to board. An account was also submitted showing establishment expenses, and those of the founders, amounting to £6,909 10s., referred as in previous paragraph"—No. 306 is a copy in which there are slight alterations of two minutes, which I found in the minute-books; this particular copy was found among Beall's papers—I also found among Beall's papers, document 307, which is a letter purporting to have been written by J. Lloyd Morgan wnd Co., per H. E. to J. R. Blakiston, Doncaster—there was an action by Blakis<lb/>ton tried in the Scotch courts—there was another document (312), which I found—as the Official Receiver in Beall's bankruptcy, I know his hand<lb/>writing—I find on the face of 312 some writing to his; it is a type-writter document, with manuscript in it—that is his writing making altera<lb/>tions and corrections in the type-written text; that purports to be a cir<lb/>cular to the shareholders of the London and Scottish Bank—I have read document No. 21, and I find that No. 21 is 312 as corrected—312 is the corrected proof (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—21 is signed "J. L. Morgan," and I find Beall's writing on each of the documents in bundle 311; the first three are entirely in his writing, and the last one partially—I have read document 311, and find on the documents phrases that occur in 312, as if jotted down, from time to time (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—In going through the books of the bank 1 saw the ledger in which the current accounts were kept—from first to last there were 34 current accounts opened in the bank books—the persons who so opened those accounts are the directors and persons whose names appear in the minute-book as being acquainted with the directors; it includes directors and other persons whose names I found in connection with this bank business—there is not a list of the 34—I have taken up to September 13th, 1893, here—there are 31 from start to finish, but I took up to that date; I went into it carefully down to that date—on September 13th I found 20 accounts had been opened; some were closed then; of those 20, 10 were overdrawn on that day to an amount of £473 6s. 4d., and the other 10 were in credit to an amount of £238 281d.—so far as I know, there was no security for such overdrafts—both Beall account's were included, and both wftre overdrawn; No. 2 was overdrawn to £1 1s. 8d., and No. 1 to £346 19s. 8d—Wain's account was overdrawn £2 7s., Printing Press Agency, Meeking, £25 overdrawn; Pappadaki, £18 overdrawn; Octavius Stokes, £50 overdrawn—five of those 10 customers whose accounts were in credit were indebted to the bank on other loan accounts at the time—they were: Martin Stokes, Mrs. Bessie Sala, W. Best, W. Collins, and Herbert Cummings: £646 15s. altogether—11 of those 20 customers were afterwards made bankrupt, and they have been since through the Court, taking Beall and Co as two—Octavius Stokes was at Green wich, and I have no personal knowledge of that—Meeking was bankrupt; that was another High Court; that was the Printing Press Agency—they were most of them overdrawn; some of them were not—the chief portion of the business which the bank did was discounting</p>

               <p>bills and lending money—in the list I made up to September 13th there is a list of debtors to the bank of persons who have borrowed from the bank—on page 319 I find that the total amount lent, which amounted to £473, including overdrafts on current accounts, was £6,768, 14 s. 8d., and that the bank recovered from those persons £4,284, but lost as bad debts £2,474 13s. 7d. up to September 13th—20 per cent, and over was charged on acceptances—the bill-book will show the renewals; the bills were mostly renewed when they matured—this is the bill-book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the discount business, taken from the point of view of profit to be earned, was a very insignificant one for the whole period—there was very little money to lend, and therefore the amount was obviously small—during the first six months the interest earned was £837 10s. 8d., and the total loss on those transactions was £2,436 11s. 11., 11d.—in my balance-sheet, at page 315, I set out £514 as being; cash at the bankers—a number of cheques were outstanding, amounting to £282 16s. 9d., leaving available cash at the bankers £231 11s. 9d.—I said £17 13s. 8d. was the cash in the hands of the cashier—how I cannot say, but I made a mistake in that item—it should, in fact, be £341 11s. 2d.; therefore cash in hand at the bank is £573 2s. 11d. instead of £249—there is an error, therefore, of £320 odd in the total, but at the foot of the account there is an item of balance unaccounted for; it will be reduced by that amount—it will not affect in any way the profit and loss account—I cannot tell you whether there was any reason for the cashier having such a large sum in hand at that time—there was no loan made the next day or shortly after that might account for it—I do not think that the cashier had an unusual sum at this time; it was to meet cheques and current expenses—it got less as time went on, until it was replenished by cashier's cheques for current expenses.</p>

Bramall £15 10s. 10d.—Pap<lb/>padaki repaid the whole of the amount eventually by 10s. a week, I think—the bank lost nothing by that—I think they were justified in looking upon it as a good advance—five of those 10 customers were indebted on their loans; the object being to show that several of those customers that were apparently in credit on their current accounts were debtors to the bank on loan accounts—there was nothing due at that time by Best; there was a discounting acceptance drawn on T. Jarvis—Best is the drawer—it was a bill for £50 due on September 30th—it was renewed and eventu<lb/>ally paid on November 6th of the following year—up to September 13th there was nothing due—with regard to Mrs. Sala, I find one bill for £355,</p>

               <p>due August 15th, paid on August 16th, and another dated August 18th, due on October 21st—Collins' was a two months acceptance dated June 17th, due August 20th, and it was renewed monthly until it was eventu<lb/>ally dishonoured, and it has not since been paid—Collins then gave some shares in the International Electric Lighting Company—the bill of Mrs. Sala is for £100 due on October 17th, then renewed and eventually paid on February 28th, 1894—another bill was given, but eventually it was met—these amounts were discount liabilities, but the time for payment had not actually matured; the proceeds of the bills were credited to the current accounts, and thus created the credit balance on current accounts—when I went in as an Official Receiver, I took possession of all the papers of every description—it appears from the share register that with respect to each person's allotment there is the date at which he became a member, which would mean the date at which the allotment was made to him, I should say—Mr. Abbott, no doubt, had the books in his possession, from which he prepared the accounts down to March, 1894, and those books passed into the possession of the liquidator and into my possession subse<lb/>quently—from those books, taking them to be correct, there is no diffi<lb/>culty in getting at the facts—I have as far as possible checked the figures with the cashier's books—Mr. Abbott's account does not relate to the period beginning September 13th; he deals with a different period—I had to use the same materials that he had to a very great extent; for instance, to show the commissions earned, I took the details of the commissions earned up to March 31st, according to Mr. Abbott's statement, and then I went through the same books for the subsequent period, and then I went through the cashiers books to see if those amounts had been received or earned—the documents that I received on behalf of Beall when I took possession as Official Receiver were very, very numerous—there were some books, but very few entries in them—I looked through every one before I went to the Mansion House—I extracted from the papers about one hundredweight that appeared to have a bearing on the case, and the agreement with the Sberidans was one of those that was not put in; I cannot tell you why, except that there were a great many left out—there were 400 exhibits put in—I think I had the prospectus of the London Refuse Company; that is the document that was put in with the illustra<lb/>tions—there were a large number of loose documents—the founders' shares were share warranto to bearer, and if 2,000 founders' sharps were payable to the promoters, so far as the company was concerned, they would only have to deal with the 2,000 founders' shares, they could not deal with any more—as they were share warrants to bearer, it was quite immaterial to the company how they were distributed—it is very unusual to advertise the dividends, and to let the holders of the warrants come forward and claim them, because in every other case that has come under my notice there has been a register showing the names of the original founders, and then it is invariably found, before the dividend is paid, how the founders' shares have been dealt with—my registration will not assist me to find out to whom the dividend is payable; it does not matter to whom it is payable, except at the time you pay the dividend—I debited all the preliminary expenses of them—I take them into the profit and loss account—of course the statement of affairs sets out all the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230246"/>
               <p>liabilities—it is right in making out your profit and loss account lo take into account the preliminary expenses—if there ia any future benefit to be derived from the preliminary expenses, then I think it would be just to spread them over the period during which the benefit will accrue, but where the whole expenditure has been made and there is no future benefit that can accrue, then the only way is to charge the whole to that period—take a case where large sums are spent on advertisements: it is very usual to extend the amount over an ascertained period, because it is thought that benefit will hereafter arise from those advertisements—that is frequently done—with regard to this particular case, I took my mind to September, 1893, in preparing this account; the profit and loss account is a very different thing to the capital amount, and whether or not a dividend may be declared without bringing into the profit and loss account, a loss on capital account, depends on circumstances; each case must be governed by the particular facts; and by the opinion I formed with the knowledge of the business as to whether the amount should be spread over, and as to the future benefit from the preliminary expenses that have been incurred in some cases, there can be no dispute—I took the whole amount of the stationery into account, but as it was impossible to ascertain the amount of stationery in hand on September 13th, I thought that would be a fair set off against the rebate on current bills, which I did not take into account—I made up the amount for the purposes of this case this year, 1899—having no means of finding out how much was left in stock on September 13th, 1893, I debited the whole amount—I recollect that Mr. Brandon had to go to Paris, and was there for more than a month, and eventually took possession of the office, and also that two of the directors had to go over; but that does not show me that the greater part of these expenses, "law charges £463 10s.," related to the Paris house litigation—I cannot speak as to details—of course, the bill would not come in for some time afterwards—I know ihere was a great deal of litigation—I brought into account the whole amount of the promotion account—on September 13th, 1893, there was a business going on—I do not think that part of these promotion expenses would be naturally to form that business—I think myself the whole amount should have been debited—there was no Paris house at that date; therefore, no future benefit could have accrued to the company in that respect—I have an item: "Liabilities, subscription received to September 30th, on ordinary shares, £16,188"—£200 of that relates to Blakiston's payments—I have treated that as a debit—it is not included in the £16,188—I should like to say as to that item that the balance unaccounted for is probably the difference between the amount I have taken and the actual account—it is impossible, in the absence of the shareholders' ledger, to ascertain the actual amount—I do not suggest that the unaccounted for balance was misappropriated—the balance unaccounted for would probably arise from there being some further pay<lb/>ments for shares which I have not found in the books—I said, "The balance unaccounted for is likely to have arisen from receipts from the shareholders which, in the absence of the shareholders' ledger, I have failed to trace"—I think that is probably the explanation of it—out of the whole amount of these cheques that have been paid, there is only one</p>

               <p>that is traced into the Morrison account, and that is the £100 Haley cheque—there is something to be added, I do not know what the amount is, for costs of litigation—the company got a judgment on the Wallace bill, and then took bankruptcy proceedings; so that whatever the amount was that was expended on those costs would have to be added to the £4,000 odd that had been actually paid by the bank; they got nothing from the Sheridans at that time—the litigation was to enforce payment of the Morrison bill, not to recover the shares—I am not prepared to say that there was no litigation with regard to these shares—the settlement that was made was made in the bankruptcy proceedings; there was a petition filed by the bank against Sheridan; then that petition was dismissed—the particu<lb/>lars of the bonuses are in the ledger (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—" 30,000 shares, £1 fully paid, in the London Steam Generator Company," are carried out at £30,000: 16,500 shares, £1 fully-paid, in the British Steam Generator, are carried out at £16,500—Wallace's acceptance for £300 is carried out at £300—if it is face value it would uot be carried out in the same way—we had no bonuses in the profit and loss account on September 13th—all I have taken in the account as credited was not in cash; it was earned, but it was not received, as a matter of fact—they had it in hand, because they only parted with the amount less interest; subject to the bills being met, it was earned—I was present at the Police-court right through—I heard Mr. Bowler called—the Alderman said he did not believe him.</p>

I find no trace of suggestion against Lambert of having had any share in the promotion of this company at all—I do not think that he has had any money out of this company except what he has received by way of directors' fees—I think the account shows that at the date of the liquidation he was a creditor on a balance for £19 due to him—the account shows £69; that is made up by crediting him with a loan of £50—anyhow, he was a creditor at that time, according to the books—I do not know if the £50 was lent by Mr. Lambert on Decern ber 5th, and that he had a receipt for it.</p>

This apparatus was put up in 1894—Mr. Livet died soon after it was commenced—I saw Mr. Livet in 1891 or 1892—he had written several letters to my vestry, and asked them to construct such a thing, but, of course, vestries are not very quick in moving, and it took two or three years before they would adopt any<lb/>thing of the kind—then they adopted it on a very small scale; they have considered this larger one, but at the present time they have not adopted it—my suggestion has not been adopted because the barging away of the dust was very much reduced in price; it went from 2s. 8d. a load to 11d. a load—it became cheaper to barge it away even than to destroy it by this process—it is only for a time, I think—I believe it is a better system to destroy it than to throw it into the river.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have no doubt as to the value of this process—if you barge away the stuff and get rid of it, you get no benefit from it; if you burn it, you get enough power to light your place with electric light, and if you have a large enough place, you would get enough light to light the streets, and save £1,200 a year—other vestries have not got rivers running through them, and, therefore, it costs them 2s. 8d. to 3s. a load-our vestry adopted it while the patent was going; we did not pay anything by way of royalty; we simply paid them £600 for the construction of the furnace and boiler; that was what</p>

               <p>we paid Mr. Livet or his widow, I do not know which; it was no royalty—if we had to pay any royalty, it would come out of the figures I men<lb/>tioned as the saving to the vestry—it was put up as a test instalment, and also to give us assurance that it was a destructor that was no nuisance to the inhabitants.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers, a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and a Fellow of the Society of Arts—I have been in practice for 30 years—I was intro<lb/>duced to this matter of the British Refuse Destructor about April, 1892—I did not know Mr. Livet before that—I went into the matter, and saw his process—I looked at the specification of the patent—I have no doubt that his invention was then protected by a patent—I know of Mr. Aston's opinion—I knew that that patent protected that invention—the peculiar feature of the invention was that as the heat of the furnaces had more energy in them the flues were narrowed, and as the energy got less the flues became larger, and there was a velocity of air through the fire<lb/>bars that was greater than you could ever get except by means of a forced draught—I know all the destructors, and this is the only one where an artificial draught is not created; the flues alter in their size: they expand—they are not elastic—these are con<lb/>structed to contract or expand as the heat or energy is greater or less—they are larger at one end than at the other—no doubt that was an original idea of Mr. Livet's—I formed a very high opinion of it; at that time, I may tell you, an experiment was being tried at a boiler in King's Road, Chelsea; I went there, and I was struck with the novelty and the magnifi<lb/>cence of the results; they were burning trade offal, and using no other power to keep the steam going; I asked the Assistant Locomotive Superin<lb/>tendent of the Midland Railway, Mr. Wetherburn, to accompany me and see it, and he could hardly believe that such a draught was caused by natural means, and he sent an assistant to the place, and he stayed there for a week to try and find out what was the cause of this draught—Mr. Wetherburn put £500 in it with a view of exploiting this patent—the next thing was the installation at Westminster Vestry; that was on a larger scale—I was satisfied with that—it was a practical test on a very extended scale—I have practised in Mexico City, and the municipality there are arranging for it, and £20,000 has been subscribed to make an installation on this principle—I went to Westminster to see this installation, and a large number of pressmen and other people connected with vestries went to see it—the unanimous opinion, so far as 1 could judge, was highly favourable—another installation was fitted up at Ira and Ickringill's at Keighley, in Yorkshire—I saw that—that is twice the size—it is working, and has proved an entire success—the installation at Ira and Ickringill's was for burning coal dust and dirt that could not be burnt under any other cir<lb/>cumstances—I put a very considerable sum into this; from first to last about £3,000—all that time I was assuming that this was a patent of Mr. Livet's, and that the patent was running—I know Mr. Livet entered into arrangements with the British Refuse Company for the purpose of financing this patent—I went all over the country; I saw different vestries, different corporations, with a view of inducing them to put their money into the business; I also prepared and read papers on the subject</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189910230253"/>
               <p>at different societies, and in that way the money went; I also lent money to Mr. Livet—I took some acceptances from Mr. Livet for some £2,000 or £3,000, all of which represented money lent—then came Mr. Livet's sudden death, and I had to take up those acceptances and repay them myself—the money was sent to my office to pay the fees, and my clerk, who was instructed to pay those fees, took the date of the payment of the fees from the date the patent was granted, not from the time when the patent was applied for: and a private Bill was promoted in Parliament for the purpose of getting the patent prolonged or renewed; it was refused on the ground that they could not take advantage of negligence, and so the patent lapsed—Mr. Glaskin was the engineer to the company, and I was consulting engineer.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. A. GILL</hi>. This document (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)is a copy of a report made by me, dated January, 1895, to the directors of the London Kefuse Company; I find this: "The company has granted certain rights to the subsidiary company for London and the six home counties This company has been formed under the title of the London Refuse Steam Generator and Electric Power Cor<lb/>poration, Limited, with an issue of £300,000, of which this parent company receive 100,000 shares of £1 each for its rights"—that is right—"The London Refuse Steam Generator and Electric Power Corporation, Limited, are on the eve of obtaining many installations on the Livet principles, and mention must be made of the Vestries of Shore<lb/>ditch, St. Luke's, Croydon, St. George's, Strand, City Commissioners, and Chelsea. The reason of several of these works not being settled is through the vestrymen being elected. As for the prospectus of the company, I can certainly do nothing but express my belief upon my ultimate success, as there is absolutely no other system that produces the same results as the Livet system"—that was my belief, and it is so now—I represented that to the directors.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SOLICITOR-GENERAL</hi>. I am not active in advertis<lb/>ing the merits of this process beyond giving lectures and going to the vestries—I do not know that I have given you a lecture to-day—I was all over the country expounding the merits of the process—the way I made up the £3,000 was not only expenses, but endorsing the acceptances of Mr. Livet, which his sudden death made me responsible for—in addition to that, I incurred expenses travelling about the country—that makes up the £3,000—I had not much suc<lb/>cess in my tours—they listened to me, but they would not perform—I had a most favourable reception, but no one would take the pro cess; as Mr. Wheeler said, the vestries are very difficult to move; I suggest that as the natural history of vestrymen they are very conser<lb/>vative; they have not an old-fashioned prejudice in favour of doing things as cheaply as possible, because had they adopted Livet's system they would have adopted a system cheaper than they are doing now by carting and barging—as to Mr. Wheeler stating that barging turned out to be cheaper, and that accounted for its not being taken up, that gentleman must have made a small mistake, because anyone going up the City Road would see an installation, a tremendous one beside a canal, where they could have barged their</p>

               <p>refuse away, but they do not, they burn it—that is St. Pancras; the City of London destroy their refuse by cremating it, and the St. Luke's Vestry do, but they make no use of it—I suppose the City of London is conser-servative—I do not think it is due to some other cause, because here is a fact that remains, that they are wasting heat every day by the destruction of the City refuse, and they are making no use of it, whereas if they erected the installation of Livet they would be lighting the City for nothing—I can-not say why they do not adopt this invaluable process; I can only repeat what I say, that the City of Mexico are going to adopt it—that is governed by a municipality, like the City of London; like our veatries—I do not know whether they are much more enlightened there, they will be, but at home in London, this process has met with very indifferent success.</p>
