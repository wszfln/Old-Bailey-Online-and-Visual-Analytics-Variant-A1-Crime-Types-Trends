               <p>—in the course of it the prisoner asked the Examiner to excuse him for a minute or two, as he suffered from diabetes, and might he leave the room: something to that effect—the Examiner said, "You will find a convenience opposite"—upon that he left; he was absent about ten minutes, and then returned—he apologised for being away so long, and said he had been to get a little brandy—the cross-examination was then proceeded with, and lasted till about half-past one—it was then adjourned for three weeks—I noticed that the prisoner was rather flippant during the examination, and he did not answer the questions properly—the Examiner cautioned him, and told him if he did not pay more attention he had power to report him to the Court—his demeanor was curious—about half-past one I left Mr. Bray's chambers, about the same time with Mr. Grainger, a friend of mine—I left after the prisoner; he was just outside the door when I went out—as I was passing him he said, "Come, Mr. Macrae, can't we come to some settlement in this matter?" or words to that effect—I said that no settlement could be come to; that we were going the right way to get a settlement—we were quietly walking downstairs all the time, the prisoner and I side by side, and Mr. Grainger behind—Mr. Green was speaking about what had caused the trouble; he said it was all owing to a Mr. Graham, and that it was not his fault—I said, "It was not Mr. Graham who had got me into trouble; you did it yourself"—Mr. Graham was a former editor of the <hi rend="italic">Financial Times</hi>—talking in this way we had got down two flights of steps (<hi rend="italic">pointing out the position on a model</hi>)—on arriving at the landing Mr. Green said, "After you, Mr. Macrae"—I stepped in front, and had got down about two steps when I felt a very violent push in the back, and I went head first down the whole flight of stairs, about ten, and my head went against the wall—my hat was still on my head; I fell down against the wall; my hands fell forward—I must have sprawled over to the right—I was lying on my right arm when I heard Mr. Green come standing over me with his stick—my hat must have been off then—directly I came to I tried to get up, and I did get up eventually—Mr. Green said, "Now I will murder you, you b—"—he must have followed me down the stairs, because directly I was on the ground he was beating me; it was all in the space of a second or two—he struck me several times over the head with a stick he had in his hand; he hurt me; I bled a great deal from the head—I was getting up at the time—Mr. Grainger and Mr. O'Driscoll came and caught hold of Mr. Green—I was up and trying to catch hold of him too; he caught me by the throat—I tried to get his hand from my throat; it was his left hand—we struggled, and got him into the corner—Meiklejohn came up before anything else was said—that was the first I saw of Meiklejohn; I did not know who he was—while we were holding the prisoner he said, "You have stopped me this time, but I will do for you yet"—he struggled violently till Meiklejohn got hold of him; then Meiklejohn persuaded him to be quiet—after a few minutes a policeman in uniform came up, and I gave the prisoner into custody for the assault—he said he would go quietly, and he was taken away in custody—I followed him—I told the sergeant at the station the same as I have stated now—the sergeant asked him what he had to say—he said, "That is right, and this is only the prologue"—in entering the charge the sergeant asked me my private address—I said, "At Norbiton"—the prisoner said, "That is just what I want";</p>

W. Green, a surgeon, at 7, Bouverie Street, came, and I went with him to his house, and he examined my injuries—I remained under his care for some days—I was out of the house on the Wednesday following—the doctor told me not to go, but I went on the Friday—I had two wounds and three bruises, and my right wrist was strained somewhat; my thumb was a little swollen, probably by falling on my hands—I did not attend before the Magistrate at the prisoner's first examination on 23rd September—I was ordered not to by the doctor—I attended on the remand, and gave evidence—I have got over the injuries; they have all healed up, and the scars have gone—I was in pain for some time—for the first day or two there was a little retching, but nothing very serious.</p>

Green's Promotions and the New Durham Salt Company"—I can't say that that company was commended to the public as an investment; I don't say it was not—I did not in the summer of this year go to Mr. Green and say, "Come, you must deal with me as Graham said he was dealt with; I must have something in respect of what you are doing"; I never saw Mr. Green at all—I have taken a good deal of trouble to find out what I could of the previous character of Mr. Green, what his companies were; I found out a good deal as to what they were, and what his character was in respect to their promotions; I mean as far as his character might be affected in regard to the companies—I cannot tell you when Mr. Moser, the detective, was first employed—I employed him to find out certain facts in reference to Mr. Green—I could not tell you without the book how much he was paid; I don't think it was so much as £250. I have never paid him any of it myself; the company paid him—I have no knowledge how much was paid him—the books are in Court—I never took the trouble to inquire about it—I did not give instructions that the prisoner should be followed till much later—I did give such instructions; that was after I had been informed that he was intending to shoot everybody on the <hi rend="italic">Financial Times</hi>—I have not stated that before; I have never had the opportunity—I can't give the date when I was told that—Major Fen</p>

"Isay no, distinctly—Mr. Green did not reply, "No, we cannot"—I did not then take him by the arm and say, "If you won't, I will make London too hot to hold you, "nothing of the kind—I had no such sentiment in my mind at the time of this assault; I had no feeling at all to Mr. Green; I meant to make it too hot to continue his malpractices; but I had no feeling at this time, my mind was on the examination; I was walking out in a perfectly friendly manner—he did not then push me away—I never had a stick in my hand, therefore I could not strike him with one—I have heard that a stick was picked up at the entrance of Fig tree Court; I did not see it—I believe a constable said at the Police-court that he thought I had claimed it; he described it as a thick knotted <hi rend="italic">wangee</hi> stick—I don't know whether it was a very fine morning, but I always carry an umbrella; I don't carry a stick in London, I do in the country—Mr. Green and I did not come struggling down the stairs, I striking at him with a stick, that I swear; my umbrella went out of my hand directly Mr. Green pushed me—I never fought at all; I used no violence except in holding him when I got up, and then I did not use any violence, I held him with all my power, that was all—I did not know that Moser was attending this examination that morning, but I believe he was, I am not sure; I believe he was, and two men; I ascertained that afterwards—Mr. Mayhew was in the Examiner's room, Mr. Grainger, Mr. Lumley and his clerk, and Mr. Terrell, and Mr. O Driscoll came there to take a shorthand note; he is in the service of the company—there were four members of the staff at the examination—I don't know that I was trying to get information as to the personal life of Mr. Green from other persons besides through Moser—I gave 10 guineas to a man named Collins—I am not sure of the amount—I paid something for information—I did not promise him £40 more if he put it in an affidavit—I think he was to have £20 altogether, not £40 for the affidavit, that was in the matter of the defendant's action after he had served his writ—it was information to defend the action—I had no opportunity to defend myself on this occasion; I was attacked from behind, without having any power to do anything.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 461). On 21st September I was called to 4, Crown Office Row—I went up a flight of steps and came to the entrance to Figtree Court, and I then saw in the corner, at the foot of the stairs by the entrance, Mr. Macrae, the prisoner, Mr. Grainger, Mr. O'Driscoll, and Meiklejohn—Mr. Macrae and the prisoner were at close quarters, and the others were holding the prisoner, but further from him than Mr. Macrae—they were all close together in the corner—I think the first words were said by Mr. Macrae, "Take him away, he is a madman"—I then took hold of the prisoner—he said he would go quietly, and I took him to Bridewell Police-station—there was blood on the faces both of the prisoner and Mr. Macrae—at the station the charge was made; I heard what was said—the prisoner handed over a revolver to me—there was a slight wound on Mr. Macrae's forehead—I only saw blood on the prisoner's face—at the station this stick was produced—it was found on the staircase; I can hardly tell who picked it up—I saw another stick under my feet between the prisoner and Mr. Macrae, on the first step from the entrance to Figtree Court—I stood on it—I asked whose stick it was—I believe Mr. Macrae claimed it; I am not certain of that—it was not this one—this second stick was handed to me by Meiklejohn, immediately I got up there—I kept it, and took it to the station, when the prisoner claimed it—it has been kept by the police since.</p>

I practise at 7, Bouverie Street, Fleet Street—on 21st September, at about half-past four, I was sent for to Bridewell Police-station—I saw Mr. Macrae there—his face, neck, and clothes were smothered in blood—I found three wounds and two bumps on his head—I suggested his coming to my house; he got into a cab and came—the wounds were bruises of the size of a walnut or hazel nut, the skin was not broken—his right hand was swollen, there was a graze on the thumb, the wrist was swollen, and there was a scratch on the back of the hand and a strain of the wrist—the three wounds and two bumps on the head were so individual I judged they were caused by separate blows—I afterwards saw him on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday at his residence—he gradually improved—on the Friday he came to town by my permission—he got gradually better and well—I saw the prisoner at Bridewell Police-station; no request was made to me as to any injury to him—I saw no sign of injury on him.</p>

Customers occasionally address me as Mr. Best—Stone paid me about £30 between the end of December and the middle of January—that was cash and credit—altogether he has paid me getting on for £45—he owes me now £19 17s. 1d.; I have had no cheque for that—on the last day that this case was on at the Police court I communicated with the Treasury solicitor—I gave him a reference to Alexander and Co.; they applied to me, and I answered them verbally.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the Hammersmith branch of the London and South-Western Bank—on 3rd April, 1889, the prisoner Stone opened an account there by a payment of £30, of which this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy—twelve of Luck's cheques are credited to Stone's account; I mean that twelve of Stone's cheques have been drawn in favour of Luck—I find one cheque in favour of Garland on May 2nd for £1 16s.—since May 12th fifteen cheques have been dishonoured, twelve of which were returned for want of funds, amounting to £60, and he rest for endorsement—I wrote on 18th June, and again in July—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188911180023"/>
               <p>this £12 cheque was returned twice; it was marked "N.S." the first time, and the second time "Orders not to pay"—that was because the clerk received a written order from Stone not to pay—his account was not overdrawn at that time, but more money had been drawn on than had been paid in—at the time Stone gave orders not to pay this cheque for £12 there were not sufficient funds to meet it, and I should not have paid it if he had not written.</p>

I am a cashier at the Stepney branch of the London and South-Western Bank—on May 24th Stone introduced the prisoner Luck, in consequence of which I opened an account in Luck's name—he paid in £13, and afterwards other sums—eight of his cheques have been dishonoured, amounting to £143 12s. 8d—the credit balance on 11th June was £6 4s. 11d., and on the 12th, 9s. 11d.—nothing has been paid in since—cheques to the amount of £119 0s. 11d. have been presented since, and dishonoured—the cheque for £4 10s. on 2nd July to Mr. Burton is one, and one to Mr. Chandler on 2nd July.</p>

I am a bootmaker, of 27, London Street, top floor—I was going into the house, about 1.30 a. m. on October 29th, and heard screams from the prosecutor that they had got his watch and £20—I knocked at the partition to know what was the matter, and San Kewitch came out, and asked me to fetch a policeman, and I went with her, and fetched No. 343—when I got back with him the row was still going on, and they were struggling together, trying to get him out of the back parlour; he would not come out without his money—Ring and Miller lived in those two rooms—I had never seen San Kewitch before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller to Max Greger and Co., Limited, and do business at 66, Sumner Street, Southwark—in December last I received this card from the managing director, Colonel Hadden, with this writing on it, "Send this gentleman two samples of claret, cheap and dear, Hotel Bastida, 26, Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road"—I went to 26, Percy Street, and saw the prisoner in a room; I showed him the card, and told him I had been sent there to bring him the samples of wine which he requested to receive—he asked me to be seated, went down into the cellar and brought up some wine to compare with it, which he had bought in Germany—I tasted his wine first, and he tasted my samples afterwards—he then gave me an order for fifty dozen—either at that interview or another he said he expected to do a great deal more business with us; he expected to get the house No. 27, next door—I reported to Colonel Hadden, who told me to go and make inquiries of the prisoner again, which I did at No. 26; I have never been to No. 27—I told him I did not want him to get angry with me, but we had received a report which was very unsatisfactory, namely, that he had failed, and that there was a bill of sale on the furniture, and the</p>

               <p>business was carried on in his wife's name; he said that was a matter of the past; it had been carried on in his wile's name, he having a lawsuit on his hands; he was afraid he might lose the case, and the parties would come down upon him, so he secured himself by settling the furniture on her, but it was now in his name again—I said, "Why have you not had it taken off the records of the Court?"—he said, "I instructed my solicitor to do so, and I shall tell him again that it has no right to be there; everything that is in this house belongs tome; I am worth £4,000 in all, "and he rushed out and brought me a bundle of papers, and said, "These are worth £18,000 besides what I have here; I have got the confidence of a merchant, and you will find every thing right"—I tried to sell the wine for cash, but he gave me his acceptance—I told him I would submit it to the managing director, and he should hear from me the same day—I reported the interview.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am a Hungarian—I spoke partly German and partly English with the prisoner—he showed me the <hi rend="largeCaps">MS</hi> of what he said was a scientific work, which, if it was published, would bring in £4,000—he simply stated that the bundle of papers was worth the money—I did not think it was bank notes, and it did not look like title-deeds—I possibly said at the Police-court, "I cannot remember whether I showed him the card or not"—if it had been a cash transaction no inquiries would have been made—some persons buy goods for cash, but you never get the money—I have been at Max Greger's about a year; he is dead—I was not offering 25 per cent, discount, nor did I press the sale to a man I did not know—the discount to a man in the trade is 20 per cent. off the in voice price, and 2 1/2 on payment of the bill—I am paid by commission; the more wine I turn out the more I get—I saw his wife at No. 26—I did not see Miss Cock—he said that his lease was run out—I do not know whether he said that in German or English—I think I said at the County-court or the Police-court that he said, "I expect to get the lease of No. 27"—I admit that I do not know enough English to understand the word" lease"—the reduction in the amount of the order from fifty to thirty dozen was made because he said, "If you don't know me we will make it only thirty"—I only went there twice before the wine was delivered—I told the Magistrate I did not ask the defendant the first time I saw him, anything about his position.</p>

I am a scale manufacturer, of York Road, King's Cross—on September 29 I received these two orders (<hi rend="italic">From Arthur Clive Cozens, ordering two sets of scales, to be sent to</hi> 60, <hi rend="italic">Chalk Farm Road, and stating, "I think it will be better for you to see my manager"</hi>)—I delivered them on 4th October, at that address, to the manager and Mrs. Cozens, but refused to leave them without the money—they sent for Mr. Cozens, and Arthur came and paid me with a cheque on the Birkbeck Bank, for £5 3s. 9d., which was dishonoured, and returned on 7th October—I took it to Arthur the same day—he said he was sorry; there was some mistake; he did not know what it was, as he had paid in £20 the day previous, and £40 the day before, but he would give me another cheque, which he did, for the same amount—I paid that in, and it was returned marked "N. S."—I paid it in again on the 16th, and it was returned again on the 18th—I never got the money or the scales.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Birkbeck Bank, Chancery Lane—the prisoner Arthur opened an account there on August 6th this year—I produce a copy of it from October 1—nineteen cheques came back in October—his balance on October 4th was £12 14s. 9d., as £12 was paid in that day—he drew three cheques that day: one for £1, one for a cheque book, 5s. 8d., and one for £2 10s; that did not leave enough to pay Mr. Pollard's cheque—the balance was only 2s. 3d.</p>

You told me to see that every creditor was paid, with the exception of Mr. Pollard—I did not know he was a creditor; I told him he might have his goods back by paying the same amount in the pound as the other creditors—he refused to take the scales back—your orders to me were to offer all the goods back, but there was the expense of distributing the estate, 3s. 6d. in the pound—we did not pay the landlord any thing; we paid the solicitor £5, and I received £5—the landlord never gave me possession; we broke into the place.</p>

Frank Cozens stated that his brother employed him to sell harness on commission, and when it was returned, not being large enough, his brother said, "Don't send it back to the firm; sell it, "and he did so, and got paid, and he considered he owed the money to the firm.</hi>

I am a furrier, living at 22, Northampton Square, Clerkenwell—on the evening of 9th November I was at the back of the Sessions House, Clerkenwell Green, coming down the hill, and I saw four men struggling—as I got near they appeared to separate, and the prosecutor had hold of Gibbons' coat—Gibbons wrenched himself away, flung the prosecutor on his back, and turned towards Clerkenwell Road; the prosecutor got on his feet and pursued them as well as he could—Phipps came to my side, and went towards Farringdon Road, and I followed five or six paces behind him—we all arrived at the corner about together, and the prosecutor said, "That is the man, "and I seized hold of Phipps—the other men got away—Constable Baynes came up at that time in answer to the first call for police, and seized hold of Phipps—then Gibbons came up and seized hold of my arm, and tried to pull me away from Phipps, of whom I had hold—Gibbons said, "What has he done? he has done nothing"—I said, "You can say what you have to say at Clerkenwell Station"—I gave him in charge to a con stable, who took hold of the two prisoners by their collars—some one blew a whistle; another constable came and took Gibbons—I went to the station, and charged them.</p>

I am positive it was Gibbons who threw the prosecutor down—afterwards, when a constable in uniform had hold of Phipps, Gibbons walked up—if Gibbons had only come up at that moment he could not see what had taken place at the other corner of the triangle—I had never seen Gibbons before—when I saw the robbery being committed it was just at that time finishing, I thought—they were not very long under my observation.</p>

               <p>picked up an evening paper—I heard Christopher Hill's name mentioned, I think, by Barnes, and having heard my mother speak of the Hills, it struck me, and I turned round and observed more minutely what was going on, and saw on one of the parchments the words "Rew, Devon, "and on a bundle of papers, "Mr. Bulwer's Opinion;" also the word "Probate"—Barnes said to Simpkin that those were not all the documents, he had to receive two more parcels, and he could give no definite instructions as to what he desired done till his friend brought him the others, and arranged them in chronological order—he did the parcel up, and this newspaper was so much torn that he took the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> which I was reading, and wrapped them up in that, and said he should deposit the parcel at the railway cloakroom—we all three left, and he deposited them in the cloakroom of the arrival platform, which is a very isolated part, for safety, because they were of great value—when he handed them to the cloakroom porter he said, "They are only small boy's trousers"—I spoke to Mr. Francis Christopher Hill the same evening—on 16th October I went with Mr. Hill and Mr. Saville, a solicitor, to the cloakroom, Liverpool Street Station, and pointed out the parcel—I then went by myself to Union Court, and saw Barnes coming through the passage with three others; they all went into the Ship, in Wormwood Street—I then went in where they could not see me, and heard Barnes say, "This is a big job, and it is as good as gold; it is a matter of thousands; and when I once get the brass I shall go over the pond; I have two parcels to receive; they are a certainty; I am receiving them from a Chancery clerk, who is employed by a firm of solicitors who do a big Chancery business; there are two very old partners in the firm; I have been offended by one of them"—he also said, "This clerk has letters and documents in his possession, by which we shall be able to prove that old Hill was insane when he executed his will"—he said he was in a position to get old stamped parchments somewhere in Chancery Lane, and that he had two parcels to receive on the following Saturday, and he was going to get another parcel, which he had deposited at the cloakroom, Liverpool Street Station—he also said, "Soon after the Long Vacation, if you watch the newspapers, you will see another similar case to the Hill case, and I am to receive £100 for what I have prepared in the matter, and that his clerk was in direct communication with Mrs. Hill, jun."—I communicated what I had heard to Mr. Hill at his hotel, and was taken by Messrs.

Oh, Hill's matter!' and took them away; I know I did wrong to allow him to take them away, but I looked on it as a drunken freak, he being half drunk at the time; some time ago he took a bill of costs from me, and I had a rare job to get it back"—I said, "Have you any documents by you belonging to your firm?"—he said, "Yes," and took me to a bedroom, and pointed to a large bundle of parchment deeds on a chair, about 220 altogether, in cupboard and on the chair—I asked if that was all—he said he thought it was, but I searched the cupboard; it was partially filled with other deeds—he said "They are easily explained; about eighteen months ago they were selling the waste paper, and a quantity of deeds were packed in boxes; I know Mr. Buckle did not know what he was doing; I took them home, intending to return them again; they were virtually sold, and were not property of the firm"—he then told me a long story as cheque transactions of Barnes, and I conveyed him to the station, and confronted him with Barnes, and said, "Is this the man you had the parcel from?"—he said, "Yes"—I said. "Sayers says you came into the office one evening and took it"—he said, "I did not steal them, neither did Sayers; they are conveyances and leases of different dates"—on the 27th I received this parcel from the railway, done up—here is "F.

                  </hi>. I am an accountant; I live at 44, Mortimer Road,. Kingsland—I am Hudson's father—I have had this barometer in my custody and control since January last—on 15th October it was in my possession; it belongs to my son—he has advertised it for sale in the <hi rend="italic">Exchange and Mart</hi>, with other articles which I also had—some time in October he received some studs, about a week or ten days before his arrest—he has been employed at Leyton's stables in letting out horses and traps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not in business as an accountant now—I have had many years' experience as a law accountant in keeping solicitors' books—the last time I did accounting was for the firm of Lee and Mold in Carey Street; it is five or six years since they were in existence—I have worked for others since then—Leyton has traps and horses, whether on livery or not I cannot say—I believe my son was employed there—I have seen him there once, perhaps three months ago—he told me he was employed there, and I had no reason to disbelieve him—whether he was a daily or weekly servant I don't know—I had these things in my possession to take care of for him, so that if anyone desired to see them they could call at my house and see them if he was away from home—I did not advertise them, because I did not take on myself the trouble of answering advertisements—it is a common thing for people to advertise in different names to their own—my son's Christian name is Edward; I cannot say why he called himself James Edwards—the things were meant to be delivered—I don't know what became of the spaniel; it was in existence then—I had it in my house some days—it was a puppy—Leyton lost it, I believe—I have the carpet still and the riding-whips; I am open to sell them—my son obtained the barometer from Hughes, of Holmesdale Road, Reigate, in exchange for a white quilt—I was living then at 3, Dalston Lane—the police visited me on one occasion when I lived at Boville Road about a trap belonging to my son, which was left in the street; they wanted to know to whom it belonged, and my son got it from the Green Yard—my son has had the barometer about three years; he gave it into my possession in January—two ponies were got by advertisement; I had nothing to do with it—my son hired the house and stables where they were; I was my son's lodger at the time—I did not see the police when they came about the ponies—these memoranda to Mr. Brown are in my son's handwriting; I know he had a book of these memoranda forms—these forms are identical apparently, and the forms in the pig case appear to be identical with them—I saw the detective who came about the ponies in the stable as I was passing by; I had no conversation with him.</p>

I live at 9, Clipston Street, Fitzroy Square—on 19th October, Saturday, about 11.50, I was in the King's Head, Little Goodge Street, and saw all the prisoners—three of the male prisoners were standing near me, and Saunders and Arthurs were sitting at the back, and they did not speak to me—the three who were near me asked me to pay for some beer for them—I said, "I have no money left"—they got rather angry, and one of them said, "I expect it is only a Waterbury"—I said to O'Shea, "What's the game? you cannot get anything from me, because I have got nothing, "and left the house—I had not got more than two yards before I was attacked and struck on my eye from the side—I saw O'Shea on my right, and saw his hand go away, and Beal struck me on my face—I turned round, and saw several others coming out of the publichouse—I ran up Little Goodge Street, where I was attacked by several, and knocked down and kicked; several hands, were trying to get my watch—Saunders struck me on my face—Crinian was there, and Arthurs was assisting in trying to get my watch—I got up, and struggled with them, and got away, and ran a short distance, but was caught in Tottenham Street, and knocked down again, and several hands tried to get my watch—I saw Arthurs' hand, and felt a jerk—they all kicked me while I was on the ground, and knocked me about—Barber arrived just as Arthurs was running away, and I pointed her out—he pursued her, and brought her back—I charged her, and a gentleman Drought me my watch—on 23rd October I saw a number of men together at the station, and picked out Saunders and Crinian—Beal was there, but I did not pick him out—when I saw him at Marlborough Street I was positive he was the one who struck me with O'Shea—I also recognised O'Shea at Marlborough Street; he is one of them—I had a very black eye, my jaws were swollen on both sides, and I could not eat any thing for two or three days; the back of my head was cut open, I was kicked on my hip, so that I was lame for several days, and I had several bruises on different parts of my body.</p>

Arthurs stated that Roworth took liberties with her, and O'Shea came up and saw him talking to her.</hi>

I am nephew to the last witness—I am an orphan—I entered into these indentures, apprenticing me to the prisoner, in September, 1887—I stopped there just a fortnight over a year—during that time I mixed mortar, swept out the shop, washed brushes, and cleaned tools—if not doing that, and there was no painting or decorating work to do, we made goat-carts—there was not sufficient business of that character to keep me constantly employed—no workmen of any sort were continuously employed by the prisoners during the time I was about—one bricklayer was employed by the week—a month or six weeks before I left, the elder prisoner said he would write a letter to my uncle to say I was to leave—he asked me if I knew anything about it and I told him no—I went home the next Sunday—after I heard some thing from my uncle about that I went back to the premises—the elder prisoner asked me if my uncle had said anything about it—I said he said he had written a letter to my uncle, and he said, "I expect your uncle will put me in prison for this"—I said it was very likely he would—he said, "Your uncle can kiss my—"—I asked James Beeston about the 2s. a week when my first year was up and why I should not have it; and he said it was not his business I was to ask his son about it; he was entirely out of the business—I 'took a letter from him to my uncle soon after I went there—he called me and his son into a room, and said, "Do you think your uncle can lend me £5?"—there was a job on at the time, and he wanted to buy paper for the walls for the staircase—I told him I did not know—he said, "Will you go and take this note with you if I was to give it to you?"e—he paid my fare—I took the letter and delivered it—my uncle wrote an answer back on the same paper; I believe that he could not do it—I gave the answer to the prisoner—I never took any money from my uncle to the prisoner—the job they were on then was Pritchard's, in Fore Street, Edmonton, I think; papering the staircase with sanitary paper and varnishing—that was the paper that was to be bought with my uncle's £5.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I last saw the premises on August Bank Holiday—I have been past twice since—about a month after I left—I have known three jobs going on there together at one time—that is the most I have known—I remember Appleby's house being whitewashed and the ceilings distempered from top to bottom; it was very common decoration—I think the staircase was simply washed down; I won't be sure—I cannot remember what rooms were papered—they were not all papered—I remember the jobs at Mallison's, Hornsey Road, at 96, Cottenham Road, at Sparsholt Road, at Granville Road, at Willis's, of Hornsey Rise; at Avenue Road, putting a pane of glass in, and at Simmons'—Simmons has 10 houses—I do not know that the prisoners have a contract with him to put the houses in repair—I believe two were done up, and two or three Chad odd jobs done—I went to two of them; I believe one was done up from top to bottom—the second was scamped by the prisoners; they told me as they had not got the money for the first one they would not do the second one properly—they put on one coat of paint instead of two in many places—the younger prisoner did Robinson's job, 492, Hornsey Rise—I remember Babson's job, and Goff's; that lasted a week, I think—I was told there were 10 houses of his—the prisoners had to keep them in order as far as I am aware—I remember a job for Mr. Home, of Granville Road; they painted the front of Davis's house in Fairbridge Road—the men in carpentering found their own tools; that is not unusual—carpenters were employed—I saw the mixing of paints going on—I asked the younger prisoner, and also the youngest son, who is 24, to explain it to me, and they put me off by saying they had not time—he was never busy in his life—I had to be on good terms with them because I was an apprentice—I believe as tenants left Guff's houses the Beestons did them up—I don't know any thing concerning them; three were done up in my time—they had a rather long job for them at Polsford's Railway Hotel—the contract was for eight days; it lasted ten—three men were employed on that, I think, a painter and two carpenters at two different times, not both together; and then there was a joiner for three-quarters of an hour or an hour—the job was to varnish and do the ceiling of the publichouse, and put up a small glass partition on the top of the bar—a new front was not built in there—at Robinson's a wall was pulled down, and another one built three or four yards out, and a secondhand front put in; the bar was not touched—that was done by Beeston Brothers, a different firm to James Beeston—at one time there were employed on that job a bricklayer, a labourer, a carpenter, and a plumber, for about two hours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> No other building was done while I was there, and that was not done by Mr. Beeston, but Beeston Brothers—a separate business was carried on by Beeston Brothers, of 277, Essex Road, Islington—that firm was carried on by Wesley and Richard Beeston—Beeston and Co. were at Hornsey Road—the jobs that have been mentioned wt re putting a latch on a door and putting panes of glass in,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of 5, Hornton Street, Kensington—about February 12th I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">This was to the same effect as in the last case; the premium wanted was</hi> £35)—I wrote to the address and had a reply, and on the following day I went to 403, Hornsey Road—I saw the younger prisoner first, and a few minutes after the elder one—I said I called in reply to their letter, as I was anxious to apprentice my son, who was then fourteen—I wanted him to learn the trade of a builder and decorator, which I thought he would do better away from home than with myself, and it was not convenient to have him at home, as he was the child of a former marriage—both prisoners joined in the conversation—they said they were doing a good business and employed a number of men, carpenters, bricklayers, and plumbers, and they showed me plans of building and decoration which they were getting out; the work was to be that of the younger prisoner—among other things they told me they were sorry to see the state of the weather as it would affect some work they then had in hand: recovering some roofs with zinc and re-pointing fronts and backs of houses—I said it was rather unusual for such work to be done at that time of year—they said they were bound to do it then as they had so much work in view for the coming spring—I said I would consider the matter and let them know—I was asked to leave a deposit of £5 to show I was treating the matter with <hi rend="italic">bona fides</hi>, as there were other applications—I did not pay the deposit—I afterwards wrote offering £30—I received a letter offering to accept £30 if the matter was settled at once—I went to 403, Hornsey Road on the following Monday, and the indentures were signed—I apprenticed him to James Beeston—I gave the elder prisoner a crossed cheque for £30—the younger prisoner wrote out and the elder signed this receipt on the memorandum form of J. W. Beeston and Co.—in the afternoon of the next day the younger prisoner came to see me, and at his request I tore up the crossed cheque and gave him an open one—that was duly honoured at my bank—my son remained, there till 3rd August, when he was sent home—on 9th August I received this letter from Mr. Sturt. (<hi rend="italic">This was similar to the one received by Mr. Nockolds</hi>)—I communicated with my solicitor, who wrote to the prisoners. (<hi rend="italic">This letter, dated</hi> 12<hi rend="italic">th August, stated that unless the</hi> £30 <hi rend="italic">wax returned steps would be taken against them</hi>)—a copy of that was sent to Sturt—I never got any part of my £30 back—soon after that I instituted proceedings at the Police-court, after making inquiries of my son and the other apprentices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not induce Mrs. Norman to take her son away—I did not see her before proceedings were taken—they were doing their utmost to get my solicitor to take up their case—I had no conversation with them at the Police-court—Mrs. Norman asked what she should do, and she was advised to ask my solicitor—I don't know that her boy was</p>

               <p>taken away against the wish of the prisoners—they told me they had a good business, and employed a large number of men—I looked round the place, and from what I saw I was so thoroughly deceived I was willing to believe anything, and I believed him—if I had had the place myself I should have thought I was doing a flourishing concern—I asked him for references, and he said I might make inquiries wherever I liked, and that I could inquire in the neighbourhood—I went to a beerhouse and to a chemist—I got replies, which I have found were false—I have doubt whether the chemist was not in the conspiracy, but I have no doubt as to whether the beerhouse keeper was—I told him afterwards I had made inquiries; all the chemist and beerhouse keeper said was, "Oh, he is all right"—I should have parted with my money if I had not had these representations—he did not tell me where he had carried on business before—he called himself an oldestablished firm, and I thought from the appearance of the place it was so—the representation that induced me to part with my money was that the prisoners were builders, and had work, and that my boy would be taught his business.</p>

                  </hi>. I was present when my father paid £30 for my apprenticeship—on 28th February I went to 403, Hornsey Road to begin work—I was first told to clean up the workshops in the yard—I then asked for more work, and was told there was not any that week, but that I should have plenty next week—next week was just the same—I had some painting to do in Fairbridge Road—Nockolds was with me—I was set to paint a gate and clear away rubbish at the Fox and Hounds-public house, Hornsey Road—one day I was set to light some fires at Hornsey Road, and I said to the elder prisoner that my father said I was not sent there to light fires but to do building work—he struck me and called me a gaol-bird, and said I was not to have any breakfast—there were three other apprentices with me, Nockolds, Wall-in, and Norman—the younger prisoner asked me if I should like to mind an office; I made no answer, but a few days afterwards I was sent to mind the office, 207, Essex Road—the name of Beeston Brothers was over the door, builders, decorators, and estate agents—the younger prisoner and some of his younger brothers came there—the only business done there was one house that was painted up—the younger prisoner did something inside it—I was there about five weeks occupying myself in playing about in the workshop—a cart called there; it had the name J. W. Beeston on it—I washed it sometimes—when I first went there I went in it, among other places, to the County-court, where he had some cases on—I minded it while other persons went in the court—no men were employed continuously at Hornsey Road, but they were employed from time to time when there was work for them to do.</p>

I am a laundryman of Kilburn Lane—on 25th April I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi>—I wrote, and after receiving an answer, went to 403, Hornsey Road where I saw the two prisoners—I asked what business they were doing—the elder prisoner said he was doing a good business—I asked if the premises were his, he said they were—I said I would consider it—a short time after I received a letter from him asking if I had thought any more of apprenticing my son to them, because he had other applications—I replied and the following day the prisoners called on me according to the appointment I had made—the elder prisoner said they wished to conclude the transaction by my paying a deposit—I paid the elder prisoner a deposit of £5, after he said that on my paying £30 premium he would take my son as an apprentice and teach him building, decorating, and plumbing—I had this receipt for the £5—on 13th May I went to the premises again with my wife and my son—the prisoners showed us several plans in the office, which they said they were building; they said the plans had been drawn out by the son—they said my boy would have a comfortable home and learn the business thoroughly—then I paid £25, the balance of the premium, in cash, and got this receipt—the indentures were signed. (<hi rend="italic">By these indentures the boy was apprenticed to James Beeston to learn building and decorating</hi>)—we left the boy there—I looked round the place—I saw no men there—I had previously asked a question about it, and the elder prisoner said he employed a number of men—on 3rd August the boy was sent home, and on 9th August I received this letter from Mr. Sturt.

(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he was compelled to give up the premises at Lower Edmonton; that he was in a state of insolvency, and did not know if the creditors would make him bankrupt; it was a similar letter to that in Sheard's case</hi>)—I replied to that, and received in reply this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This purported to come from the younger prisoner at</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Moselle Villas, Wood Green; it stated that what had transpired between the witness and Beeston, senior, had nothing to do with him, and that he would have no inquiries or interference there, and that the nephew would have to be careful, or he might have to prove words hi had used to his brother</hi>)—about the first week in February the indentures were cancelled and sent back by post; I never saw anything more of the prisoners till I saw the case in the papers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My nephew complained that he was sent to paint lampposts in the neighbourhood, and drag things, and burn bricks, and sweep up the shop, and burn paint pots—he did not say he had to see to lampposts if they went wrong—the younger prisoner did not tell me in the train that things had turned out very badly; he only said he did not know where his father was—he did not say they were looking out for a business at Hornsey—I found out, after a good deal of trouble, by the postmark "Wood Green" on the envelope, where they had gone to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now an outfitter's apprentice, at Thornton Heath—I went with my uncle, and heard what the prisoners said—on 22nd August I was apprenticed and the money paid, and I stayed with the prisoners from 24th August till 24th December—I learnt no plumbing and no trade at all while I was there—what I principally did was painting street lampposts in the Edmonton district; I did over 100—I also cleaned paint pots and brushes, mixed mortar and swept the place out—I asked the younger prisoner about plumbing and about making a D trap; he said if I waited till the summer the men would be there, and I should have a chance then—he meant the summer of 1888—that was about a month before I left—during my time a bricklayer and plumber were employed for half a day or more, and a plasterer three or four days—I was labourer to the plasterer the whole time—I was living at Church Street, Edmonton, with them—I was given a fortnight's holiday at Christmas, and during the time I was at home my uncle had a letter—after that I went to Church Street, Edmonton, and found the prisoners had moved—the younger prisoner had told me previous to my going that he was going to take a business in Wood Green—it was understood I was to come back to Church Street when my holiday was over—about three weeks after Christmas I found the prisoners at Wood Green—I followed the younger prisoner from Edmonton to there and</p>

               <p>back again—then they shut the door in my face—the younger prisoner ran after me, and said perhaps I should like to speak to his father—I went to his father, who said he was in a state of insolvency, and as soon as he could recover himself he would take me back—the younger prisoner said it was his father's house, and he was only a lodger for a time, and that it would be no good my uncle troubling after him, it would be only throwing good money after bad—I was learning the banjo while I was there in my own time after working hours—I was willing and anxious to work if there had been work for me to do—I went to learn plumbing and house-decorating.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before I was apprenticed the elder prisoner said he was doing a large business, and would make a man of me if I was apprenticed to him—the mortar was used for repairing a wall and a copper, and whatever wanted doing—part of it was for the prisoner's own house—the lamps were painted and glazed—I saw a plumber on a job at Wood Green for half a day—zinc tops were put on the lampposts; that was not plumbing, I dare say a bricklayer could do it—the younger prisoner said his father had a contract to do the lampposts—I don't remember anything going wrong with the gas-pipes—one of the sons would have done it if they had gone wrong—that would be a branch of plumbing, I suppose—the younger prisoner told me he was going to Wood Green—I cannot say if he said he was going to take a business there or not; he said they had a large job there—Mrs. Bartholomew said her son had gone there, so I knew the prisoner would be there, and I went.</p>

                  </hi>. I am vicar of Farnborough, Kent—as executor and trustee I have had the management and letting of Church Street, Lower Edmonton, which was occupied by the prisoners—I found them in possession in 1887—the rent was due for March, 1887; I made many applications—I got it on 22nd August, I think, that year—I had paid the insurance premiums in default of the prisoners paying them—this is the counterpart of a lease executed on 22nd August; previous to that there had been a lease—by the lease the tenant covenanted to insure the premises—when he paid the rent in August the elder prisoner expressed himself unable to repay me the premiums, amounting to £8 odd, which I had paid in his default—the rent due at Michaelmas was not paid till I distrained—I never had the Christmas rent—I had no notice that he was going to leave at Christmas; I found the premises early in the new year left and wrecked, lead pipes were cut and taken away, locks taken off doors, and a great deal of injury done to them.</p>

               <p>he said that the firm would pay it—I said I had nothing to do with the firm, only with him—he said that they owed him a lot of money, and when they paid him he would pay me—I said, "You are leaving Hill side tonight?"—he said, "No; tomorrow"—I said, "I have heard it is tonight"—he said, "No; tomorrow"—he had given no notice, and I said, "Do you know that in lieu of notice you will have to pay another quarter's rent?"—he said, "Yes, I quite understand that"—he under stood me perfectly when I spoke to him—some few days afterwards I returned to Victoria Mansions; I saw Krantz—I said I had come to see Mr. Bogaerts, and I asked for the key of Hillside and for the rent, as I had heard that the furniture was removed the day before—he said, "We have not left there"—he took an envelope from his pocket with some name and Hampstead upon it, saying that he had received it that morning—that was to convince me that he had slept there overnight; he showed me the postmark on the envelope, but I forget it—he said if Mr. Bogaerts did not get his money from the late firm, he himself would pay it, and also for any repairs that were wanted to the house—he drew my attention to the chambers they had taken, and of course I should know where to find them, as they could not leave such a large place in a minute—he gave me a reference, as to his being able to pay the rent if Bogaerts did not, to the Brazilian Ambassador—I said I did not want references so much as the rent, and I went away—I heard nothing from them—I called again, but could not see Bogaerts—after going to the secretary of the building I saw Krantz—he said that Mr. Bogaerts was engaged with two friends, and he left the room, saying he would fetch Bogaerts—after a while he came back; he said that Bogaerts was still engaged, and he showed me some pictures in the room, which they were bringing out as a patent, but they were waiting for the machinery to print them—I said I did not understand pictures; would he be good enough to tell Mr. Bogaerts that I had called for the rent?—I said I should not call again, but I should send my solicitor, and left—after that I paid another visit to Hillside, and in an inner bedroom there I saw a portrait of Krantz hanging over the mantelpiece—I have never been paid the last quarter's rent.</p>

I keep a private hotel at 35, St. James's Place—in October I was desirous of raising £4,500 on mortgage, and spoke about it to a Colonel Perry, who has been a visitor at my hotel from time to time; after that I met at a reception at Clapham Colonel Perry and Krantz—Colonel Perry introduced Krantz to me as Baron Krantz—I spoke to Perry in Krantz's hearing as to my failure in getting the money—after that I received letters from Perry, and on 9th October I went to Victoria Mansions—I asked for Colonel Perry; I was shown into Krantz's presence—he said Colonel Perry was not at home—I waited some time for him—while waiting Krantz showed me a plan of the Albert Palace, and said he had paid £25,000 for the palace, which he was going to rent to the Bogaerts Patent Developing Company—he showed me where he should have his own house built in the grounds of the Albert Palace—he asked me if I should like an appointment in the palace, and he would give me the management of the restaurant, at a salary of £500 a year—I was pleased to accept such a thing—when I said I must go he said, "I know what you want to see Colonel Perry about"—he said he had noticed my worried appearance, and he had asked Colonel Perry what troubled me, money or family troubles; and Colonel Perry had said family troubles—I said, "Nothing of the sort, it is money troubles"—I wanted to shift the mortgage, as the mortgagees wanted the money—he said he would enable me to do that, as I understood, by money advanced by the Bogaerts Company at 5 per cent.—he said they had brought out a patent for which they were to receive £1,250,000—he said he had a similar palace in Paris—I believed all his statements; I thought he was next to Baron Rothschild, as far as money was concerned—he said, "I know what was in Colonel Perry's last letter to you, he wants you to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188911180082"/>
               <p>write out some cheques"—that was the purport of a letter I had from Perry, and I came to tell him that I could not do it, as my banking account was too low—I told Krantz I came to say I could not do it, as my account was only just surviving—he said, "That is all I want; it is only the accommodation of your bank, it is not money I require"—he said there was so much money coming from Paris that he would pay £100 into my bank if I would just write the cheques out; they would not be paid till the money came—I believed that, and also that I could have the £4,500—I then wrote out ten cheques amounting to £78 2s.; four in favour of Krantz, three in favour of Perry, and three in favour of Bogaerts—Krantz gave me the names—this is the receipt he gave me for the ten cheques—it was understood those cheques were not to be presented until he paid in money to meet them, that day or the next—he said he would send me the money for the mortgage through the post, as it would be more legal—after that meeting I received through the post this letter of 11th October. (<hi rend="italic">This, signed Bogaerts and Krantz, said it was their plan to take up the mortgage within a few days</hi>)—on the 10th I went, taking these four other cheques with me—I filled them in in the office under Krantz's direction—they were drawn to Bogaerts's order; they amounted to £79 5s. in all, one being for £25—they have been presented and returned marked "N. S, "and "account closed"—on 12th October I received an intimation from my bankers, in consequence of which on 13th I wrote to Krantz. (<hi rend="italic">This said that she had heard from the bank manager, and that she would call at his office</hi>)—on Monday I went to the office and told Krantz what had transpired on Saturday, and asked him if he had received my letter; he said no—I found through being insufficiently addressed it had not reached him—I said I was surprised that the cheques had been sent through—he said it was a mistake, and that he would see to it at once—I was pacified, and went away quite content that it would be seen to—on the 15th I took him £6, and £18 on another day (it was all I had) to make up this deficiency as far as I could on the £25 cheque, one of the four I gave on the 10th—Krantz paid it to Bogaerts then—it is to the order of Bogaerts, and endorsed by him and not paid—on the 15th I saw Bogaerts in Krantz's office, and he introduced himself to me as a director of the Developing Company, and he said, "We are agreed that the company shall lend this money"—he seemed to understand all about it, but he did not understand very much English, I had very little conversation with him—Krantz introduced me to him as Miss Adams, who kept an hotel in St. James's Place, and said he had already spoken to me about the place of restaurant-keeper which I was to have—a day or two after I saw Bogaerts at the office, Victoria Mansions, and talked with him only about pictures—I next saw Krantz on the morning of the day he was arrested, the 24th—between 15th and 24th it came to my knowledge that a number of my cheques had been presented at the bank, and had been dishonoured—Krantz said the money was sure to come, I was not to worry—I was reassured down to the time of the arrest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Colonel Perry about two years—he told me he had heard of my difficulty, and would get me the money, and he introduced me to Krantz—Perry wrote asking me to write eight cheques, and I went to him to say I could not do it—I understood Perry was one of the heads or secretary of the company—I did not see Bogaerts when</p>

               <p>I first saw Krantz, but some time after that—I entered into arrangements to give cheques with Krantz alone; Bogaerts was not there—Krantz said he would lend me the money to pay off my mortgage, and then I could sell off the hotel and go to the Palace—Perry has not stayed at my hotel, but he has called there—Bogaerts showed me a great many pictures, and said he would take me round and explain the process they were going to bring out at the Palace; he explained that a picture like this would be sold for a shilling or so—the conversation between me and him related to pictures and the Palace—the office was beautifully furnished—Perry introduced Krantz to me as a rich man—Bogaerts spoke very broken English; but I spoke so plainly to him he said he understood every word I said—he had great difficulty in explaining him self—I spoke to him about my becoming the restaurant manager.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Krantz said the company's money was lodged in the Bank of England, and he did not wish to draw on that till a certain date, and that was why he wished to draw on my bank.</p>

I live at 3, Maidment Road, Burdett Road, Bow—four years ago Krantz called on my father, a schoolmaster, and stayed to tea—that was the first introduction—he was not a man of means then—on 7th September this year I went with my father to an office in Leaden hall Buildings, where I saw him—he took us into a private office, and explained a scheme he had for buying a building near the Mansion House for the purpose of displaying advertisements, which were to continually revolve on a sheet inside the building; as I understood—by the side of it was to be a free correspondence company, where anybody could write a letter free—there were also to be tables for eating purposes, with an invention by Krantz by which you touched a knob, and a dinner would appear under a desk—you touched different knobs for different</p>

"; and thirty pawntickets, the first being June 22, 1888, for a cigar-case, 6s., and others running from date down to 23rd October, 1889, for a watch, 7s.—all the pawnings are articles of small value; the total represented by them is £21.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—about one in the morning of 16th October the prisoner came to my room; he sat down and said, "Bill, I have murdered my wife"—I said, "Non sense"—he said, "I have been drove to do it, and I told you before that I would do it"—I again said, "Nonsense"—he said, "I have killed her stone dead; I will kiss your wife and your children, and I will kiss you also, and I will go and kiss my children, and give myself up"—my wife left the room and he followed her downstairs, and I did not see him again that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M. D. and licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh—I practice in High Street, Stratford—about half-past one in the morning of 16th October 1 went to 75, Burford Street, and saw Mrs. Speed lying on the floor in the kitchen in a large quantity of blood; she seemed to me to be dead—there was a wound in her neck about three inches in length, of an irregular shape, and wide enough to admit of the tip of my forefinger, it was about half an inch deep; it had the appearance of being the result of three actions, as if the point of the knife had been introduced first, then a cut in the shape of a distinct curve from that, and then in a line more or less straight from that curved line; there were three distinct stages of the wound—I found it was not a mortal wound, there was no arterial bleeding, the jugular vein had escaped, I sewed up the wound; the quantity of blood lost was very great, considering that no vessel had been opened—it was a wound that might have caused death—I had her put to bed; she was under my care</p>

I was at the station when the prisoner was brought there—he was charged with feloniously cutting and wounding his wife with a pocketknife, with intent to do her grievous, bodily harm—he said, "I should like to say something"—I said, "If you wish to make a statement you can do so, but it is my duty to caution you that what you say will be taken down in writing and produced at your trial"—he replied, "I am quite willing to make a truthful state ment of what happened"—I took down what he said, read it over to him, and he said, "Quite right, "and signed it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>," My wife has been away three weeks today, living with another man, John Low. About 11.30 p.m., on the 15th inst., my wife came home the worse for drink, and came into the kitchen and laid on a form in front of the fire; my two daughters asked her to go to bed; she said, 'I am b----if I will, I have a man I have been living with.' I was standing at the front door at the time and heard her fall; I went into her with my daughter Rose; I had a knife and pipe in my hand; I was cleaning my pipe out; I moved across the table and sat cross-legged. I prayed her to go to bed. She said, 'No, I will not, so long as I like.' I said, 'Have you come to torment me after leaving my children lousy and dirty; I went to pick her up, with the knife in my hand. She struggled, and in the struggle the knife stuck into her; then I knew I had done something wrong. It was an accident. I could not stop to see what I had done. I went to my neighbour and told him I had stuck a knife somewhere in the throat of my wife, and I went to my mother-in-law and told her what I had done. "</p>

On the morning of 5th October I went with Sergeant Howard to the Anchor Wharf, Greenwich, where I saw Robinson—I said, "We are police officers; I am going to take you in custody for being concerned with two other men not in custody with stealing four bales of Manilla hemp from the barge <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi> between 9 p.m. on the 2nd and 6 a.m. on the 3rd, the property of Richard Dearing and another, value £20; you will be further charged with feloniously receiving the same, well knowing it to be stolen"—he said, "I cannot see that you can do that"—he was taken to the station and charged—on the way to the Police-court on the 5th he said, "I had an idea they were stolen, because Con Shea and Mouse Howden are two convicted thieves, and a d—d nuisance to me; I went to Inspector Phillips and told him"—I afterwards, with Howard, searched the wharf—I found these three pots among others in a cupboard in the office underneath Robinson's desk—I also found this book, which I called his attention to—I asked him if he had any entry in it, and he pointed to this at the bottom of the left hand page, "Howden and Shea 10a. m, three bales of jute, 18s. on account; X his mark.—C.A.R."—I see no other entry in the book where the time is put—Howden at the Police-court asked me who in formed me that he sold the jute to Robinson; I did not tell him—on 19th he cross-examined me as to who gave me information—I cannot recollect if he said anything after that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I did not know until I heard from Phillips the names of the alleged thieves—Robinson's Wharf is a largish place, with a good river frontage—it is well stocked with metal; I should think there were 100 tons there—I searched his warehouse in Old Woolwich Road; it was well stocked—he came up when we were finishing—of all the metal at the wharf and stuff at the warehouse, these three pots are the only three things we allege against him in addition to the hemp—there were new hinges at the wharf—I found they were bought from Appleby Brothers and others—I found 30 tons of rivets—the account given by the prisoner of those was true—the account he gave of 7 or 8 cwt. of stearine wax we found was not correct; he is not charged with that—the earliest date in this book found there is 17th September—I do not produce other books of his—there are eight bins in the prisoner's office boarded up in front, and with a desk over them—I found these three pots among about thirty, I should think—other bins contained copper, brass, metal, etc.—the names of Wilkie and Soames, wax merchants, were mentioned in connection with the wax—one of my sergeants has seen them, and reported to me since this wax was found—he did not say they sold the wax to Robinson—Soames analysed a sample of the wax found at Robinson's, and it was similar to some stolen from their barge twelve or thirteen months previous—I asked Robinson where he got the wax from, and he said, "I have had it on my premises at least three or four years—I saw Westwood, and took notes of what he said on a report sheet—I let him tell his story; I did not ask him questions, I swear—it is not correct for him to say I asked him whether he saw Robinson—I did not call Westwood at the Police court, as the case was a long one, and the Magistrate wished to leave for Woolwich—there were four or five remands—Robinson did not give me information where Con Shea was to be found—I am responsible for goods</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 242). On 3rd October I was with Sergeant Don near Robinson's Wharf, about six p.m.—I saw Robinson leaving—he said, "Con Shea and Mouse Howden brought three bales to me, and I advanced 18s. on them; I don't know but that they may come to mo for more money tonight; I will try to find them, if you keep observation on me; most likely you will be able to catch two of them"—I watched Robinson till twelve that night—he went home to tea; then he went to West Greenwich, and came back to the Bricklayers' Arms, East Greenwich—he then knocked at the door of 57, Marlborough Street, East Greenwich, and came back and said Mouse was indoors in bed—I and Don went in and arrested Howden's brother Alfred, thinking he was the prisoner Howden—we took him to the station, and then, having doubts as to whether he was the right man, we went back to the house—we saw Robinson there—he said, "It is all up; they have gone round to Old Woolwich Road, Con Shea and Mouse Howden"—Alfred Howden was liberated at twelve o'clock—I went on Robinson's Wharf and watched the jute—on the following Sunday I was in Humber Road with Constable Good-game—I saw Howden with a man named Galloway—we went towards them; they ran away—we followed and apprehended Howden in Greenwich Park—I told him the charge—he said, "I know nothing about it!'—on the Friday following I went with Robinson in search of Shea to 26, Queen Street, Deptford—as soon as Robinson and his carman, Alfred Brischlayer, got to the door, it was opened to them, and they went in—I was ten steps behind—when I got to the door I tried to go in, but I heard the click of the bolt from inside before I could get it open—we watched about a quarter of an hour; I knocked, and Robinson and Brischlayer came to the door without opening it—I could see them through the glass fanlight over the door—I tried to force the door—I said, "Open the door"—they made no answer, and did not open it for four minutes—I saw a man pass out at the back—the carman pulled the bolt eventually—when I got in I saw no one but Robinson and the carman there—I know Con Shea by sight—it was just such another man as he who went to the back of the premises—when I got in I asked Robinson where Con Shea was—he said, "It is too late; he has gone out at the back"—I went to the back then; when I came back, after searching, Robinson was gone—at the Police-court Howden cross examined me as to who said he was the man that delivered the bales to Robinson—I said Robinson was the man—he said Robinson said he (Howden) was not there, and he had not bought any goods of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOGHEGAN</hi>. I believe what he said was that he did not sell the jute to Robinson, or that Robinson said he had not bought anything of him—Queen Street, Deptford, is one of the worst localities; I don't know that there is much difference between it and other parts of Deptford—thieves and prostitutes live in Queen Street and all over Deptford—Con Shea is a notorious thief, and he has the notoriety of being a powerful fighting man—I did not guard the back of the house—it was not to my knowledge one of the most dangerous</p>

I was on Anchor Wharf. I saw Mouse Howden and Con Shea. Shea was smothered in mud. There was three bales of hemp made fast to the steps. Shea went on to Robinson's Wharf; I went to mind Mr. Parkinson's boat. Mousey Howden said to me about 9. 30, 'Lend us that boat. 'I said, 'No.' He jumped in with Con Shea. Shea said to Howden, 'If Charley has the three bales we'll get drunk. He has offered fourteen <hi rend="italic">hog</hi> for them. 'Mousey said, 'I d sooner <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> them in the dust-hole. 'They untied the bales from the stairs, and towed them round to Robin son's Wharf, and slung the chain round them, and they were hove up on to the wharf by Leach and another man who works for Robinson. Robin son was on the wharf. Howden and Shea climbed up the piles on to the wharf. Con Shea came on to Anchor Wharf and gave me twopence. Shortly after I saw a pony and cart belonging to Robinson standing out side the wharf with three bales of hemp in it. I saw the water dripping from the cart.—J.

I am the wife of James Aldridge—in March, 1888, we were living at 14, Clayton Road, Peckham, we let lodgings—on Tuesday, 20th March, my husband and I, my daughter Alice, and Mrs. Miller, a lodger, were in the house—the prisoner came there that day, and I let him the first-floor back room at half-a-crown a week—he said he would pay monthly; he came that evening with his wife and a baby, a boy about three months old, it seemed very healthy—I was not very well on the Wednesday and Thursday, and I remained in my own room, which adjoined the prisoner's—on Wednesday, the 21st, I heard the child cry very much, also on the Thursday morning about eleven o'clock, and the mother was walking about with it; that was the last time I heard it cry—it ceased crying in a moment—I believe the prisoner was in the room also, I could hear the two of them walk about, I heard no talking—about half-an-hour after the child ceased crying I heard one person leave the room, I thought it was the woman; I was not sure, because her footsteps were heavier, I had noticed that before—about ten minutes afterwards I heard a second person leave the room, I could not say who it was; I heard the footsteps go down stairs and go out, they were lighter stops—I heard the room door locked—between six and seven o'clock in the evening I heard the prisoner return, unlock the door, and go into the room; he remained there between five and ten minutes, and then went out, locking the door again, and went down stairs and out—they usually locked the door when they went out—I heard no more till somewhere past eleven o'clock, when the husband and wife came home together, and they slept in the room that night—they remained in the house down to Thursday, the 29th, they then left—I was laid up the whole of that time; I did not see the prisoner at all between the 22nd and 29th—nothing was said about leaving—on Saturday morning, the 31st, the prisoner returned, I saw him, as I was at my bedroom door; he was alone, it was about eleven o'clock—he had lost his key, and asked if I had one; I said no; he said he would go and get one—he went out; but never came back any more—I did not ask him anything about the child; my daughter was there—shortly after he had gone his wife came to my room, and I had a conversation with her; she was distressed, and cried very much, she stayed about ten minutes, and then left—on the following Wednesday, 4th April, she came again with a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am a divisional surgeon of Police—on 28th March last year I was shown the dead body of a male child at the Battersea Mortuary, about three months old; it weighed exactly 12 lb.—I examined it externally, there were no marks of violence—the skin of the upper part of the arms was compressed by the bands of the chemise—the front of the arms, legs, and abdomen presented the appearance of what is generally known as goose-skin, that is a contraction of the skin; the hands and feet were macerated; the skin was loosening, showing that the body had been in the water for some days—the goose skin is frequently found on the body of the drowned; it indicates that cold has been suddenly applied to a warm body; it is usually considered, in this country, as a proof of the person having entered the water alive, that the body has been placed warm in the water—later the same day I examined the entire organs of the body; there was no disease of any—the brain and lungs were healthy—the right cavity of the heart was full of dark liquid blood; the left cavity was perfectly empty—the stomach was full of milk, digestion just commencing, very probably—the milk was slightly coagulated, indicating that the food had been recently given, within a short time, certainly less than an hour of the time of death—the cause of death was asphyxia, suffocation; I could not say how caused—I could not say whether caused by drowning—there was nothing but the goose-skin tending to show that the asphyxia had been caused by drowning—all the other indications were consistent with death by suffocation, apart from drowning—assuming death not caused by drowning, I should say that the body had been placed in the water within a comparatively short period after breath had left the body, but that no one could determine—I should think within an hour of death, or some such period; it is impossible to define the exact time—I don't think it could be two hours; I feel certain it could not—if within two hours, I don't think the goose-skin would have been caused—it would depend upon whether the body retained warmth—the warmth would begin to vanish directly the breath was out of the body—in March, 1888, it was very cold weather—I think an hour would be as long as it could retain warmth, but I could not positively fix a time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Coroner—I then had the notes that I had made—I suppose the body had been six days in the water—I have made a great many postmortem examinations of drowned persons—if the body is dead when put into the water, the water cannot enter the stomach, because the gullet would be contracted—if there had been struggling, there would be mucous froth in the air-cells, and water in the bronchial tubes—I did not find those things present here—I found no water in the stomach; only milk-and-water—I believe it was cow's milk, not human milk—I have not analysed the contents of the stomach—the stomach and its contents were given to the Coroner's officer for ex amination—he is not here—the skin was pale all over the body—there were no marks of decomposition—I cannot say whether a nervous shock would produce goose-skin; it is possible—apart from other appearances, there was nothing in the goose-skin to show death by drowning; any application of cold might produce the same appearance—death by suffocation rather retards cooling; not to any considerable extent; I am not prepared to say that it does so to a perceptible extent—I have examined many bodies of children that have been overlaid by the mother—if a bolster had been put over the nose or face, I should expect to find con traction or congestion of the facial muscles; the features of this child were pale, and the nose pinched—the length of time it had been in the water might have had some influence on the paleness of the skin—I said, in answer to the Coroner, "If the child had laid on its face, and a bolster got over it, and so smothered it, I should have expected to find some compression of the face, and some of the facial muscles, but these appearances were entirely absent in the body of the child"—I agree with that now—I say that the child presented all the appearances of having been smothered, whether accidentally or not I cannot say—there were no signs of violence—if it slipped between the blankets, the appearances might be consistent with that; the question is rather involved—I can't say that there was anything in the appearance inconsistent with that supposition—if force had been applied, I should have expected to find those appearances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There can be suffocation which would not be accompanied by any marks of violence—if a blanket or bolster were placed over the child's mouth, marks would not necessarily be found; it would depend on the position of the body and the bolster, and on the amount of force applied—I found no signs of drowning except the goose-skin, and that might arise from other causes; in my opinion the child might have been suffocated, and died before it was put into the water.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. I have said it is possible that goose-skin may be caused by a shock; I have never known an instance of it; goose-skin is a common expression; a sudden shock of cold on to a living child might cause it—that would last until the shock passed off, then the skin would resume its natural appearance—I have known many cases of children being accidentally smothered by the ordinary bedclothes getting over it; that would leave no mark—any mode by which air cannot get to the lungs is sufficient to suffocate—a pinched appearance of the nose is very common in dead bodies—a live child, three months old, thrown into the water, would sink at once; if wrapped up, it would, to a certain ex tent, exclude the access of water.</p>

James Tickett said he was not in the company of the other prisoners in Battersea Park Road; that he had committed an assault on Elizabeth Tickett, and thinking the police had come about that he ran away.
