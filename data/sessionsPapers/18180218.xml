I was very much bruised and confused, and my nose and mouth bled considerably - I have not yet recovered from the effects of it.</p>
               <p>MR. EDMUND SEXTON CALVERT. I was in St. James's-place, coming from my uncle's, about a quarter after six o'clock; I saw two men scuffling at a distance, walked up, and saw the prisoner hit Mr. Vaughan, with his hat, on his head - I am certain he is the man-it was Mr. Vaughan's hat, the prisoner had it - He ran away - I pursued. I saw no other man. When I got up to him he threw the hat behind, and fell down, I picked it up, and gave it to Mr. Vaughan; on turning round again I saw the prisoner getting up - He ran off. I overtook him, and secured him. I took him to the watch-house, with assistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not drunk - A. When he was on the ground he appeared dead drunk, I did not perceive it before. I do not think he was drunk, he pretended it. He was not two yards from me. He ran up St. James's-place, towards the Park, the gates were locked, and he could not get out. I lost sight of him, but will swear he is the man.</p>
               <p>GEORGE NATHANIEL TENNANT. I am servant to Mr. Hobson, of St. James's-place. I was opening the door, about a quarter after six o'clock, and saw the prisoner strike Mr. Vaughan, with his right hand, in the face, Mr. Vaughan staggered and fell - I heard him faintly call out, stop! the prisoner struck him again with his hat about his head; Mr. Vaughan called out murder several times. I ran after the prisoner towards Lord Spencer's house; he could not get out, the gate being shut.</p>
               <p>Q. When he ran up St. James's-place, did you see any person come in from St. James's-street - A. Yes; when murder was called. If the prisoner had ran towards St. James's-street he must have been stopped; he was not intoxicated. When I ran up he had fallen down, and Mr. Calvert stood over him. I saw a hat on the ground about the time that the blows were given, but I do not remember seeing the prisoner pick it up. He struck Mr. Vaughan with his fist.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. You never lost sight of him - A. I did not see him throw the hat away; Mr. Calvert was before me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking, and got intoxicated; as I was going home a man pretended to assist me, and put his hand into my pocket, I ran after him, mistook Mr. Vaughan for him, and struck him - I found out my mistake, and ran off.</p>

I returned a little after four in the afternoon, and found the dairy window open, and the iron bar of the casement broken in - A man could then get in-the dairy door was shut; they had broken a hole in the lath and plaster wall, and got through into the back of the house, gone up stairs, broken another hole through a lath and plaster wall, and crept into my childrens' room, and then into mine; I found the drawers open, and the things in great disorder; I missed my coat, my watch, seal, and key, which hung over the bed. I said nothing about it until I had done my work the next day, I then got Weedon to go with me, and look for the prisoner, Bishop, whom I suspected; we found him at Ryeslip, which is about a mile from my house, I collared him, and told him he must come with me, and took him to a public-house-Weeden went and took Gregory, and brought him to us. We took them both to lckenham. I told Bishop I thought he had better confess it, when he said my great coat was up in about the third tree in a hedge of one of my father's fields, which is about a mile from my house; he took us there, to the third tree, and found it himself - He said he gave my watch to Gregory. I asked him if my dog did not bark at him, when he was at my house - He said, yes.</p>

As soon as he got to the other public-house he put his hand into his pocket, took out the watch, and dropped it; I told him not to throw it away, and I picked it up - He got from me and ran off, but I overtook him; he said he would not go back with me, and that the property was given to him. I dragged him back to the public-house where Byles was, I pulled the watch out, and asked Byles if it was his, he said it was, Bishop said, "D-n" that watch, I thought it was gone" Gregory said Bishop gave it to him, and he knew Bishop stole it from Byles's house.</p>

On Wednesday the 11th of February, at eight o'clock at night, I shut up my shop, and left the door latched, but not locked - I tried it myself, and am positive it was fast-it is a glazed door; I went into the back-parlour, and sat opposite the window which looks into the shop, I could see into it-in about half an hour I heard somebody in the shop, I got off my seat, and saw the prisoner through the window, standing on a chair in the shop, the boots hung over the chair, as soon as he heard me he jumped off the chair and ran out. There was a light in the shop. I immediately pursued and secured him. I missed a boot from over the chair, and found it just outside the door, in the way he ran; I am certain it was safe when I fastened the door-nobody had been in the shop before, I must have heard them if they had. Scoball gave me the boot-it is worth 1l. I never lost sight of the prisoner, and am certain he is the man.</p>

I found it heavy, and asked him what was in it, he said, butter; I asked him if his father gave him the butter, he said, no. I told him he was going the wrong way to the Bull Inn, and secured him.

He said he came from Mr. Wilson, of Blackfriars-road, to fetch his pork. No person of that name had bought any.</p>
               <p>JOHN JARMAN. I am servant to the prosecutors. I weighed six sides of pork for Daniel Oakley, a butcher, and hung them on two hooks. At eight o'clock I saw the prisoner going out of the shop with three sides on his shoulder, I asked him where he was going with them, he said, he was going to take them to Mr. Wilson's cart; I told him they belonged to Mr. Oakley; he said it was all right, they were for Mr. Wilson. I told him to hang them up again, as they did not belong to him, and detained him.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WOODWARD. I am a Thames Police constable. On the 13th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was crossing Ludgate-hill, towards the Old Bailey, and saw the prosecutor come down the Old Bailey, the prisoner, and another girl, met him full in the face, tapped him on the breast, and said, halloo! he told them to be off; the prisoner immediately drew his watch from his pocket, he made a catch at her, but fell in the road, and they ran off; I followed them across Ludgate-hill, through a gateway, up two or three different courts - They parted, and I followed the prisoner into Dolphin-court, which leads into Ludgate-hill; when she got to the dark part of the court she dropped the watch. I still pursued, and took her. I asked her what she had done with the watch - She denied ever seeing it. I told her to come back with me, and see if we could find it; I took her back to the spot, called the watchman to bring a light, and found it down the area. I took it and the prisoner to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ARLE. I am a watchman. Woodward called to me for a light, and found the watch in the area.</p>

               <p>GEORGE FIEGEHEN. I was passing through Great Carter-lane, on the 27th of January I saw the prisoner lurking about the horse; suspecting him, I watched him, and saw him take the coat off the horse and walk away - I followed. The prosecutor called out, and the prisoner began to run. I took him - He threw the coat away.</p>

I have three lodgers. I got up at half-past seven o'clock the next morning, and found the table-linen, sheets, and other things had been moved, in the room where I slept; in about ten minutes after we found the window open, and the wash-house door had been forced open with a chisel, or something like it-it was then light - I am sure they were fastened when I went to bed. I had not heard any noise. Between eleven and twelve o'clock I saw the property at the office. I sleep in the front room on the ground-floor.</p>

On the 21st of January, I was calling two o'clock in the morning, in Hamilton-row, about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's, and saw the prisoner with a bag under his arm; I laid hold of him, and asked him what he had got? he said they were shirts and other things, which he had brought from the country, and he was going to his lodgings in Spafields. The bag contained the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

            . I was passing, and was told a thief was in the house, and that they could not procure a constable. I took him into custody, and was informed that he had an accomplice outside; the prisoner pointed out the accomplice - I took him, and then the prisoner. Mr. Day charged him with entering the house, and moving part of the plate. The articles stated in the indictment laid at one corner of the table; the salt had been emptied out of the cellar on the floor-the things were in great disorder. I found nothing on the prisoner.</p>

On the morning of the 2d of February, about half-past eight o'clock, I remember taking some plate into the kitchen, and leaving it on a table near the window, which was shut and fastened - I missed the articles stated in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180009"/>indictment about twelve-the window was still fastened as I had left it. The kitchen door leads into the garden, it was latched, I tried it not two minutes before I left the kitchen. My husband was out from ten until four o'clock, and the servant was up stairs all the while with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. MARSHAM. I have only one servant. There is only one kitchen window and one door, which communicates with the passage - You pass through another kitchen into the garden-there is a kitchen on each side of the passage. I have no children. The kitchen door, leading into the garden, was latched, but it could be opened on the outside.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ADKINS. I am headborough of Hackney, in the parish of Stoke Newington. On the 2d of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming over a gate, with something coacealed under his coat - He was coming in a direction from the prosecutor's house, and going towards Shacklewell - I followed him, and asked him what he had there? he said, "what do you want?" and ran off; I called out, stop thief! and pursued him. When I first saw him, there was a man waiting at the gate near him-the man said nothing to me; the prisoner ran until he came to Hobson's brick-field, when Newell stopped him. I took him into custody, he had not then got any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the gate from the house - A. About fifty yards, and about 150 or 200 from the brick-field-it is by the road side; the brick-fields are by Shacklewell, there are two or there turnings to them. The prisoner was talking to the man, and they both went away together. I did not pursue the other man.</p>
               <p>JOHN NEWELL. I am a brickmaker. I was working in Hobson's brick-field, a little after eleven o'clock, and heard the cry of stop thief, I saw several persons running, the prisoner was the foremost - I was before him, and pursued towards him; when I got within five yards of him I saw him pull his hand from under his coat, and throw several things into the cesspool, they looked like silver they only had two or three feet to fall-there were several different things; I caught him immediately, close to the cesspool, and told Strutton, who came up, what he had done; I held the prisoner while he searched the cesspool, and saw him pull the silver table and other spoons, and sugar-tongs, out. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Stoke Newington.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am sure he is the man. I assisted in taking him to the office; as we went he said, I could not say that he stole the spoons.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STRUTTON. I am a brickmaker. I joined in pursuit of the prisoner, and saw Newell take him; I came up just as he took him - He was not in my sight when he threw the spoons away. Newell said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had thrown the spoons into the cesspool; I searched, and found five tea, two table, and two salt-spoons, and a pair of sugar-tongs, all silver, which I gave to Rutterforth.</p>

               <p>JAMES TIMMS. I am a brickmaker. I saw Strutton find the things in the cesspool; after he was gone I found a silver tea-spoon in it of the same pattern as the others.</p>
               <p>GEORGE RUTTERFORTH. I am a constable. The property was delivered me. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Stoke Newington.</p>

When I got about 150 yards, he came behind me, seized my ear, said I was a thief, and knocked me down. I got up, he struck me again - A person helped me up, and appeared to take my part. The prisoner knocked me down again, and went across the road back to Russell-court - I missed my watch, I had it safe at four o'clock.

On the 9th of February I was in Wych-street about six o'clock, passing the Olympic Theatre, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor - the prisoner said he sold him two oranges for three-halfpence-the prosecutor said, "I have given you a halfpenny, and that is enough." The prisoner struck him, and he fell; he got up again-the prisoner went away. A man came up to the prosecutor and lifted him up, he then said he had lost his watch - I had seen it in his hand; he went behind the man who lifted the prosecutor up, and he gave it to him. We went to Bow-street, and got Tribute, the officer. The prosecutor was intoxicated.</p>

The prosecutor took an orange-the prisoner put down his basket and ran after him; he came back, and kept selling his oranges for half an hour, when the officer came, and he said he was the man.

The prisoner was in the hall with a basket; I asked him what he had in it - He hesitated; I ordered the green cloth which was at the top of it, to be moved, and found my great coat under it; I had only worn it three weeks-it cost me 7l. 18s. and must have been worth 6l.

He returned in half an hour; he ought not to have been gone above ten minutes. I afterwards sent him with other silver goods, worth 30l., in a green bag - I have never seen them since.

            . I am fifteen years old. I was employed by Mr. Crook, a blacksmith - I was out of place. The prisoner, Millett, told me to be at the top of St. Martin's-le-Grand, at eight o'clock in the morning of the 20th of November. I went, and saw Moulds at the corner of Angel-street - I did not know him before; soon after, I saw Millett come out of Dean's-court with a canvas bag, which appeared to have something heavy in it, he gave. it to Moulds, who went away with it. Millett then went into a baker's shop; I went and spoke to him. He said,"What have you come? - that is right; stay here till I come again." - I did so. In about half an hour he came to me with a green baize bag; Moulds was standing there at the time. We all three went up Angel-street, and along Holborn. When we came to the Seven Dials, Millett gave Moulds the bag; he told Millett to take it to a public-house in Pulteney-street - Millett and I went there, and had a pint of beer. In about a quarter of an hour Moulds came in-he had plenty of bank notes and some silver in his hand, and a sovereign and a half. He took us to Marylebone, to a public-house at the corner of East-street, and had some rum, which he paid for; we then went to a cook-shop, and had some meat and a pot of beer. He took us to several public-houses, and made us quite drunk. After I recovered, I found myself lying on the floor of a room at Rumsey's, in Marylebone-Millett was likewise there. Moulds gave us none of the money. It was then about half-past eight o'clock at night. Millett had a shilling, which he paid for a lodging for us that night. Next day, we wandered about the streets, without having any thing to eat. At night we met Rumsey on Blenheim steps, and asked him for some money, he said he had none; he gave us two-pence, and left us immediately. We got a penny loaf each - We then said we would go home to our friends, which I did. I was taken before the magistrate in January, and told this story. I am sure Moulds is the man.</p>

            . I live in York-court, Earl-street, Marylebone. I knew the prisoner, Moulds, by seeing him at a public-house at Dorset-street. On the 20th of November, about one o'clock, as I was going to dinner, I met him in Crawford-street, with Millett and Onree. He asked me if I had plenty of work, and sent the two boys on. I asked him how he got on? he said very well-that he had a horse and cart, and would give me something to drink. I went into a public-house with him, the boys waited outside. I saw he had a sovereign and a half, and some silver. I afterwards went with him and the two boys to the York, public-house, and had two or three pots of porter, which he paid for-the boys were drunk. We all walked to Earl-street, and had a glass of rum each at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180012"/>another public-house, the boys refused to drink any-Moulds persuaded them to drink it. Mr. Addlington, who was there, offered to pay for two of the glasses of rum, the prisoner. Moulds, said he would pay for them himself, and changed a half-sovereign to pay for them, saying that he had plenty of money. He asked me to let the two boys lay down in my room, which I did. He went up with them, it was about three o'clock, and went away about seven o'clock, leaving them asleep and quite sick - They left about half-past ten. Next night they came to my house, looking for Moulds, and wandering about.</p>

The prisoner came there on the 2d of January, and asked for Mr. Laing, I told him he was in the country, but I would attend him. He said he understood we had some coal-sacking to sell, and asked the price. I asked him his name, he said Rumsey. I asked him if he was Mr. Rumsey, of Bankside? he said, yes. I said, I was glad at the prospect of doing business with him. There is only one Mr. Rumsey, of Bankside, he is a coal-merchant. He said, "You will often see my name on the coal-waggons." I gave him a list of the prices, he said they were too high. I said, that as his consumption was large, I would take 1s. off, to open an account with him. He asked me what discount we took off for money? I said I would engage in a six months running account with him, which he told me to put on the card - I did so. He appointed to call the next day - I said I should be at Bankside, and would call on him; he said he would call on me, and went away. He was afterwards apprehended, and offered to give up the sacking, if I would not prosecute.</p>

I and the prisoner work for Mr, Treacher. on Saturday night the 10th of January, I was in company with the prisoner, drinking at a public-house, next door to his house-that was the last public-house we were at - We left together between twelve and one o'clock-both went home he appeared to me to be in liquor. Next morning between eleven and twelve o'clock, I went to his house and saw him - He was talking to Mr. Jones and Mr. Williams, who were there - I staid about three minutes, went away, and returned again in ten minutes - I asked him why he did not follow us? The first time I was there we wanted him to go with us-he said "I am coming directly."I turned round and asked him where his wife was-he said she was in bed - I went into the bed-room, and said, "Mrs. Evans, it is a fine time of day to be in bed." Receiving no answer, I looked, and saw her lying on the bed with her mouth half open-she was covered with the bed-clothes - I felt her, she was quite cold. I said to the prisoner, "Mrs. Evans is dead" - He said "Good God don't say so."He went and jumped to her, and kissed her; saying, "I hope you are not dead, my dear woman." He kept crying over her, I pulled him away, I asked him what time he spoke to her - He said "between six and seven o'clock in the morning, that she told him her feet were very cold, and that he put a hot brick to them, and that she said, "that is a good boy.'" I asked if he had done any thing to her, he said "No, but I was very much intoxicated - I don't know what I did." I asked if she was drunk? He said, he did not know; that he was aggravated by some of the lodgers-was very drunk, and did not know what he did. He said that one of the women of the house told him, that his wife had had connection with one of the lodgers in the passage; and that the lodger told him, he did not keep a wife but a wh-e; and that the lodger's husband had had connection with his wife two or three days ago, in the passage. I told him not to vex himself, and bid him good by. The floor of the room was not quite dry, it appeared as if it had been cleaned-there was a fire in the room, About ten minutes after I went there again, he asked me to go to his little boy.</p>

               <p>Q. How long afterwards did you see him again - A. About two o'clock he came to my room, and asked me to go to a person to lay the corpse out. I went with his little boy to her, she would not come. In about an hour I saw him again at his house - He asked me to go with him to the undertakers. He said, "suppose we take the length of the body." We did so, and went to Mr. White, the undertaker, he told him his dear woman was dead-he said that she was very low, and he could see death in her face for a week past-that she could eat nothing for some time - He gave White the string, and told him if that would do, it would save him the trouble of coming. White said he was much obliged to him, and asked him if she was stout-he said she was wasted away to nothing. We then went to Mrs. Jones; she and her daughter went with us to the prisoner's house - I left the prisoner's house about ten o'clock at night, leaving Jones there. The next morning (Monday), about ten minutes before seven, I went and asked him to come to work with me - He said he did not think he should to day, and asked me to take a few clothes to my wife to wash. He gave me a bundle, which I gave her - She had not been in the habit of washing for him they were tied up in a course cloth like an apron. I saw him again at half-past seven in the evening, and asked if the coffin was come - He said, no, it was past the time-it came while I was there. I heard the women say, that the man down stairs had killed his wife the prisoner could hear them. He said nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the coffin was closed did you see the body - A. I saw part of her hand, when the undertaker was taking the cap off her head, I thought I saw somthing like a crust of blood, it appeared to stick to her head. His wife always appeared a weak person - I had seen her on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I had known the prisoner seven months-he was a very kind good-hearted man - They were very fond of each other - I have seen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180014"/>her in liquor once or twice; she appeared in a low state for sometime past, and complained that her stomach was weak and she could eat nothing-the prisoner never absconded; he appeared extremely sorry,</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that he did not know she was dead, when you found her so - A. Yes; he said he had been aggravated by one of the lodgers, and did not know what he was about. He told the undertaker he might come and examine the body if he liked.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILLIAMS. I work for Mr. Treacher. On the 10th of January, I was with the prisoner - left him at the public-house, at the corner of Falconbridge-court. at eleven o'clock at night. Next morning, at half-past ten, I went to his room, and knocked at the door with my finger, he asked who was there, and said he could not open the door for me, and asked if I saw the key any where outside, for somebody had locked him in and taken it away - He asked me to go to Davis, to fetch the key to open the door for him - I did so, and came back with Davis's key. I was just putting it into Evans's door, when a woman came up from the street, and said,"I have got the key of that door," and gave it to me - I opened it, and took Davis's key back, and then returned to the prisoner Davis came after me, we found him standing in the front-room; Jones, the landlord, came in-Davis asked the prisoner to come out to drink - He said he did not care - We went out, and waited in the street for him to follow. We went back again after him - I observed the room had been lately washed-there was a little fire in it it was between ten and eleven o'clock I asked him if he knew his wife was dead? he said he did - He was sitting on the bed, crying and kissing her - I staid at the door and did not see her. Between three and four, I saw him again at Davis's - They bot went ouht and drank with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His door was locked outside, and his key taken away - A woman gave me the key, she was pregnant - I don't know who she was.</p>

            . I lodge in the one-pair back room of the prisoner's house, he lived in the two parlours, on the ground floor. On Saturday night, the 10th of January, after twevle o'clock, my husband was brought home by two men, intoxicated. I went out and met them left them at the door, and went to get a light. When I came back the door was shut, the prisoner opened it - We all three went in. There was a quarrel between the prisoner and my husband, about his coming home late-no blows passed while we were wrangling; the prisoner's wife was there with a candle in her hand; she was sober, and appeared as usual - She went out of the room and came in again. The prisoner appeared to have had a little drop, but not much. My husband was put to bed. I went out to light the two men who brought him home; as I returned up stairs I heard the prisoner challenging his wife about some money - I stood on the third or fourth stair, against his bedroom wainscot - I heard him call her bad names, and ask what she had done with some money. I heard either 2s. 10d. or 2s. 10 1/2d. mentioned. I heard him strike her; I thought it was with his hand-the noise stopped. I went up to my room. About a quarter after one o'clock I was coming down stairs for some water, and heard him beating her dreadfully; I can not tell what he beat her with, it appeared to be with some weapon. I heard her say"Oh! dear me," and "don't;" very low, several times. I stood listening on the stairs for ten minutes, or more; I thought they were going to bed. In the middle of these expressious, I called him a blackguard for beating his wife; he called me several bad names; he heard me through the wainscot. I ran up stairs to my husband, but could not make him understand, he was drunk; I knocked at the door of the next room - I could not make them hear - I could have been heard all over the house. I returned to my own room, and was afraid to go down, to pass his door, or I should have called the watchman. I thought he had done beating her. I heard no more; my bed-room is over his - I did not lock the prisoner in his room at all. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I was in the passage, and picked up the key of his door - I knocked at his door, he opened it, and had a cloth or flannel in his hand, and was wiping something off the floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you married - A. I have five children.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman - A. I pass as such. I have lived five months in the house. I never was acquainted with the deceased she lived there six or seven weeks. I never had any dispute with her, or used bad language to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember telling the prisoner about his wife doing any thing with your husband - A. I said nothing about his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you never, on any occasion, spoke unkindly of her - A. Never. I never said she had been improperly connected with my husband. I thought he was beating her with his fist at first. I went up stairs without my water. I never got any assistance. I was afraid to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see him wiping the floor -

            . I lodge on the second floor in the house. I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock, with my husband. I was disturbed a few minutes after twelve, by a great noise in the passage. I heard Mr. and Mrs. Desmond, and the prisoner, talking together. I thought I heard a scuffle - I did not leave my room; the prisoner went into his room. In a few minutes I heard Mrs. Desmond go up stairs, and come down again, and a man came in; she told her husband it was her sister and brother her brother had brought her husband home. I believe he forgot something, and returned for it. After this, I heard Mrs. Desmond quarrelling for an hour and a half at the door of the prisoner's room-some ill language passed. I heard the deceased groan three times. Mrs. Desmond was in her own room at that time she had gone down again. I at first thought it was a dog<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180015"/>growling, but the last groan I knew it was her, I said something wrong was going on - I got out of bed, and told my husband. I heard Mrs. Desmond take a candle and go down stairs. I saw a light under the crevice of my door, she called the prisoner a bad name - He left off beating his wife. Mrs. Desmond asked her why she did not cry out? the prisoner said she could not. Mrs. Desmond said, "I know very well, it is because you have murdered her." The prisoner said, "Yes, I know I have." I was afraid to go down, or to send my husband.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What is your husband - A. Clerk to a land agent. The noise was like striking a feather-bed. I thought he was beating her in bed. Next morning, about ten o'clock, I heard the prisoner talking to Mrs. Desmond-he was at his door - She was on the landing-place. She said he ought to be ashamed to beat his wife so. He said,"It was through what you said." She said, "That is nonsense, I say anything when I am in a passion." The prisoner said, "Don't say any more to me; I have more trouble in my mind than you are aware of - I don't want to be bothered with you."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Desmond insinuate that the prisoner's wife had been improperly connected with her husband - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>MARY CHAPMAN. I lodge in the same house with the prisoner. I knew the deceased by sight; she was a quiet. sober woman; she and the prisoner appeared to live on good terms. On Saturday night, the 10th of January, I met her in the passage, just before twelve o'clock, and spoke to her, she appeared to be sober. I sleep in the two-pair front room. After one o'clock in the morning I heard a quarrelling between the prisoner and Mrs. Desmond; it came from his room, and lasted about half an hour - I heard no blows, I heard the deceased groan, about eight o'clock in the morning - I was ill in bed, and did not get up. I went out about ten o'clock; when I came back, I observed the prisoner's little white curtain had been blown on one side. The window looks into the street. The bed and pillows were put up against the parlour window, which was down, they prevented any person from looking into the room. A person in the parlour could get into the street out of the window.</p>

            . I was sent for to the prisoner's house. I asked him if his wife died suddenly? he said, Yes. I said, "Sure, poor thing! did you get any doctor?" he said No. I saw her on the bed; she was cleaned them, and naked. She had a clean shift on, and her mouth was tied up.</p>

            . I live next door to the prisoner. I saw his wife about one o'clock on the night she died; she came to my house, I was in bed - She was sober. Soon after my husband came home. As I looked out, I saw a man lying on the step of the prisoner's door; I also saw the prisoner and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Desmond, and two or three other men-Mrs. Evans was holding the candle in the passage. One of the men laid hold of the prisoner's collar on each side, they appeared to be quarrelling - I went home. Next morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, Williams came to me for a key, which he took to the prisoner; be brought it back. I went to the prisoner, between ten and eleven o'clock, he was lying across the bed crying. I said, I hoped his wife was not dead - He said, "Yes, she is." I asked how she had been, and said I hoped he had done nothing to her; he said he could not tell, but he thought he had beat her. I said, "I hope you have not struck her with any thing?" (I believe I mentioned the poker) - He said, he did not think he did; he said he could not tell what he was about. I asked him what he did to her after beating her? he said he left her in that room, and went to bed. I was then standing between the two doors, I was not in the sitting-room. He said, when he got up, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, his wife said to him, "My dear, put me to bed." He said, "You shall not go to bed in that condition, however;" that he took her up, put her on a chair, stripped her, washed her all over, put her on a clean shift, and put her to bed; that she complained that her feet were cold; he said he took a warm brick from behind the fire, wrapped it up, and put it to her feet; that he made her a warm cup of tea, and offered it to her to drink, but she could not swallow it, and that it all came up again. I said, "Why did you not call somebody in, when you found she was so bad? "He said, he did not know what he did; he was locked in, and could not get out. The front-room floor appeared to have been lately washed, it was not quite dry - She was dead, and quite cold. I went and fetched Mrs. Madden. The deceased appeared to have a shalw over her head; when I went in a second time she had a cap on - We both went home. Between twelve and one o'clock the prisoner sent for me - I went; Mrs. Hitchlow was there. He asked me to lay his wife out - We did not. The prisoner came to me the same evening, between seven and eight o'clock. My husband told me I had better go, and help Mrs. Jones and her daughter, to lay the deceased out - I went. I asked the prisoner for a wash-hand bason. Mrs. Jones pulled the cloth down, and held the candle; the prisoner was in the front room. Mrs. Jones wiped her over, she did not appear to want washing, as she was quite clean. The body laid quite straight on its back-the arms were black and blue, and down to her knees. I saw no cuts-the marks appeared to be fresh made. There was a cap on her head. Mrs. Jones took her right ear-ring out, the other was gone. There appeared to be a blow on her temple, and on the side of her head, over the left eye, it looked black. On the Monday morning my husband brought me a bundle, and told me to wash it for the prisoner. I never washed for him before-it smelt very offensively. There were three petticoats, a shift, a pair of stays, a gown, an apron, a cap, and the ribbon which the cap was tied with, an odd stocking of the prisoner's, a half neck handkerchief, and a pocket handkerchief. I did not examine them, but put them all into a pan, and poured a pail of water over them - They remained there three hours. When I took them out, the water looked red like blood, the cap looked more bloody than the others; it being white, made me notice it more than the others. There were two or three holes in the cap, as if it had been cut. They were wrapped up in the wet and dirt just as they were-At night the prisoner himself gave me a bundle, which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180016"/>gave to Webb. I went out on Sunday morning, at daybreak, passed the prisoner's window between six and seven o'clock, and saw, through the holes in the shutter, that there was a light there. I saw the deceased intoxicated on Christmas-day, and the day after.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say he would have got medical assistance if he had not been locked in - A. Yes.</p>

            . I went to the prisoner's house to lay out the body of his wife. Her arms were bruised; there was a cap on her head, I moved it on one side to get her earring out, and noticed the left ear being very muchbruised. It was a clean cap, tied round with a handkerchief, which also tied up her mouth. I told my daughter to ask the prisoner for another cap. When I laid hold of her head, I found some blood in my hand, which came from the back of her head. I asked the prisoner if, when he put the cap on her head, he perceived any cut? He said, No. I said, there must be a cut, or where could the blood come from? he said there must. I have known the deceased fifteen or sixteen years, they lived on very good terms - She was a sober woman.</p>

            . I am an undertaker, and live in Tufton-street, Westminster. On the 11th of January the prisoner and Davis, came to me between five and six o'clock in the evening; I saw he was in trouble, and asked how mistress was? he said she was very well, and that he had left her at home in bed-Davis gave me to understand that she was dead. When he came into my room, he said his wife was dead, and asked me to bury her; I said, yes. He told me that he had observed death in her face for several days past, that she had latterly taken to drinking; he said she died from excessive drinking, and had a very short illness. Davis gave me a string, with the length of the corpse, and said he brought it to save me the trouble of going. The prisoner asked me if I could get it coffined by Monday, I said, yes. - I fixed to bring it home at seven o'clock in the evening. I went with my man to take it. and got into the court about eight o'clock, the door was opened immediately, before we knocked-the prisoner and Davis were in the front room. On the shroud being put on I observed the forehead looked black. When I put her into the coffin there was blood on the bolster where she had laid. I went to the prisoner, he was trembling, and asked him when he meant to bury her? - he said, on Friday, he believed. I was surprised at seeing the blood, and meant to go to the searchers', but he was apprehended before I could go.</p>

            . I am a constable of Westminster. I received information, and went to the prisoner's house about a quarter after ten o'clock on the Monday evening - He let me in; I asked him if that was the apartment where the corpse laid, he said it was. I told him, from information. I had received, I came to make some enquiry about it, and said I wished to see the corpse. I asked him if he had had any words with his wife? He said he had been out on Saturday night and got very tipsy, and when he came home a women and two or three Irishmen were in the passage, that they had some words about opening the door, and that one of the persons had made a representation to him of some improper connection of his wife's. That he had some words with his wife when he went into his room, and that he struck her a blow on her mouth with his hand. I asked him if he struck her with anything else? he said he was so intoxicated that he did not know what he had done. I asked him if he got any medical assistance, he said, no. I asked why? he said the woman up stairs had locked him in, and he could not get out. I told him he could have opened the window and called out; I believe he made no answer-the window would lift up, I tried it. I observed some blood on the mantle-piece, and took a candle, looked, and saw blood about every part of the wainscot, it appeared as if it had been splashed on the wall. There was a great deal of blood on the handles of the drawers in the front room, and blood on the floor. There was the appearance of blood stains, and three places covered with sand, which appeared to have been washed out. There was some blood on the bed-room, at the foot of the bed, and on the wainscot on both sides-the blood on the wainscot and part of the drawers appeared to have been washed-the highest spot was seven feet and two inches from the ground-there were a great many spots; the room is about seven feet by twelve wide. I asked him why he had washed it off - He said he thought it looked better. The fender, poker and shovel had blood on them-the poker was bent - I produce it. I found a pair of woman's boots on the chair, the bows have something like blood on them. I asked him where the deceased's clothes were; he said he did not know. Mr. Davis gave me some things. I took the prisoner into custody. I returned and examined the body, it was in a dreadful state, the hair was all matted with blood-there were three distinct places where I could see the scull bare, and nearly put the length of my finger in, the cuts were at the back of the head; there was one on the left side of the temple, besides. I should not think they could be occasioned by a fall. I suppose one of them must have been done by falling against the drawer handle. There were no blows in the face. I found a pan in the room, which had blood in it. There were marks of blood visible on the floor so late as Tuesday last.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did her hair appear to be washed-No; the blood on the drawer handle appeared to me to have been washed, but it was visible on the mouldings.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAM JENNINGS. I am an apothecary. I never practised as a surgeon. I live in King-street, Soho, and am employed by the parish. On Wednesday the 14th of January, I examined the body of the deceased. On lifting it out of the coffin I found three cuts on the back of the head, one about two inches long, the others two and a half - They must have been made with some blunt instrument; I put my finger on the length of the orifice, but could not reach the length of it, it was two inches long. I examined the second, I could not reach the end of that with my finger. There was a bruise on the left temple, the skin was taken off, it appeared to have been done with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180017"/>same instrument as the others-there was no intentation; the whole of the forehead was discoloured from one temple to the other. There was a blow across the wrist which appeared to have been inflicted with the same instrument. The skin was off the inside of the knee, for about the size of a dollar; I should think the poker a very likely thing to have inflicted the wounds, it would have cut the scull if it had not been for the hair. She had a great quantity of hair. The scull was not fractured.</p>

                  <persName id="t18180218-37-person247">Q. </persName>
            Were any of these injuries sufficient, of themselves, to have caused death - A. I think the blow on the temple sufficient to have caused death; I am of opinion that the other blows would have helped it, but of themselves I should not think them sufficient to cause death - They might have occasioned a concussion of the brain. I attended the opening of the body, with Mr. Carpuc, that evening, the brains were perfect, the stomach was empty, and there was some inflammation in the intestines.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing in these symptoms to induce you to alter the opinion you at first formed of the cause of her death - A. No; I cannot tell what to attribute the inflammation in the intestines to-that could not produce sudden death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the inflammation such as might have been instantly produced by acts of violence - A. I think so; it could be produced by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the effusion of blood from the wounds be considerable - A. It must. My opinion still is, that the blow on the temple was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. 
               <persName id="t18180218-37-person248">Q. </persName>
            That opinion you entertain, although the brain was quite sound - A. Yes. Mr. Carpue is a man of great science and celebrity.</p>
               <p>JAMES CARPUE, ESQ. I am a surgeon, and live in Dean-street, Soho. On the Wednesday after the death I opened the body; I consider the wound of the integuments of no great consequence; as I have patients who have recovered from wounds apparently as bad. The hair was mostly matted. I examined the scull, there was no fracture on the external part, which induced me to have it opened. I examined the internal, there was no fracture or laceration there, nor any division of the dura mater from the scull, nor any extravasation of blood; which induced me to examine the other coverings of the brain-there was none there, or in any part of the head; a blow on the temple is no more than a blow on any other part of the head, provided no injury is done to the internal parts. Not being perfectly satisfied, I examined the body; I found the stomach empty, and at least one yard of the small intestines in a high state of inflammation. I did not examine any more, being satisfied that she died either from this inflammation, or from the wounds on the head; but I think it was from the inflammation of the intestines. I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing her to be afflicted with the inflammation of the bowels before she received the blows, are you of opinion that the wounds might have increased the inflammation, or the blood that she lost from them - A. I should think the blood she lost the only method of cure; the inflammation was not likely to cause sudden death, but I should think that half that inflammation would have killed any body; she might have died from the blows, but there was inflammation enough to cause her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Would the blows be likely to produce a degree of irritation on the intestines - 
               <persName id="t18180218-37-person249">A. </persName>
            Certainly not; the blows would not increase the inflammation. The inflammation must have been going on for a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. May not blows be so violent as not to produce internal appearance, and yet cause death - 
               <persName id="t18180218-37-person250">A. </persName>
            Concussions seldom produce sudden death-it generally produces nausea at the stomach.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it not possible for a person in such a weak habit receiving a blow, to die under it, although they might recover, if a skilful person was called in to attend on them - A. If there was a considerable degree of debility; I should not expect it in a person who was able to be about their ordinary occupations.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion that, from the state of the intestines of the deceased, that she would be able to be about her ordinary occupations - A. Not well; she must be in dreadful pain; if she had been drinking the night before, it might have occasioned the inflammation. The discolouration of the forehead must have been produced by blows, but they were not mortal. There was a great quantity of inflammation.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my case to my counsel.</p>

The prisoner was brushing close to my pocket at the time - He pressed forward, there was a boy in his company. I seized the prisoner's left hand, and said, you have my property - He said "I have not." I kept hold of him; he opened his hand, and showed me my pocket-book, and said "Take it, don't prosecute me, I am a poor man with a large family."</p>
               <p>GEORGE LAMBE. I am a merchant, and reside at Camberwell. I was returning from the Temple, the prosecuter charged the prisoner with having his property; I took the pocket-book from him, the prisoner said he was a poor man. He could not have picked it up.</p>

I locked the shop door, and told him, I would have him searched - I sent up for Rawlins the constable, who lodged with me; the prisoner put one of the shillings he had offered me into his boot before Rawlins came down, took it out again, and fell on his knees, begging I would not hurt him, as he had a wife and six children, Rawlins searched him and found one bad shilling on him. The good money that I gave him was not found; he had an opportunity of giving them to the other man.</p>

            . I am a constable, I was near the place, and heard the alarm; I stopped the prisoner and told him I thought he was a thief - He tried to get away; the prosecutor charged him with passing bad money; the prisoner said he did not know they were bad. I asked if he had any more - He said he had not. I found six counterfeit shillings on him, in four separate pockets, and 6s. and 12d. good; the bad money was quite new; he said it was given to him in change for a half sovereign-he afterwards said, he sold two pair of pantaloons to a jew, who gave them to him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS THOMPSON. I am an officer. On the 7th of February, about half-past five o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner, Swan, waiting about in St. John-street, for a quarter of an hour - I watched him, and saw Wilkins come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180019"/>from Mr. Fish's shop - I knew he was a servant there. Swan joined his company immediately as he came out, he beckoned Wilkins down Parson's-court. I there saw Wilkins give him something, they immediately came from the court and repassed Mr. Fish's shop; I saw Swan had something bulky in his pocket, which he had not when he was waiting in the street; I followed them to the Bull in St. John-street, where they had a glass of something to drink. Wilkins said, I shall see you to night. Swan said, I will meet you there - They parted; I followed Swan up Charterhouse-lane, and asked what he had got there - He said, what was that to me. I said I insisted upon knowing what it was - He said, he would see me d-d first; with a great deal of persevance I got him to the watchhouse. I asked him to pull it out of his pocket; he said, he would not. I pulled one pound and a half of tobacco out, and told him I would fetch the man whom he had it from. I went to the shop and brought Wilkins to him.</p>

On the 17th of January, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my master's shop - I did not know him before. He asked for some Irish linen, which I shewed him; he had seven yards cut off, which came to 17s. 6d.; he then bought two pocket handkerchiefs, which came to 2s. 4d. - in all 19s. 10d. He gave me a 5l. note, which I took to Mr. Francis, who was sitting in the counting-house - I said nothing to the prisoner. Mr. Francis came out with me into the shop, and said to him, "Will you have the goodness to favour me with your address?" the prisoner said, "Mr. Balduck, Lisson Grove, Paddington." As the prisoner delivered the address, I saw Mr. Francis write it on the back of the note, I also marked it myself (looking at one)-this is it. The constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The prisoner was taken into custody at the time-there were two customers in the shop. Mr. Francis was standing at the counting-house desk, he was not handling any money. He never put the note out of his hands until he returned to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. ABRAHAM FRANCIS. I am a linen-draper, and live in High Holborn. On the 17th of January, Marchant brought me a 5l. note - I was in the counting-house. The moment I took hold of it I perceived it was forged - I had no other note in my hand. I immediately went towards the prisoner - I did not put it out of my hand. Marchant followed me; I had a pen in my hand. I asked the prisoner to favour me with his address; he said, "Balduck, Lisson-grove, Paddington." I immediately wrote it on the note, he saw me write it (looking at it)-this is the same note. I returned into the counting-house, Marchant followed me-the prisoner stood in the front shop, close by. I told Marchant to sent for a constable, who came in about a quarter of an hour after, and took the prisoner into cusa neighbour fetched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him respecting the note, after you had put his name on it - A. When my neighbour came in I said the note was forged, and I should sent for a constable-the prisoner heard it. I said he must give an account how he came possessed of it; he said he could very easily do that, if I would sent for Mr. Humphreys, of Staples Inn, who was his solicitor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he spoke of Mr. Humphreys as living in Staples Inn - A. Yes. I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180020"/>send for him. When Marchant brought me the note I had no other bank notes upon the desk, or about me. I never parted with the note till I wrote his name on it. I was behind the counter in the shop, the prisoner was about eight yards from the door; I did not put him under confinement. I came round the counter, and stood with a friend, who came in with my neighbour, between the prisoner and the door. He made no attempt to get away.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you wrote on the note, what did you ask him - A. I asked him for his name and address. He did not say he took it of Balduck-it was on a Saturday night. I kept the note in my possession until Monday, in my pocket, separate from any others.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How many persons stood between him and the door - A. Two, and the inner door was shut; he could not escape.</p>
               <p>JOHN BALDUCK. I am a baker, and live at Lisson-grove, Paddington. I know the prisoner - I do not know whether he knew me. I once bought 12s. worth of biscuits of him. I never gave him a 5l. note, or gave him one to pay away for me. I never authorized him to use my name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does much money go through your hands in the course of a month - A. I pay for ten or twenty sacks of flour at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see the prisoner in December last - A. I believe I met him in Holborn. He never was at my house, except at the time I bought the biscuits of him, which is above a year ago; I then paid him in halfpence. I believe we always pay for biscuits in halfpence. I will swear that I did not pay him a bank note.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Look at the note-was it ever in your possession - A. Never. I always put my name on them when I take them.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BALDUCK. I am the last witness's brother. I keep the Nightingale, public-house, at Lisson-grove, Paddington. I have known the prisoner six or seven years - He knew where I lived. I never gave him a 5l. note to my knowledge. I have dealt with him when I kept my brother's shop, which is above two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any dealings with him since the 4th of August, 1817 - A. Not any. No bank notes have passed from me to him since that period. I never authorized him to put off any notes in my name (looking at the note)-it has never been in my possession. I always indorse the notes as soon as I take them, just under the amount. I am well acquainted with the inhabitants of Lisson-grove, and am sure there is no other person of the name, except my brother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are the streets about Lissongrove described as such a place, by Lisson-grove - A. Very likely; it is a large neighbourhood. I have lived there ten years, and am certain there are no other persons of that name there. I will not swear there is no such person in the neighbourhood. It may have happened that I have omitted to indorse a note - I am in the habit of indorsing them. I never knew any harm of the prisoner - He was once a respectable master baker.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Have you known him lately - A. I have not seen him since the 6th of April, 1816. I have taken no note of him since the 4th of August, 1817.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM EVERETT POOLE. I am a grocer, and live at No. 18, Golden-lane, Barbican. I know the prisoner. On the 5th or 6th of January he came to my shop, and bought two ounces of tea and a pound of sugar - I served him. He gave me a 1l. note (looking at one)-this is it. I gave him pen and ink, and asked him to write his address. I saw him write it on the back of the note (reads it)-"John North, Warwick-place, Whitecross-street." I put my initials under it, and can swear it is the note I received of him. I gave him 18s. 3d. in change. I have inquired at Warwick-place, and can find no such person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. His being a stranger made me ask him to write his name and address himself. He was sometime in the shop - I noticed him particularly - I am positive he is the man. It was on a Monday morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock; he had blue pantaloons and a plum-coloured coat on. I am positive he is the man.</p>

In December last he came to Eaton's about three weeks or a fortnight before Christmas, and gave me a 1l. note, to get half a pint of gin at Mr. Smith's; I took the note there, and paid it to Mr. Smith, who put Ward's name on it in my presence. I told him his name and address. I returned, and gave him the change (looks at one)-this is it-it has Mr. Smith's mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know that he slept at Leigh-street. He was porter to a person of the name of Good-luck, in Leigh-street - I believe he lived there.

            . My husband keeps the Elephant and Castle, in Great Peter-street, Westminster. I have known the prisoner eight years. On Sunday, the 28th of December, at half-past ten o'clock at night, he came to me with Mrs. Skelton. He asked for half a pint of brandy, which came to 2s. 6d.; he asked me to give him change for a 1l. note, which I did, knowing him. When he gave it me I told him it was broken; he said it was broken or torn, I do not know which, but it was all right enough, and that he had taken it at Clapham, in change for a 2l. note, at a public-house. I gave him 17s. 6d.; he drank the brandy, and went away. I observed the name of "Manning, Clif<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180021"/>ford's or Clement's Inn," on it, I do not know which (looks at one)-this is it. Edwards was with me at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear that is the note - A. Yes; it is broken at the left-hand corner, "Manning, Clement's Inn," is on it. I swear to it from both these circumstances. I noticed it as I put it into the till. I cannot be mistaken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. I keep a chandler's shop. I was at Winter's, public-house, on the 28th of December, and saw the prisoner there that night. He gave Winter a 1l. note, she said it was torn, but she had no doubt that it was good, as the number was on it. I believe the prisoner said it was a good one.</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes. I look at the 5l. note-it is forged in every respect, and so are the three 1l. notes; they are off the same plate. I should consider the signatures of them and the 5l. note to have been executed by the same person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The name are different.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM FRANCIS. I knew the note to be forged, and took it to Mr. Milton, at the Bank. I did not present it for payment.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read, No. 15,077, August 4th, 1817, 5l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have not passed more than one note for these nine months, except what I received from my master, who is now under examination for the same offence. He told me to give that name and address.</p>
               <p>MARY WINTER re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Have you not said you took the note of Randall - A. I did not have it in my hand. When it was brought back to me I said I thought I took it of Randall. I took it out of a gentleman's hand, and said I took it of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you first said you took it of Randall - A. No; when I took it in my hand I knew it to be the note I received from the prisoner. I did not look at the indorsement till after I took it to Randall. I told Beech so.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BEECH. The account Mrs. Winter has given is not quite correct. She said positively she took it of Randall in change for a 10l. note, and that this note must be one of them. She had it in her hand more than a minute before she said so, and persisted in saying so all the time. I was with her about five minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Was any thing said about Manning, of Clifford's Inn, being on it - A. No.</p>
               <p>JURY to MRS. WINTER. After you said you took it of Randall, you observed the name of Manning on it, which brought to your recollection that you took it of the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>

On the 2d of February the prisoner came to my lodgings, and left at eleven o'clock in the morning - I knew him before. I asked him to dine with me at one o'clock, he said he would. I told him I should be at home exactly at one o'clock, and shewed him where I would leave the key of my room, for him to let himself in if he came before me. He said he would return at one. I told him to get over the wall, and come to the back door, which was open, and he would find the key at my door. I returned at one o'clock, found my doors burst wide open, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. I got an officer, and we found the prisoner in Clare-market - He denied it.</p>

I saw him come out again, about three-quarters of an hour after, in a great hurry - He went towards Clare-market. I went with the prosecutrix to Clare-market-the prisoner ran up against us. He said, "Now, Mrs. Blower, I suppose you suspect me of this robbery." The officer said, "What robbery?" the prisoner said he had been to Queen-square, and had heard of it. The officer took him.</p>

               <p>RICHARD SMITHERS. I am a constable, and went with the two witnesses; as we were standing at the corner of Clare-market, the prisoner ran against us. He said, "Mrs. Blower, I suppose you suspect me of this robbery." No person had said any thing about it. He said he heard of it at Queen-square. I got his box from his lodgings in Brook-street. The prisoner asked for two handkerchiefs out of it - He said the box was his; it contained some duplicates, one of which related to the scarf pledged with Hedges, and a purse.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WHALEY. I generally live in Ireland. On the 10th of January I lived at Mrs. Eulielia O'Hara's house - She is a widow; the house is in the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. I took the prisoner into my service out of compassion, and employed him to brush my clothes; when I go bed I always empty my pockets, and leave my clothes for my servant to brush in the morning, the prisoner had access to my room in the morning. I missed four 10l. Irish bank notes, with my name, "

            , Prince of Wales Hotel, Sackville-street;" on them. I also missed a 1l. Bank of England note. In consequence of suspicion that fell on the prisoner, I got a search-warrant, and Stone went with me to execute it at the prisoner's lodgings: we found him there in bed, apparently asleep, about eight o'clock in the morning. Stone locked the door and told the prisoner what we came for - He found an antique ring, which I had worn for thirty years, in a box near his bed. He took up a coat which the prisoner said was his, after examining it, he expressed his surprise at not finding a pocket in it, and threw it on the bed; I asked the prisoner if there was no pocket in it, he said there was not; on lifting it up I found a small side-pocket-Stone took it and found a brooch which belonged to me. He then examined the room, and took down two very large chests and a trunk, which stood before the fire-place. He searched the grate, which was full of old hats and shoes, under them he found three of my Irish notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not missed the ring or the brooch, they were taken from my shaving-case - I had not seen them for a month before. The prisoner and I never had any dispute.</p>
               <p>JAMES STONE. I am a constable of St. Ann's, Westminster. On the 17th of January I went with Mr. Whaley to execute the warrant; on going into the prisoner's lodgings we found him in bed, I told him what I came for, and searched a box by his bed-side - He said the things in it were his, but the box was not. I found the ring and a pocket-handkerchief, at the bottom of it. I then asked him whose coat that was that laid on the chair, he said it was his; I examined it but could find no pocket in it - He said there was none; Mr. Whaley took it up, found a small pocket at the side, I took it, and found a brooch at the bottom of it. There were two chests and a trunk on the top of them, which stood before the fire-place, and hid it; I moved them, and got to the fire-place, which was full of old hats and shoes; I pulled them out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180024"/>and nearly at the bottom I found three 10l. Irish bank notes, rolled together. I produce them.</p>
               <p>MR. WHALEY. They are my notes. I lost the brooch, ring, and handkerchief all out of my shaving-case. The ring is worth thirty guineas; they are mine.</p>

They ran down Rose and Crown-lane - I followed; they turned into another lane; I waited at the corner. I heard one of them throw something away - I went to the Rose and Crown, in King-street, and heard two men coming behind me, in the same direction as the two men; they came out of the same lane, on the left-hand side.

On the 9th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, a pane of glass was broken in my window, by an intoxicated man. I put a board to it, and some paper, and other things, to keep it up; it could not be moved without pushing them away. About nine o'clock, a boy came from the hole, and told me I had been robbed. I went out, and observed the board had been pushed away, and missed the articles stated in the indictment, out of my window. There were two panes of glass, from which a man by putting in his hand, could reach them; they were worth 3l.3s. The officer brought me the paper next morning, which has my name on it. The boy said, he had not seen any one do it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FURZEMAN. I am a constable of St Giles's. On the 10th of February, I was at the corner of Short's-gardens, Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner and two others come running up Short's-gardens; it was about ten minutes before one o'clock in the morning. The prisoner had a bundle wrapped up in a blue apron; I followed him to the Black-dog; there, as he was running in, I secured him, and asked, what he had there; he said, "Paper." I asked where he got it; he said, he bought it of a strange man in the street, for 16s. I told him he must go with me; he resisted a little; he then said he would go if I would not choak him-the other two ran away. I took him to the watch-house, and found a latch-key on him. Mr. Brooks's name being on the paper, I took it there; he claimed it. I produce it.</p>
               <p>MR. BROOKS. This is mine; I remember the prisoner coming to my shop, about a week before; he asked the way to some street. I missed all the things at the same time - I saw them safe at seven o'clock in the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a man in Holborn, who said he found it, and sold it to me.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SWIFT. I am a boot-maker, and live in St. Clements-lane; the prisoner is my apprentice. On the 26th of January, I marked three 1l. bank-notes, put them in my pocket-book, which I put on a drawer in my frontparlour, between twelve and one o'clock; it was not locked. Next day I missed the pocket-book, and money, I sent for the constable, who searched the prisoner's box, He told the prisoner to unlock it, which he did; the constable found the pocket-book, two 1l. notes, a half-crown, and some receipts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I never said I believed the prisoner did not rob me. There are two other persons lodge in the prisoner's room-my brother and another. My brother is in the country; he did not ask my wife to lend him the money. I do not know where my brother is. I was never distressed for money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some duplicates in the pocket-book - A. Yes, my wife had pledged the things; she had taken some of them out of the pocket-book; my brother was present at the time-the prisoner was not.</p>

I employed the prisoner, Dovey, as a painter there; he brought Mascall over to me that day, as a very honest man-to succeed some men who had robbed me before; he was to come to work the next day, as a plumber.

I left forty-eight squares of glass in the house, and went to work several doors off. I was informed they were stolen about five o'clock; I went there and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180026"/>counted them-there were only fifteen left. I and the foreman, went and found Dovey, quite drunk, at a public-house at six o'clock. I did not take him that night, thinking he would come to work next morning-but he did not. I and Morrison, went with Sutton to the public-house, and found him in charge. I had not hired either of them to take it away-nobody had any business in the house.</p>
               <p>JOHN WILKINS. I am a Bow-street officer. Sutton sent for me to take Dovey into custody; I took him to Bow-street. On the 4th of February, I took Mascall, and asked him, what he had done with the glass, he took from Mr. Sutton's premises with Dovey, he said, it was at his own shop, and that he gave 10s. for it. I took him to Bow-street, went to his house in Crawford-street, Marylebone, and found the frail, and thirteen panes of glass.</p>

I told him I did not know Fitch; he said, he was an old established hay-salesman, in the market; and said, Fitch made use of my name, and knew me. I consented to it. Trevillian brought it about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon. About a quarter of an hour after, the prisoner came, and said, "Is it come." I said, "Yes; it is in the yard,"-where it laid. It was directed to Mr. Giles, Abercorn Arms, Stanmore. He came into the house, and had something to drink, and said he was waiting for Fitch's cart; it did not come. He said, he would go down the Hay-market, to look for it; he went out, and returned, saying, he did not know what he should do, as he was disappointed in his cart. He said he had seen Mr. Fitch, and that the cart was gone. I told him, he must move the wine, as the permit would expire; he said, "By all means; I must have it home to night, for we have a party on Monday." I asked him who kept the Abercorn Arms; he said, Giles, who was his brother. He got a hackney-coach, and took the wine away.</p>

On the 6th of January, which was Twelfth Day, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, bought a 10s. 6d. twelfth-cake, and offered me a 5l. note. I asked her what address I was to put on it? she gave me the name of "Moore, No. 29, Bury-street, St. James's." I told her I knew a person of the name of Moore, at No. 5, and asked her if she had not made a mistake? she said, No; she lived at No. 29, Bury-street, and repeated the name and number several times over. I gave her the change, and offered to send the cake home - She said she would take it herself (looking at a note)-this is the note. I have known a person of the name of Richardson to have lived at No. 29, Bury-street, for the last twelve years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. ANDREWS. It was a busy day. I only took one 5l. note on that day - I had other 5l. notes in the house. All the notes I take in a day are put into the till, and then into a bag - They are afterwards put with other notes. I know this to be the note by my own handwriting. I have looked over all my other notes, and will swear this is the one she gave me. She said Bury-street, St. James's. I asked her if it was St. James's? she said, yes. I have not been to No. 29 since I received it. There were no other customers in the shop - She was there about ten minutes; I swear she is the woman. I saw her again on the 26th or 27th of January, and knew her immediately I saw her.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Had you never taken any 5l. note with "No. 29, Bury-street, St. James's," on it - A. None. I am positive she is the person.</p>

            . I am a confectioner, and live at No. 6, Titchfield-street. On Twelfth Day, in the afternoon, the prisoner bought a half-guinea twelfth-cake at my shop. I served her; she tendered me a 5l. bank note to pay for it, for which I gave her change. Before I gave her change, I asked her to favour me with her address - She gave me the name of "Wise, No. 11, Golden-square," which I immediately wrote on the note, in her presence (looking at a note)-this is the note she gave me. I have since seen part of the twelfth-cake. I have made inquiry at No. 11, Golden-square, and found no such person lived there, but a Mr. Austin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. No. 11, Golden-square, is a shop. I had no suspicion of the prisoner. I put the note with others, but know it to be the same by the name and address The prisoner was in the shop five or ten minutes. I had never seen her before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS AUSTIN. I live at No. 11, Golden-square. I lived there on the 6th of January. No person of the name of Wise lived there at any time whatever. I do not know the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear she is the person so long ago - A. I am sure of it from her features and manner.

               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. When did you go to London Wall - A. The day after the note was returned from the Bank, which was a fortnight after I took it of her, I believe. I made inquiry at London Wall, and that circumstance brought to my recollection the receiving of the note.</p>

            . I am the wife of Francis Pratt. I was in the back room, about half-past eight o'clock-there was a knock at the door, I opened it-the prisoner stood about a yard off. I asked him if he knocked at my door? he said, No. I shut it, and heard nothing more till about nine o'clock, I then heard a piece of glass fall, and called my husband down. I had seen the window at eight o'clock-every thing was safe then; there was no glass broken before my husband went out. We missed five pair and an odd shoe (all new) from the window, close by where the glass was broken; they were under it. There was room enough for a person to put his hand in and reach them out.</p>

She went back again, and returned with a bundle, which had halfpence in it. I chinked it, and said, there was copper in it. She said she was going to pay the baker, and asked if my son was ready?

I saw the prisoner, Ready, come up first, and observed his hands in his pocket - He had a loose coat on. He came into the street, went to the corner of Berkeley-street, stopped there, and looked over the corner of the railing towards the house. In about a minute, or a minute and a half, I saw Gossip come out of the area, and go up to him-his hands were also in his pocket-he had the same kind of coat on. I went over to Mr. Bullock's, went down the area-steps, and met Johnson, the butler, and told him. I lost sight of them. We both went in pursuit of the prisoners, and overtook Ready at the corner of Duke-street, Oxford-street, which is between a quarter and half a mile off. I had seen Gossip run down Somerset-street with him. While we were pursuing, they parted - I overtook Ready, and took him to the watch-house. As we went along, I saw him drop eight table-spoons - I heard them fall close to him - They were silver; Johnson picked up seven of them. I saw Ready searched at the watch-house, and eighteen silver forks, and two gravy-spoons found on him. I also saw twelve silver desert-spoons, and twelve silver forks found on Gossip- they said nothing.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BAKER. I am bailiff to William English, who lives at Edmonton, and has a farm at Rumford, Essex; the sheep were there under my care - I live there. On the 15th of February he had twenty sheep in a field about 200 yards from my house - I penned them all in with a hurdle that night-the field is also enclosed with a hedge and gate; I saw them all safe within hurdles at two o'clock that morning, and missed them about seven the next evening, which was Sunday, the 16th. I found the hurdle open for about two yards. I traced them, by their foot-marks, through two fields belonging to Mr. Hawes-it appeared as if straw had been shook over the foot-marks to hide them. I traced them into a bye-road which leads to London, got a horse, and came to Smithfield, where I heard my sheep were stopped at Hackney; I immediately went there, and found nineteen of them, and the other at Worship-street, where the prisoner was in custody; I knew it to be one of them, it was marked D on the left hip-those at Hackney were also marked so, and two of them had a stripe down the back beside. I have known the prisoner ever since last summer. I saw him in the same field; he is a labourer, and lives at Chattle, within a mile of Rumford.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY READING. I am patrol of Hackney. On the 16th of February, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I was at Lee Bridge turnpike, and saw the prisoner drive sheep up to the gate, the tollman asked how many he had, he said a score; the man demanded 10d.; after a little while he said he had only sixpence; the man said he could not let him through; he then said he had left his master at four o'clock, and he said he would pay the toll, and that his master would pay the four-pence. He appeared in a great hurry and agitated, which made me suspect the sheep were stolen. I followed him over Lee Bridge, which is in Middlesex; he drove them very hard. I asked him where he was going with the sheep, he said, to Smithfield? I asked him where his master was, he said he did not know. I then asked him where he came from, but he would not answer me, and I collared him. In about a quarter of an hour he said he came from Chigwell. I asked him at what time he left there? he said at twelve o'clock. I asked him if he took them out of a pen or a field? he said, out of a field, and that a gentleman and a butcher were with him when he took them. I asked him if he should know them again? he said, no. I took him to Hackney, and gave both him and the sheep in charge to Garva.</p>

            . Reading and Reader gave the sheep and the prisoner into my charge; I asked him where he brought them from - He said, from the Chigwell road; that he met a man on Sunday afternoon, who employed him to take them to Smithfield for eight pence. I asked at what time he brought them from there? he said at twelve o'clock at night. I asked him if he was waiting at any public-house until that time? he said his master and him waited in a lane, and that he did not know who his master was, for he never saw him before, but that he was dressed in a pepper-and-saltcoat. Baker saw the sheep in my possession. I found a knife on the prisoner, and some rope yarn, with which the hurdles had been tied.</p>

On the 20th of January, about one o'clock in the morning, I found it close to the outer gate, in a sack-it was taken from a quantity which had been ground-there was a man close to it; as soon as he saw me he ran farther into the yard.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Gulston, who keeps a public-house at the corner of the brewery; the prisoner came up to my room door, I called to know who was there - He said, "Hold your noise; for God's sake let me out - I am done for." He said he had been to the privy, fell asleep, and awoke and wanted to be let out. The men came and took him. <rs id="t18180218-75-verdict397" type="verdictDescription">

I saw the prisoner shove him against two other gentlemen; he immediately after went under the hackney coaches; I followed and overtook him in Russell-street. I wanted to search him, he resisted, and I threw him down. I found the watch, with the fob; he said, he found it at the Theatre. I advertised it-Mr-Bury claimed it.</p>

            's Hotel, in St. James's-street. On the 10th of February, the property was on view, for sale by auction; the prisoner came into the room - I went out; when I returned, I missed the five chimney ornaments off the mantlepiece. I met him coming out of the room, and followed him down the back-staircase, into a dark cellar; when he came out, I collared him until a light was brought, and found the ornaments, broken, in the cellar. I gave him in charge. They were safe when I left the room.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of January, about six o'clock, I saw the prisoner, in company with two more, in the Haymarket, attempting several gentlemens' pockets, as they passed. I followed them into Piccadilly; he went about half-way up, and returned, following a gentleman; the other two covered him, while the prisoner took the handkerchief out of his pocket. I was on the opposite side of the road, the prisoner crossed, I laid hold of him; he threw it down. Forbes ran after the gentleman.</p>

When I returned to the counting-house, it dropped from behind the prisoner. I called Mr. Mills down, who asked what his business was, he gave two or three different names; Mr. Mills sent me for a constable. The prisoner said his name was

On the 12th of February, I lost my pig out of the sty, in the night; about seven o'clock in the morning, I traced the blood from my premises, up to the prisoners door, about fifteen yards off-the door was shut. I asked his wife where he was. I got a search-warrant, and found my pig concealed under his floor, in the cloth-it weighed eight stone, the head was cut off. I am sure it is mine; the floor takes up, and there is a hole to put things in.</p>

            's, No. 126, Drury-lane. I took a receipt, and was to bring the money back for it. I took it to town-the prisoners overtook me in Drury-lane, before I got to No. 126 - I had seen them at the farm when they bought it. They asked me to stop a few minutes, as they were taking a cup of coffee - They asked me to have something to drink, and I went into a public-house with them, and we drank together. Bontein asked me if I had the receipt for the hay? I said I had. He asked me for it, and I gave it to him - He gave me a sealed letter. I asked him if that was the money? he said, "Give it to your mistress, it is all right." They told me to wait a few minutes - I waited outside the door. They came out and said I was to go with them down the street; I went some distance. Bontein delivered the hay to Crafer, who put it in the loft of the Peacock-yard, Clare-market. I never opened the letter. I thought the prisoners were brothers. I supposed the letter contained the money, or I should not have let them have the hay. Next day I went back, but could not see any of it. Walbank took me, and shewed me some of it. (Looks at a letter)-this is the letter he gave me (read)-</p>

            . I am a potatoe-merchant, and live in Clement's Inn-passage, Clare-market. On the 9th of January, about one o'clock, the prisoners came to me. I knew them before-Crafer is a butcher in Clare-market.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180035"/>They said they had a load of hay to sell, and asked 5l. for it - I told them I thought it far too much, as I never gave above 4l. I went to the Peacock-yard, saw it, and offered them 4l. for it-they said they could not take it; Crafer said I should have it. I gave them 3l. 15s. for it. They were together at the time. Crafer shewed me a receipt; he said he shewed it to me to convince me that he had given 5l. for it, but it was not so good as he had bought it for. Bontein read the receipt to me, it was for 5l. - he said it came from Action. This was after I paid the money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I entered it in my books.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY, on behalf of the prisoners, contended, that this was not a larceny; that the possession of the hay was parted with, and the witness (Mrs. Medley) had entered it in her book, and that it was only a fraud.</p>
               <p>MESSRS. CURWOOD, ANDREWS, and ARARIN argued, that from the beginning to end it appeared that it was the prisoners' intent to defrand the prosecutor, and that the possession was never parted with.</p>

I had patched a piece of glass over the hole - I saw it safe when I put the lamp in the window. I put a box before it, which hid the hole-it stood against the window; it had been there for a week. Noon came in, and asked me if I had lost any thing? I told him I missed a pair of shoes. He said, if I would come with him, he would shew me who had them. He took me to the other end of the street, on the other side of the way, where the prisoner, another person, and a child were standing-he told me that was the party. I took hold of the prisoner - He took off his hat; one shoe fell down the area, and the other on the pavement, out of his hat. They were safe when I put the lamp in the window.</p>

One of the boys stopped at the window, and put his hand against the glass; he went on, and met the prisoner and the other boy. They returned, took a piece of glass out of the window, threw it down, and took something out - He ran and met the prisoner and the other boy. I followed them up the street, and saw them station themselves on the other side of the way. I ran to the prosecutor, and took him with me; we met them. He took the prisoner, who took off his hat, and asked us what we wanted with him? He placed his hat over the area-one of the shoes dropped down the area, and the other on the pavement. The boy broke the glass so suddenly, that I did not know whether it was loose or not. The prisoner could not see him break the window.</p>

On the 19th of February, about three o'clock in the afternoon, my master was in the counting-house, behind the shop - I was writing at the counter. All at once, I heard a person step lightly out of the shop very quick - I immediately ran out - I saw somebody come in or go out; the print was in the window; he must have reached a great way to get it - He could not get it over the rail outside; the shawls hung by the door, which prevented my seeing him. I saw the prisoner running with a large bundle on his arm. I pursued him about a hundred yards caught hold of him round the neck, and asked him what he had got there? He took it from under his coat, threw it in the gutter, and said, "There, take it." He slipped from me, but I took him again-another person picked up the print. My master was in the counting-house; there is a window in it, which looks into the shop.</p>

The outer door was open; I tried the latch of the left-hand parlour door, on the ground floor, and found it open. The first thing I saw, was the hair trunk under the bed; I told Foy, it was mine - I unlocked it, and found every thing safe, as it was when I left it in my room.

I had not taken him twenty yards from where I missed it; nobody had passed the place but him-it is impossible any body but him, could have taken it - I had felt it safe as I crossed Brownlow-street - I felt him take it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SLAUGHTER. I am a tailor. On the 11th of February I was coming up Red Lion-passage, and crossed the street, opposite Mr. Wilsdon's shop, and saw a man in the door-way throw something out to the prisoner, who was on the pavement; the prisoner caught it - They both joined and walked together on the opposite side of the way. I saw the prisoner had a large piece of bacon in his hand; I followed them down Bedford-row - They parted - I stopped the prisoner, and asked him where he got the bacon? he said the man whom I saw at the shop asked him to carry it for him, as he had bought it. I told him I thought it was stolen; he said he would go back to the shop with me. When we got to the step of the door he ran off, and threw the bacon away. I secured him and brought him back.</p>

On the 31st of January, I went out without my master's leave, and slept with a friend at the Collonade, Russell-square. I got up at four o'clock in the morning, and went home but could not get in; I walked about the street, and met the prisoner in <placeName id="t18180218-107-crimeloc566">Piccadilly</placeName>

I gave her in charge. The notes were never found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you not drunk - A. No; I walked about ten minutes with her. I first met her in Golden-square.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COOK. I am a constable. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house - She denied the robbery. At the office she asked after a man, who, she said, was going to give change for one of the notes; she said," he is not going to do me, if I have done the other." A man brought her ten shillings, and said, there is your change.</p>
               <p>OWEN DORKIN. I am the watch-house-keeper. The morning being cold, I let the prisoner, and another woman, come to the fire; the prisoner asked me if I would split? I asked what she meant; she said if I would go and get change for a 1l. note, she would give me five shillings, and asked if I would tell. I said I would not. She went down to the cell, and brought me up a 1l. note. I returned it to her, and said I would have nothing to do with it. The man who got the note changed for her was present - She gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked him to change the note for another person.</p>

I put the twenty-seven loaves in the middle of the waggon. I left town about three o'clock in the afternoon. I had every thing safe at Hoddesdon, in Hertfordshire, at half-past ten o'clock at night. I left that place at one o'clock, got to Sapswell about five o'clock in the morning, and missed ten loaves of sugar and the box. The prisoner, Aggus, formerly drove this waggon - He came into the Catherine-wheel yard on that day, and asked me to send him some things from the country.</p>

            . I am an officer. I and Gleed were at Bethnal-green. I saw a tilted cart-nothing was in it. We went to Webb-square, to a house kept by Parker. We met the prisoner, Thorpe, coming down stairs<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180041"/>with something under his arm, within two stairs of the door. I told him to go up, as we were officers, which he did. I took him into the garret, where I found Wheeler and Cresswell. I saw four loaves of sugar in this room, on a dresser. I found four more in a basket, and a great number of things strewed about the floor. I left him with Gleed, and went into the one-pair room kept by Dunkley, and met Aggus coming out of her room. I took him to Gleed, returned, went into the bed-room, and found the window open. I went into the cellar, which was under the window, and found a bundle-the cellar-flap was up. The bundle contained a pair of breeches and a waistcoat - We took the prisoners to the office - I took the women there also. I found a pistol with the sugars. I advertised the goods.</p>

He went down, came up again in about twenty minutes, and asked for him again. Cresswell said she did not know where he was. He came up again in a few minutes, and threw down a large hamper, a handkerchief hung out of it. He brought up one or two more hampers. In a few minutes he came up again with Thorpe-both of them were carrying a large sack - I looked at them. One of them said, "Mind your washing." The officers immediately came in.</p>

He went down, returned in half an hour, and asked again for Parker. He returned in a few minutes with a hamper. He went down twice, and brought up a hamper each time-then Thorpe and him brought up a sack, which they put into a room. Aggus afterwards brought up a portmanteau. We were all taken to the office.</p>

On the 9th of January, the prisoner, Aggus, came into my room, with a bundle under his arm - He was a stranger to me. I asked him who he wanted? he told me to hold my tongue. I heard footsteps on the stairs - He gave me no answer. He heard the footsteps, ran into my bed-room, and threw the bundle on the other side of the bed. I told him I would have nothing left there. He said, "If you will not let me leave it, throw it out of the window." I gave it to him, and he threw it into the cellar. I pushed him out of the backroom-Armstrong was at the door, and took him - I shewed him where the bundle was dropped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The window was open. Parker lives in the room where the sugar was found.</p>

            . I live at Sudbury. On the 9th of January, about seven o'clock in the morning, I was driving my master's team, on the Harrow-road, to London; the prisoner asked me to let him ride to London - He had a bag. As he got in, a fowl fell out of it - He jumped out, pulled his coat off, and threw it over it, to prevent my seeing it-it was dead. Timlake came up, and asked me what the prisoner had? he said he had some fowls, rooks, and water-cresses. Timlake said it was a rum time of the year for rooks. He then dropped the bag, and ran away, leaving it behind him - We could not stop him; we divided them between us. I gave my master a turkey, which he sent to the prosecutor.</p>

I asked him if he was not ashamed of himself for stealing the malt? he said he was not. I walked to Newington with him-he then asked me to have some drink, I refused. I informed Messrs.

            . I am a Bow-street officer. On the 30th of January, about a quarter after six o'clock at night, I met the prisoner, in the Lower-road, Islington, he was coming from towards Newington-green, with a bag on his shoulder, I stopped him, and asked what was in the bag; he said, it was an iron chain, and threw it down; he said, he bought it of a man at Stamford-hill, for 7s.; he said, he did not know the man. I found the bag contained chain; I took him to the office - He begged for mercy; he then said, he got it from Newington-green, off the posts, with a stick; I took the chain there and fitted it in the posts,</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES. I was with Upton; he has spoken correctly; I found an iron-crow on the spot where the prisoner was stopped.</p>

               <p>JOHN FRENCH. I am a watchman of Crown-street, which is about a quarter of a mile from George-street. On the 17th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw a man come out of Lloyd's-court, into Crown-street, with something on his head, covered with matting, and corded. Kelly, who was with me, asked him what he had there? he said, they were coppers, and went on. I stopped him, and asked where he was going with them; he said, to Mr. Pontifex, in Shoe-lane, who was his master; he had one large, and one small copper. I told him that was not the way, and he must go to the watch-house; as we were taking him there, he threw them on me, in Bowlyard, knocked me down, and made his escape; I took him about ten days after; I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>

            . I live in Artillery-passage, Bishopsgate-street, in the county of Middlesex. On Sunday, the 9th of February, the prisoner came to my private door about nine o'clock, and brought me a piece of broken glass, he asked me if I would buy any, for he had some to sell. I said I did not want them.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SIMONDS. On the 8th of February the prisoner came to my shop, about ten o'clock at night, at Ravenrow, Spitalfields, and asked if I wanted to buy any broken glass - He asked me a guinea a cwt.; he said they were very stout pieces, and that he sold them for chandelier drops. I told him I would give 1l. a cwt.; he said as he wished to get rid of it I should have it. I told him to bring it immediately - He and another man brought it in two baskets. I told him I could not conveniently weigh it then; he said he had weighed forty of them, and they weighed ten pounds; and he calculated that the whole would weigh two hundred and a half. I gave him 2l. on account until I could weigh it, and told him to call next morning for the rest. Next day he came I told him there was a great many small pieces, and I would only give him five shillings more - He took it. About a week or ten days after I was apprehended myself, when I gave this account. I never saw him again until he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. They charged me with stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been charged here as a receiver of stolen goods - A. No.</p>
               <p>JUDITH SIMONDS. I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner is the man that brought the glass, and received the money. I afterwards met the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, and told him the glass was not weight, and asked him to go to Mr. Mosely's where he would see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181802180047"/>it weighed. I told him that to get him apprehended. He said he did not like to be seen, as there was a reward of 5l. offered. He said he could not stop.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ATTFIELD. On the 17th of February I apprehended the prisoner at the Jolly Weavers, public-house, Angel-alley, Long-alley, where the glass was found. I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing glass; he said he knew nothing about it, and would not go with me. He was in the skittle ground, surrounded by twenty persons, whom I knew to be common thieves - They rushed on me and rescued him; they had called to him to know what the charge was for. He was taken that day.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the 9th of February, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going by the prosecutor's shop, and saw the prisoner, and three or four more lads lurking about the shop, I heard one of them whistle, I crossed over and saw the prisoner and another boy go up to the door, he stooped under the window and ran away - A girl came and bolted the door; in a minute after two or three customers went into the shop, and while they were being served the door was left open, the prisoner immediately followed in behind one of the customers, and snatched the muff from the window, and handed it to a companion, both went away together. I pursued, and took one of them in Brick-lane, with the muff - He is now ill. I took the prisoner at twelve o'clock at night in Wood's-place, Chequer-alley.</p>

On the 29th of January, the prisoner came, and ordered some bars of iron at my shop for Mr. Herbert. He took eight bars with him, and afterwards had four more - He said he was to take them to Cavendish-square. On the 12th of February he had more. The foreman came to my shop, and I told him of it - He said, they never had the iron, nor did they want them.</p>

            . I am a lamplighter; on the 23rd of January, about a quarter after nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner run up Wimpole-street, to go towards my cann of oil - He had a cann in his hand - He turned round, saw me coming, and turned back; I secured him - He begged forgiveness, and asked me to let him go; his cann contained above five quarts of oil.</p>
