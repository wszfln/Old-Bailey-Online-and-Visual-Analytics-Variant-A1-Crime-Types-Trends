I kept forward and came into Dean-street, where one of the Prisoners (Bailey) came up to me, and gave me a Blow cross my Eyebrow, and cut it very much, that the Blood run down.

               <p>Salmon. That was one of the other: The young one, Swannick, he had his Hand in my Pocket, and took out my Money, which was one Guinea, and twenty Shillings in Silver. I cry'd out, Stop Thief, but nobody-was by.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light at this time ?</p>
               <p>Salmon. The Lamps were light, and I took particular Notice of him that struck me; for his Hand was full of Warts. Presently after a Gentleman comes by, I did not know him, and he ask'd me, What was the Matter ? I said I was abus'd and robb'd. He said, You are bloody, and he took his Handkerchief out to wipe my Eyes and bind my Head; and he then went home with me.</p>

               <p>Salmon.

               <p>Q. Who did you see then ?</p>
               <p>Salmon. We saw both the Prisoners at the Bar, but could not venture to take them, there was so many together.</p>

            . I know nothing of the Robbery, but I came by between eleven and twelve o'Clock, and the poor Man was crying out, Stop Thief. He said, he had been robb'd by four Fellows, but I saw nobody. He had a very great Blow, and was in a bloody Condition. I bound his Head with my Handkerchief, and went home with him. Some time afterwards we heard of Bailey being in Bride-well for another Robbery. He went to see him in Bridewell, but said then he could not be so positive, but he would go the next Day to see him; but he (i. e. Bailey the Prisoner ) was then turn'd out. On Thursday he came to me again, and he said, that in Chick-lane he saw the two Persons that robb'd him; and he ask'd me, what he should do? And I said, he had better go to Mr Body, for he knew them Gangs better than I. We went to Chick-lane, and he pitch'd upon them two as they were tossing up, but did not take them then. Would not venture, as there was so many of them. But on the Saturday afterwards Mr Body took them, and we went up before Justice Burdus, and he committed. them. They both deny'd the Fact before the Justice. As we were going with the two Prisoners to Newgate somebody calls out Hoy Jack, Where are you going ? And the Boy ( Swannick the Prisoner ) reply'd, He was going to the Start for Nimming a Call in his Eye. Then swore, he wish'd he had cut off his Head, then he would not have whidell'd again.</p>

            . I did not see the Prisoner come into the Shop, but as I was backward I lifted up my Head as I was in the Buck-shop, and I saw the Prisoner with this Piece of Check going out under his Arm. I never lost Sight of him only just the turning of the Corner, and I cry'd out, Stop Thief, and he was stopp'd. Whether it was by turning at the Corner, or in a Struggle he fell down, and the Chock fell from him. When I came up to him I took it by him: I did not see it fall from him, but I saw him go out with it.</p>

I was going from Ironmonger-lane to the Old Jewry, and I heard several People cry, Stop Thief, I met the Prisoner at the Bar with something in a brown Apron. Upon hearing the Cry of Stop Thief, I took hold of him; he endeavoured to get away upon which he fell down. He dropp'd the Chock; and when he was down he cry'd out, A Writ, a Writ. Upon that several People came up, and he was had away to the Compter; but he was like to make his Escape out of the Constable's Hands.</p>

On Monday Night between eleven and twelve o'Clock, Mr Prichard's Wife came to my House in a great Fright, and begged my assistance; she heard persons, as she thought, breaking into their House; I said I would load my Gun: She came again, and begged for God's Sake I would come, for she believed they were just ready to come in. When I came, I saw the Prisoner endeavouring to get away over the Fence. I told him, if he offered to go off I would shoot him. When he was getting over the Fence, I said, if he did not come down I would shoot him dead. So we took him, and had him to the Watch-house, where he said that there were others along with him. We went back again, with the Officers with us, to search for those other Persons, but have found none, but the Lead rolled up ready to carry away; the Lead was cut up in two Places: The Place where we heard the knocking, was of the Lead that came out of Mr Prichard's Bake-house; we examined the Place where we heard the hammering, there we found the Lead cut, and the Water dropping.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner had nothing to say in his own Defence.</p>

               <p>Kirk. She thought I did; and a Gentleman pickt up the Purse, and opened it, and counted the Money, and carried it to Mrs Kirk again.</p>

               <p>Q How came the Gentleman to take the Liberty of opening your Wife's Purse.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I suppose in a jocular way; I believe this was about four or five o'Clock, it was returned to my Wife, and she mist it in the Morning: As she was same, and not able to stir out of her Chair, the Prisoner was Servant in the House, and was very ready to wait upon my Wife: She was very bare of Clothes before, and in two or three Days she was very flush of Money, and bought herself abundance of Things, that gave us reason to suspect that she was guilty of the Robbery.</p>

            . Yes, I lost these eighteen Guineas last Saturday was a Fortnight. I thought my Spouse wanted Money, and I tost it to him out of a Window of a little Bar-Room: They were sitting at a Table in the Yard, and I throw'd it to him; so a Gentleman pickt it up, and told it, and there was eighteen Guineas; there was six and twenty, but I had laid out some; the Gentleman brought it to me, and I put it, as I thought, into my Pocket, or whether I might drop it I cannot say, or whether I might clap it under the Seat of the Chair, but there was no Body in the Room with me but that Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Bed, did you feel for your Purse?</p>
               <p>Kirk. No, my Lord. Whether I dropt it aside, or whether behind the Chair, or whether dropt down I can't tell: The next Morning I searcht for it, and ask'd the Gentlewoman of the House after it, but she said she knew nothing of it: This Girl was more than ordinary kind in waiting upon me, but I did not see her take it; but when she came to this Gentlewoman no body would have given her Six-pence for her two Shifts, and presently after she had plenty of Things, which gave me a great Suspicion of her.</p>

I lodged in this House for five Weeks, but never was in this Vault during the Time, till I ask'd that Gentlewoman's Leave on Sunday after the Child was found; and on this Thursday that was mentioned I was working for one Charmichael, picking of Hair, from nine o'Clock in the Morning till six at Night.</p>
               <p>When this Bill was presented to the Grand Jury, who, upon hearing the Affair, return'd it Ignoramus. And upon Examination of the Affair by judicious Persons in the Neighbourhood, the Charge upon the Prisoner appeared entirely without a Foundation, and arose from some poor, ignorant, and rash People, by whose Means this poor Creature was like to fall a Sacrifice to the Mob. It seems she has a Child now in the Workhouse, whom she suckled for two Years, and has given another Child suck since, which was the Occassion of her having Milk in her Breasts.</p>

I took such a Detestation to the Fellow, that I was resolved narrowly to watch him. At length I detected him standing watching two Gentlemen that were talking together; the Name of the one was

I made a loud Cry for the Watch, and he did to his Accomplices, and threatened to blow my Brains out if I did not let him go. When we were out of this Place, there was one of the Women in the Street, a masculine Creature, came up to him, and said, D - n you, why don't you seize and charge? Then, according to the Woman's Advice, he went to charge the Watchman with me, but I desired the Watchman to take care of him.

               <p>Q. Was it ever found again?</p>
               <p>Downs. The Field Keeper call'd and told my Wife he had heard of it, and that he had heard of it in St Giles's, that he heard one Mr Harman had such a Horse, and I went to Mr Harman to inquire whether he had such a Horse, and he said he had. From thence I went to Mr Hind's, and told him the Affair, and Mr Hind sent to his Collar-maker, and enquired what he had done with the Skin, and that was sent to Mr Cox's a Tanner in Southwark, there we found this Skin, the Skin of my Horse, which I believe I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the Skin of a dead Horse?</p>
               <p>Downs. Upon seeing the Skin, Harman offered to pay me for the Horse; coming over the Water he offered me 8 s.</p>
               <p>Court. Eight Shillings: You have laid the worth 8 l. Was this Skin of that dead Horse shewn you at the Request of Harman ?</p>
               <p>Downs. At the Request of Mr Hind and Harman.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know how the Gelding was lost ?</p>
               <p>Downs. No, not of my own Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination. Sir, I would ask you, when he went so readily with you to the Tanner's, and before the Justice, did not he tell you how he came by that Horse?</p>
               <p>Downs. Mr Green is a Dealer in Horses, and Harman calls himself a Flesh-boiler.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how Green came by him?</p>
               <p>Downs. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he tell you this was a stray Horse, and had the Glanders, and was turned out.</p>
               <p>Council. You have been valuing this Horse at 8 l. I would now ask you if this Horse, that you would not have taken 7 or 8 l. for, whether or no he was not a distemper'd Horse, was you not told by the Field-Keeper, that this Horse was turned out of the Field, because he should not infect others with the Glanders? And don't you know that this Horse stray'd up to Mr Green's House, and he gave him a Lock of Hay at his Door?</p>
               <p>Downs. I heard Mr Green say so, but none else.</p>
               <p>Q How far is Mr. Green's from this Place?</p>
               <p>Downs. Above a Mile.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask you, did you not declare before the Justice that Harman was guilty of no Offence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174709090010"/> at all? Did you not declare before Mr Johnson that sits here, that you believed Harman was an innocent Man, and guilty of nothing?

            . Can you recollect any thing of the last Witness's having a Horse at Grass in July last ?</p>
               <p>Lewis. On the 22d of July, Mr Downs came to enquire for his Horse; the Horse have been lately castrated. I look'd at the Horse if it were distemper'd; I found nothing was the matter with him. On the 22d of July, he came to enquire for his Horse; I told him it was in the Field; a Servant in my House went with his Man to look after it, and he told me it was not in the Grounds; so I called for the Field-Keeper to enquire, and he told me a Rail in the Bell-field was broke, there was none of Mr Downs's Horse to be found. On the 21st of July, I saw the Horse, and he gallop'd with the rest of the Horses, and I said that Downs's Horse comes on.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen his Skin? can you swear that to be the Skin of Downs's Horse?</p>
               <p>Lewis. The Skin is very much like it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examined by Council. Might not this Horse be infected with the Glanders without your knowing of it; an Horse don't always run at the Nose when it has the Glanders ?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No?</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say, that this Horse had not the Glanders?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I believe it had not.</p>

            . I am Field-Keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing of this Horse of Mr Downs's that came in the 12th of July, what Order was he in when he came?</p>
               <p>Ford. I can't say he was in exceeding good Order.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been at this Business?</p>
               <p>Ford. Three Quarters of a Year; but I had been but a Quarter of a Year in this Place.</p>
               <p>Q. Had this Horse the Glanders?</p>
               <p>Ford. Not to my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any Disorder in the Horse?</p>
               <p>Ford. He had got a Cold in his Head.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the Horse miss'd?</p>
               <p>Ford. I miss'd it the 21st of July. I went to enquire after it, and I heard of it at one Mr Green's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Green?</p>
               <p>Ford. I heard of it by the Neighbours. I did not see the Horse at Green's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where else to seek after him?</p>
               <p>Ford. I went to Harman's, and I ask'd him if he had bought such a Horse, and he told me that he had, that he had bought the Horse and paid for him; and I said, that was enough for me; I ask'd him if he had bought a black-brown Gelding, and he said he had bought such a one of one Green.</p>

               <p>Cross examined. Did you see Green at all?</p>
               <p>Ford. When he was taken, but had no Talk at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Value of the Horse when he was lost ?</p>
               <p>Ford. To the best of my Knowledge the Horse might be worth about 7 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You admitted that this Horse had got a great Cold. I would ask you whether this Horse did not run at the Nose ?</p>
               <p>Ford. He had run at the Nose, but he was got a great deal better.</p>
               <p>Council. Now when you had this Discourse with Harman, and he told you that he bought this Horse, did he not tell you that the Horse died of the Glanders?</p>
               <p>Ford. He told me that the Horse was dead, and if he had not died he would have killed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take notice what he was?</p>
               <p>Harley. He was running just as if he had got the Glanders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that to be Downs's Horse?</p>
               <p>Harley. I did not.</p>
               <p>- On the 23d of July I help'd Mr Green to grease and clout his Cart; after that I went down St Giles's and got a Dram, and coming back again he had this Horse tied to the Cart-Wheel, and Hay before him.</p>
               <p>Q What Condition was he in?</p>
               <p>- He ran at the Off-Nostril, and bled at the Near-Nostril. Both the Prisoners <rs id="t17470909-18-verdict79" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Did you observe Marks upon these Pieces?</p>
               <p>Boon. Yes, my Lord; about seven o'Clock I laid them in the Drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Reason of your putting in mark'd Money?</p>
               <p>Boon. Because we had a Suspicion that the Man had taken Money out of the Drawer. I told my Master of it, and we mark'd some Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put all this Money into the Till ?</p>
               <p>Boon. All, my Lord. I saw his Hand in the Drawer about a Quarter of an Hour after I laid it in. I was concealed in the Shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he search'd upon this?</p>

               <p>Daniel Demee. I am a Neighbour of Mr Grafton's. I was at the Coffee-house on Wednesday, between seven and eight o'Clock, and Mr Grafton was giving me an Account of the Affair that happen'd between him and his Servant, who had robb'd him several Times. As he was giving me this Account his Apprentice came in, and told him, he had caught the Porter taking Money out of the Till. There was a Constable planted to charge him if he was guilty. The Man clapt his Hand into his Pocket, and did not bring it out so quickly; so I desired him to slip his Breeches off; accordingly the Man happen'd to give me his Breeches, and I took the 2 s. out of his Pocket, which was marked P.</p>
               <p>(The 2 s. were produc'd in Court.)</p>
               <p>Upon that his Box was examin'd, which was above Stairs, and in that Box was found a Taylor's Bill of 13 l. He confess'd he had taken Money several Times out of his Master's Till; and in all upwards of 11 l.</p>
               <p>Court to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is all done out of Spight.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Witnesses ?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I liv'd with a Distiller in Drury-lane, but I could not send to him. They took away all my Money.</p>

               <p>Hill. I can't say the Day of the Month, but it was between three and four o'Clock in the Afternoon. I think it was about six Weeks ago I heard Murder cry'd out several Times. I ran into the Court where she liv'd, and I saw Mrs Powel, and she cry'd out Murder. She had a Shoemaker's Knife in her Hand all over bloody. I ask'd her what was the Matter ? She said, Mrs Williams had killed her Husband. I went up Stairs into Mrs Williams's Room. I went into one Room and then into the Bed-Room.</p>
               <p>Q Had they a House, or only Lodgings?</p>
               <p>Hill. I can't say. When I went in there I saw the Deceased lie on the Ground. I think he was not dead. I think I saw his Eyes move. I think he was not quite dead, but he did not speak. When I went in Mrs Williams was towards the Head of him, Mrs Williams, so call'd; she had one Hand towards his Nose, and the other Hand closing his Eyes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Blood about him? Was his Clothes off or on?</p>
               <p>Hill. His Clothes were on. And I said, Mrs Williams, you have kill'd your Husband. She said, she had not, for he fell upon the Knife, and did it himself. When he was turn'd up, to the best of my Knowledge, the Wound was under his Blade Bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Wound, in the fore part or back-part?</p>
               <p>Hill. In the Back part.</p>

               <p>Hill. They turn'd him upon his Face and his Clothes were turn'd up; the Blood was in a Clodder about the Bigness of a Halfpenny Saucer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on the right Side or the left?</p>
               <p>Hill. I think on the right, but I can't say, I was in such a Fright. I said, Oh! Mrs Williams, do you think this Wound can be given him by a Fall upon the Knife. Then she put her Hands together, and said several Times, I did it, I did it, I did it, a great many Times over.</p>

            . I live the very next Door to the Prisoner. When I came home, between three and four o'Clock in the Afternoon, it was on a Tuesday, but the Day of the Month I can't tell, and the Nurse that nurss'd her Child, that suck'd at her Breast, she call'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174709090013"/> me up. Powel, says she, come up, there is Murder done. Upon that I went up directly, and in the first Room I saw nothing at all; in the next Room I saw him lie with his Head toward the back Window, upon his Back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alive then?</p>
               <p>Powel. He was neither alive nor dead; his Eyes twirl'd; he could scarcely draw Breath. I saw him lying on his Back, with his Head to the Window, and his Knees laid up a little crooked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Prisoner in the Room?</p>
               <p>Powel. I saw her upon her bended Knees, stroking his Mouth up, and his Eyes up so, and said my Tommy is dead, my Tommy is murder'd</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say who murder'd him?</p>
               <p>Powel. No, Sir. I went to stretch his Legs out, and there was as much Blood as would fill an Half-penny Saucer, all in a Clodder; then coming down Stairs I saw the Knife in the Fore-Room, where he used to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Knife bloody?</p>
               <p>Powel. It was bloody up to the Handle, and I took the Knife and brought it down in the Yard. When I came down there was an Oration quickly made, and the Neighbours came in. There was one Mr. Taylor came in, and saw the same Action, of closing his Eyes and Mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Wound?</p>
               <p>Powel. I did not see the Wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Pray ask her, whether it was not off the Box that she took the Knife?</p>
               <p>Powel. It was off the Box that he sat on; he had no Seat; I found the Knife where all his Tools laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any Blood in the Fore-Room?</p>
               <p>Powel. Not a Bit of Blood in the Fore-Room; his Head was down upon the Ground, and she was closing his Eyes, and said, My Tommy is dead, My Tommy is kill'd.</p>

            . I live right over against where the Murder was committed. I was standing at my Kitchen-Window, and the Prisoner came out, and cry'd, Murder, Murder. I did not go over, but she came a second Time; and cry'd, Murder, Murder, I have killed my poor Tom.</p>

            . As I was at Work backwards, and hearing a Tumult that Mrs Williams had kill'd her Husband, upon that I went up Stairs, and saw the Man lie upon the Ground, and she upon her Knees, with one Hand to his Mouth, and her other Hand closing his Eyes; and I said, Mrs Williams, how is this, you have done some Mischief, the Man is dead ? And I perceived some Blood. I laid over the Bed, to feel where the Wound was. I says, you have killed your Husband; how could you do so? With that, says she, I have not kill'd him. I said, You are a vile Jade, you have kill'd him. Then she clapp'd her Hands together, and said, if I have, I am here ready to suffer for it. I said, here's Blood, the Wound is in his Back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn him up?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. The Women said I did, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body turn him up?</p>
               <p>Carpenter. Not while I was there, my Lord, I put my Hand under and put my Finger in the Wound, and as near as I can guess it was under his Shoulder; but I can't say which Shoulder.</p>

            , Surgeon. I was sent for to examine the Wound, and I found it an Inch long under the Shoulder; and upon examining with my Probe I found it enter'd the Cavity of the Thorax, and it was about six Inches deep.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that, in your Opinion, the Occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Hicks. Undoubtedly it was the Occasion of his Death.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you form any Judgment what Instrument it was done with?</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any Knife to try whether it tally'd with the Wound?</p>

               <p>Hicks. It seems to tally with the Wound.</p>

            , Constable. I don't know any thing of the Fact; but one told me there was a Murder committed, and desired me to take the Person into Custody. Accordingly when I came, I took her to my Lord Mayor; there appeared two or three Witnesses against her; one produc'd a Knife, and said that they found it all bloody, and this Apron was taken from her Side at my Lord Mayor's; he desired that I would take this, and the Knife, into my Possession; it was in this Manner stained with Blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Prisoner say any thing ?</p>
               <p>Davis. The Prisoner did say, that they had had Words, and she push'd him, and he fell against the Knife, that is what she told me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Mr Williams that I lived with. I never was married to him; I have had four Children by him - I was just come from Market; I sell Fruit and Things - When I came Home he begins his Airs as usual in striking and beating me; he struck me across my Eyes and Nose; I says, What is that for? D - n you, you must go out. I says, Do you design to sit down to your Work to day? D - n you you Bitch, says he, and bit my Finger very much, and with struggling together close by the Box, we fell upon it; I got up first, and I said, Tom, Tom; he ran directly, and cry'd Lord, Lord, and run into the back Room, and fell over the Bed: When I saw him sit at the Foot of the Bed, and not stir, I said Tom, Tom, and he made me no Answer: I then said, For God's Sake, for Christ's Sake, come up somebody, I believe my Husband is dead.

               <p>Mascall. Somebody came to assist me; when I went down, the Man lay a-cross the Washing-tub and Floor; I said, Mr Williams don't frighten your Wife? I helpt her, and I said I believe he is dead: I said, is he in a Fit, or what is the matter ? She said, she did not know. I said, I believed he was dead. When she let his Head go, it went down again as one dead, and I heard her say that her Finger was very much bit; she said when he bit her Finger, that he fell down upon the Knife; certainly he might fall down - I imagined he did so; I can't tell.</p>

             was a Servant-Maid that liv'd some where near Clare-Market. Mrs Watts, and two other young Women, coming from Hampstead, the Prisoner at the Bar insinuated himself into their Company, as they were going into a Publick-house to drink a Glass of Cyder. He desired afterwards to wait upon her Home, and then begg'd Leave to make her a second Visit, pretending to maintain her in a reputable Manner. By this means he insinuated himself so far into her Affections as to marry her. The first Marriage was on the 9th of February at May-Fair Chapel; the second Marriage the 21st of August, at the Anchor and Crown at Fleet-ditch, by one Prichard a Fleet Parson. We will call our several Witnesses to prove the Identity of the two Marriages.</p>

And I walk'd about ten or fifteen Yards; and there was a Man came up, and she; the first Question she ask'd me was, Whither are you going? I ask'd her, What was that to her? So I walk'd on, and then she attack'd me, and thrust me up to the Wall, and took my Purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Man do any Thing to you?</p>
               <p>Hall. I don't know that the Man touch'd me; she gave me a Blow and I fell against the Wall.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take the Woman up?</p>
               <p>Hall. I was so surpriz'd I did not take her up that Night, but I said I was robb'd, and I describ'd the Woman. They mention'd her Name; they said she was got amongst her Gang to Night, but the next Morning I might find her at such a Place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry, Stop Thief, or Murder ?</p>

She told my Spouse she would get up at one or two o'Clock in the Morning. My Spouse said she did not desire her so soon. She said, five would be soon enough. Two o'Clock in the Morning the Watchman came, and my Door was safe; at three o'Clock he call'd me up, with the Door wide open. As soon as we heard of it my Wife mistrusted that she had robb'd her. My Wife desir'd me to go to her Chest, to seek after her Gowns, and we found two Gowns missing, a white Damask Gown, and a red Silk Gown. Then I went down into the Kitchen, to see after the Linen that she was to wash that Morning, and that was gone. Upon missing these Things I went all the Day seeking after her, but I could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had her in Custody?</p>
               <p>Young. About six or seven Weeks, when we took her up, we had her before the Justice, she had nothing to say for herself. The Prisoner said, she had sold one of the Gowns and a Sheet for a Guinea, to Mrs Grah am.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Prior. I can't say that ever I saw her before. She brought the Gown to my Master; a white Damask Gown, and a Napkin that wrapp'd it in. She pawn'd the Gown for a Guinea. I am sure the Prisoner at the Bar is the Person; and about two or three Days afterwards it was put in the Advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose Name was it put in?</p>
               <p>Prior. In the Name of Eliz. White. When my Master saw it in the Advertisement he sent a Letter to Mr Young, and told him, he had got such a Gown. She said she was just come out of the Country, and wanted a little Money. She said she lodged at Mrs Graham's, but we could not find her. About three Weeks after, the 16th of July, she came into our Shop, with another Woman, to fetch the Gown out.</p>

               <p>Hawkins. By the Girl's telling of me she came several Times. We had made some Enquiries about it. There was a Woman that cries old Clothes, she sent for me, and told me, she had seen a green Gown at such a Pawnbroker's; upon that I goes to Mr Johnson's the Pawnbroker, at the Corner of Russel-street. His Servant that took them in is here. His Name is

He said there was no fear of her coming again, for she was to come to have more Money upon it; and when she did come I takes the Girl along with me, and she said, This is the Woman that has come so often to our House. When the Girl came in, the Prisoner said, You B - h, what do you do here ? And when she saw me, she said, Sir, don't make a Noise, I am ruin'd; the Gown is your's, but I did not steal it. The Pawnbroker look'd, and found the Damask which was ours. Afterwards we found the Cap, but we can't tell who pawn'd it. She deny'd the Damask; but she said the Gown was mine, but she did not steal it.</p>

               <p>Brown. I know her very well. I have known her about three Weeks or a Month. She brought the Silk Gown to me the 31st of July, and she wanted no more than eighteen Pence upon it. I made no Words of it, she look'd very well. Soon after there was a Woman that buys and sells Things, she said, this Gentleman has been robb'd of many Things, particularly of a green Gown. I said I took in a green Gown. She went by the Name of Henry to me.</p>

               <p>Brown. One Warren. I said, if she had stole it I should see her again. So she sent in the Afternoon for more Money. I said we did not lend any Thing except the same Person comes. So she came herself, and I tells her to stay a bit. Upon that the Woman that was with her said, the Gown was stole. So I sent for Mr Hawkins, and kept her there in the Shop. She wanted to get away sadly. She brought this blue Damask and the Cap before that, about three or four Days, and all in the Name of

            . On the 25th of July the Prisoner was sent of an Errand to my House. She enquired for one Wilson that lodges at my House. My Wife told her he was not within; so my Wife went out of the Shop to shut the Street-Door at the same time the Prisoner reach'd over her Hand, and took thin Piece of printed Cotton out of the Shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Home ?</p>

               <p>Bayley. She acknowledged before two Witnesses, that she had carried it to Hog lane, to a Green Shop in St. Giles's. She acknowledged she had taken this Piece of Cotton. I have been robb'd before nine or ten times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she produce the Cotton?</p>
               <p>Bayley. She begg'd the Favour that I would not take any Notice of it to her Mistress, or Relations.</p>
               <p>Q. And what did you tell her?</p>
               <p>Bayley. I told her I would take no further notice of it; but I says, seemingly to me this don't seem to be all the Cotton, I fancy if you have not cut off some, the Person where you carried it has? When I came Home I measured the Piece of Goods, and I thought I could tell there was five Yards cut off from it, and I sent to her Master, and her Mistress tax'd her, but she never acknowledg'd it till twelve o'Clock on Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by when she acknowledged it?</p>
               <p>Bayley. I was; but it was a great while before her Mistress, and the Person that recommended her to her Mistress, could get her to own it; after this, they went to the Pawnbroker's and got the Goods.</p>
               <p>- Cockayne. On the 25th of July, she said, in case the Prosecutor would go with her, she would help him to his Linen: accordingly I went with her, and saw her deliver the Goods to him, she owned she took it out of the Shop.</p>

            . I took the Prisoner at the Bar from the Parish Workhouse in Beech-lane, about five Weeks ago, there were two Guineas found in a Bird-cage, which gave me some Suspicion; then I tax'd her how she came by the Things she had bought? At first she told me, that her Uncle had sent them out of Oxfordshire. I found the Place where she bought a Gold Necklace, and a silver Spoon, and a golden Locket mark'd in her own Name J. F. I ask'd her how she came by the new Pair of Pumps. Stuff for Shifts, and for a Gown.</p>
               <p>Q. How much Money did you miss?</p>
               <p>Allen. I miss'd twenty-nine Guineas and a half; two Guineas were found in the Bird-cage, so that but twenty-seven and a half were lost. She bought the Necklace at a Silversmith's opposite to Porter's-Block; her Name is Lilly. I have seen one Guinea which I am very positive of by the Mark under the China Queen Anne's Guinea, which she changed with Mr Dawes.</p>

Mrs Allen was often times ask'd the Question by me, and by his Worship once or twice, and she refused to give any Account of the Matter; she said she had lost nothing, nor would she charge the Prisoner.

            . The Prisoner at the Bar, on Saturday the 1st of August, brought this Piece of Velvet to me. I ask'd her whose Velvet it was? I said, 'tis not your's she said, No. Says I, You must fetch the Owner; but she did not return. The Monday I advertised it; about nine o'Clock, this Gentleman came to my House to ask me if I had it, and I went to his House, and I found it answer'd to the Notches of the Velvet, and found it was the same; when I came there she was in the one Pair of Stairs Room, and I said, that was the Woman that brought it, and this is the Velvet; I have had it in my Custody ever since.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am of Council in this Cause for the Crown. This Prosecution is commenced in order, if possible, to break a desperate and wicked Gang of Men who have got together, and, for a long time, not only defrauded the publick Revenue, and fair Trader, but have likewise gone to that Height, that being armed and disciplined in Banditties, they have begun to be the Terror of the Publick; and, unless a timely Stop is put to these Proceedings, they will, in the end, strike at the Constitution itself. 'Tis now known to every body, that this Practice of Smuggling has increased to that Degree, that 'tis not carried on clandestinely and secretly, but it is carried on in the Face of Day, and in Defiance of Law and Justice. There are notorious Gangs on the Sea-Coasts, that publickly ride armed and disciplined in Troops, and that set the Officers of the Revenue at Defiance; often take and imprison them, and carry on their desperate Attempts, breaking through Laws, without any Fear or Terror from the Justice of the Nation. In order to put a Stop to this, which not only affects the publick Revenue, and, in consequence of that, affects every Man in the Kingdom, because as these Revenues are appropriated to particular Purposes, and in case they should become deficient, as they must become if these Proceedings are not stopp'd, the consequence must be, that the publick Faith of the Nation is engaged to find out other Supplies to make them good, and every Man in the Kingdom must contribute something towards them. Besides, the Practice is the most ruining and destructive to the fair Trader, because he is paying those Duties which the Necessities of the Publick require, and these Persons are under-selling him, and robbing of him of that Gain which ought to support him and his Family. In order to stop this Practice, the Legislature have try'd Methods of Lenity; these indeed have proved ineffectual: In the first place, there was an Act of Parliament in the 9th of his present Majesty, and the Penalties to that Act was Transportation for seven Years. This Act of Parliament not having it's desired Effect, but, on the contrary, these Men daily increasing, their Gangs continually augmented, and armed in such a manner, that they became the Terror of the Subject, it was found necessary to make another Act of Parliament in the 19th Year of his present Majesty, and therein it is enacted, That if any Persons to the Number of three, or more, armed with Fire-Arms, or other offensive Weapons, shall, from, and after, the 24th Day of July, 1746, be assembled in order to be aiding and assisting, in the running, landing, or carrying away uncustomed Goods, or Goods liable to pay any Duties which have not been paid or secured; then every Person so offending, being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be adjudged Guilty of Felony, and shall suffer Death. One would have thought that the Terror of this Act of Parliament would have had the desired Effect proposed by it. -</p>

            , the two Evidences now to be produc'd, to take an Inspection of the Prisoner; accordingly they went, and the Witnesses immediately knew him, and said, that he was one of the Hawkhurst Gang, which is the most desperate of any other, and that he went by the Name of Blacktooth, and was one of the foremost and most desperate in the Gang; upon this, an Information being taken, he was detained in the Custody of the Keeper of the Goal at Canterbury. By this Act of Parliament, there is Provision made, in the Vth Section of it, That Offences of this Kind against the publick Revenue, shall not be, like other Offences of Common Law, necessarily tryed in the County where they were committed, as ill Consequences may attend it; and the Legislature has enacted, That all these Offences should be tried in any County. This being the State of the Case, the Fact with which this Prisoner is charged, is this: Upon the 30th of March last, be, together with a Number of other Persons, not less than fifty, armed with Fire-Arms, and several Sorts of offensive Weapons, assembled at a Place called Reculver in the County of Kent, their Business there was to be aiding and assisting in the running and carrying off uncustomed Goods; a large Quantity of Tea was at that time run out of a Smuggling Cutter; these Persons were ready and prepar'd to receive it; the Prisoner, among others, assisted in loading the Horses, and carried it off into different Parts of the County of Kent: The Prisoner himself was armed and accoutered in this manner; he had a Blunderbuss and a Brace of Pistols.</p>
               <p>The Witnesses that we shall call, in order to prove this Fact upon him, are Witnesses that can't be deceiv'd in the Account they are to give you; because as it is necessary in all these Cases, as it is impossible to to convict otherwise, than by getting some of the Gang to repent of their vile Course, and to become assistant to publick Justice; so these Persons were present, and saw the Prisoner actually arm'd, and loading the Horses, in order to make a Benefit of it. These two Witnesses will give you a particular Account of the whole Transaction of running this Tea; and the Share and Concern that the Prisoner at the Bar had in it. They will be confirmed in their general Narrative by one of the Officers of the Revenue, who saw this Uproar and Riot upon the Sea-shore at this very Time of these Smugglers carrying off those Goods, though himself did not come near enough to this armed Number to swear the Fact himself. Gentlemen, If this Evidence comes to be laid before you, there can be no doubt at all but the Prisoner is guilty of this Offence which is laid in the Indictment, which is being arm'd and assembled, with a Number of other Persons armed likewise, in order to run uncustomed Goods. When you consider the Nature of the Offence, the general Destruction that it is of to the Trade, to the Freedom, and to the publick Revenue of this Kingdom, I am sure you will all be sensible, that it has been absolutely necessary for those that are entrusted with the Execution of Justice, to bring these Offenders to be try'd by a Jury, in order, if possible, to restore Tranquillity to the places where they infest; and to prevent this pernicious Practice, which is now grown to such a Height.</p>

               <p>Booth. I saw him every Morning - I came by his Door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lie?</p>
               <p>Booth. There are two Garrets; I laid in one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What Clothes had he when he was there?</p>
               <p>Booth. Really, Sir, I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he spend a good deal of Money at your House?</p>
               <p>Booth. No Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not some People come to see him when he was there?</p>
               <p>Booth. I did not see any Body.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you here, Child?</p>
               <p>Booth. We were subpoena'd</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose you are paid for your Journey?</p>
               <p>Booth. We ought, Sir; but we are not.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you to have?</p>
               <p>Booth. I can't tell, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you come up?</p>
               <p>Booth. With a Couple of Horses; Mistres's Brother carried me, and my Mistress rode single.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the Brother live at this Place called Saunders ?</p>
               <p>Booth. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business does he follow?</p>
               <p>Booth. He keeps a Farm and Hop-ground.</p>
               <p>Council. So you have made no Agreement?</p>
               <p>Booth. Not as I know of?</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you with a Subpoena ?</p>
               <p>Booth. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Council. The Person that delivered it you don't you know; did he deliver it to you?</p>
               <p>Booth. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Did not you ask for some Money to bear your Expences?</p>
               <p>Booth. He gave me this Piece of Paper, and a Shilling.</p>
               <p>Council. I should think it natural for you to ask how your Expences were to be paid?</p>
               <p>Booth. My Mistress paid the whole of the Expences up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it ago that you received this?</p>

               <p>Council. You say your Masters's Brother lives in the same Parish, how near your Mistress?</p>
               <p>Booth. 'Tis about three Quarters of a Mile.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose your Mistress and Master, and him, are Friends together; does he ever come to your House?</p>
               <p>Booth. Sometimes he calls, when he comes down to the Marshes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he an Acquaintance of Puryour's?</p>
               <p>Booth. He is not at all acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know whether Puryour lodged at your House?</p>
               <p>Booth. Yes, he might know that.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he know that, if he was not acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Booth. Very like be might see him.</p>

               <p>Council for the Crown. Gentlemen, you will please to observe, that this Fact is now proved upon the Prisoner by two Witnesses,

            . They have given you an Account of the Prisoner's being at Reculver the 30th of March; of his being armed; of his being assembled with the Number above what is described by Act of Parliament, who were armed likewise; and that the Prisoner: was there actually aiding and assisting in carrying off uncustomed Goods. Gentlemen, the Witnesses themselves have given you so probable an Account of this Transaction, and the Facts of the Goods being run; of the Cutter lying on the Shore, where the Water had wash'd it, and the Goods, upon the Beech, that Fact is confirmed by the Evidence of 
               <persName id="t17470909-36-person305">
                  Jarvis

                  </persName>
            . With respect to the Witnesses themselves, they are, of all others, the most likely to give an Account of this Affair; for they have both sworn,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174709090028"/> the one; that he has known the Prisoner near three Years; and the other, a Year and a Half; and that they have not only been once or twice, but several times, concerned with him in aiding and assisting in running of Goods. They give you a particular Account that they were present at that very time; and you will observe, they both agreed in the Arms the Prisoner had, and the Share he had in those Goods. In order to controvert this Evidence, they set up a Defence inconsistent with it, therefore the Question will intirely depend on the Credit you shall give to the Witnesses.</p>
               <p>You will observe, Gentlemen, there is no Sort of Attempt to discredit the Witnesses on the Behalf of the Crown; they have given you an Account themselves, that they have been concerned in this very bad Practice; that they have left it, and they are making all the Satisfaction they can to the Publick, by being instrumental to the suppressing of it.</p>
               <p>If any had thought proper to tax the Account here given, it would have been extremely easy to have called Witnesses to have given them a Discredit; but, as nothing of that Kind whatsoever has been attempted, I apprehend their Evidence must rest with you unshaken, unquestioned.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, the Account that the Witnesses on the Behalf of the Prisoner had to give, which is a common Defence, always set up upon these Occusions, that the Person was not there, but somewhere else at the same time, is, I apprehend, introduced and delivered with such Circumstances of Improbability, that 'tis impossible for any Man living to give any Credit to it. Consider the Account given of the Prisoner at the Bar; here is not one Person called to contradict the Witnesses, there is not so much as a single Witness called, that he had any other Employment to maintain him besides this of Smuggling. In the Account this Woman and her Maid has given, you observe an improbable Tale is told, that the Man was at this Publick-house in the Parish of Saunders, for six months; during all the Time that he was loitering at that House, that he carried on no Business; that he boarded at that House, but the Woman herself does not pretend to give you an Account, upon what Terms he was there, or what he was to pay for his Board. I should think, had he been an actual Boarder there at that time, it was impossible that she should be a total Stranger to any Agreement made; but, however, that was a Circumstance she had not before thought of; she was unprepared to give an Answer to it; therefore she tells you, that she was intirely a Stranger to the Terms: This Man was three Months at her House; the Woman, when she was first asked, was only prepar'd to give a general Evidence, and when I ask'd her the most plain and obvious Questions in the World, which was, What Room he laid in? when the House has but two Rooms besides Garrets, she was so boggl'd, she could give no Answer to it. The Servant was call'd and she gives pretty much the same Account, tho' this Man was in the House three Months, that not one of them should know what Sort of Clothes he had all the time; he comes to the House, according to them, without any thing but a single Shirt; he continued, without any Employment, for three Months, and they have no Demands upon him; no body knows how, or by what Means, he rais'd the Money.</p>
               <p>And this is another Circumstance: The Brother of this Holland, who lives in the same Parish, who brought this Woman to Town, that must be able to give an Account of seeing this Man at Saunders, that Man is not produc'd; and why? because that Man won't concur with them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the Witnesses for the Crown that are called, are unaffected in their Evidence and Character; and 'tis impossible to believe, that this Prosecution carried on by the Crown itself, that they should, by themselves or Officers, suborn these two Witnesses in order to convict this Man at the Bar? And what Inducement can they have to come and swear this Man's Life away, if the Fact was not true, these Persons having been of the Gang? Now it would be a Suspicion against any other Witnesses that would come to swear to the Man's Face, because, you see, they kept every body at a Distance, and shot at the Officers that came to detect them.</p>

               <p>Council. Gentlemen, when you come to hear this Master, you will think it as just and necessary a Prosecution to be brought before you, as ever appeared in this Place. It is an Indictment against the Prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174709090029"/> for taking a Letter, in the Post-Office, with a Bank Note included in it. You will consider the publick Credit, and publick Interest of this Kingdom, is extremely affected by Crimes of this Nature. Bank Notes are so publick, that if the least Check be put to them, it would very much affect Trade, and be a great Blow to the Credit of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Council. I am Council of the same Side for the Crown; and, Gentlemen, the Prisoner at the Bar stands indicted for a Crime in which as the publick Interest is extremely concerned, so the Legislature have thought proper to annex to it a very severe Punishment, by making it Capital. You know the greatest Part of the Commerce of this Nation could not be carried on but in an Epistolary Way; and the Legislature, in Acts of Parliament of the 2d and 9th Years of his present Majesty, has made it Capital, and of the same Value as Money, or Goods. I will not enter particularly into the Nature of the Offence, or the Prisoner's Employment in the Post-Office, but I shall go directly to the calling our Witnesses.</p>

               <p>Drewry. Yes. On the 20th of April we sent a Letter to Mr Hewson, with two Bank Notes, 20 l. each. This Bank Note is my Father's Property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this Letter sent?</p>
               <p>Drewry. I carried it to Mr Randes, Post-master.</p>

               <p>Randes. Yes. He brought a Letter to me one Day, and he came to the Office-Door, and ask'd me how I did? Mr Lumley happen'd to be in the Room, and he was jealous, Drewry came to me to frank a Letter for him; and Mr Lumley said, Mr. Randes, you don't know what you are doing, for if there should be any thing in that Letter, Bill, or any thing of that Kind, you may be accountable for it? so with that he surpriz'd me a little; I took all my Letters, one by one, and took this Letter, and put it in between two large Letters, and put it into the London Bag, and sealed it with my own Hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of this Note being brought to your Office?</p>
               <p>Brett. I know this Note was delivered to me by our Man, 
               <persName id="t17470909-37-person330">

            .</p>
               <p>Q. Now, can you take upon you to be sure, that that Note was delivered to you by your Clerk?</p>
               <p>Brett. Yes, Seeing the Indorsements, and hearing the Mail was robb'd, I desir'd; the next Morning, it might be sent to the Bank, to see if it was a good Note, or not. There it was stopp'd; and they sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they refuse paying the Money?</p>
               <p>Brent. Yes, Sir, but I did get it, after the Man and I had related the Affair. I told them as the Change was given out of the Note, I thought it was my Property, when they refus'd to pay me I determined to sue the Bank for it; I know nothing of the Person that brought the Note. I receiv'd 20 l. of the Bank, and it was cancell'd there.</p>

               <p>Hardwick It was in April or May I believe.</p>

               <p>Hardwick I know the Note came from Lincoln, by what I look'd upon it, but as for any Number, or Person, or Name, I can't remember.</p>
               <p>Q. For what Purpose was it given to you.</p>
               <p>Hardwick Lawrence brought it to me, and said, a Friend of his had sent it up, and he desired I would go and get a Lottery Ticket, and they told me the Lottery Tickets were not come out. They told me a Receipt was as good as a Ticket, for that reason I paid 10 l. 4 s. for a Receipt, and they gave me in change 9 l. 16 s.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was given to you, what did you do with it?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. I returned it to Lawrence the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>[Cross Examination.]</p>
               <p>Council. How came you take the Receipt in the Name of Marshall.</p>
               <p>Hardwick. I was in a hurry, and forgot the Name.</p>
               <p>Council. I want to know, whether you are positive that is the Note?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. I won't swear to that; but there was something upon it that show'd that it came from Lincoln.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other Bank Note at that Time ?</p>
               <p>Hardwick. No.</p>
               <p>Court. The Prisoner told you, it was not to be in his own Name.</p>
               <p>Hardwick. No, he said it was for some Person in the Country, which I forgot; I forgot the Name, and mentioned a Name that I recollected.</p>

            , Esq; Secretary to the Post-Office. When Lawrence was apprehended, he was brought before me to be examined; accordingly, in the Course of that Examination, it appeared he had given this Bank Note in Question, to Hardwick, to negociate for him; upon which, I sent immediately for Hardwick to be apprehended. I think he mention'd he gave it to Hardwick to buy a Lottery-Ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any Excuse when he was charged with the Affair.</p>
               <p>Mr Shelvocke. He said he found the Bank Note at first; and Grey, the other Witness, he said he found the Receipt.</p>
               <p>Court. You live, Mr Shelvocke, in the Post-house, that is, Part of the Office?</p>
               <p>Mr Shelvocke. I live in my Lord Leicester's Apartment.</p>
               <p>Court. This is laid to be in the Dwelling-house; Sir, I ask you, whether this Hall is part of your Dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Mr Shelvocke. There was a Door into the Hall, but it is stopp'd up?</p>
               <p>Court. Then 'tis no Part of the Dwelling-house?</p>
               <p>Mr Shelvocke. It is as much part of the Dwelling-house, as a Merchant's Compting-house is part of his Dwelling house.</p>
               <p>Court. In the House you live in, separate from Mr Robinson's, is that tax'd to any Rate whatsoever ?</p>
               <p>Mr Shelvocke. I believe the whole is tax'd as one House.</p>
               <p>Court. If you had laid it in the Joint-House of the Company, you would be still wrong if you laid it upon the whole in general.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. The Question is, whether there is any Proof of his felonious taking of it all, I would say it is but a look kind of Evidence. What, because this Gentleman was concern'd in the Post-Office, and in the same Seat there was seven or eight other People, that therefore he must take this Bill out of the Letter; if he did not take it out of the Letter, then it will recur to the Confession he made to Mr Shelvocke and Mr Potts; Mr Shelvocke says he confess'd he gave the Note to Hardwick to buy a Lottery-Ticket, and he said he found it in the Post-Office Yard; if it be taken upon his Confession, then 'tis the standing Rule that it must be taken altogether, if he found it in the Post-Office Yard, tho' he did very wrong to convert it to his own use, but this is not a Felony. This Letter comes to Town the 22d of April; on the 7th of May he sends a Man, with this Bank Bill, which was remarkable, to a publick Lottery-Office; now this was the most improper time in the World for him to have sent it, if he had been sensible he had been guilty of any Kind of Felony. We have a great many Witnesses to his Character.</p>

            , Esq;</p>
               <p>Council. I am Council in this Cause for the Crown. This is an Indictment against the Prisoner for a Felony of a pretty uncommon Nature; 'tis for stealing out of a Conveyance Letter delivered into the Post-Office in January last, a Watch which the Prosecutor thought proper to send to his Correspondent at Edinburgh; this he put into a Letter, and this Letter we say that he himself put into the Post-Office. We shall shew by other Evidence, particularly by the Gentlemen there employed, how it was disposed of, and how it came into the very Hands of the Prisoner at the Bar: He is a Man that has been a pretty while employed in that Office, in a distinct Branch that is called a Sorter, and that does give him an Opportunity of observing a great many Things of Value; we say, that the very Watch being so convey'd, or intended to be conveyed, to a Correspondent at Edinburgh, never came into the Hands of the Person, Mr Carr; but that this Francis finding an Opportunity, he was so wicked as to open it, and convert it to his own Use; to be sure Mr Martin, not finding that his Letters came to his Correspondent's Hands, he made Enquiry after it, but he could hear nothing for a great while; upon an Application made to the Post-Office, they had some Suspicion of this Francis; he being taken and charged with this, he himself owned these Things. 'Tis laid to be the Property of Mr Martin, and he himself will prove to you, that he put this Letter into the Post-Office. We shall call the Persons of the Post-Office, where it was put in, and the Care that was taken of it, as it was directed to Edinburgh; we shall prove to you, that this was directed for the North-Road, and that it must fall into the Hands of this Defendant; we shall shew, that he being charged with it, that he was at that time so candid as to confess the taking, and the Manner, of it.</p>

I said, Mrs Lomas, these are my Things, that old-fashion'd Plate that hung up by a String, &amp;c. She said, Touch the Things out of my Room, and I'll send you to Newgate. Then I got a Search-Warrant, and found these Things; but I have lost a great many more.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner, in her Defence, pleaded, That they were sent by the Woman herself, because her Husband might not break them; and also this Woman, Wife to the Prosecutor, owned her Money.</p>

I never had seen the Prisoner before, but she came recommended to me by a Neighbour; she sent her Servant to tell me, I might safely take what the Woman brought; I says, I believe your Mistress is an honest Woman, but I believe 'tis stole; she desired to have 18 s. upon it; upon that the Woman began to be very abusive; I insisted to know whose Property it was. Then she equivocated, and said, she was desirous to sell it. Upon that I advertised it; the Woman that came to speak for her, had been a Servant, and work'd with Mr Bolland, but for fear they should not read it. I sent a Letter to Mr Bolland. Upon the 15th Day. the Man Prisoner came to claim the Velvet as his Property. I ask'd him if they were Husband and Wife? and he said, she was not his Wife, and he claimed the Velvet as his own. I still insisted upon knowing more; he said that his Name was Morris; the Woman offered me Half a Crown if I would let her have the Velvet.</p>

On the 26th of July I was going Home to my Lodging pretty late, and pretty much in Liquor, I met with this Woman, and she goes home to my Lodgings with me; my Landlady left the Door open; when I came in, she let me have a Candle, and this Creature goes up Stairs with me: My Landlady did not know any thing of it, When she came up Stairs, she would lie down with her Clothes on, and would have the Candle put out, and these Things, and my Money, and all was gone.</p>

               <p>Hillier. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake?</p>
               <p>Hillier. About 5 o'Clock in the Morning. I am positive I had my Money, and put it between the Bed and the Sacking; but she had rifled me of it, and carried all the Things away. I was waiting for her for a whole Week afterwards, to see if I could find any thing of her; and as I was drinking in an Alehouse she came in, with another Woman, to call for a Quartern of Gin; so I told her, she was the Woman that was with me such a Night.</p>

            , I should know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Night was this done?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. About 12 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dance with the Company ?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in the House?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. About an Hour?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. I went into my own Room, which was about ten Doors from the House. I went into my own Room, which was a Ground-Floor. I came back to Mr Lewis's to light my Candle, and these young Fellows were without side of the Door, excepting two, that happened to be within side.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. There was a Matter of Ten, to the best of my Knowledge. Those young Fellows were without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174709090037"/> out-side of the Door, every one of them. There was something of a Quarrel about their refusing, I think, to pay their Reckoning. A young Fellow who was there, cry'd out, Have you no Weapon about you? We will stand by one another till we get our two Partners out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the Partners, Men or Women?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. Men, Sir.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you, or any body see, this young Fellow in the Scarlet Waistcoat do?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. It was not one of the Prisoners at the Bar, another young Fellow said to him, Give me the Hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. He is not here, if he was I should know him: He said, Come let us break the Door open; but it was not one of the Prisoners. Another young Fellow said, he would give any Money for a Hatchet. There was a great Hubbarb; there was Murder cry'd within side. I saw a Man come out to the Door. D - n your Blood, said one of the Fellows without Doors, cut his Hand off.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. Not one of these young Fellows.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing to say against any one of them at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Halfpenny. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Then stand you down, you might have been in the Indictment as well as they.</p>

             make a Hurly-Burly?</p>
               <p>Williams. No, but only said, Let us go out, let us go away. When they had got out somebody bolted the Door in the House, the Windows were shatter'd to Pieces presently. The Man said, 'Tis a sad Thing I should go without my Reckoning. He was within, and they broke his Windows in a sad Form; shatter'd all the Panes in a Quarter of an Hour. I look'd out and I saw three at the Door.</p>
               <p>Q. Which Three?</p>
               <p>Williams. Never a one that is here, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What Three?</p>
               <p>Williams. Two had Sticks in their Hands, and one with a Cutlass. I said, Gentlemen, you had better go about your Business. I said, do not let them come in. One of them has a Cutlass.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you there?</p>
               <p>Williams. I was going by and I heard Musick, and I went in to see who was playing on the Violin, and a-going in they were all merry together; so when the Hurly-Burly rose I was frighten'd out of my Wits.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Williams. I have nothing to say against any one of the young Fellows in the House.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Murder committed, without side, or within side the House?</p>
               <p>William. The Person that was murdered was within; but he that committed it was without. Mr Lewis walk'd to the Door. I saw him make a Motion to fasten the Door more, for they expected every Minute the Door would burst quite open; so with that I saw the Man, the Deceased, come away with his Hand upon his Neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Do do know that any of the Prisoners at the Bar did it?</p>
               <p>Williams. I am sure none of them did it.</p>
