                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 16, Lansdowne-road North, Dalston—I had a relation named Joseph Hankin—with the exception of my mother, I was his nearest relation, as far as I know—he used to live with me, but afterwards went to reside with the female prisoner, at 2, Union-court, Stoke Newington—she is a monthly nurse, and her husband is a road-scraper—he lived there eighteen or twenty months—the female prisoner told me that he paid her twelve shillings a week for his board—I was in the place very frequently, nearly every Sunday—before he went there, he had placed 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my possession, which I returned to him, in November, 1859—I last saw it in March, 1862, the whole amount; it was in notes and gold—in July, 1862, be spoke to me about making a will, and I asked the prisoner and her husband to come up stairs and sign the will—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced. This was dated</hi> 23<hi rend="italic">d July</hi>, 1863; <hi rend="italic">it left the whole of his property to Mary Ann Vickers, after payment of his debts and funeral expenses. Signed, "Joseph Hankin, in the presence of David Read and Maria Read"</hi>)—I wrote this will in pencil from his dictation, and afterwards took it to Mr. Howarth, my brother-in-law, who copied it—Mrs. Read was not present when I had any conversation with the deceased about money—he died on 26th November last, and I went to the house about three or four hours afterwards—I went straight to the box where the deceased had told me that his money was, to take it, but only found about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went down stairs, and said, "Mrs. Read, you must be aware that my cousin had money to live upon; all he possessed in the world was in this house. I cannot find it: do you know anything about it?"—I believe the male prisoner was present—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "He had money to a large amount in this house; bank-notes to a large amount"—she said, "Bank-notes! I had no idea he had any money at all. I never saw any of his money, beyond what he paid me weekly for his board and lodging, you know Mrs. French has been to see him, and stayed with him till 7 o'clock in the evening, and left him in a</p>

               <p>state of stupor, and so he remained for several days, and, perhaps, she may know something about the money; and an old gentleman has been to see him"—I left after that conversation, and went to seek out Mrs. French—I went to the prisoners' again a day or two afterwards, and saw the prisoners—the male prisoner asked me if I had found out Mrs. French—I said, "Yes, I have, and she will come here"—that was all the conversation of any importance—on the Monday or Tuesday following, I went again, with Mr. Howarth, and my mother settled with them—Mrs. Read said that all the deceased owed her was ten shillings, which my mother paid—Mrs. Read said that he paid her regularly twelve shillings a week from his bed—Mr. Howarth asked her if Mr. Hankin had, in his lifetime, made her a present of money, or clothing, or jewellery, or any of her family—she said, "No, Sir, never, to my knowledge"—Henry Read then said, "Mother, do not say another word; let them go to law with us"—Henry Read wrote this receipt, and his mother signed it—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Mrs. Read to Miss Vickers. Board and lodging for Mr. Hankin, up to the time of his death, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Paid, Maria Read.")—on 8th January, I went again, with Inspector Langdon—I went in first, and said that I had brought a gentleman to question her about this money—I said, "Do you know him?"—she said, "No, I have not that pleasure"—he then asked her if she knew Mr. Hankin had any money—she said, No, he had not any money, that she knew of, and that Miss Vickers and her mother knew all that there was—Langdon then produced a piece of paper, and said, "This is some information from the Bank of England. You are the woman who has changed the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—she said, "I know I did; he gave me the money"—Henry Read then came running down stairs, and said, "Charge us with robbery; charge us with robbery"—that was before he was accused—I then said, "You are the man that changed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes"—Langdon said to Mrs. Read, "What witnesses have you?"—she said, "None, but my own children"—a Coroner's inquest was held in February, at which I heard Mrs. Read state that she changed a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in December, 1863—the deceased kept the 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a box in his room by itself, and the other money he had he kept in a separate box—after his death, I found the box in which he had kept the 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it was not there—the rest of the money which he paid his way with, was in a tea-caddy, which I found—he also had a little plate and jewellery, and his wife's clothing—I went with Inspector Langdon when the house was searched, and, in a room up stairs, which the deceased had occupied, was found a tea-caddy, a silk dress, and a hearthrug—the daughter found those things—when I asked about a brooch, she said that it was not in the house, but she sent for it—Mrs. Read was not there; but I heard her solicitor say, that he had the brooch—the deceased's habits were very reserved, very mean and close, and very quiet—he was paralyzed for some time before he died, but was better towards the last—he has been bed-ridden, but he could get up afterwards.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090005"/>
               <p>I saw the contents—it is in March, 1862—it was not full of papers; it only had the notes and gold and my letters in it—the papers were on the top—I did not open them—the box was, to all appearance, the same in March, 1862, as when it left my custody—that was the date of my relative going to the Reads; he went straight to them when he left in March, 1862, without any interval between—three hours after the death, Henry Read came and fetched my mother in a cab—I was in London—he telegraphed for me on his way to their house, and I arrived about 2 o'clock—I have not got the telegram here—Henry Read was in and out the whole time, and I believe he was present the whole time I am speaking of—it was on the evening of the death that Mrs. French's name was mentioned, when I could not find the money—Henry Read wrote the account, I think, by his mother's dictation; she stood by his elbow—the interview of 8th January lasted about a quarter of an hour—I had been in the house about five minutes when Henry Read came running down stairs—it was not so long as ten minutes—he came down directly afterwards, and I said directly, "You are the young man that changed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note.

I then called this man, and he asked me if I knew my way about London; I said, 'No'; he asked me to go with him, and he would show me about; we walked about a long time; I gave him a shilling; he asked me to have something to drink; he said he knew a place where there was a nice drop of ale; I went with him; he put his hand in his pocket to pay for it, and took out this two-shilling piece; the landlord said it was a bad one, and he asked me to pay for the ale; I gave a sixpence for it, and we went out to a little shop; I went in for some tobacco, and gave the woman two shillings; we went out, and this man said, 'Ain't you thirsty?' and we went into this public-house, and asked for a pint of six ale; the policeman came in there, and collared him, and they called me out and collared me."</p>

I am a labourer—on 11th April I went to Hampstead—I got there about 3 o'clock—I tried to get a lodging, and looked all over Hampstead, but could not do so—about half-past 1 o'clock in the night, the prisoner and another man came behind me and hit me on the side of the head—I could not see whether it was with a stick or a fist, but I fell, and when I was down, the prisoner caught hold of my handkerchief, screwed it up, and put his knee into my breast—one of them, I cannot say which, put his hand into my pocket, and took away 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in a purse, and a knife—I have never seen them since—I was insensible from the blow, for a few minutes, and then the constable came and <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> the prisoner on top of me.</p>

On 12th April, at ten minutes to 1 in the morning, I was on duty near the top of Brewhouse-lane, and saw Baines go down the lane—the prisoner and a man named Grimm went down before him—after they had gone down some time I heard a disturbance, went down, and found the prosecutor lying on his back, and the prisoner holding him by the throat with his left hand, and kneeling on his chest, while Simms was rifling his trouser's pockets—he was stifled, and could not stand by himself—Crane got away, but I went after him, and took him—I had seen him a quarter of an hour before, and knew him by sight—Baines complained of being robbed, and I took the prisoner to the station, and charged him.</p>

I know him very well indeed; shake hands with me, we are better friends now, I hope, as we know each other's connexions"—we drove to the George the Fourth, in Cloth Fair, and got out there—Powell ordered three glasses of sherry—we then went into the back part where the skittle-alley is, and there I saw Finch playing a game of skittles with another—the student addressed him and said, "This place has been changed since I was here five years ago; you had a place twenty-five or thirty yards long"—Finch said, "Yes, sir, at that time we had such a place, but it has been changed; we were obliged to give it up"—the student said he used to come there with the gentlemen from St. Bartholomew's—Finch was dressed very like he is now—he and another were playing a game of skittles, and he re<lb/>quested Powell to stand out of the way while they finished the game—Powell stood out of the way—he threw the ball, and the game was finished—Powell and the student then played a game at skittles—Powell took up the ball, and said it was stone—Finch said it was not, and they made a small bet of sixpence about it, and Powell lost it—the student then came to me, and said, "Here is a man that has come in for a lot of money, I shall not get such a chance again, I am going to play a game with him, and you had better do the same"—I made no reply, so the student went over to Powell and said, "I will make you a bet for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my friend there will do the same"—Powell came over to me directly and said, "Will you?" and touched my hand, and I touched his hand—the student then asked me how much money: I had—I opened my purse, and found 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. available for the purpose—there was more than that, but 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. seemed available for the purpose—the student said, "The bet is for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I will lend you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "so the game was played—I put the money into the hands of the man who I took to be a waiter in the place, and who was playing with Finch when we went in—I lost the money—I had no more except a few shillings—Powell and the student then made a bet for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and</p>

I find it is only 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you must give me an I O U for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he induced me to make out an I O U in favour of Frederick Pearce, payable in twelve months—he said his name was Frederick Pearce—Finch said to Powell, "The fact is, sir, you have won our money; you have won my watch and this gentleman's, and all our money; I have only a short distance to go and get 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and this gentleman (pointing to me) has only to do the same; if you will allow us to go for a few minutes we can get the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—so Powell consented to make a bet of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the circumstances that we were to go and get the money if we lost it—the bet was made, and the game played, and we lost—Finch, when he saw that the game was going against me, said, "Put on your coat"—it was lying on the settle, and I put it on—he said, "Come away, come away; we are going to fetch the money"—I went outside the door, and he said, "We are not going to get any for that man; it won't do for us to be together; you go that way, and I will go this way," and he ran off—I went into Long-line, saw a policeman, and he told me something—after that I went to Morley's Hotel, Trafalgar-square, but could not find Powell—I next saw the prisoners that day seven weeks, 23d March, walking together on the Strand side of Temple-bar—I followed them into Fleet-street, and gave them in custody.</p>

On the morning of 6th May, about half-past 2 o'clock, I was on duty in King-street, Tower-hill, and saw the prisoner lying drunk on the pavement—I lifted him Up on his legs, and he asked me where Mr. Thompson's coffee-house was, No. 6, King-street—I took him to the door, left him there, and went round my beat—I came back in five or six minutes, and he was still knocking at the door—I said to him, "You have not got in," and at that time the door was opened by the land<lb/>lord—the prisoner went in, threw his coat off, and then sprung out and</p>

I keep a coffee-house in King-street, Tower-hill—the prisoner lodged there for seven or eight days—I was awakened about half-past 2 o'clock, by a violent knocking at the door, went down stairs and stood in the passage about half a minute—I opened the door, and the prisoner came in, took his coat off, threw it about two paces, and went out and pitched into the policeman—he first struck him with his hands, and then kicked him—his hat fell off, his lantern was knocked off, and they both fell to the ground—I picked up the hat and lantern, and gave the policeman his hat—the prisoner said, "I will bite your nose off," and his mouth was about three inches from the constable's nose, but the constable struck him over the wrist with his truncheon—he kicked violently, and the constable struck him over the shins—after that he was worse than ever; a few more cuts would have done him good.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, and live at 123 Manor-street, Clapham—on the evening of 21st April I was directly oppo-site Fishmonger's-hall, while Garibaldi was there, I believe—the prisoner came up and asked me if I knew how long Garibaldi had been there—I told him that I was not aware that he was there at all, for I had not been standing there above two or three minutes—directly after he spoke to me I felt something at my pocket; I looked down, and saw the guard of my watch fall from the prisoner's hand—I had this kind of coat on, and the watch was attached in the manner it is now—I cannot remember whether my coat was unbuttoned or not; it was only the top button if it was buttoned at all—I felt directly in my pocket, and my watch was gone—the prisoner wheeled round to the right, and was joined by three or four others—I had not courage to take hold of him then, for I had a good <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of money about me; I had been collecting that day—the prisoner and the others went about thirty yards towards the city; I watched them very particularly—the prisoner turned round, left the others, and came back about three parts of the way from where he started, and got into a cab—I then took hold of him, and accused him of taking my watch—he said, "I have not got it, "and he put his hand in his pocket and threw something out of the opposite door of the cab—I could not see what it was, but I have no doubt it was my watch—I heard it fall on the stones—the prisoner got away from me, and got out at the other side of the cab—I called "Stop thief," and he was stopped by the people on the other side; there was a crowd there—I did not lose sight of him—I saw him stopped and given into custody—my watch has not been found.</p>

I live in Eastfield-street, Limehouse—I have known the prisoner nine or ten years—when I first knew him he was in the same line that he is now; he kept a grocer's shop; he does not now—I believe my son was taken ill on Sunday, 20th March, and on Monday night I went to see Mr. Stevens—he has a shop in High-street, Whitechapel—I told him the boy was very ill, I believed he had got the fever; that was all I told him then—that was on the Tuesday—I did not tell him on the Monday that he had the fever—I went and got some powder and pills on the Monday—I got those from Mrs. Stevens—I did not see Mr. Stevens on the Monday evening—I had some composition powder and some pills from the prisoner's wife—I also brought him on Monday night a bottle of liniment to rub on his hip; I got that also from Mrs. Stevens—some of the powder and the pills were given to my son that night, and the liniment was rubbed on; he was no better on the Tuesday, and I went to Mr. Stevens and told him my boy was very bad, and I thought he had the fever—he gave me some powder and told me to give it to him freely—I went again that night a second time and got some more liniment, as my wife had used all that I took on Monday—part of that was used, but I think not all—I went to Mr. Ste<lb/>vens on Wednesday evening, and told him my boy was very bad—I asked him if he would come and see him, and he came and examined him in my presence—he said that he was very bad, and he would rather see him by daylight—he then left, and told me to come up in the course of half an hour; I suppose that was to enable him to make some medicine—I went, and he gave me a bottle of medicine—I gave my son some of it as directed, and altogether be took about half the bottle—I believe the prisoner came next day by daylight, but I was not there—it must have been on the Tuesday that lome other medicine was sent by Mr. Cummings or Dr. Monk, but my son had none of it—I had always been satisfied with Mr. Stevens' treatment before, and that was the reason I did not give it to him—until my son died he took no medicine, that I know of, except what I brought from Mr. Stevens; I brought the whole of it—these are the pills, medicine, and liniment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the last he swallowed; I got it from Mr. Stevens on the Sunday, the day my son died; he died as I was pouring that down his throat—the bottle was full, and he swallowed all except what you see left in the bottle—this other bottle, with "Gargle" on it, he gave him on the day he died, because he complained of sore throat—I do not think I have any of the liniment left; my wife used all of the first bottle; the second bottle was not all used, because he ceased complaining of his hip after Wednesday.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I am registered under the new Act of Parliament—Mr. Proby's sister came to me, and on 24th March I went and saw the boy at the request of the mother—it was a Thursday; they are quite wrong in their dates—I only saw him once—it was about the middle of the day—my son had seen him before for a moment, I believe, but I was not present—I examined the boy—he was suffering from in<lb/>flammatory fever, the consequence of acute suffering of the hip-joint—his state was quite dangerous, and he was in great suffering—I said, "If you have no regular medical attendant you had better send the boy to the hospital or he will be lost"—not being called in I did not recommend any particular treatment, but I said what ought to be done—a prescription of Dr. Monk was made up on my counter—I read it, and was present when it was made up—I made up part of it—I am sure of that—after the boy died, Mr. Grant made a post mortem examination in my presence—I sealed up the stomach, and gave it to the Coroner's officer—the boy had been suffering from acute inflammation of the hip-joint, for which, in my opinion, Cayenne pepper would be very injurious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw that the boy was very ill, did you not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if anybody who saw him, two hours before met, said that it was only a touch of the rheumatism, and that he would get better in a day or two, he would be a very ignorant person, and a very stupid person if it was said, but it was not said—my son is a certificated medical man, and very talented as a general practitioner—he only spoke a word of comfort, he never ex<lb/>amined the case at all; he never interfered the least in the world; he merely looked in at the door—cayenne pepper is in the pharmacopœa, only we call it there capsicum, but there are two descriptions there—if I wanted to translate capsicum into English, I should call it cayenne—hip-joint disease is scrofulous in nine cases out of ten—capsicum or cayenne may be used in scrofulous disease where there is atony or want of power—we use it occasionally as a stimulant—I have never used it in low fever, but it is used occasionally—it is a recognised remedy among the class of stimulants, and it is in our pharmacopœa as a remedy for low fever, and it is optional for medical men to use it—I do not think I ever used it—I have it in my laboratory, but I use other stimulants—I prefer them—it may be</p>

               <p>used with propriety in proper quantities where there is a weakness in the tone of the stomach, but I do not use it—of those proper quantities the medical man judges, and they may be increased or diminished according to circumstances—one of the curative processes that I recommended was that Dr. Coffin's prescriptions ought not to be used, as he was a mere unqualified man—I take it for granted that people who have not taken out a certificate are not very likely to know what is right.</p>

                  </hi>, F. R. C. S. I am one of the surgeons of the Royal Free Hospital, and pathological anatomist to it—I was ordered by the Coroner to make a post mortem examination of this lad about a week or nine days after his death—I found all the organs essential to life, quite healthy—I examined the hip-joint by laying it open, and found a portion of the circumference of the cartilage of the head of the bone absorbed or removed by disease, or more correctly speaking, removed by inflammation, and another portion of cartilage, about the size and shape of a shilling, had also been removed from the ossitabulum or socket of the hip—it is a ball and socket joint—the bone itself was highly inflamed, and turgid with blood, highly vascular, and in the cavity of the joint was about two teaspoonsful of matter—I looked inside the abdomen, at the part corresponding to the hip-joint, and there I found that the disease, I have been speaking of, in<lb/>flammation; had extended to the muscle leading down to the hip-joint, and also had extended to the peritoneum, covering the muscle and its sheath; there was peritonitis or inflammation of the peritoneum at that part—some lymph bad been thrown out by the peritoneum into the substance of the muscle, causing considerable tension of the muscle—in my judgment in<lb/>flamatory fever was the cause of death, followed by exhaustion by peritonitis—there was no difficulty in a properly qualified medical man ascertaining in the boy's lifetime what he was suffering from—in the state in which I found the hip-joint, cayenne pepper would be a very improper thing indeed to administer, because it is a powerful stimulant, and would make the inflam<lb/>matory fever inevitably fatal—I believe that the administration of the cayenne, in doses, in connection with the acute inflammation, and inflam<lb/>matory fever would together be inevitably fatal—this was not a scrofulous disease at all; I can give you a very good reason for saying so: the usual manifestations of scrofula in the meserteric glands, and by tubercles in the lungs, were absent—there was no scrofulous disease, nor were there the usual characteristics of it—I took out the stomach, held it up to the light, and saw that it contained a quantity of dark fluid, and that it also had, when held up to the light, a crimson hue from inflammation.</p>

               <p>medical opinion of the last age that has not been altered in the present—bleeding is not used as it was fifty or sixty years ago; it is not considered fatal now, but the treatment is very different—the doctors hardly ever carry a lancet now, because the state of the public constitution is so altered that people will not bear bleeding where they used before—I think that bleeding was all right fifty years ago—a great many medical men are not of an en<lb/>tirely different opinion—I never saw cayenne used for low fever, or heard of it—I am not acquainted with it from books—I do not say that the notion of using it for low fever is monstrous, because I have no experience of it, but capsicum or cayenne pepper is so powerful an irritant that we should not use it in fever—low fever and acute inflammation are not the same—I have had no experience of its effects in low fever; but as regards acute inflammation its effect in congested sore throat, for instance, would preclude our using it for inflammation—I can form a judgment of it in in<lb/>flamination, but low fever is far more mysterious, and that is the reason I cannot give an opinion—the pathology of low fever is not by any means so well understood as inflammation—cayenne is never used for inflammatory sore throats.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry at the London Hospital—I received these bottles from Cunningham; this jar containing the stomach, and this box of pills—the stomach was unopened, but I observed marks of inflammation outside of it—I opened it, and found that the mucous coat was tinted generally of a yellow colour, but here and there there were patches of a red colour as if from the action of an irritant—it contained ten drachms of liquid, (one ounce and a quartere) of a yellowish, or yellowish brown colour, which I found was due to the prsence of bile in large quantities—there was no trace of food or of any solid matter—I examined it chemically, but found no trace of matters of a poisonous nature, but only bile and cayenne-pepper—that is called in Latin <hi rend="italic">capsicum annium</hi>—it flowers annually, and is different from <hi rend="italic">capsicum frutescent</hi>—several kinds are used for making cayenne-pepper—the cayenne-pepper I found would account for the red patches in the stomach, and also for the presence of the quantity of bile which there was there, and for the absence of food, because being a powerful irritant, I think it likely to have created very violent vomiting, which is accompanied by a regurgilation of bile into the stomach, bile not being naturally found there—I examined this large bottle, No. 1, labelled "The mixture, take a table-spoonful four times a day, and two pills night and morning"—it is a twelve ounce bottle—it contained six and a half ounces of a brownish liquid, which on standing, separated into two portions; a quantity of vegetable matter which subsided, and a clear liquid which was a solution of cayenne-pepper—the rest was powder which subsided to the bottom of the bottle—the vegetable matter was so broken up that I was unable to ascertain by microscopic examination what it was—the cayenne-pepper was rather a strong solution as was ascertained by its taste, and by proportion which I obtained by evaporation—I am a medical man, but not a member of the College of Physicians, at least I am qualified, but do not practise—I practised some fifteen years ago, but have ceased to do so—in my judgment that mixture would not be a proper medicine to give to a person suffering from acute inflammation of the hip-joint—it would be in<lb/>jurions—this six ounce bottle, No. 2, called" The gargle," contained four and a half ounces of a brownish liquid—it contains spirits of wine and cayenne<lb/>pepper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090034"/>
               <p>—bottle No. 3, which the boy's father gave him when he was dying is nothing but liquorice-water—the pill-box contained thirty-two pills, weighing two and a half grains each, consisting of assafortida, or gal<lb/>bula, a resinous matter like jalap, and a quarter of their weight of plaster of Paris and chalk—they would not have a tendency to increase inflammation. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you not know that there is a prevailing opinion that cayeune or capsicum is a very useful remedy; I do not mean among graduates of the University, or the College of Physicians, but is it not among the masses very largely taken? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, I can only answer from my experience, and I have had four cases of Inquests in which I have had to inquire into it, therefore I speak from my experience, and say there may he among the masses a prevailing opinion that cayenne-pepper, and <hi rend="italic">lobelia inflata</hi>, are good remedies for serious diseases, and I found my opinion upon the fact that I have had to investigate five cases of poisoning by lobelia and cayenne-pepper—I do not know that there have been cases in which my judgment has turned out to be very much at fault—I was not entirely in error in the case of Mr. Sheridan, the arsenic test; allow me to explain, in the case that we are referring to, there was evidence that a powder was taken out of a man's pocket and thrown into a fire, and that there was a blue flame, I thought it was therefore an important question whether the person had thrown in a paper containing arsenic; the experiment was made by me in the presence of a great number of chemists well qualified to form an opinion, and we found that it does burn with a blue flame, though a gentleman, who had perhaps never made an experiment before in his life, came into Court and gave evidence that he did not get the blue flame, but that does not prove that I was at fault—I am giving the absolutely right version—Sir Benjamin Brodie did not give a different opinion, nor was the man's life saved upon that; the man was acquitted—there was no medical opinion on the case or question of it—it is not the general opinion of the profession that I was wrong, and if you had that opinion before, let me disabuse your mind of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the immediate cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The pain and inflammation had created great exhaustion and, as I take it, the vomit<lb/>ing: he died of exhaustion, following on intense inflammation—the inflammation caused the exhaustion, and the exhaustion caused the death; the inflammation being partly natural and partly artificial; natural from the hip-joint, and artificial from the cayenne.</p>

I forget the proportions, but I think it was eight grains, contained in nearly a pint of gruel; the evidence of the medical man, Mr. Tolman, was that the person had vomited up to half an hour of death, taking that into consideration, and as I had found nearly a pint of gruel in his stomach, and eight grains of arsenic, my opinion was that it had been taken within three hours: upon that the Judge made</p>

               <p>some powerful observations, that as nobody had had access to the man but the woman, it must have been administered by her, and whether I was right in saying that the gruel might not have been there more than three hours.</p>

I am a militia-man, and live at Parson's-green, Fulham—on Monday morning, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> April, there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on in the lane near my house—two or three persons were setting on my father; the prisoner was one of them—I went and pulled the prisoner off, and got my father away—the prisoner followed us, and said that as I pulled him off my father he would have it out of me—he said to my father, "I will not touch you, but I will catch hold of your bson"—he made a bounce at me, and I put up my leg to stop him—I was then at my own door, and he ran in at me, but I got away then—he did not hit me then, but he had a long thing in his hand about a foot long—my mother hallooed out, "He has got something in his hand"—he gave the long thing to another person, and then he put his hand in his pocket, making a noise in his pocket—he ran in at me in the passage, caught hold of me, and I thought he was punching me, but he was stabbing me all the time—he gave me five on the head, one on the ear, one on the neck, and one on the left side—I felt blood coming, and hallooed out, "Father, I am stabbed"—I had eight stabs altogether; seven of them after I was down, and when I hallooed "Murder!" he gave me another, and chucked the knife away—I was ill from the stabs, and was in the hospital nine days—the doctor attends me now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 1 o'clock in the morning—my father was at the top of the lane, about a hundred yards from where we live; he was about twenty yards from me when I was stabbed, and</p>

               <p>my mother was outside my door, holding a candle about five yards off—it is a small street—I was in bed when account came that my father was in a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and I got up, and put my working clothes on—I put up my foot, and ticked at the prisoner before I was stabbed, but I did not kick him—he swore by the cross that he would have my life that night, and heaved a stone at me—I do not know what it was he took out of his pocket, but I think it was a poker, he afterwards took out a penknife; I saw him pull it out—my father was quite sober—I heard that the people were punching him, and went and pulled the prisoner off him—this was Saturday night; my father is a labourer, and had received his wages—my mother had gone to bed, and so had I—the prisoner said that he would have my life, about the same time that he passed the poker to the other man—I was frightened of course—I swear that my father did not attack the prisoner; he never touched him—the prisoner left me because I hallooed out that I was stabbed; he got up, and ran out into the street, and said, "I am stabbed, I am stabbed," but he was not; it was me that was stabbed—he stabbed me with a pocket-knife—I struggled with him to try to get away from him—I had not the knife in my hand—I tried to get it away from him, but it was no use—he chucked away the knife, and my mother picked it up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Fulham—on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> April I was sent for to attend the prosecutor in Crown-street—I found four distinct incised wounds on his head, made by cutting, one on his right ear, one on his neck, and one on his left side—he was weak and exhausted from loss of blood—the wounds were in dangerous places, and might have proved dan<lb/>gerous; for instance, the wound in his side might have penetrated his chest—I only saw him that once, and recommended his being removed to the hospital—the wounds might be caused by this knife—I went to the station-house the same night and examined the prisoner—he was not drunk; he had a slight wound on his face, and one on his hand—I do not think they were caused by any instrument.</p>

I am a City detective-officer—previous to Monday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> May, I received some directions from Mr. Sims, who is a looking-glass manu<lb/>facturer; and on that morning I went to his premises, 150, Aldersgate-street, about 3 o'clock—I had the keys, and let myself into the counting-house, which runs by the side of the gateway—I then fastened up the premises; we had seen every window secure on the Sunday—I placed myself where I had a view of the roof of the premises at the back—I remained there till about 6 o'clock, when the gates were opened by Mr. Burton's foreman to let the men into some other premises adjoining—about ten minutes past 6 the prisoner Ansell came up to the gateway with his hat and coat on; he went down the gateway, and returned at about twenty minutes past 6, with a white cap and white apron on, and his shirt-sleeves turned up, without the hat and coat—he ascended a pair of steps on to a ladder that was placed against a wall at the back part of Mr. Sima's premises, got on to the roof,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090039"/>
               <p>and I could see him go along, through the skylight, till I lost sight of him—in about three or four minutes after that he came to the outer counting house door, with a key in his hand—I could see him through a glass panel; he apparently unlocked the door, entered, came towards me, and then turned to the private counting-house door, the first door up the gateway—he could not see me at all; I was in the inner counting-house—he went direct to the door and unbolted two bolts from the inside, he stood in the passage, and about three minutes afterwards Beaumont came by the win<lb/>dow to the door; Ansell opened the door for him, closed it again, and they both went out through the outer counting-house into the warehouse—I saw them distinctly—they were then out of my sight about a quarter of an hour—I heard them coming very slowly, as if carrying something towards the outer counting-house door from the warehouse—I saw them again; Beau<lb/>mont came into the door first, carrying one end of that load in that canvas bag; Ansell had hold of the other end—they came towards me, and then turned to the private counting-house door, which led to the gateway—I was still out of their sight, but could see them—when they got to the door one of Mr. Burton's men passed the window, which caused them to retreat to my hiding-place—they came to the door where I was, and tried to open it, and at last I was compelled to open the door upon them, and I caught hold of both by the shirt-sleeves, as well as I was able—Beaumont had no coat on—I had a very desperate struggle with them, and Ansell lifted up his fist as if to strike me—I said, "Mind what you are about, I have assistance here at hand"—after a struggle I got into the gateway with them, and called on some of Mr. Burton's men for assistance, but they thought I was the burglar at first, and not the prisoners—in struggling with Beaumont in the gateway I fell over; it was very slippery—Pavitt and Rowland were outside; they saw me pursuing the prisoners, and Pavitt went after Beaumont and I fol<lb/>lowed Ansell, through Bartholomew-close, through a coffee-shop, where I was stopped on the way, into Smithfield—I took him there, and handed him over to another officer—I went back to the prosecutor's premises, to see them safe, and put an officer in charge to protect them—I then, in company with Mr. Sims and Mr. Strickland, ascended to the upper part of the premises—we found a plank placed across at the back, from the roof to the wall, and above the plank was a step fastened by nails against the side of the wall, under the window—the slates were very much broken, and the upper part of the window in the joiner's shop was unfastened—I am quite sure that that window was closed and secured on the Sunday, and the doors also. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was it that Beaumont came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between twenty-three and twenty-four minutes past 6—the premises had been watched before, but not by me—Burton's men come to work at 6 o'clock—there are a great many men employed by him—they have to go through a different way to Mr. Burton's premises; one is a doorway, and the other a gateway—the door that Ansell unbolted was a private door which led into Mr. Sims's private counting house—I don't know how long Ansell has been employed by Mr. Sims—I said I was a police-officer in the first instance, but Beaumont knew me as an officer—when he turned to the door he had his back towards me, but in carrying the load he had his face towards me—I was at that time facing the door, and facing them as they came towards me.</p>

I am a City detective officer—about twenty minutes past 3 on the afternoon of 4th May, I saw the prisoner in St. Mary Axe, with a dealer whom I knew—I saw them turn up a narrow court, called Brown's-buildings—at that time the prisoner was carrying a bundle—I fol-lowed just behind them up the court, and saw them turn into a recess, where the court suddenly gets wider—I stepped back into a doorway; just as I did so, two females, also dealers, went up to them, and the man dealer pushed them away, with an oath, and said, "You don't want to buy stolen goods"—the females thereupon left, and so did the prisoner—I was in private clothes at the time as I am now—the dealer followed the prisoner up the court through into Bury-street—I followed them up to the top of Bury-street,</p>

               <p>when the dealer turned round and saw me coming—he immediately leant on a post as though nothing had occurred, and the prisoner went on into Castle-street, Houndsditch, still carrying the bundle—I followed and stopped him—I told him I was an officer, and said, "What have you in that bundle?" he said, "I do not know what it is"—I said, "Where did you get it?" he said, "I picked it up"—I said, "Where?" he said, "In Cannon-street"—I said, "How long since?" he said, "About a quarter of an hour"—I said, "Your explanation is unsatisfactory to me, you must come with me to the station"—on our way there I said, "When you picked it up, was it in the same state it is now?" he said, "This is my handkerchief that is round it, when I picked it up there was nothing round it"—on our arrival at the station I examined the contents of the bundle; it contained this piece of woollen cloth; this ticket was on it at the time; "191/2 cut "is written on it in pencil, and it bears the number "9998," and at the bottom "483/4 yards" in ink—I asked the prisoner where he worked, and he said he had been employed at Arthur Kay and Evans's, in Cannon-street, up to 3 o'clock that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a rough carpenter, of Union-road, Battersea—I received a double-barrelled gun from Henry Turner in January, with the right lock broken—he wanted me to repair it—the name of Smith was on the lock—the right-hand barrel was so worn, that if you did not mind when you were loading it, it would cut your fingers, but the left was not worn a quarter so much—it was on the Saturday fortnight after Christmas—I asked Henry where he got it, if it had come from the same place as another he had—he said, "No, that gun came from a little farm close to Ashford station"—I asked what farm; he said "A cow keeper's place"—William came in, and said that he soon whipped a pane of glass out while his brother was looking round, and got in and struck a match—late in the evening I saw Evans, but hardly had any conversation with him—the stock of the gun was walnut stained, and there were two V's which Henry pointed out to me that he had made into W's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am called Minnie Wilson—a person called Thomas Howard was charged before the Magistrate, and I attended as a wit<lb/>ness; not upon the first occasion. I am the person whom Howard was charged with taking away—in March, 1862 I was living with my father. I met How-ard at that time near St. Paul's Churchyard—I had been to an office to look for a situation—he ultimately induced me to go to the Haymarket, and told me that he would marry me. He said first that he knew a lady who wanted a young girl to serve in the shop—believing that, I went to the Haymarket, and I was there introduced to some lady—I stayed with Howard after that I had some cake and wine in the afternoon, and then I felt stupified and powerless, and in the morning, when I woke, I found myself in bed with Howard—my clothes were taken away—I remained with him some time</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090057"/>
               <p>after that He afterwards charged me at the police court with robbing him—the Magistrates dismissed the charge, and directed a warrant to issue against Howard—he was taken into custody, and I was subpœnaed as a wit-ness—I was to appear on the Thursday following, and I did not. I had a summons—I have not got it now—I think it was on the 26th March—I first saw the prisoner while Howard was on remand—I first saw him on the Tuesday as Howard was remanded the Saturday before—I had never seen him before that—I saw him in Coventry Street, about three in the afternoon. He asked me if my name was Minnie Wilson—I said it was—he said, "I have come from Mr. Howard; do <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> intend appearing against him?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Oh I don't appear against him; you shall have as much money as you like, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." and he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some gold—I cannot say how much—I told him. again that I should appear, and he asked me if I would meet him that night about nine o'clock in the Haymarket, No. 51, where Howard lived, and I was to think whether I should appear against him—I did not go, but I saw the prisoner again the next day—he came along Coventry Street and met me—he asked me again if I intended appearing against Howard—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Let me beg of you again, with tears in my eyes, not to appear against him; you will blast his prospects for ever"—he said, if I would not, he would give me money to go down to Hereford that night, and he was sure Howard would marry me—he offered me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I was to go to Hereford to be a long way off, so that I should not go against Howard—he said Howard's, friends lived at Hereford—I knew that before—I did not agree to that—then he told me that Howard was almost dying, and that was the reason I did not appear against him on that Thursday, that was the day after the conversation—I did not appear because I believed Howard to be very ill—I saw the prisoner afterwards with Howard's friends, but I did not speak to him—he came up to me once and said I should have to give evidence against him, or something of that sort, but he would <hi rend="italic">lick</hi> me—I saw him on the Thursday at Howard's place, but I had nothing to say to him then—I was going by, and was called in by a man in the shop—that was the day I ought to have appeared—I went down stain and saw the prisoner and some other gentleman, who said he had come there to take possession of the place—no conversation took place between me and the prisoner then—Sergeant Appleton came down stairs and saw the prisoner on that occasion—I appeared as a witness against Howard on the Thursday following—I don't know the day of the month.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On 31st March, I went to Howard's house, between nine and ten in the evening, and saw the prisoner and the last witness, Wilson, in the kitchen of the house. I asked the prisoner who he was—he told me his name was Tiptaff—I told him I should take him to the station on a charge of tampering with the witness Wilson, and trying to persuade her not to appear against Howard—he said nothing then—when at the station he was asked his name and address, and the inspector on duty said to him, "I am sorry to see you here; I have cautioned you about this before; I have seen you in Howard's house"—the prisoner said, "I am very sorry; I have lost my place through it; I did it all out of kindness; the money I received from Howard was in order to get him out of trouble and arrange his affairs"—he said he was a warder at the House of Detention, and I found that to be so—he was a temporary warder there on approba-tion—I have seen him there in uniform—Howard was confined there.</p>

                  </hi>. I was second officer on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Scawfell</hi>, bound from Japan to England—on Thursday, 21st April, I was residing at the Sailors' Home, in Wells-street; and on that day, I met the prisoner Russell on Tower-hill—I asked him the way to the shipping master's office, and he pointed me out the direction; and he said, "I am a stranger in London myself; I have been a farmer. I have sold my farm, and am going to Australia on the 30th"—he then asked me to take a glass of ale with him, and I went with him to a public-house, and had some ale—from there I went to the shipping office, leaving him at the corner of the public-house—having transacted my business at the shipping office, I came back, and found him where I had left him—I went back to the public-house again with him, and had some ale or wine; I believe it was ale—whilst we were drinking, Lofts came in—he spoke to Russell—I don't remember how he opened the conversation; but he said he had been a farmer, and had just come from the country to see London; and that he had given a man a sovereign to show him about, and he had robbed him of it—the prisoners talked together some time—I did not take notice what they said then—Lofts said he was the biggest man about his part of the country—he said, he could throw a weight of fourteen or eighteen pounds, I forget which, eighteen or twenty yards—Russell said he could not, and I said the same, I believe—he then offered to bet Russell 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he would do so—they then asked me if I would go to see it done, and we all went in a cab together—after I got in the cab, I found I had a nasty headache, and seemed as if I had been drinking a great deal of spirits, which I had not done, and I could not account for it—after we had been driving about for a long while, they stopped at a beer-shop, or a public-house; where it was, I can't say—they took me to the rear of the house, where there was a skittle-alley—they then said they could not heave there, the place had been inclosed, or something like that—there was a third man there, who is at large—then skittles was proposed—I can't remember who proposed it—I refused to play—playing commenced between them, and they bet upon one another for a long while—after a time, I bet, and I lost 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Lofts then proposed to play me at a game of skittles for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said I had not enough money, but I would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090060"/>
               <p>draw the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I would get a bill and lay it on, or get the money from the bankers—I then went in a cab with the other man who is at large, to the Sailors' Home, in Wells street, and got a bill for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my desk there—this was all on the Friday—I got my wages on the Friday morning I lost them—that was the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and it was after I had lost that that I went to Wells-street to get the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—at this time, I was like a man half-drunk—I was stupid; neither drunk nor sober—I saw the principal things that went on, but I could not remember the different circumstances, or the places where I went to—when I got the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, I took it back to Lofts—he would not take it; he said he wanted gold for gold, and notes for notes—it was payable at Robarts', who were agents for my bankers at Plymouth—the third man went with me to Robarts', but we could not get the money—Lofts then proposed that I should telegraph to my bankers at Plymouth, and all four of us went to the telegraph office together—Lofts went into the station with me, and I telegraphed to the bankers to send money to their agents to permit me to draw some money on the bill—I got an answer to that, stating, that they could not do any banking business by telegraph—then one or the other proposed that they should go down with me to Plymouth by express train that night, to draw the money—I think it was Russell proposed that—I went down to Plymouth that night with Russell, and on the Satur<lb/>day morning I went to the bank, presented my bill, and got 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—Russell waited outside the bank—the notes were given to me in three bundles of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and one bundle of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; four parcels altogether—I only half cashed the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—I put them in my trowsers pocket—I had 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a sealed parcel in sovereigns, which I took down with me, and which I had had ever since I left Japan—I changed it out there—Russell and I then went back to Loudon—when we got to the Paddington station I saw the third man, who is not here—we went to an hotel where we found Lofts—I don't know what that place was—all four of us got into a cab to go and play this game of skittles—I had recovered from this stupefying effect—I was not drunk; it was forty-eight hours afterwards—I saw nothing wrong with them then; they behaved very properly—we went to the house where we had been before, and the landlord said the alley was engaged, and we could not play there—they then proposed betting, which I refused—at last we went to different places to look for an alley, and at each place they wanted me to play at pitch and toss, or bet, which I refused to do on all occasions—we then went to the "Prince Albert," Old Ford, which is near the police-station—they said they could get a skittle-alley there—after some time they proposed betting again, and a bottle of sherry was called for—I went out to see the landlord to show me the skittle-ground—I did not drink anything before I went out—when I came back I sat down again, and Lofts offered me a glass of sherry, which I drank part of—they were playing pitch and toss, and betting, and they wanted me to do so—I refused for a long while; ultimately I did bet—I can't remember what it was, but I know it was nothing over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lost it, and in the play I saw that Lofts was cheating, and I made the remark that he was cheating—Lofts then said, I will give you the first toss for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I then put one of the four parcels of notes on the table (the remainder were in my pocket at the time), and he put this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and said, "There is my hundred pounds"—the contents were not opened out—we tossed, and I won—I was going to take the bag when Lofts said, "Oh, no; I have two more chances for it"—directly I found him cheating again I immediately put my hand into my pocket, and found the remainder of the notes were all gone—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186405090061"/>
               <p>I then said, "You have robbed me, I will call the police"—Lofts then grabbed up his beg and my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with one band, and knocked my wine-glass off the table with the other, and the other two men jumped out of the window—I collared Lofts by the throat; we had a very heavy struggle together, and I ultimately got him under me, and I sang out for the police; a fourth man then came in—I asked him to assist me, and he came over and pulled me off Lofts, and they both escaped out of the window together—looked on the ground directly, and saw my purse, which I had dropped in the struggle, with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and some other money in it, and some papers—I then rushed to the door and can after them, singing out that I had been robbed—they got out of the window into a yard, and then over a gate eight feet high at the very lowest—I came out at the door——I next saw them at the police-station—directly after I reached there I saw them searched, and these parcels of notes were produced; they are the same as I received from my bankers at Plymouth—they were not tied up then; they were in parcels—there is 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here now—I felt the other notes safe at the moment—I took the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my pocket to stake against Lofts 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Lofts said, "I will give you the first toss for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I won the first toss, and said, "I have won it,"—to the best of my recollection those were the words used—we were then in the room behind the bar—Lofts was sitting at the same table, opposite to me, within arm's length; it was a small narrow table, a common taproom table—I consider, by the headache I bad, and the state I was in, that it could not have happened from the drink I had had—my head was aching very heavily at that time, but I was in such a state as to know what was going on—I could distinctly see and understand what was doing, I had my senses about me—this public-house was not a great distance from the police-station.</p>

I did not go to commit felony; I merely went to ask Jones the reason for discharging me. As he was coming upstairs I was going to ask, and because I could not get a word he seized me and we both fell. He fell on the barrel instead of my throwing it upon him. The handkerchiefs were then round my neck; he pulled both off. I wore the blue Guernsey all the time. "</p>

                  </hi>.

I live at 14, Marlborough-road, High-street, Peckham—on Tuesday-morning, 19th April, about 1 o'clock, I was going home with my brother over the canal bridge, close by the prosecutor's, and saw three men under the public house window, about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's—just as we came close to them they crossed over the road a little in advance of us, and stood all three together till we came up to them, when they turned in against the wall—we passed them—the prisoners are two of them—I made a remark to my brother as we passed.</p>

I live with my brother, the last witness—on the Tues<lb/>day morning I was with him, going home, about ten minutes to one o'clock, and saw three men standing directly under the Langdale Arms, Hill Street, Peckham—there was a lamp very close, and it was a very light night—they crossed the road, and walked to a wall on the opposite side of the way, and turned their faces to the wall—I turned my head back till I got right out of their sight, and noticed their faces. Spanton was one—I identified him at the police court—he was the nearest to me—Harbert I should not like to swear to, his dress corresponds with that of the man I saw, but his face I did not see sufficiently to swear to.</p>

I keep a coffee-stand in Blackman-street, Southwark—I have a residence in William-street, Newington-causeway—I left there at 12 on Monday night, 25th April—I left my family in bed—I pulled the door to; it closes with a spring lock—I was in the habit of doing that every night, at that time—I returned at half-past 4 on the morning of 26th—as I turned the corner of the street, which is about thirty yards from my door, I saw the prisoner standing with my door open, half way in and half way out—I went up to the door and asked him what he was doing—he rolled away shamming to be intoxicated, and made no reply—I then saw another man get out from my next door neighbour's—the prisoner then ran away; I ran after him nearly to London-bridge, but could get no tidings of him—I came back and went as far as the Rockingham Arms, when I saw him again—he ran away; I ran after him across the road, and gave him into the custody of a policeman—I am quite certain there was no key in my door, and am quite certain that I pulled it to, as I am in the habit of doing.</p>
