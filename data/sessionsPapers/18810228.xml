I carry on business at 4, Finsbury Circus—I am secretary to an Italian sulphur company—I kept an account at the Royal Exchange Bank, Cornhill—no part of this acceptance is my writing—I never authorised the prisoner or any one to sign it for me; I always sign my own cheques—I first ascertained about 10th or 12th December that it had been paid at the bank and entered to my account—I imme<lb/>diately wrote to the prisoner to call on me; be did not come—Mr. Mobbs, a friend of his, called about two days afterwards; I had a conversation with him—afterwards a warrant was obtained by the bank—on 13th May, 1879, the prisoner applied to me by this letter to make him an advance of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on a bill at three months; it was sent in to me while I was at a board meeting, and I wrote on the back of it that I could not procure him anybody else's acceptance, but he might have mine—he thereupon drew on me for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which bill matured on 30th August—I have here the entry, "My acceptance to Crewe, he to pay 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he was to meet the bill either by payment of the money in or by withdrawing the bill <hi rend="italic">from</hi> circulation, which he did; it was never presented; I never had the slightest benefit from it—according to the entry in my diary that bill was renewed for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at two months; therefore I presume he was not in a position to meet it—the 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was due on 1st November, 1879—on that occasion it was retired by a payment of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and renewed at 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that became due on 9th December; it was paid into my bankers, that being the only bill that was presented there—I handed that bill to Mr. Mobbs, at his request—there is not the slightest truth in the sugges-tion that I authorised the prisoner to sign my name, or that he was to pay in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to meet this bill.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 127, High Street, Putney, and am a clerk in the South Western Railway Company—on Tuesday night, 25th January, about 11.30 I was going along the Strand with my wife, to the Waterloo Station, from the direction of Temple Bar—at the corner of Arundel Street I saw a hansom cab coming towards me from the west—it was just on the City side of the Opera Comique Theatre, by a builder's hoarding—it was coming at a reckless canter close to the kerb—the cab was swinging a great deal—it nearly ran into a lamp-post on the oppo<lb/>site aide to me—that was oil his proper side, his near side—it then came more out into the middle of the road—I watched it till it got opposite me, and directly opposite to where I stood the shaft of the cab hit a gentle-man forwards, away from a lady he was with—the wheel came along, knocked the lady down, rind the cab went over her, and afterwards over the gentleman—I am not certain whether the Wheel went over him, but the cab did—they were about two and a half or three yards front the kerb—the cab continued to go on in the same style, and about thirty yards after it had passed me the cabman's hat fell off into the road—I continued to watch the cab till I lost sight of it by the church, in the traffic—the cabman was standing up on the board it the back of the cab—the reins were as they would be if a man was loosely driving, or urging—the reins were slaek—I did not see him do anything to pull up or try to stop the horse—I do not believe he altered the pace from the time I first saw him to the time I lost sight of him—I then crossed the road—the gentleman had been picked up by some persons—I picked up the lady and held her in my arms—she said her leg was hurt—a policeman took her away in a hansom—I gave information to the police two days afterwards—I do not recognise the prisoner—on Saturday, the 19th February, I went to a cab rank in Tottenham Court Road with Inspector O'Callaghan, and there recognised the horse that I had seen in the cab on the night in question—it was a very extroardinary looking horse—it had been clipped—there were three persons inside the cab on the night in question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not give information to the police on the same night, my wife was with me and I had to catch a train—I had not seen any published bills when I gave the information on the 27th—I left my card at Bow Street on the 27th, and I wrote to the Criminal Investiga<lb/>tion department at Scotland Yard, having seen a paragraph in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> that it would be taken as at favour if certain persons would com<lb/>municate with the police—I had no reply to that, and on about the 15th or 16th of this month I spoke to the police at Putney and I be<lb/>lieve</p>

               <p>they telegraphed, and Inspector O'Callaghan came down to see me—I do not think I mentioned on the first examination before the Magistrate anything in reference to the slack reins—I was not asked—you asked me on the second examination whether I noticed anything particular with the harness, and I said yes, I noticed the reins were slack, and they should have been tight—I knew nothing about the reward of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being offered on conviction—I do not expect any reward—I expect to be out of pocket—I first saw the cab at about 80 yards' distance—it was coming along at the same speed then as when it knocked down these people—there was nothing to intercept my view—it was particularly clear—there was a block at Temple Bar—it was a very light night—there were a great many lamps and the shops were open—I lost sight of the cab at the corner of St. Clement's Church—he was still standing up with the reins in his hand—he was not whipping the horse or pulling it up—I did not notice whether the breeching was undone.</p>

About half-past eleven on the night of 25th January I was on duty at the east end of St. Clement's Church—I heard a noise, and then saw a hansom cab being driven towards me, going towards the City—the prisoner was driving—it was coming at a great pace; galloping; coming as fast as possible—the horse fell almost directly opposite Essex Street, close to the flags; the near side; the proper side—the prisoner had no hat on—he was sitting down—he appeared to me to be doing all he could to pull up—there were three young midshipmen about 16 or 17 years of age in the cab—they jumped out and ran towards the City—they did not speak to me, or give me any information—I went up as the prisoner was about getting off the cab—a gentleman came up and said "This cabman has knocked a gentleman down in the Strand"—I asked him whether he had witnessed it—he said "Yes"—I asked him for his name and address—he said "It has nothing to do with me"—he did not give it—I said to the prisoner "You have knocked down a gentleman in the Strand"—he said "No, I have not knocked down any one, there you are"—I asked him where his hat was—he said "It blew off a little way down the Strand"—I asked why he was driving so fast—he said "It is a high-spirited horse, and the breeching got under the feet and threw it down"—the horse was got up while I was there—I noticed that the breeching was broken—I thought it was broken by the horse falling down; it could not have got under the horse's feet and thrown it down—I took the number of the cab, 6,774, and the prisoner's badge was 11,381—when the horse got up the prisoner took it to the cabman's shelter—he was perfectly sober, but excited.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard the shouting, and in consequence of that I went into the roadway—that enabled me to have a clear view towards the Strand—when I first saw the cab it was just opposite Milford Lane, between Essex Street and Arundel Street—the prisoner was doing all he could to pull up the horse—I had not noticed the harness till the horse fell—I could not say how long he stopped at the cabman's shelter; I saw him there for some few minutes—it was rather a dark night.</p>

               <p>Court Road—the prisoner did not bring the cab home with him on the morning of the 26th—he said the hone had run away; it got the best of him, or something to that effect—it was one of the quietest, most docile horses that any one could sit behind, with quiet usage; if you knock him about he will get restive, and perhaps get the best of you—he is quiet over a railway, and not timid of the noise of anything like that—the prisoner only drove for me on that one day—I knew nothing of him before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have described the horse as "light-hearted"—he is a good-bred horse, a nervous horse—the prisoner said he had left the cab over Waterloo Bridge, at the first lamp-post on the right—I asked if he had run over anything or hurt anybody—he said "No," there was nothing broken, only the two shafts—he said the horse had got the best of him; that he went to the cabman's shelter to get some string, and he supposed the string must have broken, and that made him kick again, and, to prevent further accident, he ran against the lamp-post, and two police-men came up—I have had the horse seven or eight months—I don't think he would be likely to be upset by three noisy young fellows in the cab, unless they hit him, or touched him with a stick; then he would go away, and you would have to pull him in hard to stop him.</p>

I live at 186, Bromsgrove Street, Birming<lb/>ham, and am a shopkeeper—I have a brother named Henry Shorthouse; I saw him on Monday morning last; he lives close to me—I was present at St. Warburg's Church, Derby, when he was married to the prisoner, then Georgians Hassell—they lived together about two years and nine months—the last time I saw the prisoner before I saw her at the police-court was at my house in Birmingham, about four years ago—my brother was living in Birmingham at that time.</p>

I am an unfortunate girl—I did live at 5, Rich Street, Limehouse; I am now living at No. 3—I have known the prisoner about three years—she lives in Nelson Court, about two minutes' walk from me—I have been away from London for a long time—on the 28th January, about 20 minutes to 10 at night, I came out of the Eastern Hall, in the West India Dock Road, and was between there and the Oporto—I can't speak positively to the time to a few minutes, but it was between 20 minutes and half-past 10, for I was at home by half-past—as I passed along I saw the prisoner standing under a lamp outside the Eastern Hotel—I did not speak to her—I am quite sure it was her—I felt some liquid thrown over me—I did not know what it was—it fell over my ulster and bonnet; none of it touched my face—I believed at the time it was water, or some slush—it was a snowy night—I walked home, and took off my things as usual—about 2 o'clock I went to brush them, as they were muddy, and then found they were marked all in yellow spots—I had had a quarrel with the prisoner before this—she had used violent language to me several times—she had told me she would strike me, and do one thing and another to me—I lived in her house, at one time—she keeps a house of ill fame—I took my ulster and bonnet to Mr. Hatfield's, a chemist, and asked him what it was.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "October 10th, 1880, 22, Smith Street, Clerkenwell. Dear Sir,—I want you to oblige me by keeping those things I left at your place last Saturday, till I see you again.

You will hear from me about Monday evening, or first thing Tuesday morning. Oblige me, and I shall take it as a great favour. I am, faithfully yours, G. Oliver.") I found Oliver there, in bed—I told him I should take him into custody for stealing a quantity of jewellery and other articles on the 26th October—he said "I do not know anything about it"—I then went into another room, where the prisoner's father was—the father said in the prisoner's presence "The goods were brought here by a man named Alexander, which my son sold to Aaronson"—the prisoner said "That is true"—upon further search I found the rug produced—he said Alexander also gave him that—I asked him where Alexander lived?—he said he knew where he did live, but he had removed, and he did not know where he was living now.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to this indictment—from May to 26th October last year I was employed by Mr. Bromet—previous to the 8th September I had known Alexander—on that day I was outside my master's premises with a trap; it was loaded with jewellery—I waited there two hours whilst it was loaded; I spoke to Alexander—a porter put a bag of jewellery on the front; Alexander asked me what the bag con<lb/>tained—the bag was left there—three days afterwards I missed it; I told my employers—I drove the trap all day, and put it up at night—three days afterwards Alexander came by and took it off the trap; I was standing against the horse—he went away with it; I reported it to my master—I saw Alexander the next morning; I had conversations with him—I saw Oliver in Petticoat Lane; Alexander was with me; Oliver spoke to him; I did not know Oliver then—I heard Alexander ask Oliver what he dealt in; Oliver said "Buying and selling"—Alexander said "I have something I can sell you," and they made an appointment for the next day—I saw Oliver two or three days after in the St. John's Road; he said "I am going to Black's, to get some money for some goods I have left up there"—afterwards he said he had sold some goods to a man named Aaronson; he did not say what Aaronson had given him, Alexander always paid me—Alexander was there—on 7th October my master ordered me to go to Brixton with the trap—I drove round to Smith Street, Clerkenwell; I do not know the number, it was a beer-house—Alexander asked me to go; I saw Alexander, not Oliver at all, on that occasion—a bag of jewellery was inside the trap; I opened the trap, and gave Alexander the bag—he took it in the beerhouse—I went back to my master, and made a statement—the next morning I went to Alexander's lodgings in Berkeley Court—I saw Alexander and Oliver in bed together; I asked them whether they had got the bag; Oliver said it was in Alexander's box, and that they had not got rid of it yet—they showed me the bag—Oliver said he would take the goods to Mr. Aaronson and sell them—I saw them again on the Sunday morning; they said they had taken the bag to Aaronson's, and got 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it; but they had not</p>

I am clerk to the prosecutor—on the 25th October I was present when there was a conversation between Mr. Boyce and the prisoner—I was at a table, writing—Mr. Boyce first asked him if the bill was all right that was due that day—he said "Yes, that is all in order"—he said he had come down about more wood—Mr. Boyce said "Before going into the question of any more wood, I have suffered some very heavy losses lately, and I intend to avoid them in future; therefore, I should like to know something about your posi<lb/>tion, as I am not at all satisfied about your borrowing money to meet these bills"—he then stated that his position was very good; that he had a lot of money owing on his books; that he was doing a good busi<lb/>ness; that he. was the owner of two good houses, and this was a little temporary pressure in consequence of his having to provide a sum of money, as he was about taking a public-house, and he might be called upon at any moment to complete the purchase, and also that he had to take up a bill of one of his customers, which had caused him to be rather short at the bank, but he should be all right in a few days; that he was doing a very good business, and getting good prices, and there was no fear at all of Mr. Boyce trusting him—Mr. Boyce then told him that he had better go out on the wharf and select what wood he wanted—on the 18th, after the bill of the 17th had been dishonoured, I went to the prisoner's house by Mr. Boyce's direction—I told him it was a very serious matter for Mr. Boyce his not meeting that bill, and what did he propose to do—he said "I can propose nothing; things have been so bad with me lately that I shall have shortly to call a meeting of credi<lb/>tors"—I asked him what had become of the goods—he said "All worked up and sent out"—I said "Have you no stock at all?"—he said "No, nothing to speak of"—I said "Then you must have a large amount owing on your books?"—he said "Yes, I have, but I don't think it would realise much"—I asked what amount he owed—he said "Altogether about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I suppose Mr. Boyce is the prin<lb/>cipal creditor?"—he said "Oh no; I owe Mr. Williams about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. besides in small debts, amounting altogether, with Mr. Boyce's debt, to about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I asked what Mr. Williams's debt was for?—he said "Money lent"—I said "I suppose he holds security?"—he said "No, he does not; he holds no security; I had none to give him; I should have given him a bill of sale on my furniture, but I owed three quarters' rent, about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., therefore the bill of sale would have been of no use"—I then asked what had become of the two houses he spoke of when he was last at the wharf—he said he did not say two, only one, and that was mortgaged to its full value—I then asked what had become of the public-house he was about taking—he said that had been misrepresented to him, and that had fallen through; he would not have anything to do with it—the four frames which he said he had, and those which he bought from Mr. Boyce that day, when they were worked up, would be worth about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I live at 120, High Street, Deptford—I am a surgeon—I was called about 6.45 p.m. on 7th February to see Mr. Edwards; I found him lying on the sofa, bleeding profusely from the head and face—on examining him I found two major wounds; the temple artery was severed on the left side—there were also numerous small wounds; they were dangerous in their effects, but not in themselves; they may bring on erysipelas—he is improving, but not out of danger—I attended his wife; she died of apoplexy—the immediate cause of death was excitement.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi>). On Tuesday 1st February, from information I received, I communicated with Detectives Francis and Craggs, and went with them to the Greenwich Marshes—we kept ob<lb/>servation on Bethel's Wharf—we got there about 9 p.m., and remained until about 1.30 the next morning—there was a barge lying there at the time we arrived, about 50 yards below the wharf on the same side, anchored, I believe—about 1.30 we saw the barge row towards Bethel's Wharf; it came alongside, and I saw Donovan and Clark land six sacks of oats and push them down to the wharf, then they rowed towards London Bridge—I procured the assistance of two officers and went on a barge, and overtook them at Deptford—I told them I should take them into custody for stealing six sacks of oats—Donovan replied "I have lost eight sacks"—pointing to the corner at the head of the barge he said "There are three gone from here, and no doubt there are three gone from there; I have worked for Mr. Keen eight years, and this is the first time"—we took them to Park Bow Station—Clark made no statement at that time—the barge was left at anchor, in charge of a Thames officer—afterwards, when I was in the station, Wood was brought in—he said "I should know the two men I had the dealing with"—pointing to Clark, he said "That is one; I had about half an hour's conversation with him"—pointing to Donovan, he said "I think that is the other, but I am not so sure"—on the following day I went with the other officers and searched the house where Wood lived, where I found two more sacks of oats corresponding with the others—the name on the sack was, "Thomas Gillett, Faversham Mills"—there was also a quantity of rice, and two bushels of wheat, and some flour in the yard.</p>

I was with Forth concealed under the crane on the night in question—about 1.30 a.m. I saw a barge come alongside, and Clark and Donovan put six sacks of oats on shore—after<lb/>wards Donovan assisted Clark to put them on his back, and he carried them on to a trolley, and dark sent it down to Bethel's Wharf.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant R</hi>). I went on the night in question to the wharf at East Greenwich, a little after 9, where I saw a barge lying at the wharf about 100 yards below—I and the other officers kept observation on the barge until 1 a.m.—I saw two men come up presently from the cabin; they hoisted the anchor, and rowed the barge alongside of Bethel's Wharf—when they got close to us we could see they were Donovan and Clark—dark went on to the wharf and made the barge fast, and Donovan placed six sacks, which afterwards turned out to be oats, on the wharf—when they got on to the wharf Donovan assisted Clark with the sacks on his back, one by one, and he went and placed them on the trolley—after they had placed the six on the trolley they moved the trolley into the wharf, and it ran down the incline into the wharf about 150 yards—at about 7.15 I saw Crane and Wood come on the wharf; they each took a sack from off the trolley and carried it into the shed some distance farther in the wharf—in company with Craggs I followed them up and met them as they were coming out of the shed—I asked Wood what his name was—he said "Wood"—I said "We are two police officers, and want to see these oats that you have been taking in there"—Wood said "I thought so"—I saw three sacks standing out side the shed—I told Wood I should take him into custody for feloni<lb/>ously receiving the oats, well knowing them to have been stolen—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188102280070"/>
               <p>said "I must put up with it; it is a bad job"—he called "Charley!"—I told him it was no use calling, as we had got the lighterman in custody—we took Wood and Crane to the police-station—Wood said "I wish I had not bought them, but they kept bothering me so to buy them; if you make it as light as you can for me you can have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and your mate can have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have not paid for them, but have agreed to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them"—I asked him if he knew the men of whom he bought them—he said "Not by name but by sight; one is a tall, big man, and the other a shorter man"—he said he had been talking to them about half an hour—he said "I do not know what I wanted to buy oats at all for; I can always get plenty of sweepings"—I and the other officer were in plain clothes—I should think it took Donovan and Clark about 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour to bring the oats ashore off the barge to the trolley.</p>

I am in partnership with Percy Keen as wharfingers in Horselydown—Donovan and Clark were in my employ—we have a customer of the name of Gillett, of Faversham—on the 24th January we had an order to deliver 1,000 quarters of oats to Bethel's Wharf, and I instructed Donovan to load the barge and to take them to the wharf, assisted by Clark—most of the sacks had on them "Thomas Gillett, Faversham Mills"—they were to wait for the tide—Bethel's Wharf is at East Greenwich—I have seen the six sacks of oats, the subject of this charge, and have compared them with the samples that have been worked, and they are the same oats—when barges take a large order it is usual to take more sacks—1,000 sacks would be a portion of the cargo—Dono<lb/>van and Clark had no business to stop at Bethel's Wharf—I did not know Wood—they were Russian oats—we do not allow lightermen any sweepings.</p>

Donovan was a lighterman, and had been with me eight years—I believe he has been honest, although very indifferent in attending to his work very often—on this occasion he ought to have remained on the barge, and Clark ought to have come back by rail or boat—they often have an excess of sacks on a barge—as a fact we had in the barge four sacks over and above what ought to be there—it would be the duty of the officers of the Dock Company to weigh the sacks on the barge and to tally them.</p>

I am the night watchman at 169, Union Street—it is a registered common lodging-house—on Saturday night, about 10 o'clock, I saw Sarah Boss come out of the street—the prisoner was coming out of the kitchen, and met her in the passage—I saw Elizabeth Hammond there—I heard them talking in the passage—he said, "What are you showing me up for like this?"—he struck her in the face with his open hand, and knocked her down—something was said about a purse—she said, "The purse was empty, Tom; I gave it to her mother"—he said to Hammond, "When did she give it to your mother?"—she said, "A night or two ago"—he got hold of the back of the girl's neck and pushed her out and kicked her, and said, "We don't want none of your nonsense"—I was then called away—later in the night, about. 11, I saw the woman standing against the bedroom door—she asked me to open the door, and I opened it for her with the key—she said, "Don't tell Tom I am in"—she went in and slammed the door—there was no light in the room; she did not take any candle in with her—there is glass at the top of the door, and gaslight in the passage shows into the room—I did not notice what state she was in—I only had to unlock the door and let her in—about a quarter or 20 minutes to 1 I saw the prisoner in the kitchen—he came and asked me to let him in, and I opened the bedroom door and let him in—he went in and shut the door—that was the same room that the woman had gone in—I then went to the street door—I stayed there</p>

               <p>something like three or four minutes, when the prisoner opened the door and called, "Ted"—I went to the door—he had his coat off; so he had when he went in—he said, "I believe my old woman is dead"—I said, "Shut up"—I went and got a piece of candle from the deputy, Mr. Saunderson; I lit it, and the prisoner went into the room first, and I followed him—I looked over his shoulder and said, "I'm d—d if she ain't dead"—the woman was lying in the middle of the bed, flat on her back, outside the clothes; she was dressed all but her boots, and hat, and crossover—she had her hat in her hand when she went in, and her crossover across her shoulders as usual—I can't swear whether she had her shoes on—when I went in the crossover was hanging on the bed-post—I did not see where her shoes were—her clothes were unbuttoned at the neck, all undone to the bosom—I did not touch her, only looked at her—I went and told the deputy, and then fetched the sergeant—the prisoner is a labourer; he went out to his work in the daytime.</p>

I am the manager or deputy at 169, Union Street—on this Saturday night, about 20 minutes or half-past 9 I saw the prisoner in the passage; he met the deceased at the door—the little girl Hammond was there—I heard the prisoner say "You have come then, have you?" or something of that kind—I didn't hear her reply—he struck her on the face—she went down in the passage and asked him not to strike her again—some words passed between them, and he hit her again; I can't say whether with his open hand or his fist, and I think she fell—she cried out "Oh, Tom, don't nit me," and so did the little girl—he then asked her where the purse was—she said she had given it to Hammond's mother, and she asked the girl if it was not so, and she said "Yes"—he wanted to know when; she replied "Two or three days ago," and the girl said "Yes"—he said he did not want any of her speaking in the matter, and he took hold of her shoulders and pushed her out—he then returned down the passage towards the kitchen—the woman was standing in the passage—I wished them to retire, and not have any disturbance there—I went into my office, and did not see what became of them—I heard nothing more till about a quarter or 20 minutes to 1, when Mills called me and said the woman was dead—I went into the room, and saw the woman lying in the centre of the bed on her back—she had all her clothes on except her crossover, hat, and shoes—the upper part of her dress was open at the neck—I did not touch the body—I went for a policeman and doctor—the prisoner said he was sorry for it—I said "Yes, I am afraid it will be a bad job"—Dr. Roberts came in about 15 minutes; I followed him into the room—he asked who had struck her—the prisoner said "I did, with my open hand"—the policeman said that the blow from an open hand could not have caused the wound on the eye—the prisoner said "What, do you know better than me?"—I saw a mark right On the centre of her throat—when Dr. Evans came he said he thought the bolster ought to be placed under the woman's head—the prisoner said "No, it ought</p>

On Saturday night, 12th Feb<lb/>ruary, shortly after 1 o'clock, I was on duty in Union Street beween 200 and 300 yards from 169—I was fetched to the house—I heard that Dr. Evans was at the station, and I ran there and took him to the house—I found Dr. Roberts in the passage near the prisoner's room—it was about 25 minutes past I when I got there—I went into the bedroom with Dr. Evans; the prisoner was there, and the deputy, and several were near the door—the woman was lying on her back with her clothes on—her dress was loosened at the breast—the lower part of her dress was smooth—she had no boots on and no hat—her arms were lying by her side, her head lay back, and Dr. Evans told the deputy that there ought to be something put under her head to raise it—some one who was standing at the door said "Yes, and she ought to have a bandage round her chin"—the prisoner replied "Do you want to make people believe she has been strangled?"—the witnesses Mills and Sanderson then told me that she had been assaulted by the prisoner that evening, and that she had no marks on her face before—the prisoner said "That is quite right; I gave her them to-night"—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of causing the death of the woman—he said "Mind, if you do you will have to pay for it"—he repeated these words two or three times going to the station—he was sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner and M.R.C.S., of 73, Southwark Bridge Road—that is about three minutes' walk from Union Street—on Sunday morning the 13th February, about 1.10, I was fetched to 169; I was in bed at the time—I got up at once; it took me about five minutes to get there; I got there between 1.10 and 1.15; I was as quick as possible—I at once went into the bedroom, and saw the woman lying on her back outside the bed with all her clothes on except her boots and hat—her dress was a little open about the throat; I concluded it had been opened simply to ease the throat, as is usually done—her head was resting face upwards; her arms were by her side—the lower part of her clothes were all smooth; she had a recent bruise on each eye; such as might be caused by a blow from a hand or fist—I noticed a little dry blood in the left nostril, and a recent bruise on the throat—there was an ecchymosed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188102280077"/>
               <p>patch on the lower part of the larynx, just over the windpipe, and on the right it was rather swollen; it was about the sue of between a sixpence and a shilling—it was such a mark as would have been made by external pressure; it could have been made by a blow—her hair was not disordered—there was a bruise on the left side of the chin at the lower edge of the jaw—a slight mucus was exuding from the left corner of the mouth, which was nearly closed; the pupils of the eyes were equally dilated; she was quite dead—the body was not stiff; the <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> had not set in; in my judgment she had been dead within an hour—it is difficult to say the exact time, but I should think about that time; she might have been dead during the last 20 minutes—Dr. Evans afterwards came; I did not interfere with the body any further that night—on the 15th, in the presence of Mr. Evans, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; she was a woman somewhere about 30, well nourished—I saw the bruises on the eye where I have mentioned, and there was a recent bruise above the left elbow, and two above the right elbow; around the windpipe there was effusion of dark blood corresponding to the external marl; the throat was swollen—I could not trace any external marks of fingers on the throat; the thyroid gland was congested—there was extravasation of blood slightly clotted; there was frothy mucus inside the trachea and congestion, and even at the back of the throat; there was congestion' in front of the vertebrae; the brain was congested; there was one external mark of violence at the upper part of the forehead, and on removing the scalp I found a bruise there, which might have been caused by a woman being pushed and falling down; there was nothing serious in that—the membranes and the brain were congested; the internal organs were all healthy; the lungs were gorged with dark venous blood; the bladder was empty; the stomach contained partly digested food; the heart was quite empty—her linen inside was stained with urine and faces; the liver and kidneys were congested—in my judgment the cause of death was external violence, causing pressure on the windpipe—all this was compatible with suffocation—I mean such pressure as to stop breathing—such pressure would take about five minutes to cause death if kept on; it might be less in some cases—I should suppose from the internal appearance that there must have been complete pressure con<lb/>tinued until death was caused—all the appearances were consistent with death having been caused in that way—I could not account for death in any other way—it was not possible for her to have caused her own death in that way—I should not think it could be caused by a woman going to bed in a state of intoxication with her mouth against the bed-clothes—that would not account for the bruise or for the condition of the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It would not be impossible for death to be caused in that way—I do not go further than to say that the symptoms were con<lb/>sistent with suffocation—it is very difficult to say whether death is caused by suffocation or not—the data are very few on which to base the fact that death is so caused, and with a person intoxicated it would be still more difficult; all the symptoms I have described are not consistent with death by apoplexy; the state of the throat was not—putting the throat out of the question altogether, it might be so—it is possible in apoplexy to have the same internal symptoms, but I could not account for the effusion round the throat; I opened the windpipe and all the parts around—there was no foreign substance in the throat—there was undigested</p>

               <p>food in the stomach—it is possible, but not probable, that in the act of breathing something may come in the throat and stick in the passage—I know the case of the piece of potato skin being breathed back in a man's throat; of course I cannot say whether the body may not have been turned over before I saw it; in an ordinary case of strangulation one would expect to see marks of fingers on the throat, but not necessarily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The woman was a strong, muscular, vigorous person—from the state of the throat I should say external violence must have been continued—the congestion inside would probably be caused by pressure on the windpipe; I believe that pressure did it, but possibly a blow might do it—in apoplexy you would not expect to find the heart empty, but it might possibly be; the condition of the throat could not have been caused by apoplexy, neither the swelling nor the congestion—the woman must have been helplessly drunk to have been suffocated in the way suggested—I have not seen her before—I cannot say whether she was helplessly drunk or not; if she had been able to walk about and go into the room of her own accord I should not think it likely that she would be suffocated by lying down on the bed-clothes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It is a very difficult thing for a doctor to make up his mind as to the cause of death in such a case—if the woman had been helplessly drunk and had gone and laid upon her face it might have been possible for her to be suffocated—supposing she had been slowly strangled for five minutes I should hardly expect, if she had made a struggle, to find her clothes lying over her feet—I should have expected to find some signs of a struggle—if there had been a struggle I should have expected that a person standing just outside the partition would have heard something of it—I came to the opinion that death was caused by suffocation in a great measure because I failed to assign any other reason for it—that taken in connection with the great injury done to the throat—I think the external bruise and perhaps the internal bruise might have been caused by a blow on the throat—it might cause syncope,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188102280079"/>
               <p>and death might be caused in that way—it must be caused within a very short period, not altogether instantaneously—it would be a very few minutes; it might possibly not be for five minutes; I cannot speak very accurately.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Syncope would be caused by the shock to the system; death might be very sudden—the internal appearances would be dif<lb/>ferent if produced by suffocation—I should not expect to find the organs in the same state—I should not expect to find the gorged state of the longs, nor such a condition of the Teasels of the brain—I should not say it could not exist, but I should not expect to find it—I do not think it would be difficult to say whether a person died from syncope or suffo<lb/>cation—it would be more difficult to say whether she died from apoplexy or suffocation—I came to the conclusion that she died from suffocation, from pulmonary apoplexy; that is produced from the gorging of the lungs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Delahay Street, and am a F.R.C.S., assistant surgeon to Westminster Hospital, and lecturer on forensic medicine there—I have been many times examined in Courts of Justice on inquiries of this description—I have been in Court while the doctors gave their evidence—I have carefully attended to the description given by them of the appearance of the body, externally and internally—assuming that they are accurate in their description, the cause of death in my judg<lb/>ment was suffocation; I think sudden suffocation, by an absolute stoppage of the air into the lungs until death happened—that opinion is justified be<lb/>cause of the condition of the heart—in slow suffocation the right side of the heart is usually full of blood; in very sudden suffocation we get the ordinary appearances of suffocation without the gorged state of the right side of the heart, what is termed an empty heart—supposing the pressure continued so as to stop the passage of the air, in two or three minutes death might be complete—in ordinary suffocation, that is slow suffocation, it would take four or five minutes, perhaps even more—it pressure was continued on the windpide that would be very likely to cause death quite suddenly, especially in a woman of low vitality from drinking, which does cause low vitality—I do not think the appearances were consistent with death from cerebral apoplexy—I should expect to find a great deal more congestion and effusion in the brain than I have heard described—a very violent blow on the throat might cause a shook sufficient to cause death from syncope—I do not think it a likely cause of death, but possible—Dr. Evans, I think rightly, said that he should not have expected the lungs to be so gorged, nor the brain so congested, nor should I; but apart from that, a drunken woman might have congestion of the lungs and brain—supposing a blow given to the throat sufficient to cause death from syncope, death might be quite sudden, from the immediate shock—it would be slower from a prolonged shock; the heart would be empty in that case—in a prolonged shock there is no absolute certainty in the condition of the heart, but we take it as a general probability that the heart will be empty—I do not believe that the woman herself could have caused pressure to the windpipe—I mean the woman would have to be very helplessly drunk to suffocate herself—there is a reflex action, which either raises the body or pushes away the object—I have tried that in a great number of cases of dead-drunkenness.</p>

The last witness gave me a descrip<lb/>tion of a person—I first went to the premises of Mr. Meredith; I found the lower sash of the window, which is about two feet from the ground, open; this boot (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was lying outside, and I found these matches and a lot that had been burnt lying on the window sill—I called Mr. Meredith—I showed him the boot—from Blomfield's description I went to a coffee-stall in the Boro' High Street, about 100 yards off—I saw the prisoner with two other men standing there; he had a white bandage round his head; he attempted to walk away, and said "I know nothing about it"—I had not then spoken to him—I said "How long have you been here?" he said "About 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour"—I took him to the station, and he was identified by Blomfield—when charged he said he said he had been at London Bridge a great part of the night, and that he had not been at the place since about 11.30—I searched him; I found this door handle; I believe it has been used for raising the sash.</p>

Paddington, jeweller, my father—about the middle of the day on the 6th December I was in the shop when the prisoner came in and wanted to look at some little pencil cases—I showed him some which he looked at; about three minutes afterwards another man came in and wanted to look at some gold watches, and I took out a tray and he picked up one and looked at it, and said it was rather too large, and asked if we had one smaller—I told him we had not got one—he said "Never mind, don't trouble," and went off—the prisoner was looking at the pencil cases, and I saw him put something into his pocket; a pencil case and seal—my mother came into the shop and I told him I was going to get some more pencil cases—I gave her the signal that there was a robbery, and then I went into the private passage and went out at the private door, leaving the prisoner in the shop—I went as far as the corner of the street to see if I could find a policeman, and as I was coming back he popped out of the shop—Iran after him through Conduit Place, then down London Street and Sussex Court, and I lost him close to Hyde Park—I returned to the shop and found a watch missing, a pencil case, and a gold seal (<hi rend="italic">watch produced</hi>)—I am positive this is the watch—I saw it at Lambeth Police-court—I do not know anything about the prisoner.</p>
