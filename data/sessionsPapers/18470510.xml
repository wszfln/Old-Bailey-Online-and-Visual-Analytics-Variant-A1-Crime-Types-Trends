I live in Welbeck-street—the prisoner Green came to lodge at my house at the latter end of Dec. last, and was living there early in Feb. this year—Graves visited him every day that he was there, and stayed there about four or five hours—he generally came soon after Mr. Green arrived, and they went away together to dinner—I know Green's writing perfectly well—this check is his writing—I do not know Graves' writing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He had no authority to get this money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not this in particular, but he had received money before several times, and brought it to me—he was my servant and carter—Perkins was one of his customers before he came to me—he brought me three or four customers—he did not have a commission on what he sold, nor sell this on his own account—I did not then know he was making out the bills in his own name—Perkim✗s bought the hay and straw of me, and asked if I could not take less—I did not offer to take a picture for the money—the prisoner's wife said she would bring one if I would not take him into custody—he has been in business for himself as a hay salesman—I did not take him on account of his connection with salesmen—I never gave him a commission.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Metcalf, a baker, in Marchmont-street. On the 29th of April, I saw the prisoner in my master's Shop—he came for a half-quartern cottage loaf—I served him—he gave me a half-sovereign—I gave him change—it appeared to me to be a good half-sove<lb/>reign—he then asked me if it was the best bread—I said I did not know, it was genuine bread, the League bread, and I said he could have his half-sove<lb/>reign back if he did not like it—he said he would, and I gave him the same half-sovereign back again that he gave me, and he gave me the change—he then turned to the door, and came back and said he would take the loaf, and he supposed, if they did not like it, I would change it him—I said, "Oh, yes"—he then took the loaf and put it into his handkerchief, and he put down a half-sovereign—I rung it on the counter, and did not like the sound of it—I rang a little bell for Mr. Metcalf to come, and when the prisoner saw him he walked out of the shop very quickly—he left his handkerchief just as he has tied it up—he left his half-sovereign on the counter—my master went after him, and brought him back—he told him he had given a rascally bad half-sovereign, and he ought to be ashamed of himself for taking advantage of a female in the shop—he said it was not a bad half-sovereign—my master said, "It is, look here," and he took and bent it up—the prisoner said he was a respectable man, and had a respectable character—I could not say that that was not the same half-sovereign as he gave me the first time—I felt satisfied with the first—I did not like the appearance of the second.</p>

I was in my master's yard about half-past seven o'clock on the 10th of April—the prisoner was helping me there—I had a few words with him that day about his being so long gone from his work—he ran into the stable, got a fork, and ran at me with it—I wrenched it form his hand, and put it down under the stable window—he ran and fetched a second fork, and stabbed me with it—the prong entered my left temple, and he struck me with the fork on my head—the would bled—I was taken to the doctor—I was ill a fortnight—I had not said anything to the prisoner to justify this—we had some words—I had not struck him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Well-street, Oxford-street. I was a patient in Mr. Byas' Lunatic Asylum, Grove-hall, Bow—I was about to be dis<lb/>charged, and am as well now as ever I was in my life. On the 27th of March I was sleeping in the ward No. 1—the prisoner Garrett was upper keeper there, and Downes his assistant—Garrett slept in the ward No. 1—upwards of twenty persons slept in that ward—in the morning, just at break of day, Garrett called me to assist him—I directly went to his bed, and found him in bed, and William Rance, the deceased, who was a patient, and slept in the same ward, by the side of the bed, holding Garrett fast by the throat with one hand, in the act of putting a leather strap over his head with the other hand—it was a strap which Rance used to wear round his waist—I immedi<lb/>ately seized Rance by the arms, and drew him into the middle of the room—he struggled a little with me, and we both fell together; and at the time I pulled him away, he said, "Oh, it is you, Mecklenberg, is it? you are the last person I should have thought"—Garrett got up, and called for Chumley, one of the assistants, but before he came I and Rance had got up—he did not appear injured in the least by the fall, as my arm was under him—he fell on his right side, and got up again without difficulty—Chumley came and tripped his feet from under him, and threw him down—he fell first on his seat, then fell backwards—he was struggling, and I could not perceive that he was hurt by the fall—Garrett then went down stairs for a straight waistcoat, and while he was gone Chumley struck Rance several times about the body and side—Garrett</p>

               <p>returned, and Downes with him—they brought a straight waistcoat—Rance was then on the ground, and Downes struck Rance violently about the body and sides—they were all three trying to put the straight jacket on—Rance was striving very much to get away—Garrett called for a handkerchief or scarf—a black one was handed to him—he put it round Rance's neck, and held him down on the floor by it till he became quite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was the quietness caused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared to me by strangling, holding him down—Rance at that time turned dark in the face, and there was a little blood from his nostrils and mouth—he was quiet after that till the jacket was put on—his arms were tied behind him, and he was carried to his bed by the prisoners—he was then quite manageable, and could not help himself—when he was put on the bed his feet were confined by one or two handkerchiefs tied to them, and then to the lower part of the bedstead—he was laid in his back, with his arms under him—a sheet was passed through between his arms and back, and tied on each side the bedstead; to keep him down—he remained in that state till a little after eight o'clock in the morning—I never saw him attempt to strike either of them down to that time—a lit<lb/>tle after eight o'clock I followed Garrett and Downes, who went up and released him—they untied the sheet and handkerchiefs at his feet, and took off the jacket—when he was released he was as violent as ever—directly the jacket was off he struck. at Garrett with great violence, and very nearly hit him in the face, but did not do so—Downes immediately struck him on the right side, and knocked him down on the bed—I believe he struck with all the power he had—Rance appeared to me to fall on the left side of the bedstead—he was getting exhausted, and appeared very low—Garrett assisted in holding him down on the bed, having his hand on his head—pride, who is a keeper in the house, came into the ward just at that time, and I then left.</p>

               <p>27th of March, about eight o'clock, I heard a noise in No. 1 ward, and heard Garrett's voice as I went into the ward—he ordered Rance to put on his clothes—I saw Rance standing with his back towards the door—Garrett and Downes were facing him, ordering him to put on his clothes—Downes had the straight jacket in his hand—I took hold of both Rance's arms, and held them behind him—he was always considered a violent man—I observed his face all over blood—Garrett put a handkerchief round his neck, held the two ends with his hand, and dragged him to the bed more on his side, and then on his back, with violence—he put his knee on his chest at the same time, and held him down—Downes at the same time struck him ten or twelve times with his clenched fist on the left side, more towards the bottom of his belly, where Garrett's knee was—they appeared to me very serve blows, as hard as he could strike—Garrett's whole weight was on Rance's body on the bed—I told them several times to <hi rend="italic">drop it</hi>, to leave off, but Garrett said, "Give it him, give it the old b—r"—Downes continued to strike him several blows, after I desired him to cease; and after Garrett had said, "Give it him"—Garrett's knees were at the time about the same part—Rance could not make any resistance—the blood was running out of his mouth and nostrils, and he could not speak, for the handkerchief was round his neck so tight he could not cry out—they then took him off his bed, and he stood on the floor—they put the straight jacket on, and after it was fastened it appeared too tight in front—Garrett took hold of his two shoulders and struck him four or five times violently with his knee at the bottom of his belly, and said, "Stick your belly in, you b—y old b—r"—he sighed and leaned forward, and blood ran from his mouth and nostrils—he did not appear able to speak—Garrett took him down stairs and locked him in the cell—I never saw him afterwards—I saw no marks of violence about either of the prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent at Grove-hall Asylum. I have been there about two years-and-a-half—I knew William Rance—he had been under my care for twelve months—he was described as an agricultural labourer, fifty-eight years old—he was occasionally violent, and has been under restraint on two previous occasions—I proposed temporary restraint, and he recovered—I saw him on the 27th of March, about eleven in the morning—I reside on the premises, and am accessible at all times—I found him in seclusion—I went to him from a representation made to me by Garratt—found him in a straight-waistcoat, in a state of considerable mental excitement—I directed that he should remain in seclusion—ordered medicine and proper diet—I observed no blood about him—his left eye was contused and black—Garratt was in the cell with me—I asked him how that occurred—he said, he had been very violent during the night, and attempted to strangle him while he was asleep, and with the assistance of Mecklenberg and the keepers, with considerable difficulty, he succeeded in restraining him, and fastened him to the bed, and the contusion had occurred in that way—I did not notice any other appearance of violence about him—that was the only part uncovered—he was standing in the cell, which is on the ground-floor—it has windows to it—it is not padded—I saw him daily till the 1st of April, when he died—he had a diseased action of the heart, and I had no reason to suppose his death was caused by violence—I attended the inquest on the 3rd of April, and the prisoners were examined as witnesses—pride was examined after them, and in consequence of hearing his examination, I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination of the body after the verdict—his body was muscular and fat—the left eye bruised, and a bruise on the centre of the chest—bruises on the left side of the body, the left arm, and left groin—on opening the chest, I found the fifth rib on the left side broken obliquely about three inches from its cartilage—the anterior portion of the broken part was protrude<lb/>ing through the pleura—the sixth and seventh ribs were broken about an inch further back than the fifth rib—the eight and ninth ribs were also broken about an inch still further back, but the broken ends were not at all disturbed—the cavity of the chest contained about four ounces of bloody fluid on the substance of the lungs—the lung itself was healthy on the left node of the chest—the fractured bone had not penetrated the lung—the death was caused by the inflammation of the pleura, arising from its being punctured by the broken rib, which caused the inflammation—the other broken ribs would not cause death—the external bruises on the left side were over the internal injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> would the other bruises and broken ribs increase the ten<lb/>dency to inflammation.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say they would—the pressure of the knee on the parts and places struck with force, would account for the inter<lb/>nal injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the pleura, does it not surround the heart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the lining of the lungs and ribs—the pleura was punctured—I do not think a rib is easily broken—he was in a healthy state of bone—it would requires considerable violence to produce the fractures I saw—the ribs had been recently broken, certainly—I treated him for excessive action of the heart, which was precisely the treatment I should apply for inflammation—I had him bled—his heart was very much enlarged—that is a disease which very frequently causes sudden death—a person with that disease is never safe—any excitement might occasion death, but a great many such persons undergo a great deal of excitement—he had hypertrophy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say he did not die of hypertrophy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can, by the appear<lb/>ance of the pleura, on the left side of the chest—if I had not found the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184705100054"/>
               <p>inflammation, I should have had no hesitation in accounting for the death—the approximate cause of death in hypertrophy is the disturbance of the heart's action—that would not necessarily produce the enlarged state of heart which I found—it was enormously enlarged—there were no other ap<lb/>pearances about the heart—inflammation of the pleura may be reduced—it had been stated to me that there had been a considerable struggle, and that violence was necessary to restrain the patient—the struggle described might affect the action of the heart, and might terminate life suddenly, but not necessarily sudden, it might be lingering—if he had died of hypertrophy, I should expect to find the appearances about the heart which I described—Pride holds the same situation as he did before—he has not been advanced—I do not authorize a straight waistcoat in the asylum, except under my direc<lb/>tion—his endeavouring to strangle the keeper would call for more than ordi<lb/>nary care, and render more than ordinary restraint necessary—I gave it as my opinion before the Coroner that he died of effusion arising from disease of the heart—I had not then made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Downes been in the establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One mouth—he came from Whitmore-house with a good character—Garratt, also, had a very good character—serus effusion into the cavities is a common sequel in disease of the heart—this was bloody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The effusion you found in the cavity of the chest was of a totally different character to a case of death from hypertrophy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so, it was a bloody effusion—the blood itself, I believe, arose from decom<lb/>position during life, caused by inflammation from the fractured rib—I was not aware that any violence had been used to him, when I was examined before the Coroner—the straight-jacket should have been put on in a proper manner, and he should have been taken to a single room—they should have reported it to me, with all the particulars connected with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> why do you fix with certainty the death to be caused by the broken rib, instead of the diseased heart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I see in the one an amount of structural alteration which I know full well men do live with, and, in the other, an amount of structural alteration which I know must be fatal—one case is ambiguous, and the other clear—I think the injury happening on the 27th of March, would have produced the death within that period—the fracture would have caused the inflammation which produced death—the effusion of blood arose from the inflammation and mortification, caused ori<lb/>ginally by the puncture of the ribs—the bruises and contusions had a tendency to increase the inflammation.</p>
               <p>(The prisoners received good characters.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the Nag's Head, Leather-lane. On the 10th of April, the prisoner and some others came to the bar, and had something—there was a dispute about the payment—I desired the prisoner to go, and I endeavoured to put him out—we had a scuffle, and while we were scuffling, I noticed that he <hi rend="italic">grabbed</hi> my pin out of my scarf—he denied it, and I gave him in charge—when we got a short distance from the house I saw him throw something, but I cannot tell what—it fell on the spot—after we had been to the station I searched on the spot, by the light of the policeman's lantern, but did not find anything—I went out the next morning—the police<lb/>man found the stem of the pin on the spot where I saw the prisoner throw something—I found the stone of the pin—that stone and the stem of the pin produced by the policeman make up the pin I lost—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. At the letter end of Jan., 1846, I was accosted, when I was passing through Little Britain, by a person apparently in considerable diffi<lb/>culty—he stopped me, and asked me if I would render him a little service—I asked what was the nature of it—he told me had purchased a horse of a man, and he would not let him have it—I went with him, and when I had got alongside the horse, the prisoner came up—he told me this was the person of whom he agreed to purchased the horse—after a little hesitation, I said to the prisoner, "Why don't you let him have the horse?"—he said, "It is worth</p>

               <p>more than I offered to let him have it for"—the man said he offered to let him have it at 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that he went to inquire of a person who agreed to have it at a figure, I do not know what, and when he got back the prisoner wanted 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Why don't you let the man have the horse?"—he said he wanted more for it—I said, "I think it is very unhandsome," and I was going away—the other man said, "For God's sake, don't leave me"—he urged me, and I stayed some time—I was coming away, and at last the prisoner said, "You shall have it for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "That was not the agreement; why do you want 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when you agreed for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I was about leaving, and the prisoner said, "He shall have it for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "I wish you good day"—I thought my services were at an end, but the other man said, "Do, pray, see the money paid, or he will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> me, after all"—I said I had no objection to that—I went into the public-house, and the other man took out a double handful of sove<lb/>reigns and put them on the table—he counted as far as eighteen, and the pri<lb/>soner said, "No, I will not let him have the horse"—I said, "This is singular—not let him have the horse? I don't understand it; I beg leave to leave the room, and have no further to do with it"—the prisoner said, "I will sell you the horse, but not this man; the horse is not mine, it belongs to an uncle of mine, a man residing at Barnett; I won't have any transactions with this man; my uncle would be very angry if he knew I sold this man the horse; my uncle and he have had some difference"—the other man said, "Will you pay for it?"—I said, "I have not the money"—he said, "Per<lb/>haps you can get it"—I said, "That is very true, I can do that, and double the amount, if that be all"—he said, "You will render me a great service;" and he said he would pay me the amount, and there was the money; and there appeared to be more money on the table than would pay for it—I said, "I have money at home, but I am some distance from home, I reside in King's-road, Gray's Inn-lane"—they said, "Well, we will take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and go for it"—well, somehow, they induced me to go—they took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and both went to my residence, and into my drawing-room—I was about to pay the money to the prisoner, and the other man said, "Don't pay it here; perhaps the horse is gone; somebody may have run away with it"—I said, "That is a very good precaution; we will return and see it"—we went into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went into another public-house, and the prisoner said, "I am now ready to take your money"—I paid him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and three 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and he took the money—I paid him them for the other man—he was to deliver the horse to the other person on my paying him these notes—I said, "I don't want the horse, I have no place to put it in"—as soon as I had paid it, the other man tendered me a sovereign for my trouble—he had said he would remunerate me, and he took it out of his own pocket and gave it me—I took the sovereign—the pri<lb/>soner said, "Now I will deliver the horse into your hands, and the other man will follow you"—we left the room—the prisoner went first, I at his heels, and the other man, as I thought, at my heels—the prisoner delivered the horse into my hands, at least the halter, and I looked round for the other man to put it into his hand, but he was gone—there was I standing with the halter in my hand, and surrounded by, I suppose, sixty of the lowest individuals—after about five minutes, a man came up and said, "Who does this horse belong to?"—I said, "I don't know that you have any business with the horse, I have got the horse in my charge"—he said, "I must not let it stand here, it is dangerous, it has got the glanders; I must take it to the Green-yard"—he put his hand up the horse's nose, and made it bleed, and he said, "Now you see it has got the glanders"—I at last sold the horse, after waiting here the whole Sessions—the prisoner was out on bail, and he eluded</p>

I did not get the amount of the keep, only a portion of it—I let the man drive it who had it at a stable—it was he who got it for the 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I forget how much I owed for the keep—I suppose the horse stood me in somewhere about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I got 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it and the keep—I forget what that was, and a sovereign I put in my pocket, but I cannot reckon that, for my time was worth more than that to me—that made 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I found the prisoner on another charge at Worship-street, and no person appeared against him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a leather-dresser, and live in Bermondsey-street.

               <p>they were after no good—they went on the bridge, towards the City, and when they were about the centre of the first arch, I saw White go up to the right-hand side of a lady—one of the others went on her left side—two were behind this one, and one behind the other—I cannot say which was on her left side, but I can swear Jones was one of the three—I saw White, with his left hand, take a purse out of the lady's pocket—it was a light blue or grey one—White instantly darted across the road, still keeping the purse in his hand—it was projecting out of the side of his hand—they all went together—White was first—I crossed over—they all took the steps down to the wharf where the steam-boats go from, near Alderman Humphrey's—I went into Alderman Humphrey's, and Mr. Marchant came out to assist me—when I got in sight of the arch I saw the prisoners and three other persons standing under the arch—Mr. Marchant stood where he was—I went up to them—be<lb/>fore I got to them they ran away, and went up the steps on the other side, still running, and Jones, and one of the others who has not been taken, got into an omnibus which still kept going on—I went up to the conductor and told him he had got thieves in his omnibus—he still kept on—I told him I should take his number, if he did not stop, and while I was doing so they got out of the omnibus, and proceeded off—I ran and took White—he resisted very much.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Blewit's-buildings, Fetter-lane, and am ser<lb/>vant at Mr. Williams's, the boiled-beef-house, in the Old Bailey—I have been with him about ten months. On Sunday evening, and 18th of April, I was coming home, about half-past ten o'clock, across Leicester-square—the prisoner Rowe came up by my side—he passed some remarks on the weather—he then asked me if I would have anything to drink—I said, "No"—he said he was coming part of my way—he asked me again to drink—I refused at first, and then said I did not mind, I had not anything to drink all day—we went into a public-house—he called for a glass of gin and water—he turned from the bar, and went in the yard, and while he was gone I paid for it—we then came out, and I bid him good night—he then asked me if I would</p>

On the 14th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Hammersmith—I saw a wagon come up, driven by Chaney—I saw him go and call Gurling up from a house ad<lb/>joining to a stable—Gurling came down, and I heard some "correspondence" going on between them, but I could not tell what it was—I do not know that I heard any part of it—Gurling then went and looked up and down in the road—he then came back to Chaney, and said, "It is all right, make haste, jump up, <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it off"—Chaney then got on the load, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> off a truss of straw—Gurling took it into the stable, and Chaney followed him—I went down, and told Chaney I must take him to the station-house—he said, "Very well"—I took him and the straw to the station—on the way he said he was very sorry; that it was his master's property; it was the first time he had ever robbed his master, and he would never do the like again—I asked what he was going to have for it—he said a pot of beer—I asked how he knew that—he said he had seen other carters do it, and he thought he would do the same.</p>

If the bearer should miss seeing you—if a letter is dropped into the box of Miller and Harden, of King William-street, before four o'clock, or at four, I will attend any appointment."</p>
               <p>"March 24th—Do not think me troublesome in writing so often, but my anxiety is greater than I can bear. If you can appoint with the bearer to meet me in the evening in the City, at ten o'clock, I shall indeed be obliged.</p>

               <p>Prompt and energetic measures must be at once taken for our friend's safety; try and come to me, as matters will have to be seen to in the City. I am now going home. Whenever you will appoint I will attend. Yours faith<lb/>fully, <hi rend="smallCaps">E. GARBETT</hi>. I should wish to see you alone first, and Mr. B. after<lb/>wards."</p>
               <p>March 25th.—I want to see you most particularly, but it must be in a more private place than in Court. I trust you will take out the summon to-day. Shall I sketch out the affidavits for you? If you will say what time you will be at home, or where else I can see you confidentially for a quarter of an hour, I will attend. Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">E. GARBETT."</hi>

               <p>"March 23rd.—Dear Sir,—The enclosed are at present all the papers I have been able to get. I asked for the costs in Phillips's action with a view to change the attorney. The general issue is pleaded in that and Lee's. He is paid to hold over to Saturday; but I fear his attorney, Braham, of Char<lb/>cery-lane, may play tricks, and send down. A summons to set aside that judgment, supported by affidavits, must be taken out on Thursday. Please to look at the cases, pages 66 and 67 of the <hi rend="italic">Law Magazine</hi>, sent herewith.

Smith had sent one letter to Mr. Horton, and one to me, and he never did—I do not know whether it was in the beginning of Nov.—it was in the winter, and it was early one morning—I breakfasted with him at his brother's at Wellington—I asked him how matters were going on with reference to the Langley estate—that was</p>

               <p>what I went about—I wanted him to close it—I wanted that more than any<lb/>thing else—I do not owe. Mr. Garbett anything—if anything is owing, it is from the mortgagees—I am one of the mortgagees, but it is not owing by me more than the rest—we have had no bill, and cannot say whether anything is owing or not—I have paid him a little money for his services—I let him have money at different times—he has had a good deal of money, I understand, from Major Newcombe, who purchased the property—that is what I am alluding to—what I let him have must have been on account of his services—perhaps he might have had some at his brother's house—I do not know that he had—I let him have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. once at his own house at Wellington—that is not all—he has had money at different times—he has had money on account of his bill from Major Newcombe, and Major Newcombe has charged it against the mortgagees—I did not ask Mr. Garbett to mark my debt out of his book as paid, but he told me that it was paid, that there was a sum of money or something to be paid, when the Langley business was settled it would be accounted for—that is what I understood—he had money of Major Newcombe, and I gave him authority, along with the other mortgagees—I have visited him two or three times at his house at Blackheath, on this unpleasant business—I saw his wife there—that was after the month of Oct.—I should think I have seen him twice or three times since then—I think it was in the early part of Nov.</p>

                  </hi> I am a partner in the firm of Capes and Stewart, attor<lb/>neys, of Gray's-inn. The defence of this action was placed in our hands—the first day I saw the defendant was on the Sunday before the commission day at Kingston, which was on Monday—Mr. Cooper had brought the defen<lb/>dant's son to our office—he came to us through Mr. Cooper—I saw Mr. Garbett once before we went down to the assizes, and caused him to be subpœnaed—I attended the trail and heard him examined—I should say that he did not appear to be under any excitement or flurry in the course of his examination—after he had given his evidence, I told him that from what Lord Denman had stated I thought he would be committed—he replied that he did not care a rush—all the papers were handed over to me, and I have them here.</p>

Dear Sir, Mr. Booth cannot say that I have not done all I could to serve him in this matter, when I myself caused my own commitment by doing so. The least I think he can do in return will be to keep out of the way of being served by the prosecutor with any subpœna for some time."</p>

He was when I married him a <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi> proprietor—he is now an omnibus driver—I do not know either of the prisoners—I never saw them till yesterday—I know the prose<lb/>cutor, and his shop—on that afternoon I and another woman were talking close by his shop, and two young men, or boys, ran against me, and nearly knocked me down—one was a boy, with a bundle of waistcoats, and the other was trying to cover them with a handkerchief—I can swear that neither of the prisoners were the persons—they were much thinner than the prisoners—they both had jackets and caps on—neither of them had a hat—I and my friend went and gave notice to the prosecutor, and he scolded the boy who minded his shop—I said, "Were they light waistcoats?"—he said, "Yes, light, soiled waistcoats"—I saw them plainly—it was a quarter-past five.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 1st of May, I left my lodgings about half-past eleven o'clock, and went down Pen<lb/>nington-street, and was told there was a procession of charity children ex<lb/>pected in Gravel-lane—I walked with them as far as the church door, in St. George's-in-the-East—I saw them go into the church-gates—there was a great crowd—after they got into the gates I was going home, and making my way through the crowd I saw a man, who was the prisoner Phillips, coming towards me in great haste, and the prisoner Tedgell following him—Phillips came right against me in front, pressed very hard against my waistcoat-pocket where my watch was—at the same time I heard a snap, and felt my watch go from me—the guard was round my neck—that was not broken, but the watch was broken from the guard—I felt the snatch which broke it from the guard, and saw it in Phillips' hand—I directly seized him, and called the police, but no policeman coming near I had to struggle with him for ten minutes—not a single policeman came up for ten minutes—at the time I saw the watch in Phillips' hand I saw the prisoner Campbell on my left-hand side, and Tedgdll on my right, rather before me—this was while I was struggling—Campbell had hold of Phillips' arm, trying to rescue him from me—Tedgell struck me on the arm several times—Campbell attempted to make a blow at my head, and knocked off Phillips' hat—Campbell said, "You have got hold of the wrong man; he is a gentleman"—there were a number of them about me at the time—I cannot identify either of the other prisoners, but they were striking me in all directions—Phillips's waistcoat tore, and he got away from me—I followed him down Cannon-street, across the highway, and never lost sight of him till he was stopped—my watch was found on the spot where the struggle took place—the watch produced is it—it was found with the glass broken.</p>

I am one of the treasurers to the commis<lb/>sioners for paving Whitechapel-road—I am one of the commissioners, there are others—the prisoner was collector of rates for the commissioners—it was his duty to account to the Board every time they met, for the amount of rates he had collected up to that period—if he received, on the 25th of May, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Archer, it was his duty to account for it at the next meeting of the commissioners, which took place on the 5th of June—I was present when the entrys were made in this minute-book—the collector was present—these entrys were made in his presence, from the margins of his receipts—he did not account for this 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he accounted for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as what he had received up to that day for Charlotte-street, where Mr. Archer's house is rated—this account will not tell how that account is made up—Mr. Archer's money ought to have been entered in this book, and it is not—this is a book which was kept by the prisoner, and was in his possession, but he neglected posting it up—this</p>

               <p>this book was given him when he had to collect the last rate, with instruction to enter every person's rate in it, and this should agree with the ends of the receipts remaining in the receipt-book—he had a receipt-book given him, and it was his duty to tear off the receipt, and then enter on the end remaining in his book, the sum he received, and those documents were produced before the commissioners—supposing he received a sum from Mr. Archer it was his duty to produce it—I think he did not produce it—it is not entered in the book—the writing in this book is partly the prisoner's, and partly of several of the commissioners—this book should have been filled up, but we never could pre<lb/>vail on him to do it, and we insisted on his sitting down and filling it up by the counterparts of the receipts—some of it was done by him, and some by the commissioners—he was present, and acquiesced in everything that was done—he stated that was all he had collected, and made various excuses for not collecting more—this book has no date, but merely the numbers of the receipts, and this receipt of Mr. Archer's is not numbered—a receipt-book was given to him, out of which it was his duty to give receipts, and that book was to referred to—it was his duty to have a numbered receipt, and to refer to the receipt by the number, since the last book was given out—I am not aware what the arrangement was before that—this is an old receipt—I am not aware whether this rate was made before May or afterwards—this book con<lb/>tains all the sums which the prisoner professed to have received on that rate—the items of Charlotte-street are here given—Mr. Archer lives in Charlotte-street, and this does not contain the receipt of this sum from him—this book has no date, but here is a sum of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Charlotte-street entered in the minute-book, from this book—this book will not give the in<lb/>formation whether this sum 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. forms any part of this 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not know whether I have seen this rate-book before, unless I have seen it at the Board—I have not examined it—here is the name of James Archer, Charlotte-street, in it—I do not know who wrote it, but I see this book has been before the Board—here is the signature of a number of the commis<lb/>sioners to it—my signature is not to it—it is the rate-book from Christmas, 1844, to Christmas, 1845—here is the name of Archer in it, under the head of Charlotte-street—supposing the prisoner received this sum on the 25th of May, 1846, for two quarters' rate, due at Christmas, 1845, this book ought to have contained that entry in the prisoner's writing—this sum does not appear—here is a deficicency of 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due from Archer for that half-year—it was the prisoner's duty to make these entrys at the time he received the money.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think you say this pony had been taken away once in your absence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, by the prisoner, and he brought it back in the afternoon—the prisoner said that Silvester told him I had a pony and chaise for sale—I do not know where the prisoner took the pony and chaise to the first time he had it—I went out about twelve o'clock that day, and returned about three o'clock—that was on Saturday, the 17th of April—I might have seen the prisoner two or three times between that Satur<lb/>day and the day he took it to Walham-green—he brought a deaf and dumb gentleman one day—he might be there about a quarter of an hour—he looked at it and went away—it was on Thursday, the 22nd of April, the prisoner took it to Walham-green.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he had sold the pony and chaise for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you would not have objected? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know what I should have done—I did not tell him to sell it for that—he was to bring the gentleman back to me—he was going there to show it to the gentleman—he said if I would allow him he would bring the gentleman back—supposing he had brought the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>was very cautious as to whose possession my pony and chaise got to—the prisoner said it was an independent man retired from business, and my pony and chaise would be well taken care of—I told him to bring my pony and chaise back—I did not say anything about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him to tell the gentleman I would not take less then 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was to bring the gentleman back, and the pony and chaise, and I was surprised at his leaving at behind—he had the pony and chaise between eleven and twelve o'clock, and he came back between six seven o'clock—he asked me to go to see the gentle<lb/>man, and I refused—I had told him I would not take less then 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when he came back I told him to go and fetch it back—he had no authority to leave it—Walhem-green is a mile and a quarter, or a mile and a balf from Chelsea—when the prisoner came to me that morning, between eleven and twelve o'clock, he was very sober—when he came in the evening he was in liquor, or appeared to be so—I could not tell whether he know what he was going—there was no knowing how he was.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">GILLINGHAM</hi>. I am veterinary surgeon. I was at Chelsea on the 22nd of April, about one o'clock, and saw the prisoner at the Cadagon Arms—he had a pony and chaise with him—he offered me them for sale for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I offered him 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first, and ultimatly offered him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he agreed to take—I afterwards had some doubts, and wanted to be off my bargain—I told him I thought the lot was not very cheap—he said, "You can do as you like"—I said I would not have it, and I think I paid for some sherry to be off the bargain.</p>

I thought that was as much as the pony and chaise were worth—I thought they were not worth that—that was the principal objection I had—he told me they belonged to a gentleman, and he had them to sell—he has frequently brought horses to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and live at Fulham. on the 22nd of April, between three and four o'lock in the afternoon, I saw the pri<lb/>soner—he had a pony and chaise, and Mr. Fellows was in company with him—the prisoner said, "I have a pony and chaise to sell for a gentleman who discharged his servant about four months ago, and he has no further use for it, and, with a little attention, I think it would answer a person's pur<lb/>pose"—I said, "I have no more occasion for a pony and chaise then a cat has for a side-pocket"—I did not buy it then, but I ultimately bid him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—(he asked me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—when he was going away he said, "Give me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, you shall have it"—I said, "No, I offered you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "Give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more"—I bought it, and paid him 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening when I bought it, or nearly eight—he had gone away and returned again before that.</p>

               <p>afternoon—he then returned back to Chelsea, I believe—he said he would go and tell the gentleman what I bid—he said, "You shall have it for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more and I will go and bring the gentleman down to you"—when he returned he was a little fresh—he was not drunk—he was perfectly sensible—he offered to take a donkey of mine in exchange, but I considered my donkey more valuable than the pony—I think I gave within 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the value of the pony and chaise—I have had good judges to examine it, and the most value I have had put on it was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the average value has been from 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On the 10th of April, about four o'clock, I was coming up Crown-street, and saw the prisoner King folding up a card of gold rings—I do not swear positively to Bailey, but think he was standing close by—I went past about a yard and a half, and saw Mr. Linsey's window was cut—I turned round, and saw them walking very fast—they began running—I ram after them—I caught him—he threw the rings over a wall—I picked up one ring—Mr. Morley came out, said he had found the rings, and produced them—the other prisoner ran into Clifton-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William George Harrison, tobacconist, Bucklersbury; the prisoner was in his employment. On Tues<lb/>day evening, the 5th of May, he left the premises about seven o'clock—I stopped him as he was leaving, and told him he had some property in his possession—he denied it—I insisted on having the property produced, and he opened a handkerchief which he had in his hand, and this leaf tobacco was in it—it weighs four ounces and a half—he went to the end of the room, and put it into a box in which there was stalk tobacco—that would not get mixed with leaf tobacco—on the following morning I took it out—prisoner asked me what I was going to do with it—I said, "What! you never want it again?"—he said, "No"—I gave it to the foreman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Harrison. I received the tobacco from Silvester, and gave it to the constable—I was present when Mr. Harri<lb/>son gave the prisoner into custody—he asked him if it was true that the to<lb/>bacco which I held din my hand had been in his possession—he said he was very sorry for it, but there was not so much as was produced at that time—the value of it is about a half-a-crown.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is there a usual allowance of tobacco made? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; to men like the prisoner there is mostly two ounces delivered to them weekly, but that is manufactured tobacco—the prisoner was sent for, and came directly.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) I was taken into custody for this robbery, and was sent to prison when the prisoners were finally committed—I was a carman or porter in the employment of Mr. Smith, a carrier, of the Old Bailey—I have know the prisoner East six or eight months—it is not twelve months—on Easter Sunday last, in the forenoon, I was in the fields near chalk-farm, and met the prisoners, John Freer and William Martin, with a man who used to work at Pickford's—I did not know his name—he had left Pickford's at the time—they left him as soon as they saw me, and in a few minutes Freer asked me if I would go up with him in the morn<lb/>ing to the railway station to get some goods out—I understood what he meant—I did not make him an answer much, but turned round afterwards, and said, "Yes, I will"—he said it would be a very good chance, being Easter Sunday, the men would be out getting drunk, and therefore they would not come to work very early on Monday morning—J. Martin and John Freer went into the Hampstead-road as far as Hampstead-road bridge, and met East and Thomas Johnson—we all five went into the tap-room of the Buck's-head, which is kept by Holiday, and had some half-and-half—a little boy brought it into the tap-room—I afterwards saw that boy before the Magistrate—we went in there as soon as the house was open after Church—at one o'clock—we staid about half an hour—when we left, Henry East and John Freer told me to meet them at half-past two at the Southampton-arms—I went, and got there at ten minutes to three, and found East and Freer there—the house closed at three o'clock, and we came out—Martin came to us two or three minutes after three o'clock, after the house was closed—he was not let in—we were standing outside—an ar<lb/>rangement was made between us to meet that night at the Buck's-head, between eleven and twelve o'clock—Freer or East, I do not know which, said we were to meet there—and go and have some coffee, and go up early in the morning to Camden-town, the London and North Western Railway-station—Martin was present when that arrangement was made—he then left, and I went with Freer and East to a man in Charles-street, Goswell-street—Freer said that a man there would lend us a horse and cart to get some things out—I do not know the man's name—we got there about four o'clock in the afternoon—East went in, came out, and said this man would not let him have the horse, as nobody else could put the collar on but one of their own men, because he was a biter—we then went back to Camden-town, and parted company to meet again be<lb/>tween eleven and twelve o'clock—I left my lodging, to keep the appointment, just before or after eleven—I lodge at No. 1, Harley-mews, Camden-town—a</p>

               <p>young woman whom I keep company with, named Juffs, was with me—she is in the service of Mr. Rawlings, a butcher—she went with us to Holiday's—when I got there, Henry East and Johnson were there—we then went to Linev's Coffee-shop, at the corner of York-street, Camden-town—we got there after twelve o'clock—I, East, and Johnson went there—I did not notice Martin come in—I went to sleep after having some coffee—they awoke me up, and I there saw Martin there, with Freer, Johnson, and East—we were all five together—I had left the young woman—she did not accompany us to the coffee-shop—she stopped a very few minutes—after two o'clock we all five left together to go to the Camden-town Station—it was not far—we went straight there—we got there after two—we went in at the Oval-road-gate—it was wide open—we went right into the station—there were some persons about, but nobody noticed us—there was a van belonging to Crowley's standing outside their shed—Freer said, "Here is a van here; what are these, up goods or down?—I understood what that meant—the goods which are sent out of London are the most valuable—they are generally silks and other things; but things that come from Birmingham are generally hardware—they found that it was a down load, and then Martin and Johnson went and fetched a horse belonging to Sutton's, who has a shed at the station—I am not certain whether Sutton's is the next shed or not—I did not go with them to fetch the horse—I understand they went there—I know it was Sutton's horse they brought—we all assisted in putting the horse into one of Sutton's carts which stood outside, empty—we then all assisted in undoing the strings of the tarpauling, which was tied over the van—some were cut and some were untied—I, East, and Freer moved it from the front to the hind part of the van—we turned it over, and then moved the goods from the van into the cart—Martin and Johnson were standing close by, I do not know whether they were watching—they came back when the cart was loaded—Martin was dressed something as he is now, at the station, but in the afternoon he had another dress on—after the cart was loaded, Martin drove it out of the station—East, Freer, Johnson, and I followed the cart out—we got up against the Stanhope-arms—Johnson left as at the bottom of the Oval-road, and East, Freer, Martin, and I went with the cart to the Walworth-road—we stopped for a minute or two at Smith field, as you go down to Snow-hill—nothing was done with the goods there—we then went to the Walworth-road—I and Martin left at a few minutes after five, leaving Johnson, Freer, and East with the cart—we took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and wear away—East gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi>

               <p>then told John Freer to go to the Rosemary Branch at Peckham, where he had appointed to meet a man at eleven o'clock—John Freer went out and brought three men in with him, Charles Austin and two Jew men—I did not know their names—East, John and Samuel Freer, and I, were then in the skittle-ground—I, John Freer, East, Austin, and the two Jew men, went down into the cellar—Samuel Freer did not go down—the cellar is under ground—we were forced to have a candle—I saw a quantity of goods in the cellar, hales,✗ boxes, a hamper, casks and trusses—they had the appearance of being the same that I had assisted in removing—I had seen some of them on the cart—I could not swear to every one of them—we took and opened them—they contained cloth, calico, prints, rolls of jaconet, gloves, hosiery, stays, bonnets, a truss of stockings and hosiery, a hamper of drugs, I suppose—we could smell them—books, a small cask, (I do not know what was in that,) and parasols—after Austin and the two Jew men had looked them all over, Henry East asked them what they would give for them—one of the Jew men said 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—East said no, that would not do at all—they them went up to the bar-parlour and had some bread and cheese and ale—Samuel Freer was up stairs—then the same man that bid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. offered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, being 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was agreed that he was to have them—they were to come the same evening, at six o'clock, to fetch some of them away—Austin and the other two men came at six o'clock—Samuel Freer was out—they waited till he came home, about seven o'clock—they brought a light chaise-cart after he came home—I went into the tap room, and do not know who went into the cellar, but I could see through the window that they were putting some goods into the cart, but what goods they were I do not know, nor can I say who it was putting them in—there was a man sitting in the cart while they were putting them in—I should not know him again.</p>

I named 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said, "What commission will you allow me?" I think I said 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said he was in the habit of having 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Phillips and Tiplady, if I would give him the same he would give me the preference; I agreed to it, and he seemed anxious✗</p>

               <p>that they should see the vessel; I, knowing they wanted to get away, called on a friend, a shipwright, and asked him to walk on board and give me as estimate of what it would come to, to fit it up, in case the charter-party came to a close; they left me about eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning, and agreed to meet me at Mr. Ireland's at three o'clock; I met them, and instead of paying the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it was agreed that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid then, and the remainder when they were on board; it made no difference to me, knowing I had a re<lb/>sponsible party to join me in the charter; they paid 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the money was put into the box, and after stopping a short time, Mr. Rosenbaum and his daughter asked me to leave an agreement with them, as they might get more passen<lb/>gers; I did so, and the next morning I made an arrangement to proceed to Mr. Ireland's; I went to his house about one o'clock on the Wednesday; I left a message that I was on business in the corn-market, and should be back at three o'clock; I returned, and saw Mr. M'lean; I left him full power in negotiate anything that might occur; I called at Mr. Ireland's again in the evening; I was taken into custody; I have not had opportunity to get a solicitor; under these circumstances I applied to traverse my trail, and had his Lordship granted my request I should have had not only a solicitor but a Counsel; I have been a master and owner of a ship the last three years; I commanded a ship for Mr. Soames in 1844.</p>

About the 6th of March Edwards came to my shop—I had known him before—he brought Madell with him, and said he was a highly respectable tradesman in the habit of selling watches and chains, and he required some chains to show to a gentleman he was about selling a watch to—he said I might trust him—they selected three chains—Madell said he wanted them to show to a gentleman he was about selling a watch to—I said,</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at St. John's-place, Walworth. On the 5th of April I went to the Surrey Theatre with some friends—I left about twenty minutes to twelve o'clock, and went into the parlour of the Equestrian Tavern, by the side of the theatre—after a short time I and another person left the parlour, and passed to the bar—the prisoners were standing together at the bar, but whether in company I cannot say—when I got to the street-door two females and a man stood there—I asked them to make way for us to pass—as we passed Spignell threw a glass of beer at my friend, but it did not touch her—he made a rush at her after that—he put the glass down, and said to a woman who was with him, "Give me my key"—that woman held her head down—I was passing at the same time, and he made a rush at me as I passed—I said, "That man has stolen my brooch"—he ran out at the side-door—I gave an alarm, and ran after him—I crossed the road—Duckett caught hold of me, and asked me what I wanted with that man, what I was going to do with him—I said, "The man has stolen my brooch"—he said, "You are not going to give him in charge for the brooch?"—I said, "Certainly I am"—he said, "What do you want with him? what are you going to do with him?"—I said, "I shall give him in charge"—he then laid hold of me, and threw me between the edge of the pavement and the road—my brooch was safe on my breast when I left the parlour—I had that moment fastened it, and I felt Spignell's hand at my neck</p>

They also all declare, that they voluntarily make this statement, and that no promise has been held out to them; and that they have been properly cautioned that what they said would be taken down and produced in evidence against them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Webster's Defence.</hi> My Lord and gentlemen of the jury: the offence of which I stand charged is one of a very heavy character, and which, I am very sorry to say, has brought me before your notice this day. My Lord and gentlemen, perhaps you will not credit what I am going to say to you; but I will fearlessly speak to you, convinced that I am innocent, and that what I am going to say is true. It is true that I was in Richmond during the day on which the fire occurred, and I also was the company of the other persons charged with me, and that I was also present at the fire; but I can assure your Lordship that the stack was not fired by me. But being reduced to the deepest distress, through the want of work, and not having tasted food for some time past, I was induced to accompany the other per<lb/>sons, and accuse myself of committing the crime, which has caused my friends a great deal of anguish and regret, that I had not applied to them for assis<lb/>tance. My Lord, I was never in the company of those persons accused with me, but on theday the fire occurred; nor can I, to my recollection, ever re<lb/>member seeing them before. the only thing that criminates me, is the marks which the officer states was made by the shoes which I wore; but I can assure you that they were not the print of my footsteps; for I never entered the field where the ground was capable of receiving any impression. My Lord, it is not at all improbable that the marks were caused by some person who assisted at the fire, and who, in the excitement of the moment, has not since remembered crossing the field. But, my Lord, I hope you will pause before you proceed to sum up the evidence adduced against me; for it would be doing me a great injustice without being convinced of my guilt; for the confession which I signed in an unthinking moment, and which has been used as evidence against me, which the keen pangs of hungers has induced me to put my signature to, is a falsehood, of which I have had reason to repent. My lord, taking all these considerations before your notice, and weighing the evidence brought against me, I may be led to hope for a favourable issue of my trial, and which I may be led to expect from an impartial and uncorrupted jury.</p>

On the 1st of April the prisoners came there about four o'clock—they went into a room where I keep a bagatelle board—they asked where the balls were—I gave them two red balls and seven white ones—they called for a pint of ale—soon afterwards Flanagan came out for another pint of ale and a screw of tobacco—he took it into the room and shut the door—they were there some time, when a neigh<lb/>bour came and told me they had gone out of my window—I pursued them—they ran and I ran, but I lost them—when I came back my bagatelle balls were gone—no one else had been in the room.</p>
