                  </hi>. I carry on business as a provision merchant at 148, Leadenhall Street, under the style of John Moir and Son—on 15th January, 1878, I entered into an agreement with the prisoner as my servant for three years to act as office manager, at a salary of 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the first year, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the second year, and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the third year—he entered into my service at once on that agreement—on 28th May, 1878, I entered into a further agreement with him, which was endorsed on the old one, by which he agreed to act as cashier, in addition to his other duties, at an additional salary of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he continued to perform those duties till December, 1878—instruc<lb/>tions were given him that no loose cash should be kept in hand—a copy of those written instructions was given to him by Mr. Fletcher—I discharged him in December, 1878—I have stock taken on 31st May every year—after he was discharged he brought an action against me for wrongful dismissal—under the advice of our solicitor we settled that action about April—we had our accounts audited after 31st May as usual, and found that there was a deficiency of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when we tried to balance our books—our clerks went into the whole books for the year to find out where the discrepancy arose—they went into the whole operations for the year—one of my clerks called my attention to this entry of 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is an entry in the cash-book kept by the prisoner—it is in his handwriting—the figures 93 are inhia handwriting—the figures'at the end of the column (16771 14 5) are also in his hand<lb/>writing—the book was entirely kept by him—the 16771 14 5 is a correct total if the figures were 193—I have followed it out to the end of the month, and it is treated throughout as 193 to the end of the month, so that I am 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—the balance at the end of the month is 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd instead of 245<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this cash book was kept from Mr. Thompson's own system—it was designed by himself—I employed Messrs.

               <p>at the end of every month to audit the previous month's transactions—it was the accountant's duty to look at the casting of the cash book, and see that it was correct—it was his duty to test the castings to sec if they were correct—it was no part of his duty to trace the cheques to see whether they were paid in, except at the end of the month he has to reconcile the bank book—it was his duty to see that the bank book balanced—he would see that there was a voucher for every sum that had been paid out—he would examine all the vouchers—after he had seen that the total for the month was correct, it was the duty of the ledger clerk to post them into the ledger—I have the ledger and the paying-in slips here—thesum is posted as 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the ledger—this cheque was placed to our credit at the Union Bank of London as 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was paid in along with other small amounts, amounting to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—on 4th July the prisoner placed before me a lithographic form authorising him to sign cheques for the firm paid into the bank—I declined—he had only been six months in our service—he repeatedly wanted to get quit of the auditors—he said "You pay so much to the auditors; that could be saved by employing me, as I am a competent book-keeper"—he said that repeatedly—at last, after very often speaking in that way, I told him that Mr. Fletcher (our auditor) was a personal friend of mine, and it was no usebringing the matter up—if the ledger clerk had posted 193<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it would have brought to the knowledge of the persons paying in that they had been credited with too little—Messrs. Yates and Son, who were the parties, would have seen in the next statement that the account was incorrect—my attention has been called to the entry on 16th November, under the head of ox feet, tail, and tongue—that entry ought to have been 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at folio 106, and it is carried forward as 324<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I can't say whose writing the red ink figures'are—that is carried through to the balance at 324 until the last folio of the month, and there it is altered back to the proper sum—the figures are 263 9 1—it is now 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a scraping in the body of the 5, but in the balance and at the top it has been altered to the right sum—it is altered in red ink from 515, and a red 3 put—when I dismissed the prisoner we told him to balance up his cash—he had to give us an I O U to square everything up—I think he was short 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some few shillings—this is the I O U he gave for it—that is one of the subjects of litigation—on 20th October I went to Seville, and returned on 21st November—it was after my return that I discharged him, in consequence of what I heard.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Michael Butler was read as follows</hi>: "I live at 10, George Street, Gray's Inn Road. On Monday last, the 22nd instant, I was at the lodging house where the prisoner lives, a common lodge, 45, Vine Street, St. Andrew's, Holborn. A eon of mine lodges there. I was in the kitchen giving my son advice and telling him that some one was leading him to destruction, when the prisoner, who was present, took my son's part and told me to "Get out ot the b——house." I said I came in and out of the house before he ever came there. I don't remember any more being said, but the prisoner then struck me several times on the face and knocked me down. I then saw a table knife in his hand; he struck it on the table and bent it, and in a minute or two afterwards he put his hand into bis pocket and drew out a pocket knife, opened it, and struck me with it on the groin on the left side. I felt blood run down into my boots, and I said 'You have done it' I walked out, got a policeman, and gave him in charge. In the presence of the policeman he said 'That is the knife I done it with, and if I had had a bayonet in my hand I should have done it all the same.' <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I do not remember striking, my son in the Blue Posts, I might have done so. I do not remember pulling off my coat to fight the prisoner outside the Blue Posts; I never saw the prisoner till afterwards outside the Blue Posts. I did not follow the prisoner into the lodging-house; I did not hit him till he hit me; he swore he would grease his boots with the fat of my guts. I did not strike him first in the kitchen, I strongly deny it. When he struck me I returned the blow. He struck me two or three times. I did not pull the table knife out of my coat pocket, and the prisoner did not say 'If you can use a knife so can I' The only knife I saw bent was the one that I bent on the table. I did not try to hide my knife after the prisoner penetrated me. I had no knife only a small pocket knife which is in my pocket now, and I never took it out of my pocket.") I found this small white-handled knife.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 45, Vine Street—on Mon<lb/>day, 22nd September, between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, I was at the Blue Posts with Michael Butler and the prisoner—they were chaffing there—I was afterwards in Roach's kitchen—the prisoner was there; he had his clothes off—Michael Butler came in—I saw him with a knife in his hand I can't say where he got it from—the prisoner was right up against the door, and he kept pointing with a knife at Butler, intending to strike him in the arm—I saw him take it from his pocket—I can't say whether it was open or shut; I did not see the blade—Butler was quite close to him—the prisoner turned round and said "I can use a knife as well as you can, Mike"—Butler made a drive at him, and the prisoner struck him in the stomach with the knife still in his left hand to the best of my opinion—he made an attempt at his arm, and instead of that Butler turned round and caught it in his stomach—Butler's knife doubled up against the prisoner's stomach—after the prisoner had struck Butler, Butler turned round and put his knife on the counter; that was the white-handled knife—I saw him undo his trousers, and he showed me a wound near the navel; it was bleeding—he said "Did you see that, Dan?"—I said "Yes, I have; Michael, you are stabbed"—he went out and fetched a policeman—Mrs. Roach said to the prisoner, "Jerry, run away"—he said "I will not"—I said "Do't you, Jerry"—he said "I have done the deed, and am not going to disown it"—Butler came back with the policeman, who said "Which is the man that has done the deed?"—Butler pointed to the prisoner and said, "That is the man"—the prisoner said "I am the man, that is the knife that done it, and there are the two knives for you," and he gave them to the policeman, the table knife and his own knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was not a very quarrelsome man to my knowledge—he challenged the prisoner to fight—he was not drunk; he had been drinking freely—I heard the prisoner tell Moriarty that he did not want to fight with him—I can't say that the deceased had the knife in his hand when he challenged the prisoner to fight—I did say so before the Magistrate—I should not like to say so now, it is so long ago.</p>

I am the wife of Michael Roach, who keeps a lodging-house at 45, Vine Street—on Monday, 22nd September, about 2.30, I was in the kitchen—I saw the deceased come in—I don't know whether he had anything with him—he made a rush at the prisoner, and I afterwards saw this white-handled knife on the floor—I saw the prisoner stabbing Butler with a knife that he took out of his pocket—Butler turned round to Brick and undid his trousers, and showed him where he was stabbed—he then went out, brought a policeman, and gave the prisoner in custody—the prisoner was not sober—I don't think Brick or any of them were sober—this knife does not belong to me: I never saw it before: it</p>

Backhouse"), and he said "It is mine; I came from London yesterday, and I was too late to get it cashed on Saturday evening"—I said "It is rather peculiar, but if you like to go to my place of business I will go to my bankers and hear what they 8ay relative to it"—I had a call to make, and I said "You go in, I will over<lb/>take you at my place of business"—at Creighton Street I got into Andrews's omnibus, when who should I see sitting opposite me in the omnibus but the two prisoners—I then arrived at the London Provincial Bank, and got out, leaving the prisoners to go on—nothing passed between us in the omnibus—I then got to my shop and found the prisoners standing opposite awaiting my arrival—I went in and they followed, and I said "My bankers are not satisfied to let me draw against this, and advised me not to advance any money until I heard from them when they forwarded it on for collection"—Renouf said "Will you advance us 15?" or something like that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200018"/>
               <p>I then gave them the cheque back, and said I should do nothing of the kind—Chaplin said "I am really very short of money; give me a couple of pounds," to which I would not assent, and I handed him the cheque in this way, which he took out of my hands, when Renouf said "Oh, you can leave it with Mr. Jacobs; it is perfectly secure," and it was left with me—I arranged for Chaplin to call on Wednesday or Thursday, when I would have a reply—I paid the warrant into my bank for collection—in conse<lb/>quence of what I afterwards heard I communicated with Inspector Price the next morning—the prisoners produced nothing more than that one warrant.</p>

Backhouse"—he replied "very well," and then I volunteered to write a telegram—he may have requested me to—he said "Will you advance me some money on the security of the cheques to enable me to go to London, where I shall have no difficulty in tracing the owners"—I said "No, I cannot advance money on them"—I made out the form of telegram and Renouf left—he paid me nothing—he returned to my office some hours afterwards and showed me this telegram, which he said he had received from Messrs. Backhouse—the telegram to them was sent in his name, and the reply came to him. (Read: "From George Renouf, 40, Maria Street,</p>

He told us he did not do business in the street, but if we wanted to do business with him we must come to his business place. We went to hid shop at the Docks and gave him one of the cheques.

               <p>I was in Garrick Street about 11.45 p.m. on. 17th September—I had a gold watch and chain—I did not notice any one till I got to the Garrick Club, when two men passed just in front of me, and two other men were behind me, and the left-hand man struck me under the chin, and with the other hand caught my watch and chain, and tried to knock my hat over my eyes with a little stick—I got hold of part of the chain and kept it in my hand, and caught hold of the stick and knocked him back—I cried "Police!" and the left-hand man ran across the road—I thought be had my watch and chain, and I ran after him and tried to knock him down, and the prisoner struck me behind and knocked me down—I fell against the lamp-post and broke my arm and split my knee—the prisoner was then taken in custody—I said to the constable in his presence, "That is the thief who knocked me down"—he replied "I tried to help you up"—the constable helped me up and no one else—it was found at the hospital that my arm was fractured at the shoulder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had only had a pint of beer and threepenuyworth of biscuits—I had been to the Swiss Hotel and nowhere else—the whole affair took no more than two minutes'—I did not say it was one of the number who stood there, but it was not either of the other two—I first of all said I had lost my watch—I was stripped at the station, and asked the policeman to look into my waistcoat pocket, and my watch was found there and I was surprised—I told the constable about the prisoner striking me with a stick, and I asked the prisoner if that was his stick and he said "No."</p>

On 17th September, about 12.30 a.m., I saw the prosecutor in Garrick Street lying on the ground—three persons stood four or five yards away, and he said "Some one there has robbed me"—I asked him if he could recognise either of the two men—he said "No," and he recognised the prisoner, who was standing against the shutters—the prisoner said he helped to pick him up—the prosecutor said "You did not help me to get up, I got up myself—I saw him get up—part of the watch chain was found in the prosecutor's hand and the watch was in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Pamphillon, a shoemaker, of 16, Arthur Street—on the night of 29th September, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner, who is a labourer, came to the house—I told him he was not to come in; if he did I would send for a policeman and have him turned out—he called me a wh——I asked him if he could prove that I was a wh——he went out, and between 9 and 10 he came back—he knocked at the door; I opened it, and said he was not to come in, and if he did I would send for a policeman and have him turned out—he came in—there was a candle on the table—he took it up and went into the back room—I followed him and said "There is nothing in here belonging to you"—upon that he blew out the candle, caught hold of me, and threw me on the ground—I felt him feeling for my throat, and I put up my hand and felt the knife and caught hold of it—he said he would murder me—he let go of the knife when I caught hold of it—I had a cut in my right hand on the thumb—I got up, lighted the candle, and went into the front room—the cut on the thumb was as I held the knife—the cut was received in my taking hold of the knife—when I went into the front room my husband came home—I opened the door—the prisoner was then sitting in a chair in the front room—he had gone in there before me; he had only just sat down—my husband said "What is the matter?"—I said "Fetch a policeman and lock him up"—he went to fetch a policeman—the candle was lighted when my husband came in; I had lighted it.</p>

My hand was bleeding very much; I had it rolled is my apron—my husband saw my hand, and the baby I had in my arms was covered with blood—he did not ask me how it came to be in such a condition—there were no angry words between me and the prisoner; before he did this he had called me a wh—at seven o'clock, and said he would come in to annoy us—I always told my husband when the prisoner came—I have never told him he had not been when he had—my husband told him he did not wish him to come, and if he did he should shut the door in his face—ho continued to come after that—I don't know whether the knife was lying on the table; I did not see him pick it up—as soon as I got into the room he seized hold of me, and threw me on the floor—we have not found the knife; I must have put it down after taking it from him—I don't know what became of it—it was a black-handled knife—we had been using it that day at dinner time—there was not a bed in the room where this happened—he had the knife in his hand when he threw me on the ground—I did not see the knife, I felt it; it was dark, I could not see—I think he was kneeling down beside me—I struggled, but I did not catch hold of anything.</p>

On Friday, 12th Sept, about 4 p.m., I went to Mr. Rooney's warehouse, 27, Bishopsgate Street, and saw Mr. Rooney and Giesecke, and from their information I, with Davis, went at about 4.30 to Victor's shop, in Widegate Street, Middlesex Street, about 200 yards off—it is an open shop, without windows, where old tools and other second-hand goods were sold—I saw no brushes exposed for sale—I saw Victor's son, and then wont up and saw Victor in the second-floor front room—there were in the room a bed, a child's cot, a couch which Victor was sitting on, and a chest of drawers containing wearing apparel—I do not remember seeing any glass cases—there were articles of merchandise, some amber for pipes, some small nail-brushes, and other things—we were in plain clothes, and Victor knew both of us—I said to him, "We are two police-officers, and have come in consequence of Mr. Giesecke calling upon Mr. Rooney, brush manu<lb/>facturer, Bishopsgate Street, to-day, and showing him some brushes, which Mr. Rooney has identified as property stolen from his warehouse, and Mr. Giesecke telling him that he had bought 14 brushes of you to-day, and paid you 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them; is that true?"—after considering a moment he said, "Yes, I sold Mr. Giesecke 14 brushes to-day, and charged him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them"—I said, "Have you any invoice?"—he said, "No, but I think I shall be able to satisfy you as to where I got them"—after considering two or three minutes, and my reminding him that I was waiting for an answer, he said, "well, I bought those brushes of a Mrs. Overton"—I said, "Where does she live?"—he said, "In Artillery Lane, close by, and keeps a greengrocer's shop"—I said, "When did you buy them?"—he said, "Within two or three days"—I said, "What did you give her for them?"—he said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each"—I directed Davies in his presence to fetch Mrs. Overton—these 13 hair brushes and five clothes brushes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were on a sideboard near Victor, and I said, "Did you buy</p>

               <p>those as well from Mrs. Overton? "pointing to them—he said, "Yes, and paid her the same price, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—Davies shortly afterwards returned with Mrs. Overton, and came into the room where we were—I said, "Mrs. Overton, we are police-officers, as Mr. Davies has told you; Victor says that you sold him some brushes within this last day or so; is that true or false!"—she considered a moment and then said, "Yes, I did sell him some brushes"—I said, "When?"—she said, "Last Monday"—that would be the Monday before the 12th—I said, "How many did you sell him?"—she said, "I do not know"—I said, "What did he pay you for them"—she said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each"—I said, "Where did you get them from?"—she said, "Well, I am a dealer in such things; I bought them at the New Cattle Market"—I said, "From whom?"—she said, "From various persons"—I said, "When did you buy them?"—she said, "Oh, from time to time within this last month"—I said, "You must consider yourself in custody; you will be charged with receiving a quantity of brushes, the property of Mr. Rooney, of Bishopsgate Street, knowing them to have been stolen"—I then turned away to speak to Victor, when Davies said, "Sergeant, Mrs. Overton wants to speak to you privately, and I went by the door and said to her, "What is it you want to say to me?"—she said, "Well, I do boy things in the Cattle Market, but I did not buy those brushes there. Will you step a little farther back, as I don't want Victor to hear what I say"—I said, "You had better speak out openly, so that we can all hear"—she said in Victor's hearing, "Well, I know a young man named Henry Bowman, who works for Mr. Rooney, a brush manufacturer, of Bishopsgate Street; I bought those brushes that you have shown me of Bowman from time to time, and paid him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each for them"—I then said to Victor, "Mr. Victor, you have made two statements with regard to the brushes: first, you told Mr. Giesecke that you had the brushes from the country, and now you say that you bought them of Mrs. Overton; you will be charged with being concerned with Mrs. Overton in receiving a quantity of brushes, the property of Mr. Rooney, knowing them to be stolen. Have you any more brushes which you have bought at Mrs. Overton's on your premises?"—he said, "Yes, you will find some in the top drawer, "pointing to it—his daughter opened it for me, and I found in it 11 horse brushes, two crumb brushes, and two clothes brushes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said, "Where did you get these from, Mr. Victor?"—he said, "I bought them all of Mrs. Overton from time to time this last three months, and have paid her 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them"—before we left the room I found these three broom-heads (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which he said were bought of Mrs. Overton—we searched the premises, but these were all the brushes we found—I took them both to the station, and then went to Mr. Rooney's warehouse close by, and took Bowman in custody—the three prisoners were brought together at the station, and formally charged, Bowman with stealing and the other two with receiving 50 brushes—Victor, addressing Mr. Rooney, said, "Do you intend to press the charge against me? If you do I have my remedy"—Mr. Rooney made no reply.</p>

               <p>Davies must have heard it if she did—I said on the first examination she might have said so—there were goods in the room, but it was also a living room and bedroom—you did not hesitate when I asked you whether there were any more brushes—you knew I should search the place—you did not volunteer the information till I asked you—the remainder of the brushes lay open and exposed on the table, and any one entering the room could see them—I know Mr. Overton is a harness-maker, but I did not know that he sent harness for sale to Stapleton's, and purchased harness for sale.</p>

I am a brush manufacturer at 27, Bishops-gate Street—the brushes are made at my factory in Shoreditch, and some of them are finished at Bishopsgate Street—Bowman has been my porter and warehouseman 11 years—here are 14 brushes: one at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., four at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, eight at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. wholesale price—they are new and of my manufacture, and 10 of them have the hair untrimmed—the trimming is always done at Bishopsgate Street—these 13, found on the sideboard, are also of my manufacture, the wholesale prices are 12 at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and the other one at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the 12 being unfinished in the same way as the others—these five new clothes brushes are finished—the wholesale prices are: one 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., another 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the other three 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—these 11 horse-brushes are new, two of them are unfinished, being without the web strap handles—the prices are 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—these two clothes brushes are finished, prices 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the two crumb brushes are finished, and the wholesale prices are 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the three broomheads are new, finished, value wholesale 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, they are all my manufacture—the total value is 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I missed a large quantity of property from time to time—I never sell unfinished brashes—Bowman had access to my property, and until this matter was discovered I had every confidence in him—he had no authority to take brushes out to sell—Victor when in custody at the station threatened proceedings against me if I pressed the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Victor's daughter, and am married—I was present on 12th September when the detectives came, and heard Mrs. Overton say "Mr. Victor does not know where these brushes came from"—I have a alight recollection of Mitchell asking him the price he gave for those out of the drawer, and I said 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he asked if he had any more, and he referred him to the contents of a drawer—I do not remember his mentioning the cost of the larger brushes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My father said he gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., each for the hair brushes—I do not recollect that he said what he gave for the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Victor's Defence.</hi> I am a dealer in every description of goods, new and secondhand. I have conducted my business with the utmost care and caution, and have occupied one place 22 years. I have assisted the police more than once by detaining goods that I believed to have been stolen, and if I had been permitted to explain this transaction it is a question whether I should have been here. I did not assert positively that these things came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200036"/>
               <p>from the country. A tradesman is scarcely expected to state where he buys his goods, and may therefore make an assertion which is not strictly the fact. They were inferior brushes, and they were in the same unfinished state when I disposed of them. Mrs. Overton, at her own house and in my room, distinctly said that I knew nothing about where they came from, and Mitchell has admitted that she might have said so. I have bought goods for years from Mrs. Overton, and have always looked upon Mrs. Overton as a woman of business, and in buying of her I considered that I bought of him. Our transactions were always open and above-board, and I believed the goods had been honestly come by. I bought them at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., each, and sold them at a profit of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or leas. I was lying prostrate with debility when the detectives came into the room, and naturally hesitated when spoken to under such circumstances. I gave at once the required information from whom I had bought them and what I paid. I never spoke to Bowman in my life or had the slightest communication with him. I was permitted by the Magistrate to go out on my own recognisances.</p>

I live at 74, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square—in June, 1878, I lodged with the defendant's father in Milton Street, Dorset Square—the defendant also Jived there—I had just come to England, and I said that I should like to find some words to compose music to; some words were lyin there, and the result was that I composed the music of "The Tar's Return"—I cannot say whether I received the words from the defendant's father—I went to Signor Foli with the song; he liked it very much, and I went there again with the defendant, who desired to publish the piece, and made an arrangement that he was to pay 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a</p>

               <p>I came to go the prisoner's house—my wife did not apply for the place of housekeeper—there was an advertisement in the paper for some employment at the prisoner's house relating to music, and my wife went in the morn<lb/>ing, and I went in the evening—I did not tell the prisoner that I was badly off—the result was that we went to live in the prisoner's house a week after<lb/>wards, or less—we were then living in one room on the second floor in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, and paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week regularly—in the beginning we were invited to the prisoner's house to dinner, and he made me hear his son sing; I wish to show how we were coaxed to go into their house—we remained there a very long time till after July, when I had finished some work which was in their hands—we went there in May, 1878, and remained till January last—I composed this song while I was there—we provided our own food, except when we dined downstairs with them—I was engaged, and they were to give me from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day for giving lessons to the prisoner's son, but I was getting nothing, and I suppose they let the rent run on—I was not to compose music for them—I had food and lodging, and there was compensation for it in the lessons I gave his son daily in music and singing; it was that which brought me to the house—his son has a tenor voice—I do not know that he has a French medal—I never saw this medal (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—all this was to be supplied for teaching—that was all I hud to do—my wife was to do nothing at all—they were delighted at my coming there to prepare him, and bring him out at the opera—I got the words of the song about three weeks after I was in the house, and I wrote the music to them in a very few days—I did not know at first whether I could compose any music to the words; they were given to me to try what I could do—there was no arrangement as to whom the music was to belong to if I succeeded, because I did not expect to succeed, as the words were very ugly, and very irregular—the words profess to be by "Nollo," that is a gentleman named Davis—I have heard that there was an arrangement between him and the defendant for the words, and I did not suppose that he was going to pay Davis and give me the words—I know that Signor Foli, Signor Santley, and Mr. Sims Reeves sing songs for the purpose of getting them sold, and that they are paid for singing them, either so much or by royalty—the prisoner's father is, I believe, a music publisher in Newman Street, but I cannot say for certain, because there are so many of them—when I went to Signor Foli it was not to ask him to sing the song which I had composed, but to see if he liked the music, and if he did he would undoubtedly accept it—he has a bass voice—the song was for a bass voice, but still it may be called a baritone—it was peculiarly suited to Signor Foli's voice; a song can be made suitable to a baritone, and also to a bass by transposition—I suggested taking it to Signor Foli—this song was published in Shrewsbury by some Dobrowolski—my name appears twice on the MS.—I have done so with all my music; the first signature was written so imperfectly that I wrote the second so that the engraver might make no mistake—I have been in the habit of doing so for a long time—this writing at the bottom is mine; I have always been in the habit in America of entering my music in my own name, and I put "Entered at Congress," hut that is scratched out—I did not receive any money for this—I went to Signor Foli to show it to him—I played it over to him, and asked him whether he liked it—he said he did very much, and offered to buy it—I said "The words do not belong to me, I must bring the person who has got</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of 132 Fenchurch Street—in July, 1878, I carried on business in Great Tower Street, and had known Bassil a year or so—I called on him in that month relative to procuring a loan of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to complete a purchase—I saw him at my office on 5th July, and it was arranged that I should accept two bills, one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were both dated July 5th, payable in three months, and I accepted them—one was in blank and the other was filled in—this is the one for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; at the time I accepted it the drawer's name was blank, because Bassil said he would get some one to draw it; he said he would get them discounted and give me the money, or else return the bills—he wrote this agreement after I handed him the bills. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "5th July, 1878. Dear Sir,—I acknowledge that you have this day handed me two bills of exchange, one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., both of this date, and payable three months after date, the said bills being accepted by yourself. I undertake to hand you the produce of said bills, say 997<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on Tuesday next, the 9th inst., or return the same to you. Frederick Bassil. Witness, George Blake.") He signed that in my private room—my previous transactions with him had been satisfactory—he said nothing when I asked him for that, but gave it at once and I put my name to it because I thought it would make it legal, and my clerk signed it also——on 9th July, 1878, I received this letter from Bassil, it is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "9th July, 1878. Dear Sir,—I shall not be able to see you till 2 to-morrow. Yours truly, F. Bassil.") I don't think I saw him after till 11th July, when I received this letter in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "11th July, 1878. Dear Sir,—By the enclosed telegam you will see that the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not yet discounted; my friend has been waiting to settle a matter on previous discounts. Mr. Johnson is at Leamington, and I don't expect to do any<lb/>thing with him till to-morrow or Saturday morning.") (<hi rend="italic">The telegram was from Saunders, of Sloane Square, to Frederick Bassil</hi>: "July 10th, 1878. Send me Chambers's bill and I will see what can be done to-morrow.") I met Bassil on 17th July, I went to the Bank expecting to get the full dis<lb/>count, but when I got there Saunders said he could only give me 401<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd and a life policy—I accepted that for the 500/. bill—he paid me nothing with reference to the 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill—he said that it was with Mr. Johnson, and he expected to have the money on Thursday—I did not believe that—I then received this letter.

I never received the 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 23rd July I think, Bassil brought Colliver to my office and said, "This is the gentleman who is the drawer of the bill"—I said "I don't want the money now, and I must have my bill back; I have made other arrangements"—Colliver said he could not give it to me as he had given it to a gentleman to discount—I said "I don't care about that, I must have the bill back at once"—he said he thought he could get it back if I would pay the interest, which would be 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he should have to pay for the discount—I said "I don't care anything about that, I must have the bill or the money at once"—he said "If you will give me till Friday I will give you the money"—I left it in that way, and they left—Colliver said that he was building some houses for Alderman Hadley's brother—they never returned me the 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill or any money for it until a few weeks ago, when I received a certain sum by his Lordship's permission after the indictment was found—it cost me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I had to pay the 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and all the expenses—I had never heard of Colliver before the 23rd—this letter is in my writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "26th July, 1878. G. B. Colliver. Sir,—Your telegram to hand. I beg to inform you that I don't know you in the matter, and as I hold Mr. Bassil's guarantee to give the cash or return the bill, I shall now be compelled to take unpleasant proceedings for the recovery of the bill.")</p>

I have had transactions with Baasil before—I first knew him two or three years ago, and have perhaps had two trans<lb/>actions with him since—they were not about getting bills discounted—I was building a factory at Charlton, in Kent, my builder took my acceptances, and his acceptances got into Bassil's hands—I lost 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the clique down there—I did not know Bassil, but the builder introduced my bills to him, and when I found I was being robbed I was obliged to stop all the bills—we stopped one of the bills, and I asked Bassil to get me 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave me his bill for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a cheque for the balance—when my bills became due they were met, and when Bassil's bills became due they were not met, and I had to pay the money; that is two or three years ago—I called on Bassil about those bills, and he came to my office; I was alone—my clerk Blake brought the bills in, and he stayed there while the bills were made out; he made them out to himself—they are in his writing—he never mentioned Colliver's name—I never heard of him till he came—the drawer's name was left blank, because there was no one to draw the hill, and I handed it to Bassil to get a drawer's name put in—I asked him to give me an acknowledgment of the bills—he did so, and it is all in his writing—I asked for that for the purpose of securing me against Bassil—I do not call it a guarantee; it is an acknowledgment—this document has been in my solicitor's hands—Bassil has been there occasionally, but I do not know whether it has been in his hands—I am prepared to swear that Bassil was in the building when I signed it, but not that he saw me put my name to it—I cannot say whether he saw it or not—I only put my name to the document because I thought it would make it more legal, make it plainer—it is all in Bassil's writing; it takes more than one to make an agreement, and therefore I signed it—I swear that Blake was present, and saw me write my name to it—I received what I was satisfied with for the first bill—Colliver gave me this paper on 23rd July as security, a sort of charge for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on some houses which he was building at Wandsworth</p>

               <p>it is an order to pay me the money, but the foundations of the houses were not in—that 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. went into the solicitor's pocket—that is all the money I have received—I have heard of Mr. Ashman; he was a solicitor I believe; I do not know whether he is now—I do not know of Basil having received any money from Colliver; for aught I know Colliver may have paid Bassil the remainder of the bill—Newbon, Harvey, and Co. are Mr. Hadley's solicitors—I signed this receipt; it is dated 28th May, 1879—the order on Mr. Hadley was in 1878—I have seen Colliver once or twice in the streets since these proceedings, and again when he was arrested at Staines and locked up—(I have not taken up the 5501. bill yet because the gentleman has got his set urity)—I have never been offered the money before the date of this receipt in 1879, nor do I know that my solicitors have, but I believe the money has been in Messrs. Newbon and Harvey's hands for some time—I would not take it while proceedings were going on, but it was not offered me—I believe Mr. Hadley paid Colliver, who lodged the 2501. with Messrs.

The whole of the document in question, except the signature of James Chambers, was in Bassil's writing, and was in fact nothing more than a guarantee or acknowledgment that he had received the two bills to do something with, but it was no direction in writing from the prosecutor to Bassil, and that it was necessary that the direction contemplated by the Statute should emanate from the person entrusting, and not from the person entrusted. Secondly, the prosecutor put the document in a drawer, and kept it some time till he handed it to his solicitor, and there was no evidence that it was ever in Bassil's hands at all, and on that ground also, as Basal was never entrusted with it, there was no evidence to go to the Jury.</hi>

The ques<lb/>tion was whether he did not partake of the proceeds in violation of good faith, and aid and abet in Bassil's misconduct, and that it was for the Jury to say whether, as they did not want the bills for the purpose stated, their pretending that they wanted them for a specific purpose was a false statement. And, lastly, that if there was any offence shown on the conspiracy Counts it was a matter of indifference upon which Count the prisoners were found guilty.</hi>

I am the prisoner's wife and live at 32, Stanhope Street, Hampstead Road—on the night of 15th September, when I was in bed, I heard my husband strike a match; I raised my head, saw it was my husband—I remember no more until I felt his hand on my neck; he squeezed it, but not very heavily; blood came from my ears, I could not rightly tell how he did it—nothing happened to my ears, there was a little blood in my earhole, I did not find that out till some time after, as I went to the police station that same morning—nothing happened to my eyes—I had a bit of a cold in my eyes; they were bloodshot next day, not that night—I was insensible for a few minutes; that was from the fright; when I came to myself I got out of bed and went downstairs and made an alarm—I then went back and put on my clothes and went to the station in Albany Street and made a complaint—my husband had been drinking for a whole fortnight before this and had never been sober once—when sober a better husband could not be or a more tender father—we</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Norfolk with Mr. Betts when this discovery was made, and I wrote and said it was to be submitted to Mr. Campbell—the prisoner seemed very much distressed, and I said "The best thing you can do is to make every reparation in your power by dis<lb/>closing every fact"—he offered to make over what property he had, consisting of various things, and I said that I would look into the matters and investigate them and lay them before Mr. Betts, and I did so—he mentioned three houses at Holloway, but I am not aware that any assignment was made of them—I found that they had been mortgaged to their full value—I sent a gentleman well versed in such matters to look at the timber, and found what with the embargo for rent, and the quality of the timber, and the time it had been lying there, it was as worthless as the houses—I told the prisoner that the pretended assets had vanished into thin air, and that his representations were false—that was some time after April—I think it was after Mr. Howell's report that Mr. Betts decided on prosecuting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know of my own kuowledge that the deficiencies were 960<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I know they were very large—I do not remember seeing this book before; Mr. Joyce told me that he carried Mr. Willison's account in his pocket, but—he never showed it to me—I believe I got the valuation of the timber from my son, who I also employed; I do not remember the amount, but it was nothing like 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the document; it says "Please deliver to Messrs. Betts and Co. all the timber lodged with you in my name, W. H. Wiilison"—I consulted Mr. Betts about it; I wanted to discover who the aiders and abettors of Wiilison were—I did not inform Mr. Campbell till ray letter of January, 1879—I never saw a report from Mr. Howell that I am aware of—I was in Marseilles when the summons whs taken out—the prisoner said that he did not think the houses would fetch the money advanced on them—I think they were in Oldfield Villas, Birkbeck Road; I do not think there were any others—I suggested to Mr. Luckin, the auctioneer, that the Sale ought to be postponed till matters were looked into—the prisoner told me in April, 1878, that he had brought an action against a Mr. Aylett; Messrs. Tillyard were the solicitors I believe, and I suggested at his request that Messrs. Attenborough should be the solicitors, and that the action should go on for Mr. Betts's benefit—I do not I know that it was. settled by a pay<lb/>ment of money to Mr. Attenborough and his costs deducted—I beliive Mr. Betts paid Messrs.

               <p>could buy 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of timber and five houses otherwise than with the money of Mr. Betts—Mr. Willison, senior, was not a member of the firm—no part of the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deficiency has been restored—I told the prisoner several times that I would put everything before Mr. Betts, and he must throw himself on his mercy; and after the investigation I told him everything had vanished into thin air, and we declined to have anything to do with the supposed assets—I think the prisoner mentioned something about being in embarrassed circumstances some years ago and he got some little relief from Mr. Betts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Betts's employ—I superintend the books and look generally after the business—by the entries in the booh I first began to superintend them in June, 1877; I continued the work which Mr. Campbell had in hand up to that time—I checked the posting of the money into the ledger from the prisoner's cask-book and checked the receipts appearing in the cash-book against the prisoner's paying-over book—I made entries in December, 1877, on the right-hand side of the cash-book from the paying-over book—on 1st January, 1878, there was 693<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against the prisoner, and I asked him how he accounted for having such a large amount in hand—he said it consisted of varioui amounts which he had out, and it would rectify itself by-and-bye—at the end of February, 1878, I noticed that Borwick's cheque for 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I knew had been received, was not entered in the cash-book—when that cheque was added it showed a balance against him of 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I spoke to him about it and he said it had been forgotten, and then it was entered out of its proper date—the preceding entry is 24th February, and Borwick's cheque is entered on 18th February—the paying-over book shows the payment of various sums by the prisoner between those two dates—this is an entry from which he would hand in the cheque when he got it—the entry in the paying-over book is "18th February, cheque 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is no description of the person from whom it was received—the same thing occurs in March with reference to another cheque—I recollect Mr. Campbell going to the factory in April, 1878, and I received instruc<lb/>tions to cull on the customers and write to them, which took six months, as they were so numerous, and while I was so occupied I was taken ill; that was in January, 1879—I did not assist the accountant who was called in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I used to look over the books once or twice a week, but I did not ascertain the amount of cash in hand because we were not interfering with Willison, it was left entirely in his hands—I had never gone through the books up to that time to ascertain the state of the accounts—Willison, senior, had nothing to do with them—the prisoner had been for a number of years in connection with our establishment, and about August, 1878, he referred the police to Betts and Co. for inquiries about a licence, and I said to the officer "I cannot give an answer, I must refer you to the firm;" I referred to Mr. Campbell, and then told the police I should not say anything for or against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Son, and Edmunds—we received instructions to prosecute the prisoner from Mr. Betts after Mr. Howell's formal report—that occupied some time and the matter was placed before a Magistrate in April—there is no truth in the suggestion that we have benefited by money received from Aylett by the prisoner—on 8th May, 1878, I went to Holloway and saw Campbell, Cheswright, and Willison; a conversation took place with reference to what were supposed to be irregularities in Willison's accounts—he knew me and I knew him and his father before him for years—a conversation ensued in reference to the action against Aylett; he said that Aylett owed him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and desired me to take the matter up for him; I declined to do so; out of good feeling to him I suggested that he should have all the benefit of it, and allowed him to go on with the action, and therefore the first solicitor's costs had to be paid, and I induced Mr. Cheswright to allow me to check those payments; the end of it was that only enough was received to pay Mr. Atten borough's costs—the money I advanced him has never been paid.</p>

I am a private in the 2nd Battalion of the Coldstream Guards—I was at the Admiral Nelson on 27th September, about 8.30 p.m., drinking with Burton—we had a pot of ale there—we had been to the Crown and the Prince of Wales, and had a glass of ale at each place—after we had been at the Admiral Nelson a short time the prisoners came in, and wanted to speak to Burton, but he would have nothing to do with them—Burton and myself and Smith and the female were going out, and the prisoners rushed up, and Flynn knocked Burton down, and while he was on the ground Neal took' the watch out of his pocket—Smith, who was near Burton in front of him, took the watch out of Neal's hand and gave it to the landlady over the bar—Burton lay about half a minute, and then got up and came outside to follow the prisoners—the prisoners ran up the street and we ran after them, but could not get to them for the people in the street—I went up with Burton the same night to the police-station, and saw them with seven or eight others, but did not identify them—O'Brien was there and went in separately.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my brother as bullion dealers at Cornhill—I knew the prisoner some years before 1876—he had been employed at Baum's, in Lombard Street, who carried on a similar busi<lb/>ness, and failed about that time, and he was thrown out of employment—he called on us at Cornhill, and asked us to engage him in our business—we said that we had no vacancy—he mentioned his connection with Baum's, and suggested that he might be useful, and eventually we took offices in Fenchurch Street, where I and my partners paid 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent, and we had telegraphic communication laid on between Cornhill and the branch in Fenchurch Street—we found the bullion and capital lor the branch business</p>

               <p>—the prisoner was in the first instance to receive one-third of the gross profits made, hut we dismissed him at the end of November, 1876, and he was away from the business for a fortnight, and one of our clerks from Comhill took charge of it—the prisoner was then re-engaged at a salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, which he was to draw from his cash, and to receive half of the gross profits after 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that arrangement continued till July last, when he was discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I assert positively that he was our clerk and servant—the name of H. Harris was placed over the door in Fenchurch Street—he had not full control of the office business there, but he had as much control as our managing partner had—there was no one there as a rule to assist him, but somebody would go occasionally from our office—he had full power to buy what he pleased and sell what he pleased as far as money-changing was concerned; he made his own prices—he had business cards with the address on them "H. Harris and Co.," describing the business in German, French, and English—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—supposing an emigrant coming from abroad and wishing to dispose of bills, the prisoner had authority to buy them; and he was entitled, if they were going to Germany, to draw in his own name on bankers abroad in order to give persons a draft in Germany—his name would be on drafts on bankers in Berlin and Frankfort—our names were not on the drafts which he drew—he could exercise his own discretion with reference to such drafts to what amount he pleased, but he was told to consult us on any business of import<lb/>ance—he could not draw on bankers in his own name and transact business in his own name without asking us for instructions on whom he should draw—he was not empowered to draw for a certain amount on foreign bankers in his own name, but he did so with our knowledge, and those drafts were circulated without our name being on them—persons sometimes came to us at Cornhill with crossed cheques and asked us to change them—we did not then give them the card of Harris and Co. as an independent firm, and send them there to get them changed; we may have done so, but I don't recollect an instance; we were in the habit of sending Harris all business which was too small for us—I remember the prisoner changing a cheque for a person named Jackson—they may have applied to Cornhill first, and I may have sent them on with Harris's card; I do not remember—Mr. Glazier the cashier, or my brother would see such a customer—we are not in the habit of dealing in crossed cheques, and if one is brought in, no doubt it would be brought by a stranger—crossed cheques are not understood on the Continent, and persons having them wish to turn them into money, and English strangers have brought in English cheques crossed, but we do not change them; it is not the regular course of business—the prisoner could change them if he chose to make the inquiries, which we did not choose to make—it is not the regular course of business for a money-changer to change a crossed cheque for a perfect stranger—a man named Jackson was tried here who had passed a cheque which was changed by Harris, and we subpœnaed Harris as a witness, and inquiries were made through Messrs. Wontner and Son in reference to the cheque which passed through our bank—that cheque was changed by Harris and sent back by him to us, and passed through our bankers—I do not remember Jackson coming to us—the prisoner started with a certain amount of bullion as his stock-in-trade—it was his habit to send the bullion-bag from Fenchurch Street to Cornhill every night, and it</p>

               <p>was placed in the Cornhill office—"bullion" means not only coin, but notes as well in our business, and if, when it was there, some one came for some particular class of currency which we had not got, we should go to the bag and take out what we wanted and put a memorandum into the bag, a kind of I O U to replace the amount we took out—we made no permanent record in any book beyond that slip dropped into the bag—my brother would de the same if he required it, and also the cashier—if we were short of any particular currency before the bag came back we sent and borrowed it from Fenchuroh Street—by "we"I mean the three of us—we should inquire by telegram if he had got it, and then send a memorandum slip representing the amount lent—Harris had no business to change crossed cheques without ascertaining what he was doing—he did not speculate, nor did we share the profits of it; he was forbidden to do so—the cash-book was before him, and as he bought anything he entered it on one side, and as he sold, on the other; every one of the occurrences named in the indictment is properly entered on one side or the other; all the sums mentioned in the indictment relate to sums mentioned in this book, and it is from the book that our clerks have made up the accounts that they have—from this book he would post to the ledger and the stock-book—this is the foundation for all the set of books—3,310 marks are entered on 14th January, 1879, as having been purchased by him—we occasionally act as bankers, and allow people to have balances and cheque-books—we opened an account with Harris, and he re<lb/>ceived a cheque-book with blank forms, and if he had not coin to pay customers he drew cheques on us, signed "Harris and Co."—all the entries of the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week are merely put down under expenditure account "Harris 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is no entry of "Harris, wages," or "salary"—it was necessary to put down the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week under the expenditure account before we could arrive at the profit which had to be divided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We do a large business at our principal office in ex<lb/>changing coupons—I cannot remember whether we paid for the printing of Harris's cards—when he had not money in stock he drew on us, and if one of our clerks was in charge of his office for a time he would sign cheques—he would telegraph to us to say that he wanted more bullion, and if we had it we supplied it—it did not often happen that we wanted it—if he changed a crossed cheque it would come back with the other money from his office to us, and would pass through the accounts—we opened an account in Paris in the name of H. Harris and Co.—this is a copy of our letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was in French, it wot dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd January</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">from Burt and Co. to a banker in Paris, asking him to open an account in the name of H.

An I O U in the bullion bag would be settled the next morning at the head office—we lock up all our bullion at the bank, and next morning we should take back the memorandum, which would leave things as they were originally—there was no reason for a record of it but if we had not got it we should credit him with it—the memorsndum occa<lb/>sionally</p>

I am in business with my brother and Mr. Procketon as bullion dealers at 71, Cornhill—on the failure of Baum and Co., the prisoner came to us for employment, and haying no vacancy for him, we eventually established this French business in Fenchurch Street—our firm signed an agreement for the lease, and supplied entirely the cash for carry<lb/>ing on the business—he was to act alone at Fenchurch Street, and in order that he might have advice from us we had a private telegraph laid on between Fenchurch Street and Cornhill, for which our firm made an agree<lb/>ment with the Post-office—he had to render us an account of his dealings every quarter, which he did satisfactorily till the end of 1878, and there was no difficulty in obtaining the books from him—on the business of last year the gross profits were about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as he had half of the profits, over 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that would be 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to his salary—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the quarterly statement he sent in on 31st March this year, of the different kinds of bullion in stock; it is his writing—after we got that the books were not sent as usual; we repeatedly applied for them, and were not able to get them—we asked him for them, and he said that they were not quite in order; he was getting on with them—the matter went on till June, and on 30th June he sent in this statement, purporting to show the amount of bullion he had in hand—we again applied for the books, and were unable to get them—I telegraphed to him on 25th July, and as it produced no result I sent a clerk to him on Saturday—early on the morning of the 28th I waited in a doorway opposite till Harris came—I followed him into the office, and asked him what was the meaning of such extraordinary conduct, referring to the previous Saturday, when he had left the office, taking the key with him—he made no reply—I said "Are the books in order?"—he said "They are"—I said "Why did you not send them as you promised?"—he said that I should find them all in order, with all the lists attached, and gave them to me with the lists—I said "I shall take them to the office, and have them verified in ordinary course; after your conduct we shall not require your services any more; if you have any communication to make you know where to find us, and we shall have occasion to communicate with you before long'—the bag of bullion was not allowed to go back after it came to our office on the Friday night—I found the ledger was made up to 31st March only, and the stock book was only partly made up—I had them posted up by our clerk—I found this piece of paper on the premises with this stock list. (<hi rend="italic">These were the draft accounts of</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st March</hi>)—this shows that the value of the bullion in stock on 31st March was 542<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I have compared the ledger with the cash book, and find that he ought to have had 1,043<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—there is no heading to this; it is merely some figures resulting in that sum; it is the balance of the different accounts in the ledger—between those two amounts there is a deficiency of 501<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the balance of the ledger on 30th June shows that there should be 1,141<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that the deficiency on 30th June was increased to 563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is a list of the bullion found in the bag on 28th July; it is 582<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the ledger at page 436 shows that it should he 1,157<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that the deficiency had increased to 557<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I prepared this table (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the books, showing the deficiency in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200067"/>
               <p>the different kinds of bullion, and it shows a deficiency on 30th March, 30th J line, and 28th July—I find in the stock book in Harris's writing an entry on page 19 of the purchase of 310 Prussian notes bought on 14th January, 1879, and in the cash book at page 198, on 4th February, 920 Prussian marks—that entry is omitted altogether in the stock book—I find in the stock book at page 30 an entry on 1st February, 1879, of 200 francs French notes purchased by Harris, and by the cash book at page 230 I find that the actual purchase on that date was 2,200 francs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-easamined.</hi> Up to 31st March the ledger which he posted up him<lb/>self is correct with the piece of paper which was found—it shows that he ought to have had 1,043<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in hand—the ledger is posted from the cash-book—he has entered 920 marks on 4th February in the ledger, and entered it properly in the ledger in the total of the day—he has made a perfectly complete entry in two out of three books—he was our clerk and servant, and we could have gone and looked at the books and found that on 31st March he ought to have had 1,043<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or we could have fetched the books away—the balance of 31st March was made up about six weeks before—we did not have the books till July, when I took possession of them—it was no use getting them unless they were made up—when he started, in addition to the cards a circular was issued in his name—Mr. Brockton looks after the general management with my brother—we were all three present at the arrangement—we wrote a letter to a Prussian gentleman, saying that Harris was to have the sole signature—he had full liberty to go to his office when he pleased, leave when he pleased, and do what he pleased—it was his duty to attend in the ordinary busi<lb/>ness hours—there were ordinary rules of business—he would not take a holiday without our permission, I swear that—he had not to ask out per<lb/>mission when persons wanted to change crossed cheques, but as a rule he had to ask us when he drew on a foreign banker, but it depended entirely on the amount—he had a right to do it, and he did it on many occasions—I am not aware of any speculations which he entered into—I know of no transactions outside of what we call legitimate ones for him to go into which he went into, and which left a profit which we participated in—the purchase and sale of bills every day is supposed to leave a profit, but we did not know of every transaction which took place—we frequently sold 30,000 and 50,000 francs to Venablea and Co. on Paris—I have not the remotest recollection of drawing a cheque on my Paris bankers payable to the order of Harris and Co.—our books would show it, and it would be legitimate business—I have no recollection of asking Harris to sell to Venables and Co. 30,000 francs on Paris, as the exchange was rising, but it could have occurred—if a cheque was drawn payable to Harris and Co. it would have to be endowed, and they would have their name there—700 Austrian coupons does not remind me of a transaction between us and 'Harris—Kulb and Go. are money-changers—we may have had to sell them some Austrian coupons, but I know nothing about it—when we did not want our name to appear the prisoner would do the transactions in the name of Harris and Co., and they would appear in our books—I know that inquiries were made about a crossed cheque changed by Jackson—I cannot say whether we said that our books contained no record of the trans<lb/>action—I have no doubt we referred them to Harris and Co.—my brother is the senior partner—that very cheque had gone through our bankers and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200068"/>
               <p>appeared in our cash-book—I cannot say whether we returned Harris's name to the Income Tax Commissioners as one of our clerks liable to income tax—I have never seen the return—my brother attended to that—Harris no doubt made an independent return at Fenchurch Street—I do not think my brother has mentioned that the bag was always taken at night by the prisoner and brought back at night by him, until he broke his leg, and then he used to give in an account of his transactions during the day—there was a gross profit all through of about 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from 1876 to 1878, with<lb/>out the 570<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd which we say is deficient, and there is really more than that—Baum and Co. were a well-known firm of money-changers, and we took the prisoner from there because we thought we should get the connection of the fallen house—what clients he had we have now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As to Jackson, the name of the banker would appear in our cash accounts; any other entries would appear in the books of Harris and Co.—if the draft on Paris for 30,000 occurred it would appear no doubt in the prisoner's books, and so would the 700 Austrian coupons—I have no knowledge of any such transactions, nor have they been pointed out to me in the books—we have no means of testing whether the trans<lb/>actions in the cash-book really took place—we had to take the prisoner's account of what he professed to have bought and sold during the day—he professes to have bought 3,314 marks on 14th January, and that appears as a charge against us—we are charged indirectly of course—at page 198 the 3,314 marks are carried out as 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the account the prisoner kept it is charged as money belonging to us, but spent by him in the purchase of those marks, and on the other side there is 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes which he received of us that day—the ledger is a posting of the cash-book, and tallies with it—in order to see whether we really have the stock which he professes to have bought it is necessary to turn to the stock account, and on doing so I find that he has left out the 3,000 marks with which he has charged us—he never complained of any loss of money or deficiency from any transaction which had taken place—the only suggestion was made at the Mansion House—all the materials for the stock-book are found in the cash-book.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think the transaction of the 30,000 francs took place—we often have a large sum in Paris once or twice a week, and nothing the next day—Harris may have purchased the amount for us for the account in Fenchurch Street—whenever bollion and bank notes were wanted he used to purchase them of us—Harris and Co. used to buy of us—I do not recollect asking Harris to sell 30,000 francs in Paris to Venables and Co., but we may have done so—I do not recollect anything unless you give me a date—I recollect about the 700 Austrian coupons, we told him to go and sell them to Culver and Co.—we did not sell them ourselves, because Culver's might have thought we were selling on account of flat markets abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I take part in the management of the Cornhill business—if the prisoner wanted bullion of a particular description he would telegraph to us to see if we had got it, and if we had it we sent it round to him, and the account was debited with the price of it, unless he returned it the same day—the price at which he sold it would come in on the other side of the account.</p>

Leake, because we should let him have short lengths—I thought that would suit him better in a small shop—I knew he was with Bergero before he began business, but I do not know how long—Bergers has been in the same line of business for 50 years, and is highly respectable, and go is Kirby, so far as I know up to this time—I know he dealt with Outram's, a highly respectable City warehouse, and referred them to us as a reference—I had not told him to refer them to us, but I suggested that he should give us as a reference to any one he went to buy goods of, as he had told us his capital and explained his affairs, and they seemed satisfactory, and we were the parties to refer to—he told us he gave 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the business and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the leape of the premises at 626, Mile End Road, and had given notice to withdraw 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from an insurance office—he did not say he had insured in an office in King William Street, and hoped if the securities were satisfac<lb/>factory to get an advance of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from them—I have it written down—he did not tell me the name of the office, and I did not ask him.</p>

                  </hi>. On 13th August I saw Mr. Briton at my place—he was in conversation with Mr. Poole when I arrived—Briton produced this document and said "I have called to save you from further trouble and expense in Kirby's matter; I am the holder of the bill of sale which is executed to me for moneys I have advanced to him"—I said "Were the moneys recently advanced, or when was the consideration given?"—he said "A portion of it is recent and a portion of an anterior date"—I said "Are you a relative of Kirby's?"—he said "I am"—I said "What relative?"—he said "Uncle by marriage"—I said "Well, we shall have to inquire into this matter, and I do not think you will find it will end here"—I had no personal knowledge except from my manager, Mr. Poole, as to the sale of the goods and the amount due—I instructed my solicitors to bring an action against Kirby for the recovery of the amount due to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Poole was present I believe during the whole of the conversation with Briton—I do not recollect asking Briton to secure my debt, but I may have done so—he said if we would grant Kirby further time he would come to the rescue, and no doubt matters would be all right—I had never seen Briton before—he looked a respectable man—I will not swear I did not then say "Well, will you secure this debt?"—I do not think he mentioned any particular sum—I cannot speak positively, or whether he said he had advanced him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as early as 1874—I do not think it was mentioned—I only asked him a question to see whether there had been a moving consideration for the bill of sale—I think Mrs. Brierley's name was mentioned, but not the amount she had advanced—I did not say, "Now we must have our money, 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it was barred by the bill of sale—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200071"/>
               <p>he said "If you will give Kirby a little time I have no doubt matters will be all right"—I said "Well, there has been too much shuttling already; we cannot consent to farther delay"—I did not know the amount alto<lb/>gether of the goods he had had—I did not say "If he does not pay I will prosecute him for getting goods under false pretences"—I did not know I had the power to prosecute him—I do not remember Poole saying that, and I gave him no instructions, because I did not know the interview was going to take place—I was dtiled down from another part of the ware-house—I approve of the prosecution, or I would not have instituted it, and did not expect to get the money quicker by taking these steps, and did not in consultation with Mr. Poole beforehand suggest putting the screw on—if Mr. Briton had discharged the debt, and our judgment had been satisfied, I should have been satisfied—I only wanted to be paid.</p>

               <p>"Then I will give you till next Saturday," which would be the 16th—this was Wednesday the 13th—Mr. May came in while I was talking to Police-court—I know nohting of their proceedings at judge chambers—I since ascertained there was another action, Adams v Kirby—the Sheriff went in at the suit of a creditor, and I gave notice of my claim under the bill of sale—the Sheriff then interpleaded, and I was summoned, and attended on the interpleader, and was required to find security for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and to try an interpleader at the next term—I found it impossible to find security by reason of the proceedings taken by Venables, and Moseley's evidence that the cheques were given by Kirby in my favour—the Magistrate committed the case for trial on the ground that if Moseley's testimony were correct there was strong evidence of intention to defraud—there is no truth in Moseley's statement that the cheques were Kirby's, or that these were fictitious transactions—I produced these cheques in Court, and I never had cheques of Kirby—I swear all this money was advanced, and is now unpaid.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The first item, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., mentioned in the bill of sale as advanced on 28th October, 1874, was not all advanced on that day—it had been advanced in small sums, the first part of it a few weeks pre<lb/>viously and the others followed—I took no receipts—I asked him to square up the account, and as he was negotiating the sale of a picture, and thought he should receive 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, I took a bill of exchange as a guarantee for the debt—I had no difficulty in settling the amount; he took my word for it—he knew what he owed—I did not want to negotiate the bill, but wanted the money, and he said he should be able to pay it—I took bis signature on the back of the cheques as a receipt—all my cheques were payable to bearer, and I have never struck out the word "bearer" and inserted the word "order"—I have known it done at the time I gave him the cheque he endorsed it on the back in my presence as an acknowledgment—he then paid it into Smith's bank, and it came back to me through my bankers! believe I crossed tins cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but will not swear it is crossed by: me—the endorsement on he back of the cheques is the only receipt I took—they were all payable to bearer drawn by me in Kirby's presence, and endorsed by him in my presence—I had no book with cheques payable to "order"—he went into business at Mile End Road in March, and before that used to deal in pictures—I believe he had a little capital when he started busineas—did not lend him any then—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were advanced in 1878—I first asked him in the first week in August to give me a bill of sale, but had before then several times threatened to make him a hankrupt—I was not aware when I pressed him for a bill of sale early in August that his creditors were pressing him—he did not tell me so, or that Venables were suing him—I did not know about Venables till afterwards—about July last Kirby asked me if I would go and arrange afterwards—about a little debt he owed him—I went, but did not see Mr. Lyndhurst, and the arrangement was subsequenty made—when Kirby gave notice to defend an action by a creditor I said "Well if you are being attacked by your creditors, you will soon have a lot of other creditors suing and I think it is quite time I should begin to look after myself"—I had heard that Mrs. Beierley had threatened to make him a</p>

               <p>bankrupt; I thought I would do it myself, and I said, "As I am the largest creditor, I shall certainly do so"—it was then proposed jointly that Mrs. Brierley should join with me in the bill of sale, and that I should act as her trustee—I did not know of any pressure by other creditors, and immediately I heard about Venables I called upon him—I heard about Venables the day after the bill of sale was registered—I had not been requested to call, but I did so to give them notice that I held the bill of sale, and to save the annoyance of having an execution on the premises, and of my having to contest the bill of sale, and also to save them the expense of going on uselessly with the proceedings—they put in an execution, and I claimed the goods under the bill of sale—the Sheriff issued an interpleader summons, and I paid the money under protest, but abandoned it afterwards as it was a small amount, because I knew if I contested it the execution creditor would try to upset the bill of sale—Lyndhurst's was the first execution—on Messrs. Adams's claim an order was made to try issue on my finding security for 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I could not do in consequence of Moseley's evidence before the Magistrates, as it reflected upon my character—the money was to be paid into Court as security, and I did not feel disposed to pay it myself, as I thought I had lost enough.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The alleged libels were as follows</hi>: On 30th August, "A petition has been filed in the Divorce Court by Mr. Langtry. H.R. H. the Prince of Wales and two other gentlemeu, whose names up to the time of going to press we have not been enabled to learn, are mentioned as co-respondents. We have been informed that H.R.H. the Prince of Wales and Lord Lonsdale and Lord Londesborough are the co-respondents in the suit." On 7th September, "No attempt has been made to contradict the state<lb/>ment published in these columns last week as to the Langtry divorce case; and my readers may be assured that it was no invention. I now learn that a few weeks ago an application was made that the case be tried in camera, and I believe the learned judge acceded to the request." On 13th September, "I am informed that the Langtry divorce case will be one of the first tried when the Court reopens in November. It has been finally decided to try the case in camera, and so scandal-mongers will be deprived of a fine opportunity. Mrs. Langtry has, I understand, filed an answer denying the adultery, and as far as I can learn the petitioner will find it exceedingly difficult to make good his case. Anyhow at present I will give no opinion either of the petition or the defence. Of course there will be a great outcry against the case being tried privately, but I don't see why any one need be dissatisfied, especially as the details are not likely to be creditable to us as a nation. I don't care about being more explicit." On 20th September, "I am informed that the Home Secretary has warned managers of the music-halls against allow<lb/>ing comic singers making any reference to the Langtry divorce case. The press has always, of its own account, refrained from commenting on cases while they are sub judice; now, comic singers will be compelled to hold their tongues." On 27th September, "Labby says in <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> he read in a 'French paper' that Mr. Langtry is petitioning for a divoice from his wife. Why doesn't Labby tell the truth, and say he read it in <hi rend="italic">Town Talk</hi>? He furthermore says there is no truth in the statement. Let me tell him there is none in his. If Labby will take the trouble to go to Scmerset House he will be able no doubt to see the petition. If he doesn't care to bother himself so much as that, let him ask their lord<lb/>ships, Londesborough and Lonsdale." "Jenkins, of the <hi rend="italic">Nurdin and Peacock Review</hi>, says he looked through the list of causes set down for hearing in the Divorce Court, and he didn't see the case of 'Langtry v. Langtry.' Of course not, you dunderheaded idiot. The case is to be tried privately, an application for hearing it in camera having been made and consented to as far back as January last." On 8th October, "I am now informed, on authority which I have no reason to doubt, that Mr. Langtry has withdrawn the petition which he had filed in the Divorce Court. The case of 'Langtry v. Langtry and Others' is, therefore, finally disposed of, and we have probably heard the last of it. It is useless for the sixpenny twaddlers to deny that Mr. Langtry ever filed a petition. He did, and, as I have said before, an application was made to Sir James Hannen to hear it privately, and he consented. I am told also that it is not at all unlikely that Mr. Langtry will shortly be appointed to some diplomatic post abroad. It is not stated whether his beautiful consort will accompany him."</p>

In July last I was living at 17, Hendon Street, Pimlico—I rented the shop and parlour of the prisoner, and carried on business as a fancy dealer and frame maker—the prisoner lived in the house, and carried on the business of a photographer—we are both Russians—some few weeks back I told him I thought of leaving, as I made very bad business—he said he had a very good business in bis hands—I asked what it was—he said false Russian notes—he asked me to write to my friends at St. Petersburg!)—he afterwards gave me two Russian notes, one for 26 roubles, and one for 10, to send to my friend as specimens—I took them to the Russian Embassy, and after that acted under the directions of the police—Mr. Goldfarb arrived from St. Petersburg in the name of Greeman—I introduced the prisoner to him—we met at Goldfarb's rooms in Warwick Street at different times, and the police came, and took the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the White Rose, Castle Street, Leicester Square—on Saturday, 27th September, I had some boxes of cigars in the bar-parlour window, which looks out into the yard, in which there is a urinal, and between that window and the yard is an area and a space of about 3 feet—it is a very deep area, with a drop of about 15 feet—on that night about 10 o'clock the barman called my attention to the bar-parlour window, and I saw the window sliding down—I ran at once into the yard, and saw the prisoner getting down from the window-ledge—he had one foot on a wooden bar over the front of the area, and the other foot on the window-ledge—the window is about 6 inches higher than the rail—if he missed his footing he would fall down the area below—I said, "What are you doing there?"—he said, "Nothing"—I saw another man crouching down, with his back to me, at the bottom of the area—the area window was barred—I fetched a police-man, but when he came both the men were gone—the next morning, about 8 o'clock, I went into the yard, and found eight cigars near where the prisoner had been standing, and I missed from the window-ledge a box con<lb/>taining 100 cigars, which had been there about two months—those I picked up in the yard were of the same quality and make as those I had lost—I am quite sure they were there on the 27th, and the box had not been opened—the prisoner came in my house again on the Monday about 11 or 12, and while I went out of one door to fetch a policeman, he went out of the other and ran down the street—the police at that time had had information—the prisoner came in again a day or two after, but I was alone and could not leave the bar—the last time he came in was Wednesday, October 8th, and he said, "Mr. Bull, I am very sorry I stole your cigars; I was induced to do it by Fred, the polisher, the one that fell down the area"—that was the first</p>

I am a builder's material dealer, and now live at 4, Wickham Road, Tottenham—when this took place I resided at 65, Old Bethnal Green Road—I was too ill to attend here at the last Session—the prisoner is my sister; she is four years older than me—on 7th August she was living with me and my brother as housekeeper—we were moving our goods that day from 65, Old Bethnal Green Road to 4, Wickham Place—she went away for about half an hour about dinner-time, 1 o'clock—she had not dined with us—she had been in and out the whole of the morning—I had not had any quarrel with her up to dinner-time—on the recommendation of my brother I never spoke to her the whole day except in the early morning—I did not annoy her by word or gesture; I never took the faintest notice of her since 6 o'clock—she made an attack on me then with a chopper, but. it was fruitless—I had had words with her before—she had the chopper with her the previous night, and threatened me with it—she is an habitual drunkard, and my brother and I were simply watching her—we always treated her with the utmost kindness—she had a most dreadful antipathy to me—r had remonstrated with her the night before about her habits—in the morning she attacked me again with the chopper, and with the assistance of my brother and the man that was helping us to move we got it away from</p>

               <p>her—I treated that very lightly; she was intoxicated—between 12 and 1 I went out to get my dinner, and when I returned she was standing in the parlour leading to the shop—a man who was assisting us in moving took up a glass containing some stuff from the window-sill or table and put it to his mouth to drink, and it burnt him most fearfully—he came running into the kitchen to me, and I said, "I suppose that was meant for me"—the prisoner must have heard me, and as I was passing from the kitchen through the parlour she had the glass in her hand—she said, very quickly, "What's that, what's that you say, you b——if you won't have it inside you shall have it out," and with that she dashed it in my eyes or in my face, and I believe the glass followed—I believe she meant it for my eyes—I turned my head aside, and received the contents on the side of my face—it ran down my neck like quicksilver, and burnt both ears most shockingly, and under the throat and the side of my face—I could not see; I was thoroughly dazed, I scarcely knew what I was doing—I was taken to the London Hospital, and am an inmate there now—I kept my bed for some weeks; it has caused a general shock to my system.</p>

I am now living at 4, Wickham Road—I did live at 65, Old Bethnal Green Road, with my brother and sister, the prisoner—on 7th July a young man called my attention to some liquid in a glass; it looked like pale brandy—my sister came into the room and said, "Give it to me; that is mine"—I said, "No, I shall not give it to you till I know what it is"—I took it from the table and had it in my hand—I said, "Look at that man, his mouth is burnt"—she turned round to him and said, "What a fool you were to touch it without knowing what it was; I am very sorry for you"—she asked me again to give it to her—I said, "No, not till I know what it is"—she said, "It is only something that I got to clean some gloves with"—I then laid it down on the table, and saw nothing further—she was excited, and saturated with gin at the time—she has been with me about three years—she was never sober, she was continually under the influence of drink, morning, noon, and night; her nature was brutalised with drink—it is not in her nature to have done anything of this kind—I was outside</p>

About a month previous to this, when my eldest brother was out, ha kicked me in the stomach, and I could scarcely stand for a week afterwards. I complained to my eldest brother on his return, and he said I should have kept out of his way, knowing his violent temper. I said I would give information at Scotland Yard of his betting habits, and the gambling hell he intended to keep at Tottenham. He kept everything from me. I wanted a glass that belonged to my mother, and he took an inveterate hatred to me after that. On the morning of the 7th ha asked me if I intended to give him the glass, I said 'No.' He said, holding a knuckle-duster within an inch of my nose, that he would gouge my eye out if I did not return it About three hours after that, as I passed him he spat a mouthful of fluid in my face, and said,' Now, you b——sow, will you give me the glass V and if I laid a hand on anything there, he would kick my face in. He is a card-sharper and associate of the lowest scums of the earth. He goaded me to that extent that I threw it at him I got the vitriol to clean the scales, not the gloves; my eldest' brother has made a mistake. He was taunting me the whole morning through."</p>

I am clerk to Mr. Brown, colliery agent, of King's Cross, I know the three prisoners—Young is carman to Mr. Bull, a coal merchant having a siding at the Great Northern Railway Station, King's Cross—Devoil is one of an association of coal porters who have the privilege of the yard and load for the merchants from the trucks—I have frequently seen him working for Mr. Brown—on 6th September I was pasting along Copenhagen Street, Islington, about 1.45 p.m., and saw one of Bull and Co.'s vans, containing about a ton of coals, at the door of the Mitre public-house, and Devoil carrying a sack of coals into the house—I went back to the yard, and about an hour after I saw Young in the yard with the same van empty, and he said "Can you give me a load?"—I said "I thought you were busy, seeing your van outside the gates un<lb/>loading coals"—he said "I have been doing a load for Bull; I can't do, any more as he has no coal in"—my suspicions being aroused I went to the weighbridge and saw the clerk, Brookson, in the office—after examining the book I said "Who has Young's van gone out for?"—he said "For Bull"—on 8th September I saw Devoil at work in the yard—I said' "Hallo! I thought you had. turned carman, seeing you with a van on Saturday"—he replied "I was only there getting the beer for dinner, and I assisted the man to unload."</p>

I live at Copenhagen Street and was employed by Young as carman—he finds horses for Mr. Bull's vans—I have frequently fetched coals from the Great Northern yard—Mr. Bull gives us two tickets torn from a counterfoil in his book—we take them into the yard and draw on to the weighbridge and hand the weighbridge ticket to the clerk and get the van weighed—the ticket bears the number and date and quantity of coals—I then go to the wharf and give the wharf foreman the other ticket, which bears the same number and date, and the gang then load the van—I then go back to the weighbridge and the clerk weighs the van and gives me the lodge-gate pass, which I give up to the policeman at the gate and pass out to deliver the coals—we could not get out without the pass—I went to the yard with Young on 4th September to fetch 2 tons of Mr. Bull's coals to deliver at Clerkenwell Green—Young handed a ticket to Brookson at the weighbridge, and we went to the wharf and saw the van loaded—I did not notice whether a ticket was given to the wharf foreman—the van was weighed again at the weighbridge and Brookson gave us the lodge-gate pass, and the coals were properly delivered at Clerkenwell—on 6th September, between 12 and 1 o'clock, Young told me to fetch 2 tons of coals from Mr. Bull for delivery at Union Road, Tufnell Park—he gave me a weighbridge ticket, and wharf foreman's ticket, and I went to the yard and gave Brookson the weig bridge ticket, and he weighed the van</p>

               <p>No. 2408, and it is not entered, except where 3221 is scratched out and written over—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the lodge gate pass 2408, which is stamped September 6th, and the name Charles Kind, the gate policeman, is on the back—I find that in the proper course of things the pass 3221 would be issued three or four days later than the 6th—the passes on the 11th were 3086 to 3304, so that No. 3221 would be issued on that date—I find there an entry of pass 3521, which appears to have been entered to Messrs. Goring and Co.</p>

I have been about 15 years a weigh<lb/>bridge clerk—there are eight weighbridges, and one Clerk at each—there would be 400 or 500 carts in a day at No. 4 weighbridge, and only one clerk to attend to them—he is there from 6 to 5, and takes his dinner while at his post—there is no one to assist him—if I am a man short I cannot go and relieve him during his meals—it is a very busy place, and especially No. 4—the clerk receives the Weighbridge ticket, weighs the cart, and enters the weight in this book, which is the only book he has to keep, and that book is changed daily—I have seen 18 to 20 carts at the weighbridge, and 18 to 20 men waiting to go off in rotation—I never saw the Co-operative Coal Com<lb/>pany's ticket-books—they give us a ticket when they come out, which we sign and fill—in Bull's case the Weighbridge clerk initials the ticket, and keeps it, and the carman then goes to the wharf foreman and gives him the Wharf foreman's ticket, and he keeps it to get his money—with other merchants there is only the wharf order, which the weighbridge clerk initials, and returns to the carman to take into the wharf—when the cart comes out the clerk weighs it, and enters the weight in this book, arid gives a pass to the carman usually at that place; a number of carts are waiting to be dis<lb/>posed of—Brooksori has been employed there 5 or 6 years.</p>

On 15th September I went with Sergeant Miller to the Bang's Cross coal yard from information received and saw Devoil there—I said "We are police officers, and are making inquiries about two tons of coals stolen from this yard on the 6th September; we have heard that you were seen carrying sacks of coals into the Mitre Tavern, Copenhagen Street, on the 6th"—he said "Yes, quite right; I went there to get some dinner beer; I met carman Young there; he asked me to assist him in carrying the coals into the house; I carried four or five sacks; I saw some empty sacks on the ground before I carried any"—I said "Did you see the van loaded, or see it before you got to the Mitre?"—he said "No"—I said "Will you accompany me and Miller to the tavern?"—we went there, and saw the landlord, Mr. Parker—I said to him in Devoil's hearing." We are police officers making inquiries about two tons of coals stolen from the Great Northern Coal Yard on 6th September; we have heard that coals were delivered to you on the 6th"—he said "Yes, I did receive some coals on that day"—I said "Who delivered them, and have you got the receipt?"—he said "That man (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Devoil</hi>), carman Young, and another stout man delivered them—he handed me a receipt from a file, and I showed it to Devoil, who said "Yes, I received the order from Mr. Parker for two tons on Thursday; I gave it to Young to do; I signed that receipt, and gave the money to Young at the same time"—the landlord heard that, and said "This is how it occurred. Devoil was in the bar on 4th September, and asked me if I could do with some coals; I asked Devoil what price they were; he said 'They are as low now as they will be this year, 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton.' I said 'You can send me two tons.' The coals were not delivered till Saturday"—I said to Devoil then "After that statement you must know whose truck the coals came out of"—he said "I don't know anything more about it; when I received the order I gave it to Young to do"—I then gave him in custody—I gave Brookson in custody on 15th October—the other two prisoners had been before then under examination at the police-court, and the matter was in Messrs.

I am an oilman, at 63, Cannon Street Road East—on 20th August I was in Aldridge's yard, St. Martin's Lane, and saw the prisoner and another man, who in the prisoner's presence said to me "Will you just come out and see a horse at the back; these men want to buy it; they say the horse is 10 years old; it was only five when I bought it, and I have had it nine months, therefore it cannot be more than six; would you mind coming round to see it?"—I said "All right"—I had had no conversation with them before—I went round to a place in Newport Market, Prince's Road, at the back of Aldridge's, leaving the prisoner in the yard, and when I got there I found the owner of the horse and the prisoner and another man together, but do not know how they got there—I do not know the neighbourhood—I was taken to a shed, and the three men were bartering about the horse—the owner wanted 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and the prisoner offered, him 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he would not sell it on any terras, as he</p>

               <p>paid they hud cheated him by charging him with the trap to try it in for two hours during the day—they all three wanted me to Buy it, and the prisoner said 'If you will buy it for 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we will give you 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I will not have anything to do with it,; get one of your own men to buy if—he said "If one of our own men got hold of it he would not turn it up to us again, finding it was such a good one; besides, it is no use us trying to buy it, the man won't sell it to any of our men"—he said this in the owner's hearing and the others' in the shed—eventually the prisoner and the other man said "If you will buy it we will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for buying it, as we want it for a traveller's trap in Canterbury to-morrow, and it must go away to-night"—the owner was still in the shed, but not in earshot, but it was said again afterwards in his hearing—I did not agree to it then, but they fetched me round there again shortly afterwards—they fetched me from Aldridge's five or six limes, and kept repeating the offer till it got from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., until it reached 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the premium they were to give mo for my foolishness, and I said "Well, I'll give it you," and I paid the money in cash to the man as we were walking together from the shed about 20 yards from the Cock public-house, and we all went in together, and the seller asked for pen and ink—the prisoner's friend said to him "I'll be back in a minute, Tom; stop there," and went away—the seller of the horse instantly handed me the receipt signed in the name of Smith, and then he went and the prisoner followed him immediately, and as he was leaving I said "Where are you going?"—he said "The master is at the next public-house; you had better come down there and have it settled, but first look after the horse"—the horse was in a shed about 20 yards away—I went to the next public-house, but saw none of the three there—I did not follow the prisoner as I had the horse to look after—I thought I had better take the horse, as I could see it was a sell—I took it down the court and led it rouud to all the public-houses I could find to see if I could find the men—I took it to Aldridge's and explained matters to Mr. Freeman, and it was put up for sale next day and fetched 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I next saw the prisoner on 11th September standing against a wall in Stapleton's yard, Bishopsgate, talking to another man—I started to fetch a constable—as I passed him he paw me and turned round arid made for the street—I followed him closely and gave him in charge—I had been to Aldridge's almost every sale day since 20th August to look for him, but never saw him—I have not the slightest doubt he is the man—I parted with my money because the man who was selling the horse appeared to be a gentleman, and was dressed well and spoke well—he said his conscience would not allow him to take the money these people had offered him—I was induced to part with the money first because I thought I was doing the man a service and secondly because of the temptation of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium.

I am a tailor, of 9, Beak Street, Regent Street—Mr. Kittier is my nephew—about December, 1877, he was desirous, in conjunc tion with the prisoner, of taking over the business of Tatham and Co.—they bad been fellow-clerks in the firm; Kittier was traveller—to assist him I advanced him 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to form the capital of the business, and the prisoner was to find a like sum—about 4th or 5th March last the prisoner called on me and said that they were very much, pressed for money, would I discount the Kills that he had with him to the amount of about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did so—amongst them were these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), one for 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 27th January, 1879, at four months, drawn by A.

Kenworthy and Co."—I suppose that was for the 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill that was dishonoured—I paid in that cheque, and that was returned marked, "Refer to drawer"—after this he brought me other bills; some of them were dis<lb/>honoured, and afterwards, from information I gathered, I thought it my duty to institute these proceedings—I am a loser by the bills alone about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>

Ken worthy and Co."—perhaps that was the name they were trading under at that time, but I really cannot tell you—at that time they owed me a considerable sum—no doubt this cheque was given me by the firm to pay off part of that sum—I knew they wanted money because they came to me for the discount, as they could not get them done at the bank—my nephew brought me this cheque; I had some correspondence with the firm befoie it was paid—I wrote for money several times—I cannot tell, the exact date when I knew that this bill of Kobinson's was forged; I think it was about 7th or 8th September—that was the first time I knew anything about it, and I immediately took proceedings—I heard lately that the firm was in Chancery, that there was a dissolution of partnership—I believe my nephew applied for it; I don't know when it commenced—I was quite ignorant of what was taking place at the time—I have offered a composition to the creditors of the estate; I said I would give 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound for it; I agreod to take over the business on that—I have not heard anything of it since.</p>

I am barman at the Cooper's Arms, Sun Street, Finsbury, which is about five minutes' walk from Liverpool Street Station—on 17th September a little after 3 I saw the three prisoners with the two boxes produced—they left our house a little after 3 o'clock—I followed them to Broad Street Station, and on the way saw them put the boxes on their ends at the corner of Eldon Street, and Brock corded one up—I saw them go to the North London Station.</p>

I am barmaid at the Cooper's Arms—I was not present whan the prisoners came into the house on the 17th, but I saw them a few minutes afterwards, about 2 or a little after—one of them called for a pint of ale, and Lee said she had come from the country, and had lost the key of her box—they had these two boxes with them in the private bar—Lee asked me to lend them a key to undo the. boxes, and the house<lb/>keeper lent her a bunch—I left the bar, but I believe none of the keys fitted—a pair of pincers was then asked for, and the housekeeper gave them to them—I went to my dinner, but having to go into the bar for a glass of ale, I found that the male prisoners had left, and Lee was sitting on the lid of the large box—I do not think they were tied up, I saw no cord on them; she got up, and the lid gave way, and I saw the eatch projecting; it had been undone; this was the larger box—the two men came back and called for ginger beer and ale; they all three drank together, and then went away with the boxes.</p>

I am superintendent of the Horsham Division of the West Sussex Constabulary—I was at the Horsham police station on the morning of 6th September—Matthews brought the prisoner there about 2 a.m., and said "This man has confessed to a murder"—the prisoner made no reply—I ordered him to be locked up—about 8 o'clock that morning I visited him in his cell—I said "What is your name?"—he said "Jonathan Geydon"—I said "Spell it?"—he said "G-e-y-d-e-n"—I said "How old are you?"—he said "Somewhere about 50"—I said "Where do you come from?"—he said "Walthamstow, Essex"—I said "I am going to ask you a question, you need not answer me unless you like, but whatever you say I shall use in evidence against you"—I then said "Early this morning you have confessed to one of my constables having murdered a woman at Chingford; do you still adhere to that statement, as it is a most serious charge?"—he said "Yes, it is quite true what I have told your con<lb/>stable; I murdered a woman at Mr. Small's house, on a Sunday morning, when Mr. and Mrs. Small had gone to church. I left the place and I have not been back since"—I then communicated with the police in whose district Chingford is, and about 6 o'clock that evening Inspector Todman arrived—he saw the prisoner in my office in my presence—I said to Inspector Todman "This is the man who has charged himself with having committed a murder at Chingford"—I saw that the prisoner was going to say something, and I said "I caution you that whatever you say will be used in evidence against you"—the prisoner then made a statement which Inspector Todman took down in. writing from the prisoner's lips—Todman sat down at my desk and wrote as the prisoner uttered the statement—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the statement that Todman wrote down—after taking it Todman read it over to him—the prisoner said it was quite true, and Todman and I signed it—that was all that passed—the prisoner was then removed—he was handed over to Todman that same evening—in passing from the police station to the railway station the prisoner said "I have been out to</p>

Chelmsford Gaol to him; he did not say "Were you ever in Chelmsford Gaol?"—nothing of the kind—I have no doubt that he spelt his name "Geyden"—I stated so before the Magistrate.</p>

I was in Chelmsford Gaol for 18 months for horse stealing, and com<lb/>mitted the murder directly after coming out.")

I am a retired farmer, living at Chingford Hatch—in the year 1857 I was living at the foot of Friday Hill, Chingford—I left it 12 or 13 years ago, but I still live within a few hundred yards of the place—my wife's sister, Mary White, a single woman, lived with us for 20 year or more prior to her death, in June, 1857—she was 70 years of age—I remember on Sunday, 21st June, 1857, going to church with my wife; we left home about 10.30, leaving Miss White alone at the farm—she then appeared to be in good health and good spirits—she had a mark on her right eye, occasioned by a knock against a door some days before—I was sent for out of church about 12.30, before the service had finished—the church is about a mile from my farm—when I got home I found Mrs. Sapsford there and my niece, who had arrived from London while I was at church—she is now in Australia or New Zealand—I did not see my sister's body, nor did my wife—I first saw this knife at the Coroner's inquest that was held on the body of my sister-in-law shortly afterwards—I had never seen it before—I gave evidence before the Coroner—after I returned home on the Sunday I went upstairs into the deceased's room—most every drawer in the house was pulled open and ransacked—there had been a silver watch and silver guard chain of mine in the deceased's room—I had given it to her on the Saturday night when she went to bed—that has never been found—I also missed two gold rings, a pearl brooch, a jewel box, a whole suit of clothes, and various other articles—I quite forget whether I found upstairs a screwdriver, a hammer, and a bunch of old keys; I don't remember that; I might have done—I knew a man named Jonathan Geydon—his father was a small farmer in our parish—I had lost sight of him for something like two years before the murder—he was living in our parish—immediately after the dis<lb/>covery of the murder the woods were searched and the neighbourhood scoured for Jonathan Geydon; all the country round was searched—before the two years he had been in the habit of coming to my farm at different times, when he was a lad; he used to come backwards and" forwards to the farm, and had done so for some years—the first time I saw him after the murder was on Sunday, September 7, this year, at the Woodford Police-station—I saw 10 or a dozen men there together, about 3 or 4 in the after<lb/>noon—they stood in a row, and I picked out Jonathan Geydon—I see him now in the dock; he is Jonathan Geydon, the same that I had known prior to June, 1857—he is the man for whom I searched; the same Jonathan Geydon I have been speaking of.</p>

I think Geydon spelt his name Geydon—that was how we always used to pronounce it there; that was how I knew it to be spelt at that time, but I could soon find it out by the parish books; his father was rated in our parish books—I never heard him spell his name or see him write it—I don't know that I ever saw any member of his family write his name—I thought it was Geydon, that is how we pronounce it; in country places we don't pronounce exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Deputy Governor of Springfield Gaol, Chelmsford—I have held that office since 1853—I had a man named Jonathan Geydon in custody there, he was brought to us on 24th December 1855—he remained in our custody there until 16th June 1857; he was there on a charge of horse stealing—he was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment with hard labour—I can't say that I saw him from day to day, sometimes I would see him every day, sometimes only two or three times a week—I saw him a great many times during the 18 months—he was employed as a shoemaker under a warder named James who is since dead—I think Geydon knew a good deal of shoemaking before he came there; he was employed at shoemaking—I saw the prisoner at Waltham Abbey in September, when he was there for re-examination—he was so altered that I had hesitation in swearing to him being the same man, although when I saw him walking to the station I recognised him by his walk, more than by his face; his face was very much altered, very much changed—he had a sort of waddling walk—to the best of my recollection he had not any moustache when he' was in the gaol, and I don't think much beard. Q. Have you formed any belief about him now? A. Well, it is hardly fair to say, because I have heard so much now; I have had nothing to shake my opinion that he is Jonathan Geydon—I produce a leaf out of the prison book containing a description of Jonathan Geydon—I tore it out for convenience, but it was in the regular book—I enter the prisoner from the warrant, then the book is taken into the gaol and he is described by another officer; I don't describe a prisoner, I never do—this entry is John Clark's, who is here—this purports to be signed by the prisoner; it is our usual custom for a prisoner who can write to sign his name—I did not see Jonathan Geydon sign it—I remember this knife being brought to the gaol and shown to the warder James; it is an ordinary pocket knife—it was identified in my presence as being shown to James.</p>

Geyden." Q. Do you see that man, Jonathan Geydon, here to-day, the same man that signed the book?—A. No, I am not certain, I cant say; I have seen him for the purpose of identifying him—there was no other Jonathan Geydon in the prison for 18 months for horse stealing to my knowledge—I saw the prisoner this morning, and I see him now—I certainly thought in my own mind that he was the man, but I don't feel confident, and should not like to swear it—I believe he is the man, as far as I can judge he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Her Majesty's Gaol of Newgate, and have been so for nearly 25 years—I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons—during the adjournment of the Court to-day I have examined the prisoner with a view to see whether he is ruptured on the left side—I found no rupture—it is possible that he may have been ruptured 24 years ago and there be no trace of the rapture now; it would depend upon whether the rupture was a bad one or not, and how it was treated; not only as to the size, but whether or no it was treated with care and attention—if treated with care and attention the rupture might be cured—there are two very undefined marks on the left arm, low down—I think they are vaccination marks; they are unusually low down for vaccination marks—I saw no marks of smallpox.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I say it is possible he might have been ruptured 24 years ago, whether it is probable would depend upon the extent of the rupture, whether it was taken in its incipient stage and properly treated—in a man of the class such as Jonathan Geydon has been described I should not think a rupture would be likely to disappear, because in all probability it would not receive the attention and care which would be given to a person in such a position in life—he would no doubt receive every attention in the prison; he would have a truss, and everything would be done to remedy the mischief, it would depend entirely on circumstances; a year would be sufficient to effect a cure; if the rupture was entirely kept of adhesion of the parte might take place, and effect a cure; that is if treated, certainly not, if not treated, because it would increase from day to day—unless he was actually treated for it it would certainly be most improbable that he should be cured in a year—I did not find anything in the prisoner to account for his being lame—his knee joints are perfect—there is nothing to indicate that he has been lame for many years—I do not discover that he is lame—he walks with a degree of stiffness, but not with any lameness certainly, not with any limp or inequality of motion—there is no stiffness in the knee joints at all, I examined them carefully—he came in in a wretched con<lb/>dition of health—I could not form any opinion of his age except from what he tells me—I should think he was between 50 and 60; that is my impression.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think it is difficult to form an accurate opinion as to a man's age from merely seeing him—it depends very much on his previous life—a rupture might cause some degree of lameness, if it was a large one, and down—rheumatism and many things produce lameness, from which a man may perfectly recover.</p>

There is a stiffness in his walk; he does not walk with agility, freedom, or elasticity—with proper care and treatment from an ex<lb/>perienced person even a bad rupture might be altogether cured—the rule is, when they are largely developed they are not cured, except by operative methods—persons very often neglect their truas—I think with proper care, supposing it is constantly continued, a rapture may be cured.</p>

Some of the questions I put to the prisoner were about what had occurred in India—I asked him what year he joined us and where—he said in 1858 at Allahabad—we were at Allahabad in 1858—he did not say what time in 1858—I simply confined myself to the question what year he joined us and where—if he joined us at Allahabad in 1858 I conclude that he would have enlisted in England and come out—I asked him when we left Allahabad—he said in 1859; that was right—I asked him how we came down the country, by road or by rail, or was there anything peculiar about it that he could remember—he said we marched the distance down; that was correct; it was a long march, about 600 miles—I asked him then about his knowledge of the officers and non-commissioned officers in the regiment, and he answered the names of several that I knew to be correct—I asked him the name of his colour-sergeant and he told me Lefevre; that was correct—I asked him the name of the captain and he gave it correctly—I was about 10 minutes conversing with him—the questions I asked were all about the regiment, I had nothing else to test him about—at the time of the Indian Mutiny there was a great pressure for recruits—when a man enlists he signs an attesta<lb/>tion paper, in which he is asked questions about himself, where he was born and so on—he is taken before a Magistrate to be enlisted—those papers are kept as records—the recruits would be drilled here and stmt out when fit to go into active service—if a man were found in India willing to serve, he would only be taken under special authority from the general officer commanding the district—the rule is to recruit where the depdt is; if we found a man in India capable and willing to join, we should not be glad to take him; we would rather have a man drilled in England and sent out fit for service—we have them drilled in India.</p>

I am governor of Her Majesty's gaol of New<lb/>gate—it is the practice to have prisoners measured in my presence, and a full description is taken—the height of the prisoner is 5 feet 6 inches, as measured in my presence—I was present when Sergeant O'Brien wag brought to the gaol, and also when General Millman came—before O'Briea had spoken to the prisoner, in reply to my question as to whether he knew that gentleman he said "Yes, I believe that is Sergeant O'Brien"—Sergeant O'Brien then put several questions to him.</p>

"Protestant"—'Age, 49"—"Marks on his person," "on the right thumb he has an anchor, faint, in Indian ink, and on the left arm a crucifix, and he has rather a large scar on the centre of his breast, about the size of a walnut"—that was all the account he gave of himself—he did not sign it—I have no signature of his in the gaol—he has not written from the gaol—he told me he had no one to write to, no friends at all—he has greatly improved in his appearance since he has been with us—as far as I know he has not written to anybody—the High Sheriff of Essex has been kind enough to send a solicitor to do the best he can for him; that is Mr. Gepp—I have not heard of the name of Charles Wilson till this afternoon.</p>

Giles and Co., though he was only my servant, because I believed there was a goodwill in the name—he had not then told me anything about other means, except what he got from me—he was to send me a daily sheet, and to keep a ledger and cash-book, which he arranged with Mr. Chapman—the day sheets came irregularly—they were posted into the ledger at Jpswich—he had to supply me every day with a ledger summary of the amount and delivery, the names of customers, and the amount of coal in stock—on 19th September in consequence of something happening I went with Mr. Chapman to the prisoner, and told him that Mr. Breeze had told me he had received money, and had not accounted for it—I mentioned a customer's name, and asked him how he could do such a thing when I had been kind to him, and put him on his legs again, and that he ought to be ashamed to do so—he looked very cast down, and I said "I should like to know the full amount of your defalcations, and be careful for once in your life, and let me know the worst, because it is assuming a very serious aspect"—I took a sheet of paper, and said "You write it down," and as Mr. Chapman turned it over I said "You insert that"—I went out for a walk, and as I came back I met Mr. Chapman—I afterwards saw Giles again, and said "This is a shameful thing of you; I have now no alterna<lb/>tive but to inform the Guarantee Society, and I suspend you from any further duty on my behalf; take away anything which is your property"—he opened his desk, and took out a memorandum book and a child's book, and went home—he said that he had paid some money for commissions which he had not entered, and I said "You are not allowed to employ com<lb/>mission agents"—I afterwards saw this list signed by him—he has never accounted to me for the 298<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. specified here—this letter is in his writing—I received it, I think, on the Sunday morning following the 19th at my private residence.

I live at 2, Ever Place, East Greenwich—at 11 p.m. on 3rd October my house was secured, and the parlour window fastened—I was knocked up about 2.30 a.m., and on going into the parlour I saw the house had been entered by the window, and the fastening broken—some flower-pots which were inside the window had been removed and thrown into my front garden—I found this empty matchbox and some lucifer matches which had been struck lying about the parlour carpet—I know the matches as "Tanstickers," and they strike only on the box.</p>

At 3 a.m. on the 4th the prisoner was brought to the station, and I went to examine the prosecutor's premises—I found the parlour window had been opened from the bottom by some instrument; the woodwork was broken, and the catch broken off—there were some lucifer matches lying about the floor—there were no flowers in the window; there were some in the garden, which appeared to have been taken there and set down—they were not broken.</p>

I was a little sobered, and the man said, "Come indoors and have a rest; it will do you good." He was getting through the window, and said. "Get in." I said, "This is not the way to get in," and he said, "I have not the key, and don't want to wake the people." I saw the constable coming, and when about 20 yards from me I deliberately walked up to him. He said, "What's the matter?" I said, "There's a man leading me astrav." He said, "Where?" I said, "There he goes through the window," and the policeman struck me, I would not stay to be abused, and ran away and was stopped. I never touched the constable with fist or instrument, and there is no one to say so but himself. I have never seen the instrument that has been found. It was a public path and 250 yards distant. I was going into the place, but had not the slightest idea of committing a burglary. I walked about from district to district to get employment, but there is nothing to do now. I am a tinsmith and coppersmith. I am innocent."</p>

I am wife of Patrick Donohue, 2, High Bridge Road—on 3rd October I opened my window and heard a row at the Three Crowns—I saw the landlord eject three men—the constable came up and said, "Go home, there's good fellows, and go to your work in the morn<lb/>ing"—they would not go away, and swore at the constable—after that the constable went along the main street—the men did not go away—I then heard the click of a knife, and saw Noris with a knife in his hand—he used a bad expression and said he would rip him with the knife, and they followed the constable down the street—I did not aee any more.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage Mr. Hall's business, 120, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—he carries on business there and in Birmingham, as the Victoria Tea Company—it is the custom at his establishments on the sale of 1/4lb., 1/2lb., or 1/2lb. of tea to deliver a coupon or ticket to the buyer; this is a Alb. ticket, "1/2. The Victoria Tea Company, 120, Lower Marsh, Lambeth"—a number of those tickets entitles the bearer to any articles in the window, such as glass shades, and other things—on Saturday, 4th October, the prisoner came to the counter, and asked me for 1/2lb. of tea, I served him, and gave him a 1/2lb. coupon—he turned to the side counter, and said "How much does that shade go for?"—it covered a stuffed bird—I said "25lb.'—he said "I will have that," and produced these 50 half-pound tioketi—I immediately saw that they were forged, and handed them to my porter, Fish, and said "Just count these carefully, and wrap this up to this gentle<lb/>man"—while he did so I spoke to a woman outside, sent for a constable, and gave the prisoner in custody—the "120" on the forged tickets is straight (<hi rend="italic">Roman letters</hi>), and on the genuine ones it is slanting (<hi rend="italic">Italics</hi>), and" the word "The" is smaller in the forged than in the genuine ticket, and the 2 in 1/2 is larger in the forged one—there is also a difference in the card<lb/>board on tearing it; the genuiue is brown, and the forged is white—I went with the constable to the prisoner's address, 22 st. Arden Street, Battersea, and saw a woman there, who pointed out a parlour in which on a table were found a quantity of the prisoners cards as a printer at that address—I noticed that the ornaments on the mantelshelf had been recently removed, by dust marks where they had been, and also on the sideboard—I also</p>

Lang. gold, colour, and general printer, 23, Arden Street, "Haynes Street Battersea "; that was the address I went to—I saw a woman there, who was I think the same I saw outside the station—I searched the premises and found in the prisoner's bedroom in a drawer this doll and a purse—I found this concertina in the lower part of the house, also a large quantity of type, a set of jugs, and a brush.</p>

I am printer to Mr. Hall, of Birmingham, who carries on business under the title of the Victoria Tea Company—I print the tickets for all his establishments—the Lower Marsh business was opened last May twelvemonth, and since then I have printed all the tickets—the half-pound tickets at No. 120 are always green, and the quality of the card has always been the same—the centre of the card is brown—I had noticed that before this inquiry—it is letter-press, and is a proof printed from this block (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—these other tickets are all forged; the line between the 1 and the 2 in "1/2" is different, the short line is in the forged ticket, and the 120 is upright in the genuine ticket and slanting in the forgod one—our tickets are old-fashioned, and the forged tickets have what</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, King's Arms Cottages, Wandsworth, and am a labourer, working at Mr. Murray's paper mills—on 25th August the prisoner applied for work there—the deceased Schofield was employed there as a gatekeeper at what is called the traffic gate at which the carts pass out—I was working close to the gate—I saw the gate open for some carts to go out; the prisoner, with his hands in his pockets, was walking out, when Schofield shoved him, and kicked his behind—the prisoner had asked him before the gate was opened if he would open the gate to let him out, and he refused—they had two or three words together about it—Schofield said "I shall not open the gate, you will have to go out the same way as you came in"—after Schofield had kicked him the prisoner turned round and struck him in the mouth—I could not say whether it was with his open hand or his fiat; he was stepping off the premises at the time, one foot in, and one foot out, walking out quietly—Schofield kicked up against something, and fell back on some stones close inside the wall—he fell on his face on the left side—I saw him picked up; he was bleeding a little from the mouth.</p>

                  </hi> I am a ship-keeper, at 33, Station Place, Shadwell—on Saturday night two weeks, about 10 o'clock, I was on board the ship Landseer—I went into the forecastle and saw the prisoner there and three boys—I ordered the boys ashore, and the prisouer up with his fist and struck me a blow and knocked me senseless; I could not say what he struck me with, I could not say if it was with his fist—he hit me in the eye; he was standing on the forecastle deck where we were sleeping; after he struck me he began to bite me in the head and in the arm—when I came to I called out "Murder"—he said he would kill me—I said, "You will be hanged for it if you kill me"—he did not say anything to that—he</p>

               <p>struck me a blow on the arm and I fell underneath the lower bunk—he then ran to his bed where he generally kept his knife—I was helped out: I do not know how I got ashore, I was rather senseless—I think one of the biggest boys brought me on shore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first knew the prisoner when I joined the ship, a week and four days before this occurred—it is my regular business to look after ships—I was on good terms with the prisoner, I used to try all I could to please him, he did not do all he could to please me—he said he would tell the captain and get me out of the ship—he spitefully wished to get me out of the ship, because he said I could not work hard enough for him—he wanted me up at 5 in the morning to wash the deck and I would not, I said 7 was the time—that was on the Friday morning before this occurred; he made me a present live or six days before this, it was an Agnus Dei—he put it over my head because he said I was a Catholic—the commencement of this row was my sending the boys ashore—I had been drinking with him and the boys—I did not say anything to him before he struck me—he knocked the senses out of me, and as soon as I came to I jumped up and said, "You scoundrel, what did you do that for?" and caught hold of his long hair and held him as tight as I could—I was obliged to defend myself—I did not kick him, I was not able, he kicked me in the privates—we fell down several times, and I thought he would kill me—I sung out, "He is eating me"—he bit me in five different places while I held his hair—he said, "I will kill any white man who pulls my hair"—I do not know that it is an insult to a Hindoo to pull his hair—I was afraid to let go for fear he would kill me—I had not provoked him—as soon as I let go his hair he went towards his bed—he put the light out between 9 and 10 after the scuffle, and it was very dark—I have been ruptured before by working hard and lifting, and it came on worse after this—I cannot say if I fell on any<lb/>thing—I saw a lot of wood and sails on deck—he put my arm out and I fell down in the bunk—I do not think I had hold of his hair then, because he had his finger in my mouth—I have told the interpreter and the police officer I would withdraw from the prosecution if paid a certain sum of. money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police at Rotherhithe—I was called to the police-station on 3rd October, soon after midnight, and found Smith bleeding profusely from a wound in the head, and with his left shoulder dislocated—there were five lacerated wounds, apparently bites, on his chest and arms, and a large rupture on the left side, which appeared recent—I caw no wound which could have been inflicted by a knife, but the wound on the head might have been inflicted by such a stick as was shown to me—he was in a very serious and exhausted condition, and there was reason to fear inflammation of the bowels from the rupture—I have not attended him since—I have seen him to-day and for several days past, and he appears to have recovered—I reduced the dislocation at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I found two ruptures, one apparently an old one and the other recent—a kick would have caused it—a fall would not have caused such a rupture—it was not an extension of the old rupture, but a totally new one, and on the other side of the body—it might possibly have been caused by falling on a projecting piece of timber, but in my judgment it was such a wound as would be caused by a kick—there were two bites on the front of the chest, two or more bites on the arms, and some injury to the thumb, and the shoulder was dislocated—that might have happened from a fall or a direct blow—I saw the prisoner afterwards, and he was in a state—of almost maniacal delirium, and in such an intense state of excitement that I considered he was suffering from the effects of a drug called "bang," which men of his nationality often take.</p>

I am a planterer, of 122, Cornwall Road, Lambeth—on Friday evening, 19th September, I was standing at my door, and saw Leonard nearly opposite the White Horse dragging Hobbs, who was trying to get away from him—he dragged him across the road, and attempted to get him into the public-house, when Collier came out, and there was a severe struggle between the three—Hobbs got away and seemed to stagger back two or three yards, and then Leonard pinned him by his arms and Collier assisted in holding him—they took him a few yards up King Street, and his hat fell off—they were still struggling, and 1 saw Leonard put his hand into Hobbs's right trousers pocket and take out something very bulky, and then they both ran down St. Andrew's Court—this was about 6.30 p.m., and it was a very clear, bright evening—I informed a constable, and afterwards picked the prisoners out from a group of a dozen at Kennington Lane Police-station—I recognised Collier the moment I saw him, but I had a tho ough good look at Leonard because he was holding his head sideway, but I went in front of him, examined him thoroughly, and identified him—that was on the following Wednesday about 10 p.m.</p>

I am a draper's porter at 191, High Street, Dept<lb/>ford, two doors from Mr. Bennett's shop—I was standing at the door on 80th August about 8 o'clock, and saw Lott coming from the direction of Mr. Bennett's shop carrying a carpet on his shoulder—ne went round High Street towards Windmill Lane—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the same carpet; the pattern was outside.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi>). On 2nd inst. I went to Bateman's house—Lott was there, and this carpet was on the floor—I looked at it, and Lott said, "You need not look at that; I can warrant they have had this four years"—in consequence of that I did not remove it, but from what I heard afterwards I returned on the following day, and the carpet had gone—I then found Lott at 8, Southwark Part Road, and the carpet rolled up in a back kitchen—Lott was in the same room—I said, "What rooms do you occupy?"—he said, "This is the only one"—I said, "How do you account for this carpet being here?"—he made no answer—I said, "I shall take you in custody for being concerned with Bateman in stealing this"—he said, "I did not steal it; I only helped to carry it"—I then took him to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The day the detective came to take the carpet, I went down to Windmill Lane to see Bateman, as I did not go to work because I was queer; and when I got there I saw the detective, and he said he was coming down for the carpet. I told him where it was, and that the room was let to Mrs. Bateman before he went into it. He asked me to carry the carpet to the station, and I did so, and was placed in a cell, and did not know what I was charged with.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the Wandsworth Infirmary—Stone was brought in on 30th August—I found a clean cut deep wound in the face in front of the ear, implicating the nerves of the face and the temporal artery; also several superficial wounds on the neck and face and a wound on the left hand, a severe wound about 2 1/2 inches long—I found several recent bruises on the arms and body and thighs and face—the wounds were such as might have been caused by the table knife produced.</p>

She got into the window first and I stopped three-quarters of an hour, and at last I broke the window and went upstairs, and she got the knife from me, and in the scuffle the accident occurred.</p>
