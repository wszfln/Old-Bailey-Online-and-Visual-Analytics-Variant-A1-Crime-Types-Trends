In July, 1843, I was one of the servants of the Great Western Railway Company—I was stationed at Paddington, in the goods' department—the prisoner was also stationed in the same department—I have been in custody charged with participating in the stealing of this property—I left the service of the railway about Aug., I believe, 1843—I left on my own account—I stated that I was going to see my friends—I had leave of absence for a week for that purpose—I did not go back to the railway—I did not inform them that I had quitted their service—I returned, and re<lb/>sided in the immediate neighbourhood of the railway, and sold butter—the railway people knew I was on the spot—about a fortnight before I quitted the employment, I met the prisoner at the Red Lion, Red Lion-street, Whitechapel—we had agreed to meet there—the witness Williams was also there—he did not come in by accident—w e had agreed to meet</p>

               <p>there—I have known him for years—I had met him in Fleet-street that morning—the prisoner said he had a little box or case to dispose of, which he had from his sister—he asked me if I knew who would buy it—I understood him to say his sister lived near Temple-bar—he produced this box—it was unlocked—it looks as if it was forced—it looked so then—he had it in a green-baize bag—Williams was to buy it of him for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these glasses and fittings were in it, and there was a gold chain, which the prisoner produced from his pocket—in a day or two, or two or three days after, Williams brought the case to my house, No. 1, Conduit-street, Paddington—he brought it to deliver it up to the prisoner because he said it was not worth the money—I saw the prisoner in a few days or a week after, or something like that—I told him Williams had brought it back, and he would not have it, and he could have it when he liked—he said he would call for it some day, and take it with him—I saw him once or twice after that, but nothing more was said about the dressing-case—I kept it—the chain was sold—I sold it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and kept the money—I intended to return it when I was asked for it—I sold it to a person named Sayford—I suppose he took it to a refiner's—I do not know where he took it—I sold it to him some time in July, 1843—I believe it was the latter part—it was about a fortnight after I had it from Williams—I never disposed of the case—I got the chain from Williams's pocket—he gave it me when he gave me the case—I kept the dressing-case in my possession till I was over at Kensal-green, which was very soon after Christmas, 1844—there was a distress put in for rent, and Mrs. Fowler lent 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on a table, two chairs, and this case—she lent it to Mrs. Oborne, by my direction, and I paid the rent with the money—I did not go and live in the country after leaving the service of the railway—I went into a butter-shop in North-street, very soon after—I got my butter up by the Great Western Railway, and had to meet it there, and always do—I did not ask the prisoner's permission to raise money upon the case—he was at Bath at the time—I did not write to him—I pawned without any autho<lb/>rity—they would have taken it if I had not—the prisoner never called for the case or chain—I was taken into custody on the 18th or 19th of last month—the box was proved to have been in my possession for the last year—I did not say anything at that time about who gave it to me—I said I got it from the prisoner, when Collard apprehended me—I was three times before the Magistrate, and then let out—I made this statement against the prisoner when I was first taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>trains, one at six, and the other at ten—I do not know whether I was em<lb/>ployed to unpack the ten o'clock train on the 1st of July, 1843—if I went on at half-past four, I was; but sometimes I got a man to stay a quarter for me; then I should go on at half-past eight, and it would not be my duty to be there—I do not know whether I was there—I know I was on the goods' side—I do not know whether I was at the ten o'clock train or not—I knew Williams at that time—I have known him for years—he is a shop-ticket writer, and makes dumb-bells—I have heard before to-day when the robbery was committed—I cannot tell whether I was at work on that very train—I know I was employed at the station at that time—I did not steal the case—when I received it from the prisoner I had no notion that it was stolen, or that there was anything wrong about it—I do not know whether the gold chain was a lady's or a gentleman's—I thought it belonged to him, at least, I thought it was his sister's—I did not think I was robbing the sister when I sold it, because I could return three times its value next day—I had my goods coming up by the railway, which would enable me to pay—I got my goods.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you not to take it back to the sister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know where she lived—I knew it was near Temple-bar—I did not take the chain to the melting-pot—I did not expect to get it back again—if I had pawned it I could have got it out again, but I knew I should have three times the amount next day—I do not know why I did not pawn it—I made no inquiry of the prisoner's sister to ask her permission—I never knew or saw her—the prisoner knew I had the chain and box, because I told him of it a very few days after—I do not know the person that keeps the Red Lion—we had something to drink there—I had agreed to meet the prisoner, and when he and I were coming along Fleet-street, on the same day, we met Williams—I had made an appointment with the prisoner, when leaving work at the rail<lb/>way, that same day—I made the arrangement with Williams in Fleet-street, and we all three met at the Red Lion—the prisoner did not mention any time when I was to bring him the money—I do not know whether it was the following day that Williams brought it back—it was in the prisoner's absence—he did not know where he was—I kept it about a fortnight before I sold the chain—I did not hear of any dressing-case having been missed, nor that inquiries were making about it—I was not on the other side—I did not know it had been advertised, nor that bills were posted about describing it—I took it to Mrs. Oborne's—I never said it belonged to any one, nor how I came by it—they made no inquiries about it—I had some furniture there at the time, belonging to myself—I had no dressing-case or anything else there but what belonged to me—I had some furniture belonging to Mr. Pound, who kept the Blue Posts, Holborn—I had none belonging to a lady no lady had entrusted me with a considerable quantity of furniture about that period—I never told Mrs. Oborne whose dressing-case this was—I did not remove it from Fowler's—it was left there—I did not send the prisoner word of that—I had not got it in my power to redeem it.</p>

Deane's, London-bridge, and perhaps I may call on my brother, and I will look round"—I did not expect to see the box—I had never seen the prisoner before—I thought I might make something of the case among my private connexions—most likely I should have offered it to my landlord or landlady, at No. 75, Berwick-street—it was</p>

Spurting, requesting the prisoner to forward him 2 1/2 yards of black broad cloth</hi>)—I asked the prisoner if he had sup-plied the broad cloth mentioned in the letter—he said he had—I asked if he had entered it to himself, or whether it was paid for at the time—he replied that it was entered to himself—I have examined the books, there is no such entry—I never gave him authority to sell the cloth—it was not greatly out of his province, but it was out of his department—the cloth was under the care of another person.</p>

About half-past seven Abbott made a communication to me respecting the prisoner, while the sorting was going on, in consequence of which I directed my atten<lb/>tion to the prisoner—I watched him to his place for a moment, and from that to the adjoining room leading to the water-closet, to which I immediately followed him—when I got to the door I found it fastened from the inside—the top of the water-closet is open—I ascended some steps that we have there to turn the gas cut—the steps were not fixtures—it took me less than half a minute to get up—when I looked down I saw the prisoner sitting on the seat of the water-closet—I did not see what state his clothes were in—there was not sufficient light for me to see—I distinctly saw him with a letter in his hand—I could not tell whether it was open or shut—the letter was on his lap and his two hands were on the letter—t was a folded letter—I could not see whether it was sealed or not—it was in the form of a folded letter—I either said "Gord, what are you doing?" or "what are you about with that letter?"—I spoke to him from above—he said, "Nothing, sir"—I desired him to open the door—he did so immediately—I did not then notice the state of his clothes—I should have noticed if they had been unbuttoned—he had a letter in his hand—he appeared to be in the act of coming out—I held out my hand and he put the letter into it—this is the letter—it was in a crumpled state—it was sealed—near the seal I noticed the fracture of the paper, which is here now—it might have been merely accidental—I sent for an officer and gave him in charge, and in the presence of the officer I asked where he got the letter from; he said he did not know—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said, Nothing"—the envelope of the letter has the stamp of the Post-office on it, eight o'clock at night, on the 17th—I cannot see where it was posted—there is no receiving-house stamp upon it—the "eight o'clock" denotes the time such a letter wuuld be sent out for delivery that evening—such a letter would</p>

               <p>be in our office about half—past seven—it is not addressed to any place within his walk—he would have nothing to do with such a letter—in the course of sorting he might probably have it, but not for the purpose of delivery—all those who are sorting may take up any letter—they are tied in large bundles and sent to our office indiscriminately—they must take hold of them in order to sort them into several walks, and as they sort them they put them into the different sorting—boxes, which are large pigeon—holes—there are two divisions—the prisoner would have no right to take any letters out of the Strand walk—if this letter came into his possession in the sorting, it would have been his duty to put it immediately into the Strand box—after he had been taken into custody, in consequence of some message given to me I went to the prisoner—I found him in custody of the officer, in a small adjoining office—I said, "I believe you called me?"—he said, "Yes, I had no bad intention with that letter, it was a mis—sordletter; I am a sorter, and it came to our walk"—I then told him though he might say what be pleased, it might be used against him—as he made no reply to that, I said, "I understand you to say that, you had no bad intention, &amp;c." repeating his own words—he said, "Yes," and I then left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of the branch-office at Charing-cross. The prisoner was a letter-carrier there—he was on duty there on the afternoon of the 3rd of Nov.—I remember the arrival of the quarter to four and four o'clock dispatches—he was on duty at the time those letters were sorted—he then went out with the four o'clock delivery—he returned at six, and assisted in sorting the letters that were delivered at eight.</p>

I was on duty on Tuesday evening, the 4th of Nov.—the prisoner was stand<lb/>ing next to me sorting letters, about half-past six—he held a bundle of letters in his hand—I saw him put his right thumb over one letter, feeling it to see if it contained money as I thought—in consequence of that I watched him—he placed that letter under the letters he held in his left hand—a letter-carrier sitting on my left asked me some question, which induced me to turn round-when I turned to the sorting-table again the prisoner had left—I saw him going up the office and into the second office, in which the water-closet is—I saw him go to the water-closet—he tried the door, it appeared to be fast—he then came into the sorting-office again, to his own desk—the name of his dis<lb/>trict was then called out by Mr. Smither, and the prisoner, as was his duty, went up—whilst he was gone I looked at the letters which lay on his desk—they were quite right—hey were letters addressed to his own walk—he did not take them with him—it was only the first part of the duty—they were separated, ready for being taken away—I then missed the prisoner from the office—I went to the bottom of the office, and found he had left the office—it is not a very long office—I went outside the office into the street—I went ten or twelve yards from the office, towards the Golden-cross hotel—I saw him coming from that direction towards the office—he held some white paper in his hand—he was tearing it into pieces, and threw the pieces into the road with his left hand—I said nothing to him—he passed me and went to the office—I proceeded to pick up some of the fragments ho had thrown away—I produced them to the officer—these which have been produced are the pieces—my examination of the pieces did not enable me to find out whose letter it was, or where it bad been addressed—I took the pieces home, and put them to-gether, but could not understand them—I mentioned to my wife what I had noticed, and next day, or the day after, I am not positive which, I named it to Dolan, who is in the same office—I did not show him the pieces—I told him what I had seen—the prisoner was taken into custody on the 17th—I preserved the fragments till then—they were produced before the Magistrate—I had been on duty the day before, Monday the 3rd, at the same place—the prisoner was there also—he and I assisted in sorting the letters that were brought from the chief office, by the dispatch, at four and a quarter to four—I did not on that occasion notice anything that attracted my attention.</p>

Peter Pattison is the owner of the house, and some of his servants reside there—it is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill—Gamble has been in my brother's employ nearly four years, and in my father's four more—our business is very extensive—the two watches found on Bodill are the property of cus<lb/>tomers of ours, in our care (looking at eight watches, Nos. 8128, 2163, 6803, 5837, 7574, 2751, 54295, and 4229)—these, Nos. 2163 and 4229 are job watches, brought by customers to be repaired, the others are my brother's—one of the job watches was brought by Mr. Gilmore, and the other by Barry—we have missed watches of this kind from the stock since these discoveries have taken place—No. 2183 is worth about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two of the watches are worth rather less than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the value of the whole is rather more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Gamble was dismissed from my brother's service on Thursday, 16th Oct.—after he was in custody, in consequence of a message sent to me I went to see him in Tothill<lb/>fields prison—I said nothing to induce him to say anything to me—I cautioned him, after the officer who was present cautioned him—I said, "Whatever you say, Gamble, will be used against you, therefore use your discretion"—he said he felt deeply sorry for having done what he had, and proceeded to make a statement to me, which I reduced to writing within three hours—I did not say it would be better or worse for him if he made a statement (<hi rend="italic">looking at his memorandum</hi>)—he said he had on various occasions given Henderson watches stolen from Mr. French, to pawn, and also to Bodill—that this had been going on for many months—that Henderson never gave either money or duplicates to him, nor did Bodill—that Bodill and Hender<lb/>son were both repeatedly pressed by him to give back the duplicates, as he intended to confess all to Mr. French, that Bodill having once got him into his power threatened him to discover him to Mr. French, in order to obtain more property from him—that in no instance had Gamble intercepted watches to be sent to customers, Mr. P----'s case excepted—he had never pawned or stolen new work himself, that is gold or silver cases—that it always was his intention to confess his guilt to Mr. French, and implore his mercy—that he did so now because he felt Mr. French's kindness had been returned by great ingratitude, and he saw no way of making reparation but to give every informa<lb/>tion by which Mr. French might recover his property—that he had no defence of his conduct to make, and imputed his disgrace principally to Bodill's per<lb/>suasion—that Bodill recommended him to establish a French hazard bank, in Panton-street, by way of getting money—that he consented to do so—that apartments were accordingly taken by Bodill and Eustace, that gambling was carried on, in which Gamble was generally a loser.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police sergeant of the D division. On Wednesday morning, the 29th of Oct., I saw the prisoners in a coffee shop</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184511240048"/>
               <p>in Great James-Street, Lisson-grove, about three in the morning—I had a charge of assault against two of them—I found them all three in company with five females—I called Mitchell out of the room, and said to him, How came you to knock that man about in Steven-street?"—He said "I have not been in Steven-street to night"—I said, "Oh yes you have; you must go with me to the station, both you and Burke"—he said, "Well, I will go with you; let me drink my coffee first"—I said, "Yes"—he took his coffee up in his left hand, and with his right he took out a handful of half pence from his pocket, and handed them over to Grogan—I saw them in his hand—I said, "What are you doing? I shall not allow you to pass any<lb/>thing in that way"—Mitchell said, "He (meaning Grogan) must pay for the coffee"—I did not see the coins sufficient to identify any of them—I took Mitchell, and another officer took Burke—I saw Grogan take eight penny pieces from the rest of the copper Mitchell had given him, and hand them to the coffee-shop keeper for the coffee—we took the prisoners to the station-house—I searched Mitchell, and found on him a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, two pence, eight half pence, and a farthing; some lucifer matches, two keys, a knife, tobacco box, and book—the prisoners were placed in the dock at the station-house—I left them there about a quarter of an hour—when I came back I found them in the same place—Mitchell's arm was leaning on the bar close to a cupboard—I heard of Mr. Clark's robbery next morning—I went there about half-past seven and found in the back parlour several things upset, and the window of the room open—there was a trace of footsteps over a wall on some leads to the back of No. 3, Salisbury-street, Devonshire-place, which is about eighty yards from Steven-street—Devonshire-place turns round on the right in Salisbury-street—between Nos. 2 and No. 3—it is like a paved court—I traced the footmarks over the wall—we could trace somebody having got out of Devonshire-place to the back of 3, Salisbury-street—Stafford-street it twenty or thirty yards further from Salisbury-street than Steven-street—I went to the coffee-house again, and saw the landlord, to whom I had seen the money paid—he gave me this coin—I went to Grogan's house, and apprehended him—I told him the charge—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, and found on him sixteen halfpence, one penny piece, two far<lb/>things, and a French coin, and in his jacket pocket a small portion of cheese, which I produce, and some lucifer matches.</p>

I accompanied Hannant to the coffee-shop—I took Burke to the station-house, and placed him in the dock there—we left to fetch a witness, and when we came back Burke was out on the coal-box—I found on Burke twelve half pence, one penny piece, and two lucifer matches, a key, two farthings, and a pencil—this was before I went for the witness—at half-past ten o'clock that night I had seen Mitchell and Grogan in Steven-street, with four other men and women, and at half-past eleven o'clock I saw Mitchell and Burke together in Stafford-street—I saw them all three together in Steven-street a little after two o'clock—they were eighty or ninety yards from Clark's house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surveyor to the parish of St. Pancras. I made this plan—it accurately represents a portion of the workhouse—the part called the school—house is a separate building—it joins, but has no communication with any other part—there is a room on the ground floor used as a dining hall—above that is a school—room and sleeping—room—there are separate apartments, for the use of the master, at the east end—there is an area, separated from the burial ground by a boundary wall, adjoining the school—westward is the shoemakers'and tailors' shop, and a yard before that—westward from the tailors' shop if a distinct building, called the oakum room, which consists of a ground floor and a floor above it—there is a yard behind that, and a wall continued from the area—the communication from the lower to the upper oakum rooms is by a step—ladder—there was formerly a communication outside, from the yard to the upper room, by a stone staircase—that has been remove and bricked up on the outside by a nine—inch wall—the yard is covered with iron bars behind the oakum room—persons getting out by that door could walk over the bars, which are nearly on a level with the upper floor of the oakum room—a per—son getting out by this door—way would be a very few inches above the bars—persons could pass along the wall—there is a stone landing, reaching from the area to the boundary wall—the boundary wall is about fifteen feet high from the bottom of the area, about six or seven feet above that landing—there is a flight of steps from the landing into the area—persons could pass from the oakum room door, which had been blocked up, over the iron railing down into the area very easily, by dropping on the stone landing—I saw the oakum room about a fortnight ago, and saw a hole which had been made through the door—way which had been bricked up, large enough for a person to pass through—the door itself had been fastened up, and bricked up outside besides—the hole was made through the part which had been bricked up, but I have not seen the in—terior—I saw the windows of the dining—room and the back area—it had been then refixed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Parson's-green, Fulham. On Monday afternoon, the 21st of July, I was under the sewer at work, getting timber out—I went from there to the Colville Arms public-house to have a pot of beer—it was about twenty minutes to six o'clock—I had only had one pint of beer that day—I was perfectly sober—I found the prisoner at the house—he was a little the worse for liquor—when I went in he asked if I would set-to with him for a pot of beer, meaning fight him—I said no, I would not—he came up to me, turned back from me, took a quart pot off the table which contained the beer, threw the beer under the table, and gave me a se<lb/>vere</p>

               <p>blow on the head with the pot—I had not struck him—the blow cut my head nearly two inches, and locked me under the table; and while I was under the table he gave me a kick in the eye, which cut the flesh and skin of my eye—it bled very little—I bled from the cut in the head—there were four or five of us in the house—we went in one at a time—after I was knocked down, Foreman came to my assistance—he came to take me up, but did not, as he was knocked down by the prisoner—there were from ten to twelve of them there—I was taken to the hospital in Mr. Pye's cart—I had my head dressed, and did not stop in the hospital—I was stunned with the blow—I was a fortnight without doing anything afterwards—I am certain I did not begin the attack.</p>

               <p>cart at that time—I saw in the cart a truss of hay, a bundle of straw, and a sack containing something, I do not know what—a person they call <hi rend="italic">Ratty</hi> came out of the public-house—I knew him to be the associate of thieves—he took hold of the horse by the head—I then went into the public-house, and saw a great number of persons there, from fourteen to twenty, but I did not see the two that had been in the cart—I knew a great number of them by sight, in fact I knew them all, though not by name, but they are all always in company with thieves, a regular gang of them—I then came out of the house and said, "Bray, we must take this horse and cart to the station"—I then took hold of the horse, and Bray also—Bray was standing at the horse's head at the time I came out—he had a view of the contents of the cart—when we took hold of the horse's head from fourteen to twenty persons rushed out of the public-house, and surrounded us—they called out "Don't let the b----s take it"—Myers, and the other man whose name I do not know, but whom I had seen at first, got into the cart—I saw him come out of the house—Myers drove it away—Carney made an attempt to get up, he got on the step but came down again—several of them said, "Whip their b----hands off; cut their be hands off"—I saw all the three prisoners—Barnett said tome," Mr. Burgess, let the horse and cart go, it belongs to him," pointing to Myers, who was in the cart—I knew Barnett before—I said, "I shan't let the horse and cart go, it roust go to the station"—several of them cried out, Don't let it go, don't let them take it"—Carney said, "Won't you let it go T—at the time I saw Lewis close by Carney, at the side of the cart—I was standing close by the horse's head—I had hold of it—Lewis struck me twice or three times in the breast with his fist, not very severely, it did not hurt me much—I con<lb/>tinued hold of the horse, and shortly after Carney gave me a blow across the face with a pen-knife—it cut part of my nose off and left it hanging down—I could see the blade of the knife—he gave me a second blow on the left temple, and cut me severely—it bled very much—he also gave me a slight cut in the neck, but not much—I think that was from another blow—I cannot say whether received three blows—I found this slight cut in the neck when I got to the hospital—I was taken away by two men to a doctor's shop and got the wounds dressed—I should say Lewis was standing by me for about ten minutes or better—he was close by Carney at the time I was taken away—I should say he was there at the time the cuts were given, I saw him—he had on a brown coat—the second cut was immediately after the first—as soon as he struck the first, he came back and gave me the second—it was done all in a second—I have known Barnett about three or four years—I have seen him frequently during that period—I think to the best of my knowledge he had on a brown Taglioni coat on this occasion—I have been well acquainted with him, and seen him very often—I have known Carney about twelve months—I have seen him frequently, and have frequently seen him in the King's Arms—I have known Lewis I should say better than twelve months—I have seen him frequently up and down Whitechapel—I have not the least doubt of the per<lb/>sons at any of the prisoners—I was ten days in the hospital, and am an out-patient at present.</p>

               <p>I was stabbed—it was when I turned round again—I am sure you are the person that stabbed me—I became insensible after two stabs, and two men took me to the doctor's—they are not here—I suppose there were from 400 to 500 persons round at the time—the street was filled with people—I called for assistance, but no one came to assist me—there were too many of your party there, and the people were frightened to come—I do not suppose any respect<lb/>able shopkeeper would venture to come forward, there was such a desperate lot—I drew my staff—I had no opportunity of using it, you took good care of that—I bad it out nearly all the time—I struck no one with it, I could not get an opportunity, you prevented me—I was some time at the horse's else that I know of—I suppose I was from twenty minutes to half an hour at the horse's head—I did not remain a moment after. I was stabbed—it was not you alone that assaulted us, it was all your gang; you had got, I sup<lb/>pose, about twenty to assist you, while we only had our two selves—I saw you in conversation with the others inside the house, not outside.</p>

I was called by Burgess, in front of the King's Arms, White-chapel-road, about half-past eight o'clock on the night in question—I saw a horse and cart at the door—there was no one in it when I came up—Carney was standing by it—Burgess went into the house—he might be gone a minute and a half, or two minutes, before he came back—I saw on the top of the cart some hay, a bundle of straw, and a sack full of something, but the bed of the cart was full underneath the straw—I knew Carney before—when Burgess came out he said, "Bray, we must take this horse and cart round to Spital fields station"—Burgess and I took hold of the horse for the purpose of doing so—we were in the act of turning the horse's head round, when Carney seized horse of it—we had not succeeded in turning it round—about fifteen or twenty persons came out of the King's Arms at the time—that was while Carney had hold of the horse—we all three had hold of it—among those who came out I noticed Lewis, and several more not yet in custody—I did not see Barnett at that time—there were cries of" Cut their b----hands off don't let them take it"—that was repeated more than once or twice—I cannot say whether any expressions of that kind were used by either of the prisoners—whilst I, Carney, and Burgess were at the horse's head, I saw Lewis come off the pavement—he was the second that took hold of Burgess and me, and likewise of the horse's head—he struck me two or three tires—I had then hold of the horse's head at the off side—I saw him strike Burgess in the breast more than two or three times—Burgess at that time had hold of the horse's head at the near side—I heard some one say to Burgess, "Let go the horse; it belongs to the person in the cart;" but who said that I cannot say—I did not notice Burgess cut by anybody—after Lewis struck me I still kept hold of the horse's head—I was on the opposite side to Burgess, but</p>

               <p>at times we were both in front by being pushed about so—Carney was on the near side, the same side as Burgess—I did not notice Burgess after he was cut—while I was standing at the horse's head I was struck a severe blow from behind, between the shoulders, like from a stick or some heavy instrument, and directly after that I missed Burgess from the horse's head—about a minute or two before I missed Burgess I saw Carney take a knife from his right hand side, and open it with his left hand—about a minute or two after receiving the blow between the shoulders, Barnett came from behind the cart, and struck me in the left ear—I was not aware when at the police-court that my hat was cut as it is—had it not been for my hat I should have received a more severe blow—my hat is cut right round—it was done with a stick or a life-preserver, I cannot say which; but I saw Barnett come from the tail-part of the cart with something in his hand a foot or eighteen inches long, and be struck me with that—I have known him about three years—I am positive he is the man that struck me that blow—I have not the least doubt of it—it disabled me from holding the hone—I was knocked right away from the horse—it cut me very dan<lb/>gerously—I was carried to the doctor's, from the doctor's to the station, and from there to die hospital, where I remained nine days—my ear was cut from the blow—it was sewn up when I got to the hospital—two of the per<lb/>sons that came up, got into the cart, and succeeded in driving it off—I was in my uniform, on duty—Burgess had his private coat on—he is in the habit of being out in plain clothes, but they all knew him—I had my staff out part of the time—I took it out when I received the blow between the shoulders—Burgess had his staff hanging on his arm, and I saw Carney lay hold of it and try to get it from him—I have been into this public-house several times—I was never in the back place, never further than the bar—about half-past ten that night I was fetched from where I reside, to go down to the station to charge Barnett, who had been taken into custody by a sergeant—I saw him at the station in custody—my ear had not been sewn up then—I was taken to the hospital afterwards—some lotions had been applied to it, to stop the bleeding.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>between the shoulders, that could not have been with the fitt—in addition to that blow, I received the cut in the ear—that was from Barnett—I did to hear him deny having struck me that blow—I did not hear him say any<lb/>thing at the station—I was merely brought there to identify him, and then taken away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Lewis.

On Monday afternoon, the 10th of Nov., about five o'clock, the prisoner Tietzner, came into my shop—he told me he wanted some provisions—he looked at a cask of butter, and said he wanted half a hun<lb/>redweight—I showed him two casks, which he had weighed—he then selected a bag of biscuits and two cheeses—there was about 130lbs. of butter—he spoke broken English—I could understand him—I asked who he was—he said, "Captain Korakin, of the brig <hi rend="italic">Twaan</hi>"—he wrote it down on this piece of paper, and gave it me—he also wrote his name, with a lead pencil, on another piece of paper, directing me where to take the goods, to Captain Korakin, of the brig <hi rend="italic">Twaan</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Tewan</hi>—I asked him where his ship was—he said, at Deptford—I asked him who his broker was—I could not under<lb/>stand him—he showed me a card, which I have not got—the prisoner kept it—it had on it, "J. Smith, late Soulby, ship-chandler, 126, Wapping"—he said nothing more about any other goods at that time; but while I was conveying them to Mr. Soulby's, he came and ordered more goods—I was not there then—I took the goods down to Mr. Soulby's, according to his directions, and left them there, with the bill—he said nothing about the money for the goods, the first time—he said the second time that he was going to his broker's to get money—I saw him again on Wednesday morning, the day but one after, and he gave me an order for peas, coals, and potatoes—they were not sent down, as he said his ship was coming into the London Docks—I went to Mr. Soulby's on the Wednesday, and the goods were gone—I found no money left for them—in consequence of what Mr. Soulby told me, I went with Murphy and a constable to a house at the corner of Houndsditch—we rung the bell—the prisoner Hakal opened the door for us—we asked him where the goods were—he said the goods were gone—I described the goods to him—I asked him about the man—he said he was gone also—we searched the house, and found part of the goods in Hakal's room, the back room, second floor—the biscuit was in the bed, covered over with some things—I could identify every one of the things—I found the casks by the side of the bed, in the same room—part of the butter was gone, and the cheese was also gone—I have since been to the London Dock—I found no such vessel as the <hi rend="italic">Twaan</hi>, nor any name like it.</p>

I am shopman to Mr. Soulby, a ship-chandler, 126, High-street, Wapping—on Monday, the 10th of Nov., between one and two o'clock in the day, the prisoners, Tietzner and Popart, came together—Tietzner laid hold of a piece of brown canvas that was on the counter, and Popart said</p>

               <p>the captain wanted some better bleached—I took them up into the sail-loft, and showed them a better sort—he ordered a bolt of No. 4 canvas, and a bolt of No. 6, two gallons of oil, one hundred weight of the best lead, and two fenders—Popart told me that Tietzner wanted them—Popart acted as inter<lb/>preter—he spoke English to me—I asked him the captain's name when we came out of the sail-loft, and he wrote on the slate "Captain Korakin, of the Russian brig, <hi rend="italic">Evon</hi>, lying off Deptford"—my master took them into the count<lb/>ing-house—they said they wanted to buy some provisions, and he recommended them to Mr. White's, of East Smithfield—they then spoke together—I could not tell what they said—after that Popart told me the goods were to go to the ship at Deptford on the following morning—he asked Mr. Soulby if he would take any provisions in that came, and keep them till the ship came up to the East Dock, London Dock, on the Wednesday—he asked as interpreter—my master said he would—on the next day our goods were sent down to Deptford—I was in the shop, and helped to carry them into a boat—I did not go with them—they were afterwards brought back to the shop by the water<lb/>man that took them—he is not here—I went round to the London Dock on the Tuesday, but could not see such a ship as the <hi rend="italic">Evon</hi>—I went again on the Wednesday and could not see her—about four o'clock on the Tuesday I saw Tietzner again by himself—he came and shook hands with my master, and I told him his vessel was coming into the East Dock, London Dock, on the day after to-morrow—on the Monday I saw a bag of biscuits and two firkins of butter at our place for Captain Korakin—I was not in when they came—on Wednesday morning, about ten o'clock, Tietzner brought a cart and said he was going to take the things back to Mr. Reynolds as they were too dear—he had Murphy with him—the things were put into the cart and went away—Tietzner went with it along side the cart—I do not know whether be stepped up in the cart or not.</p>

               <p>Hakel answered the door—we went and looked for the things down stairs, but could not find them—we asked him where the things were—he said the man was gone and the things too—we went up stairs and found some of the things—they were the same things I had had in the cart, all of them except the butter—Hakel was present when they were found—he said nothing when they were found—he said Tietzner had left them, and that he had said he was coming back in two hours for the rest of the things—one thing I should state is, that when Tietzner got as far as the Mint he bit his lips.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Henry Smith, the master of Rasberry. I was employed as a labourer on the 21st of Nov. at three houses which were under repair—the scaffolding was taken down, and Wiles was the carter to take it away to Mr. Fordham—I was called away by the bricklayer—I returned, and Jones, the carpenter, asked me to atsist him in taking these things out of the cart—they are my master's.</p>

I was present on that day—the cart was there to take away the scaffolding—I saw Rasberry helping to load, and in taking the scaffolding he took some old boards under the scaffolding, and carried them to the cart—I think Wiles was the man who was in the cart, but I cannot swear to him—when Rasberry had given the scaffolding and boards to the man in the cart, Rasberry took a small door from a mortar heap, and carried that to the cart—he then went back, and fetched another small door—the same man was in the cart all the time—I went to Jones, who had been longer in the employ than me—I told him what was going on, and he went up to the cart—these are the two doors, and these are the pieces of wood—I do not believe they had any business to take this wood—I understood they were to take the scaffolding.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the Rector of Chingford. On Saturday, the 1st of Nov., about six o'clock in the evening, I had two old 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and three other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, which I had received from Mr. Frazer, the cashier at Messrs. Childs', on the 29th of Oct., a few sovereigns and some id. pieces—I put them in the drawer of my writing-desk, which was in my study—it was all safe at six o'clock in the evening—I locked it up with a Bramah key—I missed it on Monday—Jessop had been a servant in my house—I turned him off in Aug.—I had put the Bramah key into my shaving case, where it used to be kept—Jessop knew it was kept there—on Sunday, the 2nd of Nov., I was going to church at a quarter before eleven o'clock, and saw Jessop coming up a corner as if he were going to my house—he had not on his working dress—to the best of my belief I do not think anybody else in my house knew where the key was beside Jessop—I never took any money out in presence of any of my servants—on the 4th of Nov. I met Jessop coming from the train, and taxed him with having been in my house—he said he had spoken to the kitchen-maid outside the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, living at Greenwich. On the 23rd of Oct. I was called in and saw the prosecutrix—I examined her eye, which was in the actual state of displacement from its natural cavity—she has completely lost the sight of that eye—a poker was produced to me, which I examined—a thrust from such an instrument would cause such a wound—during my attend<lb/>ance on the prosecutrix she did not take that essential care of herself which such a case required—the sight of the eye was lost immediately after the thrust, by the effusion of blood into the chamber of the eye, but that is sometimes absorbed—she did not take care of herself, or it was possible the sight might have been restored.</p>

I can tell seed from wheat in a minute"—the sack of seed was taken out of the wagon, I and placed with four other sacks of turnip seed—when I got that sack out of the wagon, which I assisted in pulling out, I put the sack of wheat in, which made fifteen—I counted them, and the prisoner went with me into the office to sign the book for fifteen—when be went in, the sack of seed was not in the wagon, but standing safe with the others—as the prisoner was going with me into the office, he said to the man, "Tie up, and see all is right," or, "All is right"—after he had signed the receipt, the prisoner went away, wagon and all—between the time that he came into the office to me, signed the receipt, and went out again, there was ample time for the other man to have put a sack of turnip seed into the wagon—I think there might have been time after the prisoner went out of the office, for him personally to have done it—the time would have been short—he might have done it with assistance.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Duchess of Kent public-house, in Deverell-street, Dover-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On Saturday, the 1st of Nov., about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, I went out into the back yard and found my back gate open, which was a very unusual thing, as it was not an entrance for customers, but merely a private back gate—I went back to the bar, got the key and double-locked the gate to secure it—that was as near twenty-five minutes or half-past seven as possible—I went up stairs to get an apron, unlocked my bed-room door, and found the window wide open, and the dwarf-blinds also—I looked out the window, and found the large looking-glass gone from the dressing-table, and put outside on the leads—I searched the bed-room</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor. My offices are on Fish-street-hill—I live at No. 11, Terrace, Walworth, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington—On Monday, the 20th of Oct., when I came home, a communication was made to me by Mrs. Shaw, who has been very ill for the last two years, and last night we did not expect she would survive the night—she placed nine<lb/>teen duplicates in my hand—the prisoner Caroline was in my service at that time, and had been so nearly eleven years—next morning I called her into the breakfast room, put the duplicates before her, and asked her where she I obtained those duplicates from, which she had given to Mrs. Shaw last evening—she said she had received them from Mary—I asked her to look at them and I see if they were them—she said, "Yes"—I asked how Mary became pos<lb/>sessed of them—she said she admitted Mary to the house at different times, and Mary had taken away the property and pawned it—I asked what busi<lb/>ness she had to let Mary into the house, as she had been forbidden when she I was dismissed the service—she said she would come in and bring a basket with her—I asked why she did not inform her mistress or me of it—she gave no answer—she was subsequently given into custody—I never persuaded her I to make a confession—I found there was property wanting, of which she had no duplicates, and asked her about them, and she afterwards gave me the duplicate of a pearl and diamond brooch—I have a list of the duplicates—I know Miss Cathcart—she placed in my custody in July, 1844, a box of plate—I did not see the contents of the box at that time—it was delivered to me locked and corded—I sealed the cord myself, and placed it for safety under my own bed—I never touched the box myself between that time and the 20th of Oct.—I saw it under the bed nearly every morning—I never authorized Caroline Cummings to open it—I examined the box after I re<lb/>ceived the duplicates and found the lock broken, and very few things in it—the prisoner Caroline was in bed then—it was at night—Mrs. Shaw gave me the duplicates—I communicated with Miss Cathcart on discovering the lost, and went with her to Mr. Turner's, a pawnbroker, No. 19, Pearl-row, about 100 yards from my house—I there found the property mentioned in the nine<lb/>teen duplicates, and Mr. Turner showed me other property, which I identified as Miss Cathcart's—I discovered other property wanting in my house, and I asked Caroline respecting more articles—she produced the duplicate of a pearl brooch and a diamond brooch—I subsequently gave orders to have Mary apprehended—she was apprehended the following day, and brought to my house—I think I said to her, "How could you commit so great a robbery as this in my house?"—she begged I would have mercy upon her—that was her only answer—I had not given her authority to pledge property—I had not seen her since she had left my service, which is ten years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Mary was in your service before Caroline? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and must have left my house in 1834—she was pert and irritable—we dismissed her on that account, that was all—I have scarcely dined at home for the last two years, in consequence of the illness of my wife, and the domestic arrangements have been under the care of my wife—my wife</p>

               <p>was not at the Police-office—I have not been out of town much for the last twelve months—I was once in Ireland, but only for four days—I always sleep at Walworth—I never sleep in town—I leave the money required to pay the bills of the house every Saturday—the day after the discovery of the robbery, Mr. Turner came to my house—some of the property was produced—Mrs. Shaw was present—Mr. Turner, on that occasion, mentioned the fact of a quantity of the property having been redeemed at one time, particularly on the day this was discovered—neither of the prisoners were present—Mr. Cummings, their mother, was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it not stated by Mrs. Shaw, that she had advanced 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get the property out of pledge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She said she had; for, at the time Caroline gave the duplicates to her, she found some of them had their term run out, and she hastily sent 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down to the pawnbroker's, to redeem part of the pro<lb/>perty—nothing was said about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Shaw did not say, if she had had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. she would have redeemed property to that extent—part of the money she did advance was not mine—it was stated that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or thereabout, had been paid to redeem articles—something was said about redeeming property at a previous time—I have reason to believe that on one occasion she redeemed the whole of the property, and forgave the servant for pawning it, the mother and daughter having gone on their knees and begged forgiveness—the box was again locked, corded, and sealed, and it is for the second offence, in breaking it open again, that I bring her here—Mrs. Shaw has been in such a state of health as to make her, at intervals, unfit for bnsiness—she is subject to fits, and at times completely under the control of anybody, and this rob<lb/>bery has preyed upon her mind—I have seen both the prisoners since the dis<lb/>covery—they never once uttered a syllable about Mrs. Shaw having directed the pledging of this property, but asked me to have mercy on them, nor did they make any such defence before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>went to a chair and sat down on it—when the room-door was opened it opened very near that chair, and he said that in rising up from the chair she cut her back against the latch of the door—he said he had had a few words with his mother about some beer—the wound was on the left side of the spine, on the back, between the sixth and seventh ribs, very near the spinal column—it appeared to be a clean cut wound—there was not any contusion about it—when I saw it, which was about two o'clock, or a little after, it was then quite clear from blood, and I am sure there was no swelling about it—I think it was not such a wound as could be inflicted by the latch of the door—it looked probable when the son sat down in that way, but I should say it could not be possible—it is probable a scratch might be inflicted, but with regard to that wound it was not possible—I examined the body afterwards—I noticed considerable adhesion all over the left lung to the ribs on the left side, and in the pericardium there was rather more than would be healthy—the right lung was healthy and the stomach was healthy—on making an incision to open the head, I perceived a portion of the scalp was gone, so much so that the cranium was exposed, and there was a scab from some disease or from some injury probably—I took off the top of the skull, and perceived it had penetrated through it—it did not appear to be recent—it had penetrated the membrane beneath the scalp, and there was considerable effusion under it—I removed that, and it had injured the brain—in cutting into the little brain, or the base of the brain, I noticed some coagulated blood, about the size of a nutmeg—that was not of long standing—it arose from the rupture of a vessel—it could not have existed long—this was on the Tuesday, and I judged it had taken place on the Saturday night or Sunday morning previous—to a woman, at her time of life, that rupture would be sufficient to cause death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the cut of itself sufficient to cause death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Judging from the quantity of blood which had escaped on the shift and sacking of the bed, and taking into consideration the state of her health from disease and intemperate habits, I think sufficient blood might have escaped from the wound to cause death in a woman of her age—in my judgment the immediate cause of death was the rupture of the blood-vessel on the brain—in fact apoplexy—as to how that took place I cannot form any opinion—it might have been from excitement—it might have been from a fall, or from many causes—I did not judge the cut itself the immediate cause of death—it was about three quarters of an inch long—it had not gone to the cavity of the chest—I should think it had been inflicted by some sharp instrument, such as a knife—I do not think it possible to have been done by the latch—I examined some clothes—here is a shawl which has a cut on it, as I believe it to be—the clothes had all been washed—here is a sort of handkerchief, this has a cut in it—this shift has the part torn away just opposite where the cut was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You attribute the death to the rupture in the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the other might have caused the death, but I will not swear it did.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of St. George's Southwark. I produce these clothes—I found these two knives in a cupboard in the room—they were as they are now, and appear rusty from wet—I came to the house after I heard of the death—the prisoner was there—I asked if he could account in any way for the suddenness of the death of his mother—he said she had been ailing, she was aged, and troubled with asthma—he was sitting on the side of the bed with his head on his hand, and seemed very sorry—he after<lb/>wards stated that his mother had a fall, and fell against the latch of the door, and hurt her back—he said he was asleep himself, and was awoke by a noise supposed to be the rattles in the throat—I asked if there had been any quarrel—he said no.</p>

I am innocent; I own I had been drinking and so had she; she was of very intoxicated habits for between six and seven years; I was her prin<lb/>cipal support, and my wages were but very small.</p>
