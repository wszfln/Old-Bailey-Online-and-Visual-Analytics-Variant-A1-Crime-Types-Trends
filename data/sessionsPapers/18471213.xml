                  </hi> I am in partnership with Charles Chilton, as button manufacturers, in Old-street. In Aug. last Lane was in our employ—my partner purchased some tools of him in that month, consisting of lathes and the tools now in question—we were to give him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I fetched them home my self next day from Lane's premises—Grover was there at the time—the hobs were packed up in a box in his presence, and afterwards brought to my premises—I paid the money—Lane came into our service after that, and Grover also, but he was under Lane, not actually in our service—I entrusted Lane with these eighteen hobs—they are worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are attached to lathes for cutting umbrella knobs and things of that kind—the prisoners worked on our premises for about ten weeks, and left on 30th Oct.—I paid Lane that Saturday night what was due to him—he had no authority from me to take away these hobs—they were using them at that time—the prisoners did not come to their business on Monday morning, in consequence of which I went with my partner, and Sergeant Brannan, to where they live—I searched for the tools—part of them were on the bench, apparently in use—Lane afterwards brought this little box out, and said, "Perhaps you will say these are your's"—I said, "Certainly they are"—I have no doubt they are the same—neither of them had permission to take them from our premises.</p>

Q.</hi> What is Mr. Flight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A gentleman—he has large estates in houses and landed property—he occasionally discounts a bill—he does not keep an insurance-office—sometimes he has got a friend to insure his life for security—he is not a money-lender—he may have 700 or 800 tenements from which weekly rents are collected—I cannot say to a hundred or so, he may have 600 or 700 from which the rents are collected quarterly—we have a quarterly collector, he is sixteen or seventeen years of age—when he could not enforce payments the prisoner used to get it—it was his business to enforce the quarterly payments, when I instructed him, but not without—I swear positively he had no right to collect quarterly rents without instructions—I did not instruct him to get Miller's, Lines', or Alforth's rent—I have our pass-book her (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 3rd Nov. he paid me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the first time he paid me after 28th Oct., but this book merely alludes to the weekly tenants—this is the cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—you will find the weekly tenants entered and classified, and the amounts paid are passed to his credit—there is no entry here to show that these payments only allude to weekly tenants—if he received a quarterly account he would pay it to me, and I should enter it in his presence, not in this book, but in the other—he generally brought me a list—he did not bring me one on 27th, only for his expenses, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if he had not received anything from the quarterly tenants he would not bring a list—if he brought money from weekly tenants he would put it down in the book—I do not know London-street—my master has a great many tenants there—they are set down in the books as weekly tenants, but they are very respectable people, and weekly payments are not enforced except with some of them—I believe the prisoner has had to put in distresses—I received nothing but what the tenants owed—the prisoner received his instructions from Mr. Flight in his private office—I may have heard in general conversation that the prisoner remonstrated about putting in distresses to particular people—I do not recollect his saying it was very hard thing to cast that business upon him, or beg that he might be relieved from it—he has not said it to Mr. Flight in my presence that I am aware of.</p>

               <p>him—I thought there was no possibility of losing it—I was the eldest hand and the first player—I sat next to Lewis—I said, "If you will bet, I will bet you 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at six to one"—Barr said, "If you have got such a good hand, I don't mind betting it," and he made his bet too—I do not know whether it was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he had to place down his watch—I played off the six trumps and the ace of spades I believe, and that was trumped by Lewis—I cannot exactly tell what I had beside, but I know I had no diamonds—Lewis brought in his diamonds—he had been seven trumps to my six, and he had a suit to follow—neither his partner nor mine had any trumps at all—Lewis and I had all the trumps—when this was lost, I paid a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note down—I had to leave my watch for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and Barr put down his money and watch—I did not examine Barr's money—he had the arrangement of it with Lewis—after I had lost the odd trick we separated, and I and Barr went on to Evan's—I asked Barr if the watches were safe—he said he supposed that these men were known to Outhwaite, and we should get our watches the next day—I had received their names—Lewis was Stephens, and Carter was Harrington or Carrington—those names were given in the presence of Barr—Stephens was the betting-man—after going to Evans's, Barr and I went home together—he lived at St. John's-wood—I told him I was much astonished at my losing this trick—he said it must have been my bad playing—Stephens had given his address at the Tavistock Hotel, Covent-garden, and Barr and I were to go there the next day to redeem our watches—Barr called at my place next day, I think between three and four o'clock, and we went together—we met Lewis just in Covent-garden Market—he said he was just going out, because we had not been to our appointment—I believe we were some half-hour behind our time—Lewis said he had the watch at a certain place, and he would go and redeem it, if I did not mind going into this littler place—I have since understood it is the Bear and Ragged Staff, in Castle-street—I do not know whether he had the watch about him, or whether it was there—I got my watch there, and paid my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Barr then paid his money and redeemed his watch—Lewis then said that he expected Carter very shortly, and there was some proposal made to play—I said it was about my dinner hour. I wanted to go home—I and Barr went away—Barr made an appoint<lb/>ment to meet me at Evans's, and I met him there—we went to the Bear and Ragged Staff—they had taken the rooms—I heard them tell the man they would be there at seven o'clock—Barr and I went there, and met Lewis and Carter—we all four sat down to whist—Barr was my partner, as before—we played for a bet, and I lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a hand that I was induced to bet on against a good hand—Lewis dealt it—the bet was got up the same way as he other—Lewis looked at his hand and said, "I don't mind making a bet"—the bet was the last hand we played, but before that we were playing a match, which could get the greatest number of rubbers—we played a good while, and this heavy hand was given to me—Lewis looked at his hand and said he did not mind taking a bet, if anybody would give him odds—I looked at my hand and said, "I have a most extraordinary hand here"—Barr looked at his hand, and he encouraged me by saying he would join in a bet—I cannot tell whether I led, but I lost the odd trick in the same manner as before—it was quite unintelligible to me—I lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the that bet—we had been playing before for trifles—I had not own any other bet—this was the closing bet—I believe we were best off in the rubbers—I cannot tell what we were playing for, it was so much stake for a match—I think it must have been pounds—I might have won from Lewis a few pounds—I think I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a Bank note, as near as I can remember, and I again deposited</p>

               <p>again, and Lewis wanted to bet—I said I had been so unfortunate by losing twice, that I would not bet—Lewis had dealt me that hand—Barr looked at his hand, and said, "My hand is such, that I should think I could give any one three to one on my hand"—he was my partner—after this a bet was made, Barr 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I led off my trump, which was a heart—I said "Trump"—Barr said, "O, that is not trump, diamonds are trumps,"—and there was a great dispute about the trumps—he thought these men had changed the trumps—I said "No," hearts were trumps and we must abide the bet—I lost the odd trick because my partner had no hand—I think the heart I led was a three of hearts, the smallest I had in my hand—the end was that I lost the odd trick, and Lewis again had the command of all my trumps—I cannot tell how he did it but he again had it—when the odd trick was lost Barr thought it was through carelessness—he put his hand up to his head and said he was dis<lb/>tracted—I got up—they asked me to go down and take a glass of soda-water—I went down and took one—Barr would not take anything—he got up and came away—the bet always finished the evening play—I had a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my pocket—I produced it on the table, and of course I left my watch for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Barr put down his watch and some money, or what appeared to be money—I always betted for more then I had—they knew the value I put on my watch—they would have taken it for any money—we all came to town together—the omnibus took us up—we made an engagement to meet again, as the match had not been played out—I was to meet them on Monday morning to pay the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on Monday morning the 26th, Barr came to my place—I said I could not make it convenient to pay the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day—he said, "We will go and arrange about it"—we went—I saw Barr pay the money to redeem his watch—I did not see him take his watch out of the man's hand, but I saw him with it, and he had it not before—I made an arrangement to pay on 3rd Aug.—I left my watch because I could not pay that day without selling out—I met Barr on 3rd Aug., and accompanied him to Doctors' Com<lb/>mons to prove my father's will—it was necessary there should be two wit<lb/>nesses to the bond—they were Barr and Stephens—this is the bond—before I went there, I had been with Barr to the stock-brokers, and sold out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it fetched about 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Barr had said he could get his friend to sign as surety, and he left me at Doctors' Commons and brought Lewis with him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Barr said, "My friend was out, and luckily I met with Stephens" (we had appointed to pay the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Lewis that day)—Lewis signed the bond, and I paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and got my watch back—of course the match was still pend<lb/>ing—Barr brought me letters on different occasions saying, this man Stephens was worrying him to play out the match, and he wanted me to write him a note to say what I would do—I said "No, you have been corresponding with him, you must correspond with him, I will keep out of the way; I will not play with him, let the matter die off"—I said I would not play any more with Carter or Lewis—I expressed that several times, and Barr expressed himself just as willing as myself not to meet him—I still continued to associate with Barr—we were very intimate—he pro<lb/>posed to me to go into the country—he said he was going to Ramsgate for a few weeks, and was going to take Mrs. Barr—after he had been there a week he wrote to me to go down—I did not go—after he returned from Rams<lb/>gate he called on me and said he was very sorry I had not been down, and asked me to go down with him to Boulogne—I did not go—I expressed a wish to see Windsor Castle, and I left London with him to go there on 2nd Sept.—he told me he had some friends shooting near Windsor, and if I was fond</p>

                  </hi> I have known Mr. Barr for sixteen or seventeen months from the present time—I have known a person named Carter for six or seven months from this period—I introduced Carter to Barr—in July last I went to Cremorne-gardens—I do not know the time, but it was the day Barr met with Mr. Kerie—Barr and Carter went together by the boat—before we went, an arrangement had been made between us, as to the purpose for which we went there—it was for the purpose of picking up a <hi rend="italic">flat</hi>, in the phrase used amongst men like ourselves, I am sorry to say—that was the term then used—I had before that been connected with Barr in playing, as we did with Mr. Kerie, in cheating—we got to Cremorne-gardens, and separated—we met occasionally in the gardens—it was arranged that whoever was picked up there, the person who picked him up should bring him to town, and the other two should follow them for the purpose of getting the person to play at cards—I saw Barr accost Mr. Kerie, and light his cigar—I went and fetched the cigar for Barr—he is not in the habit of smoking, but on that occasion he thought he would, to introduce himself to Mr. Kerie—we had selected Mr. Kerie—we saw him about along—Mr. Barr had spoken to two or three others but he did not like them—he went and spoke to Mr. Kerie—they went and saw the fireworks—I and Carter were keeping an eye on them—our agreement was not to lose sight of them—we saw Mr. Kerie and Barr come up to town, and we came in the same boat—we did not speak to them, we kept at the other end of the boat—we should not have gone by that boat but there was no other, it was the last—I know where Barr was going to take Mr. Kerie—after they landed, I saw them go to the cigar-shop in Little Russell-street—Carter and I waited ten minutes or a quarter of an hour outside—we then went into the room, where Barr and Mr. Kerie were on the sofa—Carter and I entered into some conversation about cards—it was arranged to do so—we had done so on frequent occasions, to dispute on a point of whist, so as to get Mr. Kerie to give his opinion, and induce him to play—that was the object, and we succeeded—when we mentioned about this, the conversation was made general, and it was proposed about playing a rubber at whist—I almost think it was I that said I should be happy to join as one of four, to play for cigars or what not—Barr agreed to it, and asked Mr. Kerie to join—we sat down, and had a rubber for coffee and cigars—Barr and Mr. Kerie were partners, and Carter and I—we played first for coffee and cigars, and I believe Barr and Mr. Kerie were allowed to win that—after that we played another game—I do not know that we played points—it was long game whist—the cards we were playing with, were brought in by the landlord—they had been given to him by one of us—I do not know whether it was by Barr or me or Carter—I had a stacked pack of cards with me—I had had them when I went to Cremorne—they were arranged for the purpose of giving any one such a hand that he would bet 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that he would win, but it was so arranged that he could not win—one person would have a particular hand, and another a much better hand—the person was placed beyond all chance of winning—Barr and Carter knew I had this stacked pack of cards in my pocket—while Mr. Kerie was playing, Barr drew his attention</p>

He has an appoint<lb/>ment with his uncle at five o'clock, to sign some papers. He will not be dis<lb/>engaged till half-past, when he meets me to dine, so you may expect to see us at Greenwich about half-past six, and I should advise you to look out for us at the Church, where you will see us pass. I shall be on the look out for you. I do not think we had better dine at the Yacht again, but at the Tra<lb/>falger, or Ship, lest he should think something.—Yours, in haste, A. W. Barr. Half-past ten o'clock."—"Dear Lewis,—I showed Kerie your letter, and he says he is engaged on Monday, but that on Tuesday, the 17th, he will be happy to play it out at the Tavistock; to be punctual at seven. Get all you can. I think we shall have to follow him to Liverpool. I did not say any<lb/>thing to him about your going to Doncaster. I shall not be there.—Yours, in haste. A. W. Barr."—"Friday, 20, 1847. Dear Lewis,—I received your letter, but not till this morning, so that K. has not seen it. He dined with me yesterday, and this morning started for Tenby to see his aunt, and will return to town on Thursday next. I therefore propose to tell him when he returns that I have fixed upon Monday, August 30, to finish our match, and when I hear what he says I will let you know. At. all events I shall see you as soon as he returns. Everything seems all right.—Yours, in haste, A. W. Barr."—"Dear Lewis,—I received yours this morning. I am going with K. to-morrow to spend two or three days at his uncle's, at Richmond, where he has invited me. I shall be in town on Monday with him, but should anything occur I will write to you. The business goes on well. He has proved the will, and goes to-morrow morning to lodge the papers at the Bank, where they remain eight days, when he will <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> 2700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three and a half per cent.

               <p>give a reason for doing so—I had several men under me there at Dulas—I would foolishly allow them to go out shooting or fishing, and used to pay them their money; a man came from Bristol, named Cotterall, or some such name, I took him out shooting, and he told the gamekeeper who took him out, and there was a warrant for me, for poaching—I went to the Church were this man was at work—I desired him to go out—he would not—I might have a struck him, and made him go out, and he went and got a war<lb/>rant, and he went to Mr. Evans, who sent him back to tell me to let him work—I would not, and then Mr. Evans sent for me—he desired me to employ him—I said I would not employ him again, and he said, I might leave the work—there was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me—they would not pay me, and my solicitor desired me to leave it—I went to the Church, and took a little burnt umber, and a little black, and mixed it, to alter the tone of the paint in the Church, and William Lewis came to the Church, and he understood from this man that I had spoilt his paint, and they sent a con<lb/>stable to my lodging—I was not taken—I shut the door against him, and locked it—I told him he must not come in there—in the meantime Mr. Evans got to understand what I had done, that I had only altered the tone of the paint, not spoilt it—the next day was Sunday, and I had an oppor<lb/>tunity of explaining the whole circumstance, and the constable was taken off—I know there is no person in that neighborhood but would give me the highest character, except for an acquaintance with a young woman there that I married—the only thing against me was, that I married a young woman—that is the only thing that any of them can say against me—it was on account of the paint they sent for the constable—I brought the young woman up to London—she is my wife—she returned home again—I do not remember a Captain Kelly preferring some indictments against some persons for swindling, or for gaming—I do not know any such circumstance—I was not employed to settle with the swindlers or the gamblers—it was usual for the prisoners and me to share in what was won by them—I was not the bead man, but they thought I had better never perhaps, and put me forward to do what was done—I did not always stack the cards—I did sometimes, and sometimes Barr, or Carter did—on the first and second occasion I was the person selected to change the cards—I did not stack them—I believe it was Barr who stacked them—one of us gave the pack of cards to Mr. Hitchcock, the innkeeper—I could not undertake to swear whether it was me, or Barr, or Carter—we were a little elevated, and I am afraid to tell a falsity by swear<lb/>ing which of us gave it him—I had seen Hickman before—we had been there frequently—I believe he knew I was a gambler and a cheat.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, residing at Hackney, and have known the late Mr. Nelme many years—I was first called in between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and he died, as near as I can ascertain, between four and five in the afternoon—I had not attended him since I cut off his arm, I believe, in 1837—I was in the habit of attending the family, Mrs. Nelme being in bad health, as well as the daughter—the morning I saw him he described himself as suffering great pain in the bowels, and having been very sick, and having been purged—I thought him extremely ill, wrote a prescrip<lb/>tion, and they sent it to be made up at our surgery—I promised to see him again in a few hours, I saw him again between twelve and one; he had then taken two of the draughts, and I directed him to have some beef tea and a little brandy and water—I was afterwards sent for urgently, and went imme<lb/>diately, between four and five, and found he was dead—I afterwards, by the direction of the Coroner, opened the body—he was about 73 or 74 years of age—I amputated his arm in 1873. in consequence of an accident, and he told me then he was 62 or 63—the draughts I gave him did not contain any arsenic—I did not, on the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, discover anything that caused me to suppose he had come to his death by foul means—the first examination I made was on 29th, forty-eight hours after his death—I discovered nothing that led me to suspect the presence of poison, but it may be right to observe that the contents of the stomach, the stomach itself, and other parts, were removed expressly for the purpose of chemical analysis, so that I had not the opportunity of judging altogether of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, appearances—the contents of the stomach were placed in a jar, and the stomach in another jar; the intestines were secured at either extremity, and placed in a jar, with a portion of the liver; the jars were all sealed—I can hardly recollect what was in each—there was one small one and two large ones—I did not seal them myself, or see them sealed; my partner, Mr. Hacon, took charge of them; he kept them till I called for them in my car<lb/>riage on the Sunday morning, and we took them, together, to Dr. Letheby—on 1st Nov., I was sent for to Mrs. Nelme; she had been sick—I received from her some arrow-root and pounded sugar—I requested to have them, and placed them in different papers, and took them away—I did not make an experiment on the arrow-root; I endeavoured to dissolve the sugar in cold distilled water; it would not dissolve—I delivered the rest of the sugar to Dr. Letheby, at the London Hospital—he made some experiments on it in</p>

               <p>my presence—it was pounded lump sugar—he told me it contained a consi<lb/>derable quantity of arsenic—I was not present when he made the experiment on the liver, the contents of the stomach, and the intestines—all I know on the subject is, from Dr. Letheby's evidence before the Coroner, which I heard, and attended to, and from which, I have on doubt, Mr. Nelme died from arsen<lb/>ical poison.</p>

                  </hi> I am physician, and lecturer on chemistry at the London Hospital. On Sunday morning, 31st Oct., Messrs. Toulmin and Hacon called on me with the three jars—the smaller one, which was put into the larger one, contained the contents of a human stomach—the other large jar contained the stomach, the intestines, and a portion of the liver—the jar into which the smaller one was put contained nothing—the intestines were secured by strings, to keep the contents within them—on the following day Mr. Toulmin called on me at the hospital, and gave me two paper parcels, one containing arrow-root and the other pounded sugar—I analysed all those</p>

               <p>matters—I used tests of my own, which are known only to a few—they are known tests, but somewhat modified—I can state that there was not any material used that contained arsenic, inasmuch as experiments were per<lb/>formed with portions of sheep's liver, and so on, which did not yield to the same reagents any indication of arsenic—the contents of the stomach were first put into a retort and distilled, and about three tea-spoonsful of liquor distilled from it—those three tea-spoonsful were tested for prussic acid, without giving any evidence or indication of that poison—the remainder of the contents of the stomach were evaporated nearly to driness, then digested in about half a pint of alcohol, then about half a pint of alcohol poured upon this nearly dry deposit—this alcoholic solution was then filtered, and then tested for lead, corrosive sublimate, copper, and beryta, all of which are poisons; also for opium, nux vomica and oxalic acid, but without being able to detect either of them—the remainder of the contents of the stomach not dissolved by the alcohol was then boiled in water and tested for arsenic, by which means I was enables to detect that poison, a portion of which I produce in a metallic state—it is the small metallic ring in this tube—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is only a portion of what I discovered; the other has been subjected to analysis—the liver was then tested for arsenic, and that gave similar results—I then proceeded to analyse the arrow-root, but did not detect any poison there—I then analysed the coarse white sugar, which amounted to four ounces and a half, and out of that I was enabled to obtain this, which is rather more than half an ounce of white arsenic—I afterwards examined a portion of the brain, which was given me by Mr. Toulmin three of four days afterwards—I cannot remember the day—it was at one of the sitting of the Coroner's Jury—I analysed that, and detected a trace of arsenic in the brain—I did not weigh the quantity of arsenic I found in the stomach, but in my judgment I should say I detected about four grains of white arsenic in the stomach, liver, intestines, and brain altogether—I weighed one portion, and from that obtained rather better than two grains and a half, nearly three grains, of white arsenic in the intes<lb/>tines—I think that would be sufficient to cause death—I can form an opinion, from discovering arsenic in the liver, how long the patient had been under its influence—I may be wrong, but I am of opinion that the deceased had been under the influence of arsenic of few days—I am speaking from my experience in similar cases—from the time it takes to get arsenic into the system, I think he must have had it in him for about a week—that which was contained in the intestines might have been taken recently—I should say he had taken if very recently before death—in my judgment the arsenic was the cause of death.</p>

               <p>which are connected with the formation of that opinion, which it is necessary you should know, or it may mislead you; in the course of my inquiries, in some hundreds of cases, I have found it a rule, when arsenic is detected in the brain and liver of animals, that the animal has been for some time under the influence of that arsenic, but there are exceptions to the rule; taking the rule, I am of opinion that he was under its influence for some time—I do not speak of the rule as infallible, but as a general one—I should be disposed to think he had been under the influence of arsenic a month, still bearing in mind that I am guided by that general rule.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a patient had died from arsenic, and the body being afterwards opened arsenic was discovered in the liver and brain, as in this case, and you had known that he had apparently been in good health for a month or week preceding, what would then be your opinion, from your experience? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion would then be the reverse of that I am now expressing—at the time I gave evidence as to the arsenic in the liver, I knew nothing of the circumstances—if the case was so, I should say he had been under the influence of arsenic within twenty-four hours—it generally taken some time for arsenic to get into the system—it may be quicker or slower.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not arsenic occasionally administered as a medi<lb/>cine, and in such doses as would not exhibit any external signs of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to accumulate in the liver to the extent I found here—I have examined the liver of parties who have been under the influence of arsenic for same time—I do not think that if arsenic is taken medicinally, in small quantities, from time to time, it would get into the system gradually and so exhibit the appear<lb/>ances I found in the liver and brain, without creating palpable signs of a in the patient—I think that, generally speaking, arsenic is got rid of from the system almost as flat as it is given, when given in such small doses as not to produce any serious illness or strong marks—it is administered in certain diseases of the skin—it is a common remedy for such diseases—it generally passes off with the urine—it is the duty of the kidneys to get rid of any such poison—there would be always some to be found in the liver, but not to such an extent as I found here.</p>

                  </hi> I am the widow of the late Samuel Nelme—he was in his seventy-fourth year—he died at 2, Grove-place, Hackney—he had very good health of late years—about two or three days before his death he com<lb/>plained of illness—I attended upon him entirely—he first complained on the Friday before his death, which was on 27th—we thought it was nothing more than a cold—on Tuesday night, 26th, he complained of sickness for the first time—on Wednesday morning he took a cup of tea, and about eleven o'clock he had a little beef tea—that was not prepared in my presence, but by the servant in the presence of a friend, Mrs. Simpson, who was stay<lb/>ing with us—she poured it out herself—there was a sugar-bason that was used in the family—Mr. Nelme generally used that sugar more than any-body else—the sugar-bason was generally produced after dinner, with fruit—it contained powdered sugar—Mr. Nelme always ate some of the sugar after dinner with his fruit—it was kept in the sideboard closet—the prisoner was in the habit of seeing that sugar-vase on the table, and used by his grand-father—I think Mr. Nelme did not partake of that sugar on the Tuesday afternoon, for he did not eat any fruit then—I do not think he took any fruit on the Monday, or any sugar—he took nothing on the Monday or Tues<lb/>day, which I prepared for him, which contained sugar—he had part of a mutton-chop on the Tuesday—he had no gruel or arrow-root on Tuesday or</p>

               <p>the distinction between truth and falsehood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is a very clever boy in some things—in most things he is a boy of very superior ability—there was nothing to lead me to think he did not know the difference between falsehood and truth—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—"My dearest Mother,—As you cannot come to see me, I hope you will write to me, and tell me what I ought to do to get forgive<lb/>ness for what I have done, for I know I have sinned against God, and I deserve to be cast into hell; but what is my only comfort is the Bible, for our Lord says, 'If ye repent I will forgive you; if ye seek me ye shall find me, for he that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out;' therefore I hope for forgiveness, for I will put on a fresh cloak, and I will cast the one I have got on off from my back; and although my sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as wool; I will cast off all my evil ways and put on better. Mr. Davis preached a beau<lb/>tiful sermon on Sunday; he took it from Pro. xvi., begin at the sixth verse: 'By mercy and truth iniquity is purged; for fear of the Lord men depart from evil; and after service time he told me that if I did not confess what I have done, God would not forgive me, and every one was sure I had done it; and he told me that if God was to strike me dead where would my soul go to; therefore, dear mother, I have no one to blame but myself. If I had only attended to what you were teaching me I should not have come into such a place; but Satan had got so much power over me that I had two dreams this night; I will tell them to you. I dreamed that if I did not confess what I had done God would not forgive me, and I should surely die, and that God would cast me into hell; and if I did confess it, God would forgive me, and if I turned away from my wickedness God would take me to heaven when I died: and Satan tried to make me not confess it, and that if I did confess it I should be cast into hell; but I turned away from him, and said, 'I will confess it, or else God will not forgive me; and I mean to turn away from my wickedness.' And then I awoke and perceived it was but a dream; but I soon feel asleep again, and I had another dream: it was about the resurrection. I felt so happy whilst I was dreaming it. I dreamed there was God seated on his throne, and Satan was on the left hand, and God called us all up, and asked us a question; it was an English word to make French, and those that had confessed all their sins, and had left off all their wicked<lb/>ness, he said to them, 'Come ye into my kingdom, which I have pre<lb/>pared for you;' and he said unto those on his left hand, 'Go ye into the furnace of fire prepared for Satan and his angels.' I dreamed I was happy, and you, and all my brothers and sisters; but I hope done what I am accused of. How I got the poison was this: on the 20th of Oct. grandfather went to his desk for the key of the wine-cellar to get some wine up and to look over his accounts; and whilst he was gone I took the poison out, and emptied some of it into another piece of paper, and put the other back; and then after dinner I put it in the sugar-bason; and why I did it was I had made grand<lb/>father angry with something I had done, and he knocked me down into pas<lb/>sage, and my head went up against the table and hurt it very much, and he said next time I did it, he would almost kill me; but in future I will say the truth and nothing but the truth: as grandfather said, 'Truth may be blamed, but cannot be shamed.' But if I am transported I know it will be the death of me, therefore I hope they will pardon me. What is the punishment of man to the punishment of God? It is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. I dare say you will not believe the dreams, but I assure you it is the truth. With kindest love to you and all at home, believe me, ever your affectionate son, W.N.A.</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon to the gaol of Newgate, and have had opportunities of seeing and conversing with the prisoner since he has been in goal until the present time—I do not recollect when he was committed—I have seen him almost daily—I have conversed with him continually, and have watched him with a view of ascertaining his state of mind—I have heard the letter read—I have not observed anything about him which induces me to doubt his being of sound mind—during the time I have seen him he has appeared to me of sound mind—the evidence to-day does no alter my opinion of his sanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have not, I believe, particularly studied matters of this sort? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have been obliged to do it, in connexion with this prison, but not besides that—it has been made a branch of itself for many years—there are many distinctions and forms which insanity takes, not at all apparent to ordinary observers—I heard Mr. Toulmin examined, and heard his state<lb/>ment that the boy was suffering from scrofula—I do not agree with the other gentleman examined, that scrofula is very liable to affect the brain, not to that extent—I differ with him—I believe that in cases of scrofula a person's brain may be out of order from extreme debility—I have not seen any madness result from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand that the only way you would imagine scrofula would affect the brain would be to affect the general system? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be scrofulous tubercles in the brain—it would depend on the extent of the tubercles whether they were externally manifest, tubercles have been sup<lb/>posed to exist some years without being discovered—it is not within my ex<lb/>perience that scrofula driven inwardly is liable to produce a certain character of insanity—I have not met with a case in which scrofula has affected the brain direct—when I say his mind is perfect, I do not consider it in the same way as I should consider the mind of a grown-up man—I have reasoned with him and talked with him—I found his reasoning correct—there has latterly been a great distinction made between what is called a disease of the mind and moral insanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I right in supposing that almost in every case of insanity the moral faculties are the first to be implicated in the disorder? I am putting the question from Dr. Winslow's book, which I conclude is one of high authority. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have read it, it is not of very great authority, but I should be sorry to detract from it—I should consider that in an infant the mind is rather a matter of feeling than of understanding—they understand from others that a thing is right or wrong, and do not reason upon it—I consider Dr. Conolly a person of very high authority—my opinion is that the prisoner shows no indications of insanity whatever—I expressed the same opinion in the case of Ovenstone—he was decided to be mad—Dr. Conolly and I both said that Ovenstone was sane at the time—I was asked my opinion whatever he was sane at the time of the commission of the act—I do not give my opinion on that subject now, but only speak of the time I saw the prisoner.</p>

I am suffering very much in my mind for the number of sins I have committed, but I pray to God to forgive me my sins through Jesus Christ; but if God will not forgive me; but it makes me very miserable to think that I shall be cast into hell. I feel I am in the depth of sin in its true light. I did not before when I was at home; I gabbled my prayers over without thinking the least of them. Oh, I am an ungrateful child, but, dear mother, pass it over, and look for the future; I know my sin is very great indeed, but God is able to wash me clean through the blood of Jesus Christ. Oh, I shall be either hung or transported from all my dear friends, but, what is my comfort, I cannot be separated from that precious friend. God's will be done what punishment I am to have, but if it please him to grant me a little longer life I will endeavour to walk in his righteousness, and never to break any of the least of his commandments. Continue to offer up your prayers for me. I continue to pray for you and myself six times a day and night, as my mind stops me from sleeping. Oh, mother, comfort yourself by looking up to God. Never can I be happy again till I feel myself relieved of my sins, which God alone can wash away. I have such fancies at times, When I am reading, or lying down at night, I fancy I can see some one; and it does startle me so, and makes my heart beat so; and when I look, I see no one; and I lay down again, and I fancy I can see it again; and I get up again, and ask it what it wants. It mutters something, but I do not know what it says. I do not say it to frighten you, dear mother. I have had it like it for some time, and before grandfather's death, only I did not like to tell you of it, because I knew it was only my fancy. It is not story I assure you, dear mother. It is what I fancy. I felt quite overwhelmed to think I am such a sinful and an ungrateful child I have been to you for your great kindness to me. I can never repay you for it I am sure. It makes me very ill indeed, when I look back, I feel I shall go out of my mind at times, but I will try, by God's help, to conquer my unruly temper, I think I must have been mad to have done what I have, or else I do not think I could have done it. Mr. Goodchild was kind enough to come and see me on Saturday. He recommended me to a prayer in the Communion Service. I hope you are better than when I heard from you last. God's blessing be upon you, and bring you through this heavy trouble. I am sure I shall not have strength to bear up against it; my heart feels ready to break; but I must not murmur against the God who sends us this trouble for some good or another; besides, I have brought it all upon myself, and I deserve to suffer; therefore I can only say, 'God's will be done, not mise.' Look at our blessed Saviour; what agony did he suffer when nailed upon the tree; and yet, when on the tree, he prayed for his enemies; he never murmured. Now, again; Joseph was sold to those merchantmen. God ordered it to turn of out for some good. King Pharaoh would not have known how to provide against the famine if he had not have been sold. So you see it is very wicked to murmur against God. Let our troubles be ever so afflictive, God orders them to turn out for good. So learn to be patient. Therefore, dear mother, do not make yourself ill because of me, if I am transported. I will bear any punishment he inflicts upon me. He will help me through all my troubles, if I turn to him with all my heart. He sees me wherever I go, either in the dark or light. I will look up to him in all my troubles, and he will guide me to that heavenly kingdom where moth nor</p>

               <p>rust doth not corrupt, nor thieves break through nor steal. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Let me have the Bible. Never before this time did I value the Bible, the book I could read. I am un<lb/>worthy of the lenst of his mercies. I am a wicked child; but in future I will put off all my bad habits, and put on better. The sermons we have guide me a great deal, together with the Bible. One sermon was taken from Proverbs xxiii., beginning at 23rd verse: 'Buy the truth, and sell it not.' In the week he reads one or two verses out of the Old or New Testament, and then explains it to all the prisoners, which my soul I think profits by it a little. Oh, most merciful Father, forgive me all my sins, and let me find comfort in thee. Oh! I am a very great sinner, and I deserve to be cast into hell; but, Oh God! keep the devil away. Oh Lord, for thy Son's sake, bless my dearest mother, and all my brothers and sisters, and all my kind friends; and at the last bring them to thy everlasting kingdom, through Jusus Christ our Lord; and if it should pleases thee to restore my dearest mother to health, and grant that we may grow up good boys, to be a comfort to you. Oh, dear mother, when can I repay you for all your great kindness to me. Oh, I will grow up a good boy, by God's help. I do earnestly repent, and am heartily sorry for my sins, which are as many as the hairs of my head. I will ask God to blot them out of his book. I must now conclude with kindest love to you, and all my brothers and sister, and grandmother, which I hope are quite well. God bless you all. Oh continue to guide my dear brothers to the Saviour while young. Could not I see my tow brothers? Your affectionate but unhappy son, W. N. <hi rend="smallCaps">ALLNUTT."</hi>

                  </hi> I have been a medical man since 1826, and am brother-in-law of the late Mr. Allnutt. He was subject to epileptic attacks—I attended him many years—I did not attend him immediately before his death—I saw him at Hastings probably about two months before his death—he was then quite mad—I had seen him so before at times—he was a person of an extremely excitable habit and mind—I know his father (the pri<lb/>soner's grandfather)—he was subject to paralysis—that is a disease connected with the brain; and his two sisters are blind from a nervous disease, called anmarosis, which is, no doubt, connected with a disease of the brain—I have attended the prisoner—I saw him subsequent to Mr. Croucher, for the illness occasioned by the fall on the ploughshare—I was the regular medical atten<lb/>dant, but Mr. Croucher happened to be in the house—I saw the prisoner either the day, or the day but one, after the accident—nothing very particular ensued from the wound—there was a degree of inflammation—there was not erysipelas, that I recollect—the last time I attended him was for ring-worm, after they returned from Hastings, and before they went to Hackney—it was after his father's death, probably eighteen months ago—ring worm is a disease of an irritable, painful, and excitable character, it was very obstinate, it is a disease of the head, I should not like to say that it would affect the brain, but certainly the remedies may do so—the irritation of ring-worm might have the effect of disturbing an already excited and disturbed mind—he was suffering from scrofula; and at the present moment his face exhibits traces of it—he very early gave evidence of a scrofulous habit—scrofula is usually hereditary—it is so in this family, on one side—when it is hereditary, it is more obstinate and difficult to cure—I have attended him for scrofula, but only for a short time—I do not think Mr. Conolly attended him for scrofula—I believe Dr.</p>

               <p>Duesbury did—the nature and character of scrofula is calculated to affect the mind—I think it more likely to arise other causes, from the pre<lb/>sence of tubercles—I was not in Court when Dr. Letheby gave his opinion—tubercles are not to be ascertained, they may be suspected—I know Mrs. Allnutt's other children—the prisoner is more excitable than them, so far as my examination has gone—from my examination of him, I think he is par<lb/>tially insane; that partial insanity, when he was suffering from it, would pre<lb/>vent him distinguishing right from wrong.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you last attend him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was in the autumn of last year, on his return from Hastings—he was on a visit at my brother-in-law's—I had opportunities of seeing him—I cannot say that I considered him partially insane then—from all I have heard, and what I have seen, and acting in the way he is charged, he must he under an impulse and delusion; but I do not mean to say he always was so—I mean at intervals—I do not actually say that a boy who would murder his own grandfather, must be insane—when I saw him in prison, last Satur<lb/>day, he spoke of a voice inducing him to do what he was charged with, as far as I recollect—I consider that to be a delusion—I mean that I consider him to have been insane when he committed the act, not when he told me about the voices; his telling me so, partly led me to that opinion; but I take into consideration all the circumstances which I hear of him; his suffering from scrofula, and his father being decidedly insane, at the last part of his life; and the evidence I have heard; I come to the conclusion that he was partially insane when he did the act—my opinion, independent of anything I have heard about him since last Saturday, is, that he is a scrofulous boy; and I consider, from his shrieking out in the night, that the brain was certainly in a diseased state—as a medical man, I have no hesitation in saying so—I agree with Mr. Latheby, that the walking, and calling out in the sleep, may have been occasioned by an overloaded stomach—I have not seen him since last autumn—I think he may have been partially insane at the time he did it; and I think he is at this moment; and I think he is liable to become more insane, and probably will—nothing has passed since Saturday to leas me to that opinion—his skin was unhealthy in appearance; and he told me that he was often complaining of dreadful headaches; and I believed it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a Doctor of medicine at Clapton. In March, April, and May the prisoner was brought to me by his mother—he was suffering from indigestion and scrofula—he paid me six or seven visits of about a quarter of an hour each, during those three moths—he was suffer<lb/>ing from scrofula in a very marked degree—I have heard that his father died mad, and that the prisoner is in the habit of walking and shouting out in his sleep; and he has told me at his visits that he has heard voices in his head telling him to do things: from all those circumstances, and from my know<lb/>ledge of his constitution, I do not believe him to have been in a sane state of mind at the time this occurred—that opinion did not occur to me, to the same extent, previous to this matter, but to a certain degree it did—I entertained an opinion that he was very peculiar in the formation of his mind—there was a peculiarity and eccentricity about him which arrested my attention when he consulted me—the stated of his mind struck me—I have not had more than the ordinary knowledge of insane people, which would occur to a general practitioner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean that you consider him permanently insane, or liable to occasional derangement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is that it is the early stage of insanity, implicating the moral sentiments, the sense of right and wrong, and not as yet having reached the intellect in any market degree, or interfering with his judgment of right and wrong—I did express any opinion of that sort, not to that extent, until he was charged with this murder—I consider him in the ordinary initiatory stage of insanity—I have not had knowledge of his conduct, or of the particulars of his life, until very recently, so as to form a notion of how long that has existed—it is now in an early stage, and has not gone to a length to weaken the intellect in any marked degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by a marked degree, has it gone to a length to injure the intellect, so as not to know that he was poisoning a person when he did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might know it as a principle of hearsay, but not as a con<lb/>trolling principle of his mind—I think he would understand that he was poisoning his grandfather, if explained to him, but at the time the sense of right and wrong was not acting with sufficient power to control him—I mean a morbid state of the moral feeling, of the sense of right and wrong—I think he knew what the act was that he was doing, but that he did not feel it as being wrong—I am speaking of moral feeling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would consider a pick-pocket had not got much moral feeling, but do you consider when he did this that he did not know that poisoning his grandfather was a wrong act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not prepared to answer; I think he has not the moral sense of wrong distinguished from right, or right distinguished from wrong, to give him a moral sense of feeling; that it was an irresistible impulse on his part—I draw that conclusion from his having perpetrated this act without hesitation, or struggle of mind, or remorse, or compunction, and without any sensible object; and also another circumstance which I have heard, leads me to believe his conscience is diseased, that he could not fell it as an influential agent to distinguish between right and wrong, although his intellect leads him to understand what others tell him.</p>

I was without money, having been out of a situation since March—I knew the prisoner four years or more previous to his being in the Post-office—I did not know his name—I knew him first at Clapham; he was then a gardener—be only knew my Christian name—on Wednesday evening, 10th Nov., after eight o'clock, I met him in the General Post-office, when he left off duty—I went according to his appointment—he had told me that as I was in bad circumstances, if he had a few shillings to lend me he would do so—I made an appointment to meet him next day at the George and Gate, Gracechurch-street—he did not come—I afterwards met him at the Four Swans, Bishopsgate-street, not by appointment, but I knew he would be there, and went at a little before five, and met him—he then told me the reason he did not keep his appointment in the morning was on account of illness, that he had borrowed the money of a man in the Post-office; he did not say his name—he pulled his purse out and showed me the note—he said he had not been able to get it changed—he did not give it into my hands then—I did not see it open then—it was very dirty—it was a country note—he did not say what note it was, or the amount—he was then going to the Post-office to go on duty, and said when he got there he should plead illness, get off duty very early, and return to me at the George and Gate as soon as he could—I went there, but he did not come—next day, about a quarter to three, I met him accidentally, very near the George and Gate, and asked him why he failed in keeping his appointment the night before, and the reason he deceiver me so—he said he could not get off duty as he anticipated, and directly he did he proceeded home, he was so unwell—I afterwards went with him into the street—he asked me which way I was going, and asked me to walk with him—we went to the Flowerpot, in Bishopsgate-street—he then said, "I have not been able to get change for this note, as it is a country note"—he pulled out a green silk purse and pro<lb/>duced the note—I opened it, according to his wish—it was a Wisbeach and Lincolnshire Band-note—I have no doubt of this being it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from its general appearance, and it is very dirty, and the writing and all corre<lb/>sponds—it appears to be the same—I did not observe anything on the back of it—I had it in my hands, and gave it into the prisoner's hands, and he gave it me back, and told me to take the purse and note and get it changed for him—it was a green silk purse, with steel beads and slides—I said the bank</p>

Bank of England note for it, which I changed with Mr. Nutt, the landlord of the George and Gate, for nine sovereigns and two half-sovereigns to the best of my recollection—about ten minutes past three I went to the four Swans, where the prisoner was to wait till I came back with the change—I found him there, put the gold into the purse and gave it him—I told him I had got a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note at Barclay's, and had changed it at Mr. Nutt's—he seemed perfectly satisfied, and said, "On considering it over in my mind I can spare you half a sovereign, and you must return it me as soon as you get into a situation—I stopped with him till five o'clock, till the mail cart came for him—I gave him all the money, and he returned me half a sovereign—that was on Friday, 12th—on that day week I saw Peak, the officer, told him something; and on the same day, between five and six o'clock, I was brought before the prisoner in the presence of Peak and Mr. Peacock, the solicitor, and one or two others—I stated the whole of the particular of my meeting him, and hid giving me the note; on the Friday previous, about the middle of the day, not recollecting the exact time; the prisoner directly said, "You know better then that, it was three o'clock"—it was about three o'clock—when asked if he knew me, he said, "I know him very well, but I do not know his name."</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon and general practitioner, in Abingdon-street, Westminster. I had known the deceased, John Bell-chambers,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184712130071"/>
               <p>for about twenty-five years—I last saw him alive about a quarter to seven o'clock on Monday morning, 11th Oct.—I had been sent for—he lived at 44, Wilton-street, Westminster—I found him in bed in a state of insensibility—he had two black eyes, and a cut on the right side of the fore-head, just above the brow, a graze on the right cheek, and a small cut on the left cheek—I applied lotions to the wounds, and did what I considered necessary for him—I then left him—I returned again at eleven o'clock, and found him much in the same state, still perfectly insensible—I saw him again at four o'clock, and bled him at the arm first, and then ordered him to be cupped—he was attacked with convulsions, at intervals of about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, or sometimes longer—I continued to attend him until he died, which was on the following Sunday evening, the 17th, at about nine o'clock—I just got into the house as he died—I saw him after he was dead—I thought it right to call in to my assistance my son, who is surgeon of Westminster Hospital, as he was more acquainted with these cases than I am, I being a private practitioner, and, in conjunction with him, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of the deceased's person—in my judgment the cause of death was injury done to the brain, in consequence of a fracture of the skull—the fracture went through the frontal bone, and extended right across the upper part of the orbits—it was directly over the right eye-brow; not exactly in the front, but more towards the corner—it was a perpendicular cur, and then took a lateral direction over the plate of the upper organ—the fracture perfectly corresponded with the cut under the right temple—I attribute that injury to violence certainly—I should hardly think it possible, from the position of the cut, that it could have been caused by a fall—if the deceased had been struck on the head with such an instru<lb/>ment as this bolt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it might have produced such an injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the injuries you found on the person of the deceased such as could have been the result of one blow, or must there have been more? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think there must have been at any rate one for the cut, and one for the blow on the eye—the other injuries about his person were not material—the fracture was downwards, and across the base of the skull, making almost two sides of a triangle, but they would not be equal in length.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You think there were two blows given? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, from the appearance of the left eye, that he must have been struck, because it was a very slight cut, as if he had received a blow with a fist—there certainly were not two blows with the same instru<lb/>ment—I knew him well—he was a stout man, about five feet six inches, I should think; not a big man—I do not know that he was bigger than I am, and a very little stouter—the wound was a clean cut, not as if done with a life-preserver, or any blunt round instrument—this bold is precisely such a one as would produce it—this is not a sharp instrument, but it would come down at once on the single edge—it must have been a blow struck downwards, as if you struck a blow with a ruler—it would not be the point of a circle that would come on the forehead—if I was to strike in this way I should make a straight cut down—it would certainly be a portion of a circle that would come in contact with the body—the wound was so high up on the forehead that he could not, in my opinion, have received that cut, and consequently a frac<lb/>ture by a fall—I think, in consequence of the cheek being grazed, he must have come with his head in that way—the grazing of the cheek itself would raise a presumption that it might be the result of a fall—sup<lb/>posing that he stumbled for a yard or two, and fell with his head upon a high</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184712130072"/>
               <p>kerb-stone, I do not think that would account for it—I do not think it would be morally possible that a man's falling on his cheek, and grazing his cheek, would inflict a would above his eye—I know the spot perfectly well; it is a high kerb, but not very high; it is not six inches high—I went by it this morning—I did not measure it, but I should say, by my eye, that it certainly was not six inches—it is at the corner of Kensington-place where the deceased fell, and where the blood lay—I look particular notice of it as I came here—I do not think there is a gradual descent towards the kerb where he was found—there is no descent in the street of five or ten yards, before you come to the spot where he was found—I should think, from the spot which was pointed out to me, and where I saw the blood next day, that he must have fallen off the pavement on to the stones, instead of falling against the kerb—there is no descent in the street, I think it is quite flat—it is a very narrow street, with the kerb-stone flat—there is a grating not six inches form the kerb where he was found, for the purpose of carrying away the water—there is not a small channel running down there, nor any channel at all; it is all flush—the grating is close up to the kerb—the street is not very rough there—I took particular notice of it this morning—I should certainly say there are not stones projecting two or three inches over—it is as flat a paved street as any I know in London—there are no stones sticking up about there—I will swear that—there was no water when I came up this morning—I did not pass it yesterday, but I did the day before—I am in the habit of passing it every day of my life—the kerb is about six inches above the road paving.</p>

                  </hi> I am the son of the last witness, and one of the assistant-surgeons at Westminster Hospital—I assisted my father in his <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body of the deceased—I have been in Court, and have heard to what he has attributed the death—I concur in that opinion, that he died from the effect of concussion and irritation of the brain, produced by the fracture of the skull, as he has described—I should think that the injury over the right eye, to which the fracture was traceable, was occasioned by external violence, and not by a fall—this iron bolt would be likely to produce such an injury if used against his person—in my opinion the position of the wound was too high to be ordinarily received by a fall—there was no abrasion of the skin, merely as wound—if a fall had occasioned it, I should have expected to find abrasion of the skin besides—it appeared to be a cleaner wound than would have been the result of a fall, as if some smaller instru<lb/>ment had been applied, producing the injury, than falling flat on a surface.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the length of the cut? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From half to three-quarters of an inch—it was such a wound as would be produced by a blunt instrument of a small calibre—it was what we term a clean cut produced by a blunt instrument—supposing a man to have struck his head against a sharp kerb-stone of the caliber of this instrument, of course it would produce the same kind of wound that might have been produced by this instrument—there was a cut on one side of the eye and an abrasion on the other—there was an abrasion on the cheek.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not quite understand what you mean by saying that the edge of the kerb might produce a similar cut. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you can imagine one surface of this bolt to represent the edge of the kerb-stone, of course any person falling with that particular part of his forehead against the edge of the kerb would produce such a wound as was produced by this instrument, except that probably the edge of the kerb-stone might inflict a wound of rather a</p>

               <p>sharper kind than this instrument—this has no sharp edge—if it was described as an incised wound, I should imagine it would come nearer the character of a wound inflicted by the kerb-stone than by this bolt—if it was produced by the end of this instrument, I should imagine it would produce a wound of a more jagged character than that which was produced.</p>

                  </hi> I am carter to Mr. Weeks, as ginger-beer manufac<lb/>turer, and live at the King's Head public-house, Orchard-street, West<lb/>minister. Mr. Beese manages that house for his brother—I was there at two o'clock in the morning of Monday, 11th Oct—I knew the deceased, Mr. Bellchambers—he was there that morning—I was serving behind the bar, and saw him come in—Mr. Beese was behind the bar—when Mr. Bellcham<lb/>bers came in he went in front of the bar, and offered Mr. Beese a pinch of snuff from a silver snuff-box—there were other persons in the house at the time, two of the prisoners, M'Coy and Sale, were standing by the beer<lb/>engine in front of the bar, not far from Mr. Bellchambers—Mr. Beese invited Mr. Bellchambers to come behind the bar—he did so—he told him that he thought there was some bad company, some bad parties, in front of the bar, and advised him to come in behind out of the company—I should say that was said loud enough for Sale and M'Coy and the people in front of the bar to hear—Sale said to me, "Do you know that old gentleman that is going behind the bar?"—I said, "Yes"—Sale said he should like to have what the old gentleman had got in his hand—Sale and M'Coy were in company together—M'Coy did not say anything—the old gentleman bad the snuff-box in his hand, and a sort of yellow cash-bag, from which he paid for what he had—M'Coy said, "I will not do anything for the sake of hurting the house, as you know the old gentleman"—Sale was with him at the time he said that—M'Coy and Sale were drinking ale together, which some sailor was treating them to—about three-quarters of an hour after Mr. Bellechambers had come in, Doyle came in—Mr. Belchambers was then behind the bar—M'Coy and Sale were in front—there were several people with Doyle, but none of the prisoners except Sale and M'Coy—I noticed Davis come in about three o'clock, or half-past, dressed very decently with a plaid shawl on—he called for six penny<lb/>worth of brandy and water—that was about half an hour after Doyle had come in—Doyle spoke to Davis, but not to any of the others that I saw—I do not know whether he took any of Davis's brandy and water—Doyle and a woman were quarrelling together—Doyle struck her, and there was a <hi rend="italic">bother</hi>, and Davis attempted to get behind the bar, which I and Mr. Beese refused, and said, "We do not allow strangers behind the bar"—Mr. Beese went to turn the woman out, and Davis forced himself behind me and went behind the bar to speak to Mr. Bellchambers—he did speak to him—Mr. Beese, on that, made a communication to me, in consequence of which I kept my eye on the parties—Davis said, "How do you do, Mr. Bellchambers?"—Mr. Bellchambers seemed to know him, and said, "I have lent this man a shil<lb/>ling, and I have lent him many a one, and I have lent him one now"—he asked Davis what he would take to drink—Davis said he would take a little drop of brandy and water—we had no brandy up, so we wee obliged to make sixpenny-worth of shrub and water—a few minutes after that Davis went from behind the bar, and went out with M'Coy, Sale, Doyle, and others—they all four returned in about five minutes—Davis went behind the bar again, and Sale and M'Coy stopped in front of the bar and called for a pot of sixpenny ale—Davis went and spoke to Mr. Bellchambers again—they seemed to know one another very well indeed—after Davis had been in there</p>

               <p>do not"—he then asked me for a pen and ink—I got it and he wrote on the back of one of our cards—Wilton-street is half or three-quarters of a mile from the King's Head—you pass New Pye-street, to get to it—it comes out at the same corner as Kensington-place—it makes one side, and Kensington<lb/>place runs into it—if I was going the nearest way there from the King's Head, I should pass the end of New Pye-street, up Orchard-street, along by Strutton-ground, and the Horseferry-road.</p>

               <p>after, and I turned them all out except Davis—I had not given him permission to come inside the bar—I told him I did not allow strangers inside there—when I came back from turning Doyle and the woman out, he was inside the bar with a glass of something to drink in his hand—he was not talking to Mr. Bellchambers then—they appeared to know each other—Mr. Bell<lb/>chambers told me that he knew him—Mr. Bellchambers stayed till about twenty minutes past five—Davis went away about a quarter of an hour after the others—Mr. Bellchambers took out his watch while inside the bar, before he went, and I saw that it was twenty minutes past five by his watch—as he was going away I told him to put the seals inside his pocket—I put them in his hand, and he buttoned up his pocket—I had told him to stop till the other people were gone—I had a reason for doing so—he was quite capable of taking care of himself—when he left he had his hat with him—he went out of the door sideways—I followed him out, and stood on the step and saw him go down the street—there are two steps out of my house—I saw him go down those steps, and he turned down Strutton-ground—he had to go past Pye-street—that would be the right direction towards his house in Wilton-street—it was then getting light—I observed him for about 100 or 150 yards, nearly to the top of the street—he walked very well indeed—I should think Wilton-street is about half or three-quarters of a mile from our house—Kensington-place would be in his direct way home.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Richard Tuck, and keep No. 15, in Union-court, Orchard-street, which I let in furnished rooms. Before and up to 11th Oct., Sale and his wife took a room of me—I recollect hearing of Mr. Bellchambers' murder—I saw Sale on the afternoon of Tuesday, 12th—I did not see him after that before he was taken into custody—he did not give me notice that he was going—his wife went on the following Saturday—I had given her notice—they occupied the front parlour on the ground-floor—the shutters there are secured with an inside bolt—that bolt had lost the knob—the bolt produced resembles the bolt belonging to that shutter—I did not miss that bolt till the night Sale's wife left—it was their duty to fasten the shutters while they occupied the room—I had nothing to do with it then—when they came to lodge there, six weeks before, it was quite safe—I never was in the room but twice after they came there—no complaint was made about the shutter not being bolted—Sale did not complain to me about the loss of the bolt—I knew it was missing, but did not hear anything of it till Mr. Taylor produced it to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the bolt within reach of any person passing along the court, as it was a shutter that fastened outside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not very well, they go up two steps to the room—the house is rather high, and the window is high—the shutters fastened with two bolts, one went up and the other dropped down—a bolt is put through the shutter on the outside, and fastened with a cross-bolt inside—it was not fastened from the outside—the bolt was visible in the day-time, it was left in the shutter, which was turned back—I do not know whether it was usually kept attached to the shutter—I do not recollect seeing it after Sale took possession—it was on the chimney-piece when he took the room, and I told him there was the bolt—on account of its having lost a knob it was not very easy to keep it in the shutter.</p>

Sir,—I write these few lines to you, which I think myself justified by turning Queen's evidence in the case of Mr. Bellchambers, so that the guilty persons should be brought to justice, and the innocent have their liberty. About half-past five, on Monday morning, 11th Oct., Mr. Bell<lb/>chambers came out of the King's Head, in Orchard-street, and went up Orchard-street towards Strutton-ground. Me Bellchambers down Strutton-ground, down the Horseferry-road, down Regent-street as far as Kensington-place. When he had turned the corner at the bottom of Kensington-place, I asked him what o'clock it was; he answered twenty minutes to six; when I stole the watch from him and ran up Kensington-place. He hollowed after me, 'Stop the b----.' The two persons that were with me were behind me when I stole the watch. I had not run more than twelve yards when I heard a blow and then a fall, one after the other. I ran home to Sale's place, at Union-court, with the watch. I was there about five or six minutes when Sale and Lloyd came in. Sale said he had hit him on the forehead with a bolt, and knocked him down. Lloyd said he had brought his hat with him, which he had on his head when he came to Sale's place. Thomas Sale, John Lloyd, and myself. Lloyd is well known to the police; he is a short lad; he wears the hat of Mr. Bellchambers, a blue jacket, with anchors on the buttons, cor<lb/>duroy trowsers, and low shoes. He is somewhere over the water by the New Cut. Thomas Doyle is innocent. Your unfortunate prisoner, George M'Coy. Sir, will you please, when I come up to the office on next Thurs<lb/>day, to keep me from Thomas Sale."</p>

                  </hi> I live with my father, at the Queen Bess. On Saturday night, 27th Nov., I put a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence, into this work-box, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock—the prisoners had left the house before then—I put the box close under the window in the bar—I say the officer on Sunday morning, and described the money to him before he showed it to me—when he showed it to me, the same date and reign was no it as was on the money I had seen in the box before—I had a medal similar to this one—I had seen it in the box, a fortnight before the robbery—the half<lb/>crown and shilling were George the Third's; and the sixpence was a Victoria.</p>

                  </hi> My husband is a baker, on Clerkenwell-green. On Thursday, 11th Nov., the prisoner came and asked for a penny loaf—he gave me a good half-crown—I put it into the till—I gave him two good shillings, and was going to give him fivepence in halfpence—he put his hand into his pocket, and said, "I beg your pardon; I find I have a penny in my pocket I did not know of"—he put down two shillings—I took the penny up, and gave him the half-crown—as soon as he was gone, I found one of the shil<lb/>lings was bad—I called after him—whether he did not hear, or did not wish to come back, I do not know, but he did not come—I went about five doors after him, took him by the collar, and brought him back—I said, "You have changed one of my good shillings, and given me a bad one; you must come back with me"—he said, "I gave you a good half-crown"—he repeated that several times—I said, "Yes, and I gave you two good shillings, and you have changed one, and given me a bad one"—he said, "Any person might make a mistake"—I sent for a constable and gave him into custody—I gave the constable the bad shillings—the prisoner was remanded till Saturday, and then discharged.</p>

               <p>where my sister was—I thought my sister had the best right to take care of it—it was my mother's shawl—it was in her bed-room—there were strange people in the place, and I thought it was best for my sister to have charge of it as strangers might take advantage—my brother took it away from me—not by force—I let him have it quietly—I created no noise whatever—I went to give it in charge to my sister, and he took it from me—on the Wednesday before the funeral I did take an old pair of my brother's trowsers—I took them out of destitution; I was starving at the time—I sold them for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my brother would not give me any food—I do not know the person's name where I sold them—it was in Wells-street—I do not know that my brother pawned his coat to get money for brandy-and-water for my mother—he had no occasion to do it—he had got money forthcoming without doing that, one would suppose—he went out, but I do know that he took his coat, or that he came back without it—he did not give me any money for brandy—my sister was paying for the brandy for my mother—he once gave my daughter two half-crowns to pay a tailor's bill for mending clothes—that was after my mother was taken bad, but before she was in a dying state—I did not take half-a-crown from my daughter and spend it in drink—I asked my brother for money, before he went out in the morning, for my mother—he said, "I will give nothing more; I have only done too much"—he had money at the time, and there was money in the place—he gave the two half-crowns into my daughter's charge to take care of for some purpose—my sister would have one of them—she was confined to her bed, and said she had a right to one for his ill-usage—I did take one from my daughter, and gave my poor mother part of it—she was in a stupor in bed, but then I brought something in for her; at least I brought in some of the money to send out for a little brandy for her—I was not constantly sending out for a little brandy—I sent out for a quartern—when I took the half<lb/>crown from my daughter, I gave my mother some of it—I took a little—this was at the time when my mother was confined to her bed insensible and in a stupor—I gave her half a wine-glass of it—I kept the rest, and gave it to her when she seemed to require it, at different times in the day—I did take some of it, but did not bring it in with the intention of drinking it all myself—whenever I had it in my power to get any she had a little, as I thought she was so bad—my sister used to have a little; she was very bad too—the rest of the half-crown was kept till the next day, and was then spent for a little brandy on account of my mother's being so bad—the doctor ordered her not to be without it, and she had it not in her power to get any, as she had no money at that time—my mother rallied a little between the sickness—when the sickness left her she was in the same stupor again—she was always in a stu<lb/>por, except when the sickness came, during the whole eight or nine days—I believe my sister partook of a little of the second quartern of brandy, but she had got a half-crown herself which she had taken from my brother—she sent out for what she like—I think it was half-a-quartern of wine—she sent out for any little thing she wanted—my poor mother was in a destitute state, dying, I may say, for want—the doctor ordered what we had no power to give her—I think it was on the Saturday that the two half-crowns were given to my child, the day before my poor mother was taken so bad—if my sister has sworn that my mother was in her usual health the day before she was taken ill, but was rather feeble, that is true—I did not say I sent for brandy for her the first day she was taken bad—I am sure it was on the Saturday, the day before she was taken ill, that I took the half-crown from the child—it is</p>

               <p>true that after having bought the brandy, one shilling was saved till the next day, and one shilling's worth of brandy was sent for, which I gave to my poor mother, and had some myself, and my sister, who was in bed, had the rest—my mother was ailing; but the first time she was taken so seriously bad was on Sunday morning—my sister sent out her half-crown on the same day for wine—on this night my brother came home—my sister had been previously almost killed by my brother, and she had had leeches on only on the Saturday night—he came in, and almost knocked the partition in, and frightened us all very much—if he had got into the room, I do not know what would have become of us—my poor sister was very much terrified that night, and sent for a little wine—that was after the five shillings had been taken from my child—we did not sent out for brandy every night from the time my mother was taken ill till she died, we did some part of the time, the doctor ordered it—I solemnly declare I did not take any drink while I was waiting on her—I take my oath I was not lying drunk on one of the chairs in the room in which my mother was dying, nor yet in the outer room—I was not drunk—I was not lying on a chair in either of the rooms the night my mother was dying—I know that on one occasion they told me I did come in, but I was so frantic they did not wish me to be in—I believe I did go in, although I had no knowledge of it—they would not let me remain in, as I was so frantic—I was not lying asleep on one of the chairs before my mother died, or before I went out, or at all that day—I was in attendance when the last offices were per<lb/>formed for my mother before she was put into her coffin—I do not know that my brother pawned his clothes for the purpose of raising money to purchase linen to wrap her in—the woman who performed the last offices for my mother did not find her in a filthy, dirty state, without a rag on her—she was not left so—the poor dear soul was washed all over, according to Doctor Hacon's orders, the day he gave her over, the day before she died—that was not altogether because she was in a filthy state—he was afraid of the disorder, that something had taken place, I don't know what they term it; but it was no such thing; it was not found to be the case—she did not die without linen on her, I am certain—my sister sent for some linen herself on the day before she was so bad, the day before she died, through the disorder she had—I believe she paid for it—she had two pounds sent her from a friend where she lived, who respected her—I do not know anything about my brother pawning his clothes to get linen—I do not know Mrs. Mills—I have only seen her once—I was not present at the time my mother died; my sis<lb/>ter was, and my little girl—I could not stop to see her last moments—I had gone through too much sorrow—that was the only reason I went out, as the Almighty is my Judge.</p>

               <p>thick fluid, which had come from the stomach itself, the gullet, the intestines, and about 1/2lb. of liver—I could not form any idea what proportion of the liver that was, as I did not see this liver—I heard it was a large one—the weight of an ordinary liver is about 4lbs.—I applied tests to cach of these parts separately to detect poison, and I detected the presence of arsenic in the intestines, and also in the liver—I produce portions of the arsenic reproduced from the intestines and liver—the other portions have been submitted to an analysis to prove that they were arsenic—I did not weigh the quantity I got from the liver, but, in my opinion, there was about two grains in that portion of the liver which I had, and about four grains in the intestines—the contents of the stomach did not contain any poison—the quantity I found would be quite sufficient to cause death—there is not more than half a grain in the tubes I have produced—the quantity I found in the liver was so large as to induce me to believe that it had been administered in successive portions—arsenic is absorbed into the system, taken up by the blood—one of the functions of the liver is to arrest anything offensive in the stomach, which is passing through by means of the blood—the portion of the liver I had might be about one-tenth part of the whole, and it is but reason<lb/>able to infer that the whole liver contained a similar quantity, which would be twenty grains in the whole liver—that would be enough to kill five persons, or nearly so—if such a quantity had been administered at once, it would cause immediate vomiting, and it would be thrown from the stomach, and we should not then find that quantity in the liver—I believe it was given in successive does, and found its way quietly into the system—if it was taken all at once, and retained in the stomach, rapid death would be the con<lb/>sequence—I believe, from the circumstance of my finding arsenic in the be<lb/>ginning of the intestinal canal, that there had been a does very recently administered—I think the whole I found in the intestines had been recently administered—I did not weigh it, but I take it that about six grains was the quantity I detected in the intestines and liver together—I think four grains administered at once would produce death—I have been in Court during the examination of the medical gentlemen, and have heard that this was con<lb/>sidered a case of cholera—the medicines administered would have a tendency to retard the effects of arsenic—lime is an antidote, and opium would tend to stay the action of the poison to a certain extent—it would tend to stay the irri<lb/>tation that arsenic produces, and it might, in all probability, be passed through the system without any effect—carbonate of soda, I should say, would rather tend to make arsenic more soluble, and enable it to go into the system—if arsenic alone were thrown into a fire it would produce no immediate effect, but if wrapped up in a piece of paper, the flame would be bluish.</p>

Turner and the prisoners came in—Turner appeared half drunk, the prisoners were very nearly sober—they asked me to shave Turner—I was engaged, and said I would in a few minutes—Turner sat down, and fell asleep—Grimes sat near him, and seemed asleep too—Collins was on the other side of the shop, reading a newspaper—I was obliged to go up stairs for hot water—I was away about three minutes—when I came back I told Grimes to wake Turner up—he said, "Let him sleep, it will do him good"—I made them wake him up—they</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Richard Young, of Clapham. On Thurs<lb/>day, 25th Nov., about a quarter to one o'clock in the day, I was in a street near Brick-lane—I had a bag in my hand—the string was twisted three times very tightly round my wrist, and the bag was tight in my hand—there were two purses in it—one was empty, and the other had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, four sovereigns, and between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in it—the prisoner came up to me, and wrenched the bag out of my hand—I am sure he is the man—I held it very tight—he tore it from me and hurt my hand—I ran after him, and called "stop thief!"—he ran down a street—I got very near him—he turned round twice and looked at me, and then went up some steps into a house—I saw no more of him—the reticule was mine, and the money my husband's—I did not follow him into the house, because such a mob came round me—I was very much frightened and alarmed.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bell-hanger. At this time I lived in Redman-row, Stepney—on 25th Nov., about one o'clock, I was standing in Thrall-street, about one door out of Brick-lane—it runs into Brick-lane—there were two girls of the town standing so as to eclipse Mrs. Young, but I saw her hands and arms and her bag—the prisoner came across the road—I saw him stoop, snatch the bag, run down Thrall-street, and put it into his hat—Mrs. Young ran so fast that I thought it was one of his <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>, one of the girls, till I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—when I got half-way down, the same two girls began to knock me about the face and head, and some men too, and I did not pursue him—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—I picked him out of the cell from twelve or fourteen others—he was in a different dress.</p>

                  </hi> I am a gardener, at 15, Thurlow-square, Brompton. On the 4th Nov. last I was at the Admiral Keppel public-house in the Fulham-road—the prisoner and deceased were there—the deceased was quarrelling with every one, and was very much in liquor—he was wrangling and quarrelling with Spicer—he called him a cur, and said he was no man—he then quarrelled with the witness Cook, and wanted to fight him—Cook said he would do no such thing—Birch got up and swore he should fight either up or down, and struck him, knocked him down, and dropped down on him—Cook had a file on the table, and said, "If you offer to hit me I will strike you with this file," upon that Birch fixed him in the throat, and held him down till he was black in the face; at the same time taking the file out of Cook's hand he stabbed at him with it two or three times, and struck him in the eye with the handle of it—I got up and snatched it out of Birch's hand—he still hold Cook by the throat—Spicer got up, took up the tongs, and struck him with them on the lions, and right up the back—it was a very heavy blow, with the top part of the tongs—I said to him, "For God's sake, do not strike the man like that"—he repeated the blow; Birch at the same time rose his head and received the blow on his head—he went out of the room bleeding—I saw him about ten days after—he appeared better then.</p>

                  </hi> I keep an eating-house, in Lisson-street, Mary<lb/>lebone. On Tuesday evening, 7th Dec., between five and seven o'clock, I was in the bar parlour of the Broad Arrow public-house, Milton-street—the prisoners were in and out all the evening—I do not know whether they were both in the room together—I had two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, in my purse; which I pulled out about six o'clock from my right trowsers pocket, and put them into my left hand—I was going to give them to Mr. Cooper, who was going to take possession of the house that evening—the broker pressed me to put the notes into my pocket again—I put them into the purse, but the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note clung to my fingers, and I sup<lb/>pose I must have dropped it—I put the purse into my pocket, buttoned it up, and did not look at it again that evening—at eight o'clock next morning, I missed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 76058, dated Oct. 11th—the purse and the other notes were all safe—I staid in and about the public-house about two hours after I took the notes out—I was in the neighbourhood till eleven o'clock—I</p>

                  </hi> I am a refiner, at Wilderness-row, Clerkenwell. On 26th Aug., between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, Bowman came to my shop, and said he had come to sell some silver and gold for his master, Mr. Anderson, of 8, Hatton-garden—he produced spoons, forks, and fork handles, about eight or nine pieces, and a gold case, wrapped up in a hand<lb/>kerchief—I said it was pity his employer had broken it up in that manner—he said he wanted to make up a certain sum, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—I weighed the articles, gave him an invoice with the weight and amount, and told him to send his master—I immediately sent one of my workmen to 8, Hatton-garden, who returned again in about twenty minutes—in about three quarters of an hour. Bowman returned with a person who I believe was Townsend, but I am not quite sure—he said his master had given him a good <hi rend="italic">blowing up</hi> for not bringing the cash—the other assumed the name of Anderson—I asked if that was Mr. Anderson—he said his name was Anderson—he brought the</p>

On Thursday evening, 2nd Dec., about half-past eight o'clock, I heard a cry of, "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running in Denmark street, about three minutes' walk from the Swedish Flag—he had nothing in his hand—I stopped him, and asked what was the matter—he said they wanted to stab him with a knife—several per<lb/>sons came up and said he had stolen a jacket—I took him to the station—the prosecutor and Brown came there, and charged him with stealing it—I have not seen the jacket since—I have searched at the pawnbrokers.'</p>

                  </hi> I am a soldier. On 18th Oct.
