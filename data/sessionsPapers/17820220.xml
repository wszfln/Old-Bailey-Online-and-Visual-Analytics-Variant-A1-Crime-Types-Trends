               <p>I am a butcher; I live in Whitechapel-road; I had been to Acton with some meat in a little cart, and coming by Tyburn turnpike there were two men came galloping by as fast as they possibly could come, towards Acton that road; I said to a little boy, I am afraid of mischief, we shall never be able to get away; one of them rode against the shafts of the cart with his horse, broke both shafts, threw his horse down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200005"/> and throwed the rider I believe five or six yards; he called out for help, the people came out from the Swan and took him in, the Swan at Bayswater, and they took the prisoner in; when he had been in a little while, he begged to go out to ease himself, he was much hurt and stunned with the fall; I went in then, and enquired for the prisoner, they said he was gone out, as a man came in and talked of the robbery, I and three more went after him up the hill, he was going along, he had got up beyond Bayswater; when he came back, he would have paid me for the damage done my cart, I would not take it, as there was a report of a person being robbed; it then wanted about a quarter to six when he was brought back again; then we took him to Morant's in Park-lane; I did not know Mr. Morant, a person here said he heard it was Morant that was robbed, it was very near Bayswater he was robbed, he might come in two or three minutes to me; we all brought him to Bow-street office.</p>
               <p>Court to Morant. You said, between Bayswater and Tyburn turnpike? - Yes; I was coming from Beconsfield.</p>
               <p>Briggs. I was coming from Acton.</p>
               <p>From Jury. Did you see their faces? - No.</p>
               <p>Hepburn. I was at Bayswater, I and my man went out, I heard a terrible crack like a gun, I picked up the gentleman at the bar, he was stunned with the fall, I had him into the house by the arm, he begged as soon as he could speak, to go out to ease himself, I said to my man, don't let him come to any hurt, I put him in care of my man.</p>
               <p>Briggs. He was searched at Bayswater, when I took him there were no arms about him.</p>

               <p>I know no farther than my master gave me charge of him, lest he should come to other harm; I said you will get into a ditch, he said I want to ease myself, I withdrew, he walked a good way up the road.</p>

               <p>I had been in town for my master, Mr. Dawson, the wax chandler, Craven-hill; as I was going along, I saw these two men on horseback order the post boy to stop; about half way between Tyburn turnpike and Bayswater, about just dark then, they bid the post boy stop; the gentleman in the chaise bid him go on, and then they went close to him and stopt him, at the time of the robbery I heard somebody talk, I was on foot; I stopped a few minutes, I made a little way to the people talking, and told them there was a chaise stopt; before we got up to the chaise, the gentleman was robbed, these people were on foot; as soon as they had robbed the gentleman, they turned back, and went as swift as the horses could go towards Acton; when they passed by me, one said to the other, damn your eyes mind your fire. I was going home to my master's, just by Bayswater; it was not light enough, I could see partly the colour of the horses, they went so swift I could see nothing farther, I think they were of a bay colour; I was not five minutes before I got to Bayswater; when I came opposite the public house, I saw a light in the road, and the landlord and three or four people were standing round the horse that was thrown down, he was not quite dead, but he never got up any more, I could not see how the horse was hurt; they were talking of the force he came down with, I said that is the horse of one of the persons that robbed the gentleman on top of the hill; there was no other horse passed me at the time, I am sure of that; there is a house betwixt, but no other horse passed backward or forward; I mentioned it to the landlord of the public house, she said let us go and fetch him back, they had let him go off, I did not go up, but the landlord and Mr. Evans went up and fetched him back, I went with them to Mr. Morant's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What colour was the horse that was hurt by running against the cart? - A darkish bay; I told Mr. Morant what I have told in Court, and I told the Justice the same.</p>

               <p>Cross-Examination of Houblon.</p>
               <p>I have sold many cases of that sort and description; I judge of it by the maker's name; the watch was almost new, not made six months.</p>
               <p>It is impossible you can tell the case without some private mark? - It is the case of my making up, I am positive it is what I sold the Baron; I know it from being a larger pattern than common, like a mock repeater, a large hole; it was like a mock repeater, a large hole to wind it up.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear that is the case you sold to the Baron? - Yes; I am positive of it.</p>

               <p>Did you examine the whole of the body? - I examined the whole, I examined the head to see if there was any contusion, there was not; there was another gentleman dropped in belonging to St. Thomas's Hospital; there were no marks of violence at all on the body, that person will confirm the same I believe, if called.</p>
               <p>You cannot say what was the cause of his death? - I cannot form any idea of what was the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Did you open the head? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you examine his neck? - I examined his neck, and round his chest and side; I examined about his neck very particularly.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks there? - There were no marks at all, as I saw.</p>
               <p>Did you open him? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Court. If a man dies by being strangled, whether with a silk handkerchief or cord, or any thing else, would it not affect his countenance? - I should think so.</p>
               <p>Was this man's face at all affected? - Not at all in the least; he had a very pleasing countenance.</p>
               <p>Was it black? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>In your judgment could a man be strangled with any thing, without having some effect upon his face? - I should think not.</p>
               <p>Court. Would that blackness of the countenance appear immediately after the death of the person, or does it require any space of time before it appears? - I should conceive it would appear instantaneously.</p>

It is a coach yard, Davis is a coach master; at the bottom of his yard is a pond not so large as this room, but the inside square of the court about four feet deep, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was it four feet deep towards the edge? It was deepest at the farther end; as I was watering my horses I saw a bit of checque swimming upon the water, as I stood on the side of the pond, I put in a stick and pulled it to me; as I was pulling the checque towards me I saw the woman's hand rise out of the water; I saw a ring upon her finger; I went to the stable and called

               <p>I Know the prisoner at the bar, and I knew his wife very well; on the 5th of February I was called upon to go to the pond side; our stable is near the pond where I was, the first thing I saw was a checque apron lye on the top of the water; I took my fork and twisted it round the apron, and

             the body to the edge of the pond; it lay about a yard and a half in the pond when I put the fork in to pull it to the edge; as soon as I saw the face, I said God Almighty forgive me, it is Mrs. Brown! I immediately sent for the prisoner; he came down the yard directly afterwards; I did not go for him; I was there when he came down into the yard amongst the rest of the people; I said Oh, Mr. Brown, it is a shocking affair; oh, says he, it is indeed; the next thing he said is, oh,

            , you turned my wife out of doors last night (he Davis was present) and she ran down the yard at that time, and he (the prisoner) ran after; I said the next words, Mr. Brown she has no cap on her head, nor handkerchief, nor no shoes or buckles; upon this Mr. Brown made answer, and said, her shoes and buckles were in the pond. I was by the pond side when it was took out; the body lay sideways in the pond, we catched hold of her arms, and seeing her hand I put the fork under and lifted her up; brought the body out of the pond, and put it upon some straw; I did not examine the body; I took notice of no marks on it; Mr. Davis came down by his orders; she was taken to Mr. Brown's house; he said it was more proper than to let the body lye there.</p>

               <p>You put it under her body? - Yes; her legs were quite straight as though laid out. I put the handle of the fork under her cloaths, and there was a step at the pond; we put it in particular under her cloaths.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the shoes were found in the pond? - There was only one shoe and buckle found, the water was taken all out, and no other found; the shoe and buckle was found soon after, as the pond was emptied as soon as possible we could; we got our engine and pumped the water out as soon as we could get men to work; there was no cap on her head, it was found tucked hard under her roll, in her neck; she used to wear a roll; she had neither shoe nor buckle; I said it is a shocking affair, he said so it is.</p>
               <p>Are there any necessary down your yard? - There are two necessaries down that yard.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Hampstead, not far from Mr. Davis's yard, I cannot say how far; I heard three screams a little after twelve at night.</p>
               <p>How long ago? - A fortnight last Monday; it was the night before the body was found, I was coming that way, when I heard two screams, one by Mrs. Forster's, and another at the top of the Church-yard.</p>
               <p>What distance is it from Mrs. Davis's house to Forster's? - A good way; the second noise was from the Church-yard stile, when I got to the top of Cock-alley, I heard a most bitter scream, that was in the town, not a great way from Davis's yard.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell the distance, but Forster's is a good way from Davis's? - No.</p>
               <p>How far is the Church-yard stile, is it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200020"/> between Forster's and Davis's yard? - Yes; between Forster's and Davis's yard, I cannot tell how far the Church-yard is from Davis's yard, it is a good distance, but higher than Forster's; I heard a third scream at the top of Cock-alley.</p>
               <p>Is Cock-alley, or the Church-yard stile, nearest to Davis's? - Cock-alley; and that was a louder screak than I had heard before; the third was the last I heard; I then went home and told my father, he said it was a screich owl, I said it could not be a screich owl.</p>
               <p>From this house, which was your way home? - By the Church-yard stile, and by Bradley's, when we came by Forster's, we came nearer Davis's yard, I cannot say how near I was to the yard, my way home was higher up in the town; I live in the middle of Hampstead, I did not come nearer Davis's yard, I saw nobody but the watchman, I asked the hour, he told me it was past twelve.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>There are watchmen in Church-row, there are many houses; I did not tell the watchman I heard the screams, he was crying the hour, I never was nearer Davis's, there are houses between, I did not mention it to the watchman, I went home directly.</p>

               <p>Is there any shop mark on it? - Yes; Mr. Jeremy's; as soon as I picked it up, I put my own mark on it; I know it to be Mr. Jeremy's property: I saw Guard attempting to conceal something she appeared to take off the compter, she was close to the compter; I did not know immediately what it was, but I plainly saw that attempt to conceal something.</p>
               <p>How far was you from Guard? - About a yard and a quarter; Barrington never shewed me any money, I did not take the direction down till I saw the attempt to take something; I did not like Guard's appearance, I don't say I saw her take any thing from the compter, I saw the muslin under her arm; they were all together, Lloyd was nearest the door, I suppose there were six or seven people in the shop besides, but none at my compter; this is the same muslin that dropt between Barrington and Guard, I was nearest them at the time, and no other persons, I am sure it is the very same parcel Guard endeavoured to give Barrington, I kept my eyes upon them pretty clear; I have sold such kind of muslin before with such marks, I did not see her take it, I suppose Lloyd was a yard and a half off, she was near the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You told me you perceived Guard concealing something under her cloak, I plainly saw that, are those your words? - Yes; I did.</p>

The manner in which this indictment is framed, makes it a capital offence against the prisoners; the circumstance of stealing privately in the shop, if above the value of 5 s. is a capital offence, and will affect their lives, if you are satisfied of the evidence; all three are charged with having committed this felony; it is not possible that every one of them should be the actual hand that took it, that is not necessary in point of law; if you are clearly satisfied of the circumstances of the case, they came all of them together for the purpose of stealing any thing from his shop, and that one was privy to the intention of the other, in that case, if they were privy to that intention, and present at the time, it is equally a felony in all, the same as if they were the very hand that took it; and said it was laid down by the judges as law, if any person saw them take it, it is then not privately stealing, and ceases to be a capital offence.</p>

               <p>To Gladman. What time did you set out with the bags from the Post-office? - About a quarter past three, upon the 16th.</p>
               <p>How far had you gone before you met any body? - About the five or six mile-stone beyond the Highway; there a tall man came up to me as I was travelling down the hill, he damned me and swore very much at me, I said hallo mate, it is the mail, says he, that is what we want, then two more men came up, and knocked me out of the cart, and took my whip from me; they drove the horses up the, they turned out of the way into a field, at the distance of half a mile, or three quarters of a mile, from the road, they opened the cart and took the bags out.</p>
               <p>Were the three men all together then? - Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>What became of you all the time? - The short man stood over me with a cutlass in his hand, he lead me by the collar after the carriage; when they had taken out the bags, they asked me if I knew the best, I said, I knew no more about them than they did; after they had thrown all the bags and mails out, but one, they throwed me up in the cart, I begged of them not to kill me, they said they would not; the short man took a handkerchief and tied my hands behind me, and shoved my legs in, and put the iron bar across them.</p>
               <p>They shut you in? - Yes; they said they would take the smallest bags, I heard a chaise drive up upon the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>Did you hear nothing said? - No; I believed it was a one-horse chaise, and when I came to Holloway turnpike, the man told me it was a one-horse chaise; I don't recollect hearing them say any thing about it; I came back, as soon as I was able, to the post office.</p>
               <p>Are you able to form any recollection of the person of either of these three men? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; he is one, Sir.</p>
               <p>Are you able to speak with any certainty, belief, or recollection? - I speak the real sentiments of my heart; it is my real belief.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it in the field they put you into the carriage? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200025"/>How long did they keep you there? - They left me in the cart in the field, with my hands tied; I was in the cart pretty near three hours after they left me.</p>
               <p>Did you see the one-horse chaise at all? - No.</p>
               <p>When you speak of a one-horse chaise, it is only from the noise of it you suppose it to be so? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about a chaise by any of them? - No, there was not; one said they would take the bags one at a time, and the other said go fetch it here.</p>
               <p>What was the expression? - They said they were going to carry the bags one at a time, one of the men said go fetch it here; they did not mention what it was.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did you hear any thing? - I heard them loading the chaise, when I was in the inside of the carriage, laying upon my face.</p>
               <p>How soon did they come after the expression, go fetch it there? - I believe they came about three or four minutes after they put me into the cart, I saw nothing.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark night? - No; it was a bright star light night.</p>
               <p>Is this the short man that had the cutlass? - No.</p>
               <p>At what place and time had you an opportunity of observing this man? - While they were robbing the cart; I stood looking at them all the while.</p>
               <p>Had they any disguise over them? - No; only the short man had a handkerchief over his face that stopped me first, the other men had nothing over their faces at all.</p>
               <p>Had you any opportunity of observing either of the others till you got into the field? - No.</p>
               <p>It was in the field you observed them all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the short man keep on his handkerchief? - Yes; he never pulled it off at all, till he pulled it off from his face to tie my hands behind me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the dress of the two men? - They had got a brown surtout coat on.</p>
               <p>Each of them? - No; one was without one.</p>
               <p>Which had the great coat? - This man.</p>
               <p>How near did you stand? - I stood just by the horses heads.</p>
               <p>How near was the prisoner? - I suppose it was the distance of three or four yards.</p>
               <p>Were they at the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long had you an opportunity of observing them then? - All the while they were cutting the mails open, which was pretty nigh ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Which was it you spoke to when you desired they would not kill you? - It was the two biggest, this man and the other; that wanted to kill me, the little man said no, he would spill no blood.</p>
               <p>Were there any thing particular in his dress or appearance that struck you, besides having a great coat? - Yes; I knowed him by his voice, he talked so much of the brogue.</p>
               <p>What, the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, do you take upon yourself to swear the prisoner was one of the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I will ask him, he says he knowed me by particular marks, what marks is in my face he can know me by; can he know me by my speech among four, five, or six men.</p>

               <p>Are you sure you could distinguish his voice from any other person? - Yes, Sir.</p>

            . I live in Chick-lane, the prisoner came to me on Monday after the mail was robbed, I saw him again the Wednesday after, the 16th, he asked me if I wanted to buy any Bank-notes, it is a commodity I deal in, he had two notes, and asked me for some money, said he would bring more notes, came again with more notes, and wanted to sell them, I went to Mr. Lion about it, Mr. Lion advised, the best way was to go and apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Did you give information to Mr. Lion? Yes; I then sent for Mr. Clark who came and took him.</p>
               <p>Did Clark come by appointment to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was this upon the Thursday evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come with any notes upon the Thursday? - Yes; he said he had three ten pound notes.</p>
               <p>Had you any note of him that evening? - He left a ten pound note, and a thirty pound.</p>
               <p>Did you make any mark upon the thirty pound note, so as to know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that the note? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you give it to? - To Mr. Clark; when he came on Wednesday I asked how he got the notes, he said he robbed the mail.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you been intimate with him before? - Never before; he came in to buy a pair of gloves, and asked me to buy this watch, I did not buy it, it was the Sunday night, he asked eight guineas for the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What he says is quite false, the man has been cast and convicted of perjury here, and flogged in the yard, and fined, and in Newgate at the time of the riot, and he got out then, he is the man I hired the horse and chaise for of Mr. Chambers on Sunday morning at two o'clock, he and one Mr. Lions had a horse and chaise at Old-street road.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he never hire a horse and chaise for you? - No; I know nothing at all of that.</p>
               <p>This chaise was not hired for you? - No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Jury. I should be glad to know whether that note is the same, and how he knows it? - I put my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Point it out to the jury? - It is this mark in Hebrew characters.</p>

               <p>To M'Donald. Did that key open the door near the area gates? - No; but the street over, it opened it on the inside, not the outside.</p>
               <p>Cartwright. The middle part of the door was broke, so that a person might get through; I found up stairs, closets and presses, and drawers open, and some trifling things in it scattered about; I had been there ten days before Christmas, and nobody had been to inspect the house after that till the robbery; I missed a bed and several things; I know nothing to affect the prisoner, with breaking in, or taking any thing; this key that was produced opened the door.</p>

               <p>How many days might it be? - It might be November or December.</p>
               <p>Not begin directly? - No; I had two guineas and a half to spend, Mr. Campbell gave me; I worked at my business a little, at a glass maker's; I have not been tried here above once or twice.</p>
               <p>You cannot tell really? - Am I obliged to tell it.</p>
               <p>Tell the truth if you can? - I was never cast but once; I was tried upon another wrong affair; I was took up in Park-street for this robbery, in the middle of the street, I was seen coming out of a house, I thought it the best way to give evidence when I was taken up and my life in danger. May, Knowles, and Munday, and Best there, and myself.</p>
               <p>This was just three weeks after you came out? - It was a week after Christmas; none of the property was found upon me; about three weeks or a month after the robbery was committed I was taken up; I never gave no information before this, I cannot guess how many robberies I have been concerned in during the three weeks, I believe but three or four, which I am to appear to.</p>
               <p>You understand you cannot be tried for this? - If I make my evidence good I think I am safe.</p>
               <p>You understand by swearing against those men, your life is safe? - Yes, surely.</p>
               <p>You don't mean to begin again? - No; not to go any more.</p>
               <p>Jury to Hart. Was that bolster and pillow sold to Mrs. Hart? - No; May had them; I don't know what became of the coverlid, Knowles said he would take the bed to himself, which he did; May took the bolster and pillows, there was no money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200034"/> or value distributed for them, they were carried to his lodgings by himself; Knowles took the key of the door with him, it was in the lock within side; as soon as the robbery was committed, we went to Harris's, I went the next morning to his lodgings, and saw them at May's.</p>
               <p>How came you not to have money for it? - We did not care for the trouble of carrying them, he said he would take them home, we said he might take them to himself if he would, I swear I did not carry them there.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of January I went with M'Donald to Knowles's lodgings; we took him out of bed, and searched the places round about, upon the cupboard on the stairs we found this key, with several others; Knowles said it was his cupboard and his keys; he owned it at the justice's; on the 12th of January, we went to May's lodgings, and found a bolster and a couple of pillows; we took him to the rotation office in Litchfield-street; Mr. Bramstone's servant came and owned them.</p>

               <p>My lord, in regard of this key, it was taken out of the cupboard upon the staircase, at the lodging-house where I live, it was taken out a fortnight before Christmas; the landlord where I live kept an old iron shop, and sold old keys, and things of that sort, when I went to live with him, but he dying, there came a gentleman to live in the house, who turned it into a coal shed, and part of this man's property was then thrown about the house, and those keys thrown into the cupboard; as to this Hart that has said this, I know no more of him than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>MAY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My lord, and gentlemen of the jury, I am brought here to answer to a crime that man has alledged against me, which I know no more of than the child unborn; the bolster and pillows, taken from my house, were sent me after I was married, I have been married four years, and have two children; I have witnesses to satisfy you the bolster and pillows were sent out of Lincolnshire, with a bed from my father-in-law's, as a present, with several other things at the time; I have witnesses to prove the identity of them, and their coming out of the country, with regard to the property; I totally deny knowing any thing of the man who has swore this robbery to us to clear himself and his confederates, but I declare to you before the face of the Court and Almighty God in Heaven, I know no more of what I am accused of than the child unborn.</p>

               <p>I am an officer at the public office, on the 11th of January we went to Mrs. Harris's, about a quarter past eight in the evening, to search for a portmanteau that had been taken away, cut, she lives in Butler's-alley, Grub-street, there were four or five of us, there were two doors, two went to one door, and M'Manus and I went to the other door, on listening at the key-hole, I heard some men's voices, I knocked at the door, it was opened, Mrs. Harris was at the foot of the stairs, when I got in, I found M'Manus, who had just got in at the other door just before me, there was the prisoner May sitting down upon a chair, he appeared to be doing something to his breeche's knees, Knowles was standing with his back towards the fire, there was not a yard between Knowles and May, there was a table between them with one cutlass upon it; M'Manus said, Knowles, don't throw any thing away, he put his hand to his pocket, I went up to him, and pulled out these pick-lock keys, (producing a bunch of pick-lock keys.) there was a cane stood reared against the chimney-piece; I asked Mrs. Harris, in the presence of the prisoner, who that cane belonged to, Mrs. Harris said, she did not know, she never saw it before in her life, I asked Knowles and May what they did there, they said they came there to see Mrs. Harris, about a person on board the lighters, May had eighteen guineas and two half guineas found upon him.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>You did not go upon Hart's information? - No; we were upon other business; Knowles said he was going to carry something down on board the lighters, I believe Mrs. Harris's husband is there; I went over the house to search it, but found nothing more; there were a pair of new boots below, Mrs. Harris said were her's.</p>
               <p>Court. Were any other persons at her house? - Only one Rocket, a brother of her's, who was ill in bed, and had been so some time, to my knowledge; Knowles said, damn my blood what is this, I just heard it, I did not take any particular notice of their appearance; finding the pick-lock keys upon them, we took them up as suspicious persons.</p>
               <p>There was nothing struck you in particular but the keys? - No; this was a little after eight we went there, we were there three quarters of an hour, when we went out, we soon heard the clock strike nine, I should think it was about three quarters after eight; nothing particular struck us of their appearance, only the keys, I think Knowles had the same great coat off, they were sent to prison.</p>

               <p>M'Manus.

               <p>I believe the house was searched very carefully, we asked Mrs. Harris who these things belonged to, she said they were not her's.</p>
               <p>If you had only found the keys, you would have taken them? - I should, as suspicious persons; nothing in particular struck me of their appearance; she being a notorious receiver, I should have taken up any body I found there.</p>

               <p>Did you recollect the mark of the cane before it was found? - Yes; I don't know I told any body of it before it was found; I had it in my hand almost twenty years.</p>
               <p>Was the mark an inch, or inch and a half from the head, or close under it? - I think it was quite close, and the mark came down about an inch, I believe.</p>
               <p>Did it run along the cane, or down it? - I think it runs down along side of the head.</p>
               <p>Are there any other marks, from which you could discover it, was it chased or plain? - There is a little raised work on it, I don't know the term, I kept it for the sake of the person it belonged to; it was at my bed's head, I had a short cane string to it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200041"/> when I left it at home, it was a longish ferril, about two or three inches long.</p>

               <p>(The Counsel read the commitment from the calendar.) I told the justice it was General Amherst's, and I never said it was gold; M'Manus asked if it was gold, I said I did not know; all the time I had it, I did not know whether it was gold or not, he bought it at Bath; I will not swear to an inch in the length of the ferril; there is no other mark that I know of.</p>

               <p>On the 11th of January, on Friday night, I, May, Knowles, Best, and Munday, went to the best of my knowledge, about seven o'clock; we went to a house in Green-street, Knowles went up to the door and knocked at it twice or three times, and found there was nobody at home, he took one of the pick-lock keys, and tried to unlock the door, he could not undo it with the first key, he saw the window shutters open to the parlour, he said he would get in that way, he put Best over the rails, he shoved the window up and got in, went round to the door and unlocked it, we all went into the house together to a back parlour, a bed room, and took away the property; they all came out of that room, all the property was in that room, we all went out of the street door, all five, we got to the bottom of the street; I gave Knowles the keys, and to May I gave the cane, which I took out of the bed room that is backwards, even floor, we went into no other rooms but the back parlour that night; at the bottom of the street, Man and Knowles said, we will go to Mrs. Harris's while you three go back again, there must be some more property up stairs; we three went back, I, Best, and Munday, Best got over the area, the same as he did before, we had shut the door after us, before it went with a spring, Best got into the window and he let us two in, we went up one pair of stairs, there was nothing but a salt and a silver spoon, we heard some people at the door which alarmed us, and we came down, we came to the door and found it fast, we went into the parlour and shoved the window up, and jumped out of the window over the area into the street, I was taken in Park-street soon after, I was pursued and taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>What property had you found in the back parlour? - Shirts and linen; they were all put into a brown bag, Knowles took them on his back; we all came out together, and we got as far as the bottom of the street before we three agreed to go back again; we were up stairs at first, came down upon the alarm, found it fast, they could not come in upon us, we had bolted it with inside, we unbolted it and tryed to pull it open, and somebody held it fast on the outside.</p>
               <p>Had you any arms? - There was I believe two cutlasses, Best and Munday had a cutlass each, I had a stick, May had a cutlass; when I first went to the house, to the best of my knowledge it was about seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>How long might you be there before you all came out the first time? - About ten minute</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200042"/>Are you pretty exact about the time you went there? - I believe I am pretty near the mark when I say seven o'clock, I had a watch and had looked half an hour before. These things were to be carried to Butler's alley, in Grub-street, to Mrs. Harris's.</p>
               <p>Grub and M'Daniel were ordered out of Court.</p>
               <p>Court. The things were to be carried to Mrs. Harris's in Grub-street? - Yes; when I was at the office I gave that information, I told them it, Mrs. Harris's, an alley in Grub-street, they said they knew it, I said it faced the ruins, they said it was, they had been there before, I told them if the things were not at her house, there was a house within a door or two lower where the property was conveyed to that she buys, after she has bought it.</p>
               <p>Who lived in that house a door or two lower? - I cannot say who lived in it; I knew Mrs. Harris's house well before, it is first carried to the house where she lives, and then conveyed to the other where she lives.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination by Counsel. I am going to twenty five.</p>
               <p>At what age was it you began thieving? - I don't chuse to tell that.</p>
               <p>Court. He is not clear as to all felonies.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester said, he cannot be indicted for any previous felony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller and Mr. Recorder were both of opinion, that he was liable to indictment for other felonies, or a man might give evidence of a petty felony, and by that means get off from others; his being admitted to be an evidence, in one case, could not amount to a general pardon.</p>
               <p>Hart deposed, upon a farther cross-examination, that he was discharged in November from the lighters, that he began robbing again in December; that he had the good fortune to escape with a watch in his pocket; he knew Mrs. Harris's very well, that he had been there about twice or thrice in a fortnight, and that she purchased things of him; the moment he was in custody he began to squeak; when taken he had a cutlass in his hand, that he held Best's cutlass while Best came out; only two of them out of the three had cutlasses; that it was not him but Best that was catch'd by the spikes; that he was not the person that was struck with the candlestick; that the cutlass was not drawn, that he hurt the man with the butt end of it that was going to take him; that he had a stick first, which he let drop; that when he got out of the window he stopped half a minute, and saw the other coming out, then he went away as fast as he could; Best did not clear the rails quite, he hung by his coat, and tore it away; that as soon as the people at the door saw him jump out of the window, they cried stop thief; that Best was near them, he supposed they did not like his cutlass, and so did not take him; but they came after him (Hart.)</p>

             called again. Said, the first she saw of it was at seven in the evening; then she saw the man get into Mrs. Lewis's window, and let the others in at the door; she went down stairs and gave the alarm, came up again directly, and looked out of her window, and saw two men come out with bundles; it was a very little time after they went in; Lee came in after she had given the alarm to her fellow servants, and he went over to the baker's; that she saw the two men come out with bundles before Lee went over; that when she first gave the alarm, there were only women in the house, who were afraid to open the door.</p>
               <p>Lee called again. Said he went over to the baker's immediately, upon his fellow-servant telling him what she had seen; it was about a minute before he and Mrs. Lewis's maid went to the door; the three men appeared upon the fill of the window with cutlasses; he struck at the last man that came out with a candlestick, and that baffled him so, that he did not clear the rails; the rest ran away directly; he never lost sight of Hart till he got round the chair, where the chairman took him.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this Hart the man that you struck at, and the man that you took after? - Yes; I am sure of it, there are several people to prove it; at the time the chairman took Hart, the chairman's mouth bled, there was a kind of scuffle; when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200043"/> jumped out, their cutlasses were all drawn, he believed there were three drawn, two he was sure of.</p>

            's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Upon the 11th day of January I had dined at home, at the corner of Stanhope-street, I have got an aged father and mother, that have lived in a very good way; through misfortunes in life they have failed, they are not capable of taking care of themselves so well as I could wish them, they brought me up in a very good way of life; I went over with intent, as I have done for these two years past, since they have failed, to pay their little rent for them, they lived at one Mr. Green's, who is gone, unluckily for me, into the country, or he could have proved it I stayed with my father and mother I suppose till it was near six o'clock, in Kent-street, in the Borough; I paid the rent, which was two pounds for the quarter, he is a man of very great age; I came through the Borough about six o'clock, and over London Bridge, I met one Clark, who is a Custom-house waiter, or something of that kind, he is not here, I have had every body here since Wednesday that I could; I went into a house, many people know the sign of it here, it is called the Tumble down Dick, a public-house just before you come to the foot of London Bridge, there I staid and drank part of six pennyworth of shrub and water with Clark, I came over London Bridge at very near seven, it was not quite seven; I went and called at Red-cross-street, a very little way from Moorfields, from thence I went and called at Cashmore's, that keeps a house in Long-lane, Smithfield; I thought the best way was to go across Bishopsgate Church-yard, and across Moor-fields; I met my fellow prisoner who stands by me, I met him as he was coming along the City-road, I said, Knowles, he turns round, and said to me, how do you do, says I, I am pretty well, I have not seen you some time says he, I told him I had not seen him; he asked me to go along with him to call at Mrs. Harris's, and said, he would then go home with me; I had not been in two minutes (he turns round to talk to her, I never saw her before) while we were there, there was a knock at the door, in come Carpmeal, M'Manus, and two more; they said, hallo, what do you do here, I said I had called in with Knowles, says M'Manus, I must search you; I said you may, I have nothing about me that I am afraid of, I have nothing but a little money, which is my own; they took it out of my pocket, and gave it to me again: all my witnesses have been here since Wednesday in waiting, but they are not here now, the Court have heard the four that were here the last time I was tried.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burt came to speak in his behalf, and gave him a good character; said he had known him fifteen years, that he had worked for him as a <rs id="t17820220-13-deflabel74" type="occupation">taylor</rs>

               <p>KNOWLES's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Upon the 11th of January I had been in the city road; coming across Moorfields, I passed by May; he called to me by name, as being near sighted I did not observe him, I asked him how he did, as we had not seen one another some time; he asked me where I was going, I told him to one Mrs. Harris's, that lived somewhere by Grub-street, I wanted to call upon her to know how her husband did, as I had known him many years, I asked him to go with me, he did, and coming down to Grub-street, we met two men coming out of Mrs. Harris's door, as we were coming up the court, I knowing it to be Mrs. Harris's door, stopt, we heard the bolt go; we knocked some time before we could get in; Mrs. Harris asked from the window who we were, I could not make her understand, the maid opened the door; when I came into the house this cutlass that is produced in court laid upon the round table; immediately the maid says my mistress is gone up stairs a minute, she will be down in a moment; you must understand, there are two doors in the house, as the gentleman said that took us, one door shuts into the front kitchen, and at the foot of the stairs there is a back door; that goes out; I heard some talk above; Mrs. Harris came down stairs to us; upon her coming down stairs, these gentlemen came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200044"/> and knocked at the door, upon hearing them come in, a woman that sat in the chair ill, said, God bless you take hold of these things, and put them in your pocket, (the pick-lock keys) thoughtless of what they were, as they were done up in a rag, I held them by my side in the rag, not in my pocket, Mr. M'Manus found several about the sender, that were put there as they came into the house; they asked me what I did there, I told them I was coming to ask Mrs. Harris after her husband, they said I must go with them, I said would go with all my heart, we went to justice Wright's, we were examined a part, and Mr. Wright was going as we thought to discharge us, he thought proper to keep us, we were at the Watch-house, and trusted out and in, but knowing ourselves innocent, we never offered to get away; we could have made off but we would not; he called for two witnesses, Harris and Smart, who did not appear.</p>
               <p>Court. For the sake of detection of offenders, and bringing them to punishment, for the preservation of the public, by disclosing dangerous confederacies of men in iniquity, it is held, that an accomplice should be, in point of law, an admissible witness; but the legislature, and those that have administred the law, feeling that such a person, who, in the very act of giving his evidence, acknowledging himself to be guilty of a great offence against the laws, stood in circumstances of considerable discredit, have also, that the lives of men might not be at the mercy of informers of that character and description, always held, that unless the evidence of the accomplice is confirmed by other material circumstances affecting the parties who are accused, upon that single evidence, no man's life or personal security should be taken away; and upon the single evidence of an accomplice, unsupported by circumstances, courts of justice will never permit a prisoner to be convicted. So much has that principle prevailed, and so thoroughly is it established, that the general practice is not to examine an accomplice at all, till some other circumstances have been given in evidence affecting the person concerned, which can lay a foundation for the evidence of the accomplice, and enable the court to say, before the accomplice is examined, there are circumstances that tend to throw a suspicion upon the party accused, which may confirm or destroy the story then to be told by the accomplice; therefore, the law for the sake of punishment of the guilty, admits the evidence of accomplices, but with great caution, and it is for the consideration of the jury, when that evidence is admitted, how far it is confirmed by other circumstances, and upon the evidence itself given by the accomplice, whether he is deserving of any, and what degree of credit; for the evidence of one accomplice may be so circumstanced as to be more deserving of weight than another; and the degree of credit the jury will give to an accomplice when examined, must be left to them in the circumstances he stands, and upon all the circumstances of the case; so far may he said, that if juries are, because a man stands in the light of an accomplice, totally to disbelieve all he says upon that account, and give him no credit at all, and not suffer his evidence to be considered as any addition to the other circumstances, it defeats the principle of law intirely, which admits the accomplice to be examined, for it would be perfectly nugatory to examine a man, to whom in no case you ought to give any credit; the credit of an accomplice is like the credit of another person, but certainly liable to circumstances of discredit, from his being an accomplice.</p>
               <p>In this case there is another circumstance respecting this evidence of Hart, which is an additional circumstance of discredit; he has been convicted of another felony, for which he has suffered the punishment of the law, and is restored to his competency of being a witness, but still his character is affected by that circumstance also, and the degree of credit arising from that circumstance as well as the other, is a matter for the consideration of the jury. As to his evidence in this case, you will consider how it stands, not totally rejecting it, but receiving it with caution, and carefully examining<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200045"/>how far it is confirmed by other circumstances; with respect to that, you should understand this also, that the circumstances that confirm the evidence of an accomplice, are not merely those that relate to the commission of the fact, because being an accomplice, necessarily supposes he was a person assisting in the commission of the fact, and therefore he must know the circumstances that attend the fact; of which he was one of the perpetrators; therefore I don't conceive that those circumstances, which merely attend the commission of the fact; without serving to point out the persons who were concerned in that fact, are to be considered as confirming the testimony of the accomplice, because the point in which his testimony is to be confirmed, is not that a robbery was committed, but that the parties charged, were the parties together with him, committing that robbery; therefore you will consider in this case, what circumstances there are affecting the prisoners, with suspicion of being concerned in this robbery, and those, circumstances are to be taken in confirmation of the positive testimony of the accomplice.</p>

But there is another point in this indictment which is extremely doubtful; for it is laid in the indictment to be the dwelling house of

               <p>Court. This is not a case that falls within a capital offence, as Sheridan swears he lost it upon the 31st of January last; the account he gives is, he was very much in liquor, they had been drinking together, they both appeared intoxicated, he fell fast asleep, when he came into the apartment he had his watch, when he waked it was gone. This is not what the legislature meant to make a capital offence, or a stealing privately. I believe there was a decision of a similar nature; a person got intoxicated at Vauxhall, and fell asleep in one of the watch-houses or nitches upon Westminster Bridge, during which time, a waiter that came from Vauxhall stole his buckles out of his shoes, in that case the judges considered it, and they were of opinion, it was not a stealing of his property which could make it a capital offence, as he was asleep; the statute was made to protect that property which persons awake can secure; the man must have been in a situation, that he must have been upon his guard to have discovered it, in this case he could not; if you are of opinion he stole the watch it cannot be a capital offence.</p>

I said, I fancy you know that; I told him he had stole it; he walked back again, and threw it down at the warehouse door; I got him then into the warehouse, and sent for Mr. Scott, and got a constable; he made no resistance at all while I had the care of him; Mr. Scott came when I went for a constable.</p>

               <p>John Lane; produced the things, said he had them from the prisoner, three yards and a half, 8th of December, and to the 29th she brought them; I knew her some time using the shop; she told us where she lived truly, and that she was sent with them, and she told her name; she said, she was sent by different apprentices and servants to pawn things; the woman where she lives has thirteen apprentices and servants; I know the prisoner was the woman that pawned them.</p>

               <p>Do you know the gown any better than you do the cloth? - I very well know that I know them both; I have no particular mark on it.</p>
               <p>Do you swear to the gown as you do to the cloth because she confessed it; should you know the gown if you saw it in a different place? - Yes; I should know it by the make; no promise was made to her in my hearing after I had been to the justice; I told her I would not hurt her before the constable came.</p>
               <p>The prisoner made no defence, but said the prosecutrix had promised her forgiveness to confess.</p>

               <p>Job Haywood. I live in New Belton-street, Long-acre, I am a sawyer, have known the prisoner ten years, he worked with me three years ago, he was honest, I lost nothing durin g the time.</p>
               <p>Court. He must not only take it but carry it away to constitute the felony, it remained in the waggon, if a man breaks into a house and takes a parcel of goods, wearing apparel or other things, out of a repository or chest, and removes it any distance whatever, in order to carry it away, but before he has actually carried it away, he is detected, and the goods removed out of their original situation, that has been held sufficient in law to constitute a capital offence. The other day a case came before the judges reserved by Mr. Justice Nares, which was this; some where in the Acton road, a person got into a waggon with intent to steal a parcel of goods, which lay as a pocket of hops would, at its length, he had removed it and put it end ways, but not out of the original situation that it stood in the waggon; and he had with some knife or other instrument cut that package, and was proceeding to take out the goods it contained; previous to the time of taking out the goods he was detected, he was tried, and that case reserved for the opinion of the judges, and they were all of opinion it did not constitute a felony. If you find this prisoner guilty of the fact I shall respite the sentence, and state the case to the judges, and the opinion they give upon it will be given to the justices next in rotation.</p>

               <p>Upon the trial, the substance of the case as far as it relates to the prisoner, was that he applied to the prosecutor, a pawnbroker, and bargained for a watch of the price of eighteen guineas, and then produced this Bill of Exchange, alledging it to be a Bath Bank Bill; there appeared upon it an indorsement in the name of B. M'Carty; upon the prosecutor's enquiring who he was, he said he was

                  Barnard

                  </persName>
            , he said that he had indorsed that Bill, and that the letter B. and names M'Carty was his indorsement; and he likewise sent to Beaty and Co. to know whether this was a good Bill or not, they said it is a very good Bill, and will be paid when it comes due; when that was transacted, the prosecutor took this Bill for the watch, that was for the eighteen guineas he paid, besides the eleven pound two shillings which was the difference supposing this Bill of Exchange had been a good and genuine Bill, and the prosecutor gave him a receipt in the name of M'Carty.</p>
               <p>Upon his defence, divers witnesses were called, who proved that there was really such a man M'Carty, and that this indorsement was the handwriting of that M'Carty. It was referred to the Jury to consider, whether they believed that the fact was so or not, and the Jury, were satisfied, whatever opinion they might have of the transaction itself, however dishonest that might be, they were of opinion, that in fact there was such a man as

                  Barnard

            , and that the name B. M'Carty upon this Bill, was of the handwriting of that M'Carty; therefore it came to a consideration if they found the prisoner guilty under these circumstances, but with reference to the opinion of the Judges, whether this amounted to the crime of forgery, or to the crime of uttering a forged Bill knowing it to be forged.</p>
               <p>Upon the first day of the last term there were eleven Judges present, who took this matter into their consideration, and they were of opinion, that in point of law the prisoner was not guilty of the offence charged upon him, for they were of opinion that there must be a forgery. The Act of Parliament, of the 2d of George I. says, that if any person shall falsely make a forge or counterfeit, or cause to be made, forged or counterfeited any indorsement upon any Bill of Exchange, or shall utter any forged indorsment upon such Bill of Exchange, that it shall be felony without benefit of clergy. Then they were of opinion, the foundation of the whole must be a forgery, whereas in this case, there was really such a person in existence as B. M'Carty, and that B. M'Carty in his own hand, writing made the indorsement upon the Bill Therefore however corrupt and wicked this combination might have been (it perhaps may come before the Jury in a different mode sometime or other) they were of opinion they could not find it felony, they must take the matter as it stood; so this being the hand writing of a real M'Carty in whose favour the Bill was drawn they were of opinion there was no forgery and consequently that the prisoner <rs id="t17820220-32-verdict158" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>How far did you pursue them before he said here take him? - It might be a hundred yards; as soon as I got to the surface of the earth, I saw them running a-breast, within ten yards of each other, and they continued to run a-breast, I said it did not signify their running away I should catch them, Davis, said, here; I laid hold of Davis as Collingwood took hold of his breast, and turned him round to me, Collingwood came back voluntarily; the trunk lay in a ditch within two hundred yards of the church, it was taken to the Justice's; it is the same trunk that is here, I never saw the prisoners before, I was the first that got up along side of them.</p>

               <p>Collingwood. I did not know but the prisoner Davis might have some weapons about him; and it might not be safe for me, I kept him in sight all the while, the other prisoner knows nothing of me, I came back voluntarily.</p>

               <p>What was the work? - A blue manteau, shot with white, cut in the loom and left there; it was cut clear from the reed; on examining the window, we found it open, and saw the mark of a foot, as if somebody had gone out there; I found a candle burning in the house, on the ledge of a wall; I saw nobody in the house but the prisoner; he was in the kitchen, standing upright in it, between seven and eight at night; we searched the prisoner, found nothing but a clasp knife, and some half-pence; I saw the light on the stair-case, on a pier of the wall.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Whether he did not knock me down with a poker? - I did not knock him down, I had one which he endeavoured to take from me.</p>

               <p>Did the light change its situation? - When I first saw it, it was close to the window; a little time after, I saw a glimmering light, it seemed to me to be moving towards the stair-case, according to the appearance.</p>

               <p>I am a horse-waterman at Charing-cross; I don't remember the stage coach coming with Mrs. Harbin; I remember the hackney coach coming to take up the fare, and the gentleman go into it with two trunks, and a hat box; the gentleman ordered it to drive to bunhill-row, Moorfields; I did not see the lady get into the coach; the gentleman only.</p>
               <p>At Charing-cross you have a hundred and fifty gentleman of a day getting into coaches? - Yes; I saw the gentlemen get into a coach.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing in particular led you to observe him at that time? - No nothing in particular; I looked at him very hard, and asked him for some halfpence, he said he had none; he ordered me to tell the coachman to drive him to Bunhill-row; there was not any thing in particular made me take notice of him, more than what I have mentioned already.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I believe the 3d of December, I did not know the day of the month, but I heard the gentleman mention it at the office, three weeks last Tuesday from the time it happened; it is now near two months since it happened.</p>
               <p>What made you recollect it? - Sometimes one cannot be off taking notice of people one lets in; I may let in a hundred or more gentlemen in a day.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing in particular led you to take particular notice of it that day? - No; nothing in particular.</p>
               <p>You were sent for to the office; did you know on what account you were sent for? - No; not till I came there; the gentlemen asked me about it, if I could recollect the coachman, I told them no; I could recollect nothing about it, at first.</p>
               <p>Do you mean the runners? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any body on this day lurking about the house? Yes; at the time this coach was there I saw four men; it was the third of December when the coach went off; that was the day, as the gentleman told me at the office.</p>
               <p>Are you clear of that circumstance of the gentleman's desiring you to drive to Bunhill-row? - At night; yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Was there never no instance of any person ordering you to drive from Charing-cross to Bunhill-row? Yes; often before that; I did not understand what you meant at first, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see either of the prisoners at the bar? - Yes; I saw those two men, and two more with them, about six o'clock or soon after in the evening, soon after the stage came in, I heard the name of

               <p>How many coaches were taken last night? - I was not there but at St. Giles's round house; they told me I must go there till the trial came on; they gave me 18 d. a day, good living and good lodging.</p>

               <p>They asked you about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The runners have often applied to you? - Once or twice I believe.</p>
               <p>You was not desirous to go into the Round-house? - I was not desirous to stay there, I would rather be out and do nothing, than have eighteen pence a day and be there, they had spoke to me several times about it.</p>
               <p>Did they ever talk to you about a reward of forty pounds for convicting this man? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they never tell you, you was to have a share for convicting them? - No; I was at the coach door while the coachman put the boxes in, nobody was in as far as I saw, before the boxes, the gentleman went in, I saw nobody else, I shut the door.</p>
               <p>Did the men whom you saw go after the coach walk or run? - They ran after it.</p>

               <p>I am a hackney coachman, I remember taking up a fare at the Golden-cross, Charing-cross, the 3d of December, I remember it was on a Monday, I was first coach, they called me to the yard at the Golden-cross to take two trunks, I took them and put them in, I took up a gentleman and a lady, and was ordered to drive to Bunhill-row, at St. Martin's-lane end I went to take hold of my check string, I saw a man up behind the coach like a footman, I did not know but he belonged to the gentleman, he still kept behind like a footman, at every turning I turned, he got down at the end of Chiswell-street, I drove up the row, took the things out, and they paid me; I missed him at the turning, I remember the house, I could go to it now; I took the trunks out, the lady went in before the trunks, the gentleman too; I put them in custody of the maid, a man then came and asked me, what shall I give you to go to Charing-cross, I believe it was the same man, it is the further man of those two, (the prisoner at the bar, Verrier) I believe it to be the man, he had a light brown great coat, the waistcoat I could not see, but he had a lapelled white waistcoat, I asked two shillings, he said I will not give two shillings; as I was going to the same stand again, I parted with Verrier at Mr. Smith's door, and went away with another person, I saw him at the office, I looked round twice, I was so ignorant of the matter I could not distinguish him, they bid me look again, I did, and then I looked at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-Examination.</p>
               <p>I was asked all these questions there, and then I was asked to look for the man, I took the box out, it was pretty heavy, I am pretty strong, the trunk was not very small nor very large, it was middling heavy.</p>
               <p>You were left to bring in the trunks after the lady and gentleman had got out? - The lady had got in, but the gentleman did not just then, he was at the door with me, the lady was in the passage till the trunks were both in; there was one man behind the coach all the while to Bunhill-row, I left him there at the door.</p>
               <p>You had no difficulty of knowing him again? - No; I took him to Catherine-street, and by accident.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you of observing him? - I took notice of him, being in light cloaths behind the coach, when I said I would not take less than my fare, he said I thought you were going to the same stand again.</p>
               <p>Did you ever observe his face before? - I did not.</p>
               <p>I want to know how you know the man that spoke to you on the side of the coach, was the same as was up behind? - I am certain it was, I took notice of his light dress, I am certain, I took notice of his lapelled waistcoat too, it was open.</p>

               <p>Is he that sort of hosier, that carries his shop upon his back? - Yes; I have seen him with two or three dozen pair;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200068"/> you may call him a pedlar, he carries them under his arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Verrier. When I have orders, I execute them.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 9th of January, Mr. Hillman came up with a handkerchief of tea, which he said he took from two men employed in a lighter, in unloading the York Indiaman; one was secured on the quays, the other made his escape, the one that was taken was the prisoner at the bar; the bulk of what he stole might be three pounds all together which was taken from the two men.</p>
               <p>Mr. HILLMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer in the service of the customs, I found the tea on the prisoner at the bar on Saturday the 19th of December, that the prisoner at the bar and another were in the hole of the hoy that was unloading the York Indiaman, the tea is spilled out of the chests; the man that came up first I examined, I found some tea about him, and the prisoner at the bar was endeavouring to make his escape, I pursued him, and the first man made his escape, I found a quantity of tea upon the prisoner, and went and informed Mr. Twiss of it, the company gave orders for prosecution; the prisoner was employed by the master of the tackle porters to help to unload, I have no doubt he had the tea out of the hold.</p>
               <p>What is the value of that tea? - Five shillings, that is one pound without the duty.</p>

            ; he asked him where Caston lived, he said over the water; the next day he was examined again; this sugar is mine, I am clear of it; it was intended to be lumped, but not clearing so soon as was expected, I bid the boiler give it another clay, and put it in the stove, and he said, suppose we put it in with the head on; the heads are generally cut off, being perfectly brown, and full of syrup; I have been nineteen years a sugar-baker, and verily believe such a thing was never done before, as goods of this kind being put into the stove with the heads on, (the sugar produced in court had the heads on) I have no doubt the sugar was stolen; we got a constable and searched his dwelling, we found none of those things we expected, but we found this carpenter's mallot, which is just such a thing as we use in the sugar-house to knock the heads off, and this would bruise it small, it is all over sugar; I have missed five hundred weight at one time, and six hundred weight at another, during the time of this Caston Haseman being the <rs id="t17820220-61-deflabel292" type="occupation">miller</rs>

               <p>Was the window fast? - I don't know; the door opens into the mill, and the mill is always open to the dwelling, but not to the street, they cannot go from the street; the mill window is common sash, the other are iron-barred, the cutting-room window is not barred.</p>
               <p>What day's work was this sugar? - From a day's work of pieces, the Friday and Monday.</p>
               <p>What day was it cast? - Boiled a great while before these goods were taken from the stove to be ground on Thursday night, our process takes six weeks going through; I was angry about his not doing what I expected on Saturday evening, at tea time the maid came, and said Caston wants to speak to you, he said he should be glad I would give him his wages, there were sixteen pounds in my hands, I said I could not give him his wages, I said your warning will be on Thursday, I cannot spare you before; he fell into the most violent agitation I ever saw a man in my life, cried out Oh Lord, what shall I do, what shall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200079"/> I do; he said a friend of his was going over to Germany, and he should have a place there, if he went, I made him an offer to stay with me; he wanted to go to Bremen, I said I could not spare him, and then he fell into a more violent agitation than ever I saw, it was heard by all in the house; on Monday morning I went into the mill and found him got remarkably forward, he asked to go when he had finished the next hogshead; I said, is not the ship gone? he said no; there was about an hour and an half's time between my accounting for this mystery, and the time of his intending to have gone off; the window shutters were all close, and no outward marks of their being forced; I suppose my house to be near half a mile from Bishopsgate church, Seyfert left me about Midsummer day, we parted friends, I had told him, at the time of paying his wages, if he was short of money, I should not mind lending him twenty or thirty pounds, little suspecting what I heard afterwards of him.</p>
               <p>When did you discover the loss of your sugar? - Between ten and eleven at night; from the circumstance of being taken out of the stove, and cut as this was, on the Friday morning, the 1st of February, I understood it was lost; Saifert was apprehended the Monday morning following, two days had intervened.</p>
               <p>It is clear the sugar was not carried to Seyfert's house on the first? - He was discovered on the first; I entrust nobody but myself to sell the sugars, for a twelve month past I have been my own clerk; the room this sugar was deposited in was in the custody altogether of Caston Haseman, who had the key.</p>
               <p>Whether you did not collect from Prosser and the rest, that Caston Haseman was the name by which it was discovered? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. It was the declaration of Saifert that led to the discovery of Haseman? - The man going to gaol, said he met a man that spoke to him, according to Prosser's account to me.</p>
               <p>Are these sugars now in a saleable state? - No, by no means, they must be ground in a mill, this instrument will do it as well in time.</p>

               <p>I am a sugar refiner, I don't know when it was taken out of the stove; I boil for Mr. Glover, it was taken out on Thursday in the afternoon; I am almost sure that is the sugar.</p>

Payne the constable, who attended the sitting magistrate at the time Hevey was examined, deposed, he searched the prisoner Hevey, and found a handful of guineas in his pocket, about twelve or fourteen and a pocket-book containing a vast number of notes, (the book was produced by Mr. Reynolds, it being deposited with him after the trial of Hevey, for the forgery at a former sessions).</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds informed the court, he had opened the book and looked through every article, that it contained a great number of notes similar to the note in question, some ed up, and others unfilled, and with different fillsums, some were wrote Bath Bank, some other places.</p>
               <p>Mr. Payne said, the account Hevey gave of himself was, that he only acted as clerk to Hevey and Co. he said he found one, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200083"/> there were five or six gold watches found upon Mr. Hevey.</p>

               <p>Mr. Read senior, deposed, that was the watch he sold to the prisoner Hevey; that he had never been paid any money for it, and had received nothing but the bill; that he went to receive the cash when it was due, but found the people were all run away or gone; it appeared afterwards they were both in prison, that they were taken up, the one on the 1st of December, the other on the 3d.</p>

               <p>The counsel for the prisoner objected to the indictment, that the charge attempted to be brought against the defendants was not warranted by the penal law; that conspiracy (the crime imputed) like all other crimes, has a clear definition and description annexed to it; that conspiracy in antient times was different from the modern; the first conception which evidently came into the view of the legislature, was a combination to charge persons with some crime, and possibly in its extent, subjecting them to trial, that some perilous consequence must attend it, and therefore it is evidently distinct from fraud, the crime now imputed fraud is not a conspiracy, and it is impossible to say it amounts to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Read junior was called again, and the following question put by the court.</p>
               <p>When you went with the bill to Great St. Helen's and saw the prisoner Beaty, what question did you ask him respecting the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200084"/> bill? - I asked him if it was a good bill.</p>
               <p>What answer did he make? - He said it was a very good one.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him any farther questions? - I asked him no farther.</p>
               <p>Court. There is in this indictment a distinct substantial charge, that

                  Richard

             wrote the acceptance of this bill, and no evidence has been given of the fact, or of the hand writing of Beaty.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the prosecution said, it was not necessary to produce any farther evidence than Read junior had given; for if a bill was tendered to a man, which bill purports to be his acceptance to be wrote by him, and he looks at that bill and says it is a good bill, it will be paid when due, that is a proof of his acceptance, sufficient to support an action in any court of justice, and therefore sufficient in this case.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the defendants said, it was begging the question to say, if a note is tendered to a man as an acceptor, if he says it is a good bill it will be a good acceptance; there is no doubt of that, but there is no evidence in this case of the man pretending to be the acceptor, he only looked at it sometime and said it was a good bill, and that which would not be evidence to charge a man in a civil suit, cannot be evidence to affect him in a criminal prosecution.</p>
               <p>The counsel for the prosecution said in reply, the man himself taking the note in his hand, holding it a minute, then returning it and says, it is a good bill, it will be paid; that is an acceptance to all intents and purposes, it is acknowledging that acceptance to be his acceptance; in this case it was as much as to say I have wrote R. B. upon it, and will pay it when it comes due.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no doubt at all, if no acceptance had been written at all upon this bill, what Beaty said, if he is proved to be the person addressed, would unquestionably amount to an acceptance; and if it had been charged in this indictment that this bill was drawn as it is stated to be, and that

             did fraudulently declare was a good bill, upon the bill being presented to him so purporting to be accepted by him (Beaty) but my doubt is, if in an indictment for a crime you take upon you to state distinct substantive facts, which are not essentially necessary to make out the crime, that is the subject and the gist of the indictment; you shall not be permitted to treat that as surplusage, and say, though we have charged an unnecessary fact, the indictment is good without it, we may consider it as struck out of the indictment, and we need not give it in evidence; the contrary of that I take to be clear and settled law. Here Mr. Recorder cited a case in which he was counsel some years ago in the King's Bench, in which upon an indictment for perjury, the writ of declaration was stated, and all the proceedings prior to joining the issue; that he called upon the prosecutor's counsel to produce the writ and other proceedings; that the counsel on the other side said, it was not necessary, and it was no matter whether the writ issued or not, it was totally immaterial; if that cause was called on for trial it was equally perjury of the witness if he was called upon to give evidence; lord Mansfield said it was very true, but as they took upon them to state the writ and other proceedings, they must produce them, and they must be proved to correspond with the issue upon the indictment; and though in this case it is only said to affect the person out of whose mouth it comes, it likewise affects the other, and though this is part of the offence of Beaty, it is as necessary to be proved against Hevey as him, upon the principle that what is stated in an indictment must be proved. If the jury are of opinion upon the evidence as to the merits, that the prisoners one or both are guilty, I shall reserve the point for the opinion of the judges.</p>
               <p>I think there is no weight in the objection made by the prisoners counsel at the outset, upon the nature of the charge itself, whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200085"/> the evidence amounted to a conspiracy; he stated that which is true, that in the old law the word conspiracy in general, was appropriated very much to confedracies, formed to make false charges against people either in criminal or civil suits, and the antient writ of conspiracy at common law lay only in those cases; but it is equally true, that besides that kind of conspiracy for which the antient writ of conspiracy lay; at all times by common law it was an offence for more persons than one to confederate and unite together, in a plan to commit any fraud whatever, and the word conspiracy has been constantly applied to that kind of confederacy; I conceive there can be no doubt at this day, there are many precedents for it, that an indictment to charge persons with conspiring, confederating, and agreeing together to commit a fraud, is a good indictment, and I am clearly of opinion upon the general point, this indictment is well laid against the prisoners for that offence.</p>

I asked him a guinea; I went back to let the man know; I came back and asked him 16 s. He would not give any more than 13 s. I went back again, and the man said I might take 14 s. one shilling for myself, and 13 s. for the harness. The man said, my master gave me two guineas, and I have lost the money. Lealter said, he thought he was imposed on, and had given too much.</p>

             shaved him, he whispered to him, and he told me this Harris has got something to sell belonging to horses. I said, did this fellow come honestly by them, as I had only seen Harris two or three times. Harris told him his master had given them to him, he had a new carriage and the old harness and things belonged to the servants, he said he had pawned his new buckskin breeches and gamed the money away in the Lottery-office, and now he must wear his new breeches, and must take them out of pawn, therefore he wanted to sell this harness. The prisoner then said, let me fetch one that lives in our neighbourhood to look at them. I told him to go and not stay; he went and fetched one Simons to look at them; he asked 16 s. for them. Harris shewed them to Simons, he said they were not worth so much, so he would have nothing to do with them. Harris said to the prisoner I will leave them with you till tomorrow morning, he said if you get above 14 s. keep it yourself, and if only 14 s. I will give you 6 d. In the afternoon he carried them to Lealter, and shewed them him. I know no further. Harris said he was a coachman belonging to the same stable next the Saracen's Inn, I did not ask him to whom.</p>

I have shaved the prosecutor, I asked him where Harris was; he told me that he came once or twice to clean horses, they said they knew nothing of him, they knew nothing of the lad Harris, but now he knows nothing of him; one is the prosecutor himself. I learned his name was Harris at the Saracen's Head.</p>

Then the prisoner fetched one Simons, he came with him, and they could not agree; I do not know what he asked; Harris asked the prisoner to shew them to any body else; after his business was done he went with the harnesses; Harris left them with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178202200090"/> prisoner to sell for him; he brought them home again; Thursday morning the prisoner took them out again. Whilst the prisoner was out, Harris came for the money, the prisoner came home and gave it him.</p>
               <p>What was Harris? - An hostler; he said he worked for the George Inn, in Fenchurch-street; he said his master had got a new coach and the harness was his.</p>
               <p>What master, the master of the George Inn? - I don't know; he said he would not have sold them, but he lost his money in the lottery time; he said he wanted to buy him a pair of boots and a pair of breeches; he said his master gave him money to buy them, but he had lost it in the lottery. The prisoner is no relation; I am journeyman to my brother; he was by, we were all shaving the customers; he spoke loud, he did not whisper; my brother could hear well enough himself; he told me in the hearing of my brother that he belonged to the George Inn.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to me about seven or eight weeks ago, and asked me to come to his house to buy a pair of harness, there was a man had a pair to sell.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a jew by profession, and a chapman and dealer; I deal with master hackneymen for hammer-cloths and harness, and any thing in their way; I buy at sales; I deal in old cloaths besides. There was a man had them to sell, the harness was not there; I went to

               <p>It might be kicked by her into the street? - No, my lord, she had got near a hundred yards.</p>

Was not the check loose at one end? - No, it was tied at both ends; my master told me the woman had stolen some check who had been in the shop, I stopped the first woman I met, it was about a hundred yards, my master came and took the prisoner, I saw the check fall from her, I believe it fell from under her apron.</p>
