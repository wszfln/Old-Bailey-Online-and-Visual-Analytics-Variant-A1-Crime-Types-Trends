I am now living in Brentford Union—before I went there, I was living with my father at Hounslow powder mills—he is a groom—my mother is dead, and my father has since this matter married again—I am eighteen years of age—in Nov., 1854, I was living there, with my sister, who is about thirteen years old, and my two brothers, who are mere children—the powder mills are inclosed, and my father's house is within the inclosure—the prisoner was a clerk in the powder mills, and lived within the inclosure—my father has to go out a good deal, as groom, to drive people about—I was confined on 9th Aug., 1855, in the work-house; I was removed there for that purpose—Joseph Hague is the father of my child—it is three years ago since I first knew him, to speak to—he frequently spoke to me, sometimes at my father's house, and sometimes away from it—the first connection between us took place on Sunday, 5th Nov., 1854—he came to the house to me; he went by the house several times that day, and that night he came to the house after me, about half past 10 o'clock—my sister was there when he came—he persuaded me away, and we both went up the plantation together—the plantation is about three times the distance across this Court from the house, about 100 yards—there is a path leading through the plantation to the packing shop and to his house too—that is the way that he goes home—we went along the path, and when we got into the plantation he had connection with me—I was away from the house about a quarter of an hoar altogether; he then went home—on the Tuesday following I had connection with him again, in the same place—he came to the house on that occasion also—it was about half past 7 o'clock—my sister was there; my father was out on both those occasions—the connection was repeated up to March—from the time I first became acquainted with the prisoner until I was confined, I had no con<lb/>nection with any other man, nor had I before I saw the prisoner: never with anybody else—I saw nobody on any of the occasions when I was with the defendant—I know Harriet Lane—she was with me one night, but not when I was with him—while I was with her I saw the prisoner, and she left me; that was about a month after the first connection—when she left me, I went with Joseph Hague into the plantation, and had connection with him—besides walking with him on the two occasions I have told you of, he has often been to our house; not before 5th Nov., but five or six times between 5th Nov. and March—there are some mills there—I remem<lb/>ber being with him there—I do not remember how he was walking with me, whether he did anything on that occasion, any more than he kissed me—that was about dusk—I cannot fix the time—it was at some mills under the building.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness, and lived at my father's house in Nov., 1854, and still do so. I have seen Hague there; the first time was on 5th Nov., Sunday, when he went out with my sister Emma, at half past 10 o'clock—they were away a good while—I saw him again on the Tuesday following—there were fireworks on the Monday, and he came on the Tuesday, and went out with my sister about half past 7 o'clock—I saw him in the house before they went away—my sister was away about half an hour—they went into the plantation—besides the 5th and 7th Nov., I have often seen him at my father's house talking with my sister, and walking with her outside frequently—Mrs. Davis used sometimes to come to the house.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you married since Nov., 1854? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—no one lived in the house with me except my two daughters and my two little boys—after that Sunday night, I saw Hague next morning—a person named Bennett was present, but he is not here—he is a neighbour of mine, and lived on the premises then, and does so now—I am not married to a relation of his—I last saw him yesterday—he is not here to-day—there was nobody but my daughter present when I told Hague that she was in the family way by him—I had no conversation with him after March—there has been some little difficulty between this young man and me—I heard that he said something disrespectful of me—I have not brought an action against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You know that he was at the powder mills, where you were engaged, and he has not got that situation now; do you remember telling some one you would take care that he should not stay there long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am in the habit of driving my mistress about in an open carriage—I did not say that I would take care that he should not stay there long, as he had spoken disrespectfully about Bennett, or about myself to Bennett—I told several people, between March and the time when the Magistrate first heard it, that I had charged Hague with being the father of my daughter's child; I told Mrs. Bennett; she is here to-day—I cannot recollect who else I told—I knew that my daughter was going before a Magistrate in Oct. to obtain a summons against Hague—I did not know it before she went—I did not go with her, and I did not go the second time—I did not go before the Magistrates at Brentford; I did at Clerkenwell—I have beaten my child Emma, but not for being out late—I never knew that she was keeping company with young men, and never complained to her about it—I tell you deliberately, on my oath, that I never scolded her for being out late at night—if anybody says that I have done so, it is not true.</p>

I know the defendant perfectly well, and have known him about three years—on 4th Nov., 1854, I was on a visit to him; I was with him on Sunday, the 5th—I went on the 4th; I met him that evening at the Cross Lances, at Hounslow, in company with my brother, between 8 and 9 o'clock—I went home with him after leaving the Cross Lances, and slept with him on that Saturday night, at his mother's—I remained with him on the Sunday—I recollect that day, because it was the day before Guy Fawkes day—I slept with him on the Sunday night, and left on the Monday, I think—we went to Hampton-court on the Sun<lb/>day—I dined with him and my brother on the Sunday, and in the after<lb/>noon we went to Hampton-court, to an uncle of mine, where we had tea—we returned about half past 11 o'clock—we left Hampton-court about 7, 8, or 9 o'clock, and called at Teddington on our way home, to see another uncle of mine, who kept the King's Head there—I know perfectly well what Sun<lb/>day I am speaking of; it was on 5th Nov.—no, I have made a mistake, I was to have gone on the 5th, and I went on the following Sunday, the 12th, or rather Saturday, 11th—I wish to correct myself—I wrote to Mr. Hague, saying I would come down on Saturday, 4th Nov., but from some circum<lb/>stance or other which I do not now recollect, I was prevented, and I wrote to him to say I would come down on the following Saturday; that was the 11th—it was on the 12th that I went to Hampton-court with him—when I said it was the day before Guy Fawkes day, it was said inadvertently—I was with Hague the whole of Sunday, the 12th—I returned home with him, and slept with him—I left him on the Monday or Tuesday, I will not be certain which.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 121, St. John-street, and am a trimming manufacturer. I recollect, early in April, going to the house of the prisoner, in Holborn; Mr. Button was with me—it was between 4 and 5 o'clock—I saw the prisoner in the back parlour—Mr. Sutton introduced me to him, to buy some goods—I spoke to the prisoner about the goods that I had come to purchase, and he produced me this sample—I asked him the price and the quantity, and he furnished me with a list of the articles—this is the list: "23lbs. of twist, 116 girdles, 40 reels," etc.—I told him I would call again—I went again the next day, and he gave me a sample, I took it to Mr. Earl, in Watling-street, and he sent it to Mr. Evans—the policeman afterwards came to my house, and Mr. Hotter, and it was arranged that I should go to the prisoner's house, and Mrs. Weller should accompany me—I went, and told the prisoner that I had come respecting the goods that I had received a sample of previously—he said, "I don't know but <hi rend="italic">what</hi> they are sold; I had a party here on Friday night, but I was busy"—I said, "Well, if they are, so be it"—he said, "I have not received a deposit on the goods "—I said, "Very well, if you have not sold them, I will purchase"—we made a bargain about them—the whole of the goods were not shown to me then, but I agreed to pay for the quantity mentioned in this paper 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid a deposit of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he gave me this receipt: "Received of Mr. Legge, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account of goods bought"—I and Mrs. Weller then left the house, and I made a communi<lb/>cation to the police, who were outside at the time—I gave the sample to the police—I had made an arrangement with the prisoner to go in the afternoon to fetch the bulk of the property.</p>

               <p>interview—the bulk of the goods was not shown me then, but I took the sample and asked the prisoner if he would invoice the goods—he said, "I am not likely to invoice another man's goods"—I said, "Well, there is an end of the matter; I shall not buy without an invoice "—he then said he would see the party—I was coming away with the sample, and he called me back asked me for the sample, and I gave it him, and he gave me my sovereign back—I went after that with Mrs. Weller on the morning of the 14th—I paid for the goods I had, and I agreed to give 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the lot—I should not have liked to have given a great deal more for them, as fancy goods alter so much in price—when he showed me the tassels he asked me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them—I told him I could manufacture a portion of them at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not myself know the exact value of the great bulk of the property—publicans are not likely to know the price of goods, they would be more likely to ask the price that others ask them.</p>

On 14th April I went with Mr. Legge and Mrs. Weller to the Blue Posts—after Mr. Legge had been in then some time, he came out and gave me a sample of twist and this receipt—I went again with Moss and Mollineux at 4 o'clock in the afternoon—I saw the prisoner go in with Moss and Mollineux, and I went in after them—Mollineux asked the prisoner where the rest of the goods were—the prisoner said they were not in the house—Moss asked him where they were, and he denied again that they were in the house—I believe he said they were somewhere in John-street, and if we would give him an hour he should he able to get them—Mr. Rotter, the 'prosecutor, came in, and he said to him, "The sample that you sold this morning are my goods; I give you in charge"—I asked him where the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was that was paid for a deposit, and be gave it me—we proceeded to search, and in the drawers in the bedroom up stairs I found a bunch of keys—I took them, and the prisoner straggled with me, and tried to get them—I let him have them, and while I was searching another drawer I saw he was trying to get one key off the bunch, and I took them from him—on the landing, close to the bedroom door, I saw a box, or chest; I asked him for the key of that box—he said there was nothing there but linen—I tried to open it with the key that the pri<lb/>soner had been trying to take off the ring—I found it opened it, and in the box I found this writing desk—when I found it the prisoner said, "I will give you anything not to take it down," or "down stairs"—we both replied "We must take it down "—he said, "For God's sake, don't take it down"—I took charge of him, and took him out.</p>

that he had been several times in a state of in<lb/>toxication, and that had been the occasion of it—he said that he had received between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that he had not accounted for—he was asked for the keys and the cash box, and that he delivered up—he was ulti<lb/>mately discharged—the Directors had no power to discharge him—that was done at a subsequent meeting—these receipts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are signed by the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">These were for</hi> 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;

during that fortnight other business had been done, he had received 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the particulars constituting that sum are entered—they do not include this sum from St. Margaret, Westminster—it appeared that the prisoner had paid to the bankers 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;

               <p>except that he was careless—I cannot say whether the sums on 30th April were paid by cheques—the receipts are the prisoner's writing—I have, the banker's book here—I see that on that day 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid in—when he received money it was his duty to account as soon as the Board day occurred, and there was a Board day every fortnight; on the second Thurs<lb/>day in the month, and on the last Thursday—if he received moneys on the Friday he would pay them into the bank, and account for them the next Board day—he should from time to time enter in the cash book what he received before the Board day—I am afraid his habit was not to enter till he went to pass the account—what he received generally was contained in books of charges of fees—he does not go to collect money except in parishes where he might call—he should enter the money at once in the cash book—he lived at the office—at the meetings of the Directors he had to account for the money he received during the fortnight—I apprehend he himself, went to the banker's with the money; we are not present to witness it—if he paid in ten cheques amounting to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it would be entered short, no doubt—this minute book is his writing—it is copied from a sheet of foolscap paper—these entries are taken from the book of charges and fees—when he receives money he fills up a page of the book—one duplicate is given to the customer, and one is left with the Company—he is present when the Directors are examining it—he comes to the meeting with these details on a rough sheet, which he has prepared from the various books in the office.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know that he has ever debited himself with money that bag not been paid to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware of it—there were some petty accounts which he said he had paid which he ought to have received a warrant from the Directors to pay—they were a number of small items, and there was a difference of opinion whether they were ours or not—it did not appear on the face of it—he stated that a sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was debited to him which had not been paid, and that there was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him; the date of it was 10th May; but inquiries were made, and it had not been paid to him—the disbursements that he said he had made were about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was subsequent to his sending this letter—since the delivery of this letter the books have been in my possession—he wrote this letter on 13th Aug.—we had not suspected him of any irregularities before that—he had appeared careless and inattentive—there was no person to receive money but the prisoner—he was the only clerk in the office—I am not aware that it hat frequently happened that be has received money, and not accounted and paid it in till the second Board meeting after he received it—I will swear that I do not know it—he stated that lately he has been given to take a little more drink than he should do—we had security with him.</p>

On 13th May last he came to my shop, and brought a gold watch, and offered it to me for sale—there was nothing attached to it—this is the watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if it was his own—he said no, it did not belong to him, but to a young man in the city—I asked him what the young man wanted to sell it for—he said, because he wanted money—he asked 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I gave him three guineas—I remember Mrs. Stanton coming to my shop about 6 o'clock on the Thursday evening, two days afterwards—before she came, I had sold the watch to a gentleman—I do not know his name—I sold it in my shop over the counter.</p>

               <p>charged with receiving this watch—I am an optician and jeweller—I am not a watch maker—I have carried on business in the Walworth-road for about seven years, and there has never been any complaint against me—I have not been in business before that—I have never been in trouble—I swear that—I know the value of this watch—I have been informed that it is worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was stated to be worth 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the papers against me—it would be worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the trade, it would be worth something more to a purchaser—I sold it to a gentleman—I do not know that gentleman, not by name, I know him by sight—I got 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—that I swear—I sold it for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to a gentleman I do not know.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long were you in custody before the watch was returned to the prosecutrix? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The watch was returned when I was out of custody—I was out on bail to get the watch back again—it was given up at the police court, Guildhall; I brought it in the first instance; as soon as I received the watch, I took it to the prosecutrix—it was given up to her in the police court—I offered myself as a witness immediately—the Alderman refused to allow me to be sworn—I could not offer myself as a witness, because I was given into custody for receiving the watch, well knowing it was stolen—I certainly can swear that I did not know it was stolen—I did not know it was stolen at the time the prisoner brought it to me—I did not ask him, when he brought it, whether it was <hi rend="italic">square,</hi> or whether it was got <hi rend="italic">on the cross;</hi> nothing of the kind, I asked no such question—I said nothing about its being <hi rend="italic">regular,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">on the cross,</hi> nor anything to that effect—I did not say that I wanted to know whether I could hang it in my window, or whether I should keep it quiet; I never said anything of the kind to him—I swear that—I did not say to the prisoner that he ought to have told me in the first instance that it was stolen; he represented to me that It belonged to a young man in the City, and that he gave it him to sell because he wanted the money, and that was on Whit Tuesday, and I considered it very feasible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Edmonds and Remnant, bookbinders, Lovell's-court, Paternoster-row. The prisoner was in our service about eight or nine years, about seven years as porter, and the last two years as carman—we have stables in the Oxford Arms-passage, Warwick-lace—in consequence of some communication from Mr. Ford, I went to the loft over those stables about 2 o'clock on the 9th May—the prisoner was not there—I there found eleven books in a rabbit hutch—I have the list of them here, they were valuable books—among them were two volumes of "Knapp's Chemistry," bound by us for Mr. Bailliere, of Regent-street—that is rather an expensive book—the value of the whole eleven books I should imagine to be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the cost of the binding would only be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—nine of them were bound by us—all the books bound by us ought to have been delivered to the respective publishers—it was the prisoner's duty to have done so—after finding the books I got the assistance of a policeman—I went with him into Mr. Ford's house, opposite the stable—after remaining there some time the prisoner came to the stable, and I saw him come out again with two books in his hand—this was about 3 o'clock—the policeman followed him, and took him into custody in my presence—the books he had in his hand were these two volumes of "Knapp's Chemistry," which I had seen previously in the loft—another book, "The Words of Jesus," was taken from his pocket—that was published in 1855—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185606160024"/>
               <p>I do not know when that was bound—the prisoner lives in Gray's Inn-road—I went with the policeman to his lodging, and saw about 100 volumes there, worth about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I could not say how many of those volumes were bound by us, I should think about half; some of them recently—it would have been the prisoner's duty to deliver the books bound by us, to the respec<lb/>tive publishers—I cannot state how he might have got the others which were not bound by us.</p>

I know the prisoner by sight—I have seen him at the stables from time to time—I have seen him in the loft with several books, I cannot gay when—about Christmas time I noticed him with two books, and it was that which drew my attention to him—they appeared handsome books, in maroon covers—I saw him very particular with one book, he put it down, took up another, turned it over and over, scraped it with his nail, and blew it (<hi rend="italic">describing the motion</hi>)—it was the inside of the book that he was scraping or rubbing.</p>

               <p>London Docks"—one of them said that they had been at the Row all the evening—next morning, Sunday, 11th, I went to Messrs. Price's premises, and found the window of the store room broken open, and footmarks in the gutter leading to the window of the store room—the gutter is on the roof of a lower building—I saw the inspector compare one of Ward's boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with the mark in the gutter; it corresponded exactly with the nails, and with the part where there are no nails—there was also some chalk on the bottom of one of the boots, and I saw some chalk on the head board of the boat in which we found the brass—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the head board; it is in the same state in which we found it—there is chalk on the wharf close to the water side—there is pitch on Messrs. Price's pre<lb/>mises, on the ground leading to the staircase, here and there: a quantity of pitch had been landed there, and I found pitch on the head board of the boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you compare the footmarks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—these art not ordinary waterman's boots, they are Bluchers—they are worn by all labouring men, but not by boatmen—the nails seem to me regular, but I think one is wanting—the tip of the heel is a little worn—the impression was in mud in the gutter, but it had dried, it was good—I compared it on Sunday morning—when I first saw it I threw a bag over it, so that the wet should not get at it if it rained—I did not put the boot down into the print, nor did inspector Brydges; he made two other impressions, and com<lb/>pared them with the other—I did not count the nails—that was between 6 and 7 o'clock in the evening—there had been no rain up to that time—I have on Wellington boots, without nails—the Old Rose public house is on this aide of the river.</p>

                  </hi>. I am store keeper in the service of Messrs. Price and Co. There is a store warehouse where the brass and old materials are kept—we had some brass safe there on Saturday morning, 10th May, at 8 o'clock; everything was secure at that time, and I locked the door after me—I went to open the premises about half past 6 o'clock on Sunday morning; and near 10 o'clock I found a great quantity of brass on the wharf—in consequence of what Ariel told me I went into store room, and missed about a cwt and a half—this brass (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) has never been used on the premises, it has been knocked out of fittings which have been bought as on brass—I should have noticed if it had been taken away on Saturday—I left the pre<lb/>mises about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock at night—if I do not see the watch<lb/>man when I leave, I secure the strong lock which is on the gate, and go away—he came that night before I went away, and I paid him his money—I have known Ward since he was a child; he has occasionally been employed on the premises carrying out wood and coals—a dog is kept on the premises chained up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police inspector</hi>). On Sunday evening, 11th May, I took off Ward's shoes, took them to Messrs. Price's, and made with the left shoe another impression by the one in the gutter, and there could be no mistake about their corresponding—I counted the nails, but could not count the impressions of them, as there was an accumulation of soot nearly an inch deep, which made a sort of furrow—the nails in the middle of the soles are in an oblique direction, and they corresponded—persons may get from the river side over the wharf, and through some gates over a low roof, and by climbing, which I did, up the side of a wall by the engine house—there is a slanting roof from there to the metal house, where an accumulation of soot would run down with the rain—I endeavoured to bring the impression away out of the gutter, but it would not hold together—that gutter leads to the window which was found open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Hartley—I had been weighing silk previously—he merely said that he was taking a skein or two—he had no authority to do so—I told him we had missed a great quantity of silk—he made no reply—I told him we had missed a great quantity of staylaces; he said, "Staylaces?"—I said, "Yes"—he made no further reply—this is the silk he had, it is worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was behind his coat—he had not buttoned his coat—he was at the silk drawer when I went up—he had no right to be in the warehouse at all—he had been ordered to put the shutters up.</p>

On Saturday night, 17th May, I was in the back parlour, a little after 10 o'clock—I heard a strange noise at the outer door, that leads to the street, as though some one was on the landing—I said to the girl, "Sarah, have you been up stairs?"—she said, "No"—I listened again, and heard a noise—I was sure some one was getting in—I heard footsteps over head in the bed room—I ran to the street door, and called "Policeman!" and "Mur<lb/>der'."—while I was doing so, a man jumped down from the leads of the first floor into the area—he said, "Don't be alarmed"—he had something in his hand, which I thought was a pistol—he was coming towards me, I drew back into the passage, and closed the door, or partly closed it—I believe the prisoner is the man—I went to the bedroom with the policeman—I found the catch of the window torn off, and it was hanging down—there had been a wash hand stand under the window, which was a little removed, and the window was wide open—I had seen that window between 6 and 7 o'clock—it was then shut and fastened—it had not been opened all day—no one had come in at the front door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the house of Messrs. Codd and Co., army agents, in Fludyer-street, and have been so nineteen years. They acted as agents for Mrs. M'Nair, the prisoner—I was acquainted with her the whole time they acted as her agents—I transacted business for her as their clerk, and corresponded with her from 1843 up to the present time, on business—I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from her in 1844—it bears the postmark of 27th Nov., 1844, and was posted at Lewisham—that is the place from which we received her letters, and to which we addressed letters—I know her handwriting—the whole of this letter is in her writing, both the signa<lb/>ture and the body—she first came to Messrs. Codd's in the year 1843, she was introduced by a Mr. Augustus Minniken, as a widow—she was present at the time of the introduction—in Nov., 1855, she called at our office—she came in consequence of our having refused to let her have any more money—I have paid cheques for her, I mean cheques drawn on our house—she applied in Nov. last for the usual sums which we paid her on account of her accruing pensions—our house received money for her on account of two pensions, the Lord Olive Fund, and the Madras Military Fund—they were received by our firm at the house of the East India Company—we continued to receive the Olive Fund from 1843, up to 31st Dec. last—when the prisoner came to us in Nov. we had received a letter, which was shown to her, and she read it—Mr. Codd was present as well as myself—this is the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "To Messrs. Codd. Nov. 16th, 1855. Sir,—Informed that you are agent for Mrs. M. E. M'Nair. I beg to notify to you that it will be well not to pay any monies to her until I call upon you personally on Wednesday, to place certain documents involving the legality of her right before you. It is only in compliment to yourself that I am instructed to write this to you. <hi rend="italic">Signed,</hi> M. C. Warren.

The person who intro<lb/>duced me to you was this Dr. or Mr. Minniken, and lately requiring a sum of money to carry on some mining operations in Germany, he did everything he could to induce me to raise a sum of money for that purpose, even if I could on the policy of my life insurance. But not meeting Mr. Minniken's views on this point, he turns round and threatens to injure me, in every possible manner with you, to the extent that I am married; but this I peremptorily deny, he has not and cannot have any proof of such marriage taking place. The threat he holds out to you regarding me is done merely to give me annoyance. I am not in his debt; on the contrary, he owes me upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. He is now in the Queen's Bench, having been removed lately from Horsemonger-lane Prison; his debts are numerous, and in every respect he has acted disreputable, and truly disgraceful, which is well known in the City. He has assumed the name of Dr. Augustus Ligonier Minniken, his name being James Minniken; he is quite an adventurer, and I know he does not and never did possess a shilling property. Messrs. Watson, solicitors, near Finsbury-square; Mrs. Robinson, No. 34, George-street, Minories; or Mr. Laurie, Fleet-street, will bear me out in what I state; and several others. This Captain Marriott I do not know, but I am given to understand he was formerly a Cornet in some regiment, went to Bombay, and sent home for bad conduct. He is also in the Bench, a companion of Mr. Minniken's. I deny his having any certificate of my marriage, indeed, he cannot; and I hope you will take no notice of his letters. He is a most base, worthless fellow, devoid of all feeling and character. I have not done anything to injure him, more than what I now state, but his threats I dis<lb/>regard, and have told him so; he has done now all he possibly can do in writing to you. M. E. M'Nair.")—We were satisfied with the receipt of that letter, and the person writing the letter signed Warren not having come as he said he would, to bring the documents he spoke of, we continued to act as her agents—in March last she again came to our office; that was on the subject of a second letter that we had received—we showed her that second letter, and she read it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "To Messrs.

Sir,—I am directed to inform you it is now decided to send Mrs. M'Nair's certificate of the marriage which took place at Bow Church on the 28th May, 1846, to Grindlays and Co.; but, previous to taking this course, a respect for you sincerely entertained by a gentleman whom you do not know, induces the parties concerned to give you this notice, in order that you may retain any sum due to you from policy of insurance, or other<lb/>wise. In fact, I am requested to advise you that, from circumstances which you may conceive to be grave, the placing of the certificate in the hands of the proper authorities cannot be deferred; this being unfortunately forced upon those by whom I am commissioned to address you.

Henderson.")—when she had read that letter she neither denied the con<lb/>tents of it or admitted them; she made no remark—we told her that if the face of that letter we could let her have no more money—we said that from that letter, and the search for the marriage, and the particulars given, we had no doubt of her having forfeited all right to receive her pension, and that we could act for her no longer—we had received the quarter's dividend for her up to 31st Dec., 1855—the next was due on 31st March following</p>

Codd for the proof that they alluded to, and that the case would have to go before the Committee of the Fund—I told her that there were rumours that she had been married, and I asked her if she would make an affidavit that she had not, and as far as I now recollect she declined to make it—she said she was not married, that there was no truth in the report—I then had some conversation with her about her children—this is the letter she wrote, about a copy of Mr. Codd's letter—I (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "To H. Low, Esq. April 8th, 1856. Sir,—I beg leave to request that you will have the kindness to forward me, at your convenience, a copy of Mr. Codd's letter regarding my pension. <hi rend="italic">Signed,</hi> M. E. M'Nair, care of Mrs. Gray, No. 10, Tottenham-court-road, New-road, Begent's-park.")—on the Monday following, I believe, the 14th April, she came again to our office, and was then taken into custody—I believe the signature of Mary Minniken to both these registers to be the prisoner's writing.</p>

On 7th May, the prisoner was employed in the newspaper office, the upper office; he was a newspaper sorter and letter carrier—it was his duty to sort newspapers that were intended to go by that night's mail; this occurred about 35 minutes past 5 o'clock—these three newspapers were given into my possession by Smith, they had no addresses upon them, one is a newspaper called <hi rend="italic">Lloyd's,</hi> of 4th May; one is the <hi rend="italic">Bath Express,</hi> of 3rd May; and the third is the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> of 3rd May—I sent for the prisoner into a private room, and asked him if he had thrown any newspapers down the foreign shoot—he said he had not—I asked him again if he was sure, and he said, "Yes"—I then said I had reason to believe that he had, and I showed him this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> and asked him if he had seen that paper before—he looked at it and said he had not—I said I had reason to believe that he had sent these papers down the foreign shoot, that I should call in a constable, and must give him in charge, and have him searched—he became very much alarmed, and said, "I did tear the papers"—I asked him what could induce him to have done such a thing—he said he could not tell, more than he was afraid of missending them, and that he had lately missent a large number of newspapers, for which he had been heavily fined—Peak, the officer, then came in, I desired him to search the prisoner—he did so in my presence, and took from his pockets these covers, and pieces of other newspapers—some of the addresses on these papers are plainly writ<lb/>ten—I have compared the pieces with the three newspapers in question, and they fit—here is one, "Mrs. Rugeley, St. James's-house school, Isle of Wight;" another is, "Mrs. Alexander, Axford, near Marlborough, Wilts;" the third address is quite illegible, it is so bad that we cannot read it; there appears to have been a postage stamp on it—by throwing the papers down the shoot, the prisoner would get them out of his way, and prevent their being forwarded by the poet, otherwise they would have gone by that night's mail—it was his duty to have sent them to the road at which he was—what we call a road is a frame of boxes at which the papers are sorted—he had the Blandford-road—the paper addressed "Isle of Wight," would come into that road—if the others had come into his possession he should have put them on one side for the messenger to take to the general sorters to be re-sorted—it was quite out of course to throw them down the foreign shoot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Robert Overbury; he occupies a warehouse on the ground floor of No. 13, Basinghall-street, in the parish of St. Michael Bassishaw. Mr. Nathaniel Overbury keeps goods there, but he is not in partnership with Mr. Robert Overbury—the ware-house is on the ground floor in front, and at the back there is a counting house, which has a skylight over the whole of it—Mr. Salaman is a solicitor, and he occupies an office over the warehouse—there is nothing over the counting house—there is a window from Mr. Salaman's office which comes to the skylight—on 7th May there were some boards lying on the skylight—the workmen had been at work the day before, laying some lead on—I know Mason's-alley—there is a wall there, over which you can get to our premises—there is just one warehouse between Mr. Overbury's warehouse and the alley, and by getting over that wall access could he had to our premises—that is the way the workmen went up—on the evening of 7th May I left the warehouse about 25 minutes past 6 o'clock—I was the last person who left—I locked the warehouse door, and took the two keys with me, a Chubb patent lock, and another lock—at that time everything was safe—on the following morning I was called to the warehouse at a little after 6 o'clock—my residence is at No, 27, Basinghall-street—I went to the warehouse, and found two policemen there—I saw seven pieces of woollen goods near the street door—some of them were Mr. Robert Overbury's—the greater part were Mr. Nathaniel Overbury's—they were in the warehouse, and covered up, when I left on the previous evening—they had just come in—they were given back to us by order of the Magistrate, because we had them for an order—I went from the street door to the warehouse door, which is on the left hand side of the passage—that was the door that I had left locked, and both the staples were off—the screws had been drawn—the bolts of the locks were shot—they must have been opened from the inside of the warehouse—there is an alarm bell there, the wire of that was let loose, and the hammer was down on the bell, so that it could not strike by opening or shutting the door—I found five or six more pieces of cloth had been removed—I noticed the skylight of the counting house—there is a counter under the skylight, and on the counter there was a plank in an inclined position from the skylight down to the counter, so that any one could slide down—a pane of glass had been taken out of the skylight—that glass was all safe the night before—I went up stairs to Mr. Salaman's office—I found the door of his back office had been broken open from the inside—that could have been done by getting in at the window from the skylight, and the window was</p>

I sleep on the premises, at the top of the house—on the night of 7th May, I fastened the street door at half past 9 o'clock—at that time the house was all safe—on the following morn<lb/>ing, the 8th, there was a knock at the door directly after the clock struck 6—I went down part of the way, and hearing a noise it gave me rather a start (I had expected a man to come at 6 o'clock)—when I got to the second flight of stairs, I saw Mr. Salaman's office door open—I got to the foot of the stairs against the door, and saw three men inside the office—they went out of the window over the desk, and got on to the skylight—I said, "What are you doing here?"—they made no answer—I went to the window, and saw the three men going to the wall of Mason's-alley—they were on their hands and knees, scrambling over towards the wall—I called, "Thieves!"—one of them went over the wall, the others attempted to go over, and turned back, and went over into the churchyard—I still called, "Thieves!" and they got away—I went down and opened the door—I saw the goods behind the door—I found at the door the man that was come to do the work—I sent him for Mr. Overbury's porter—the prisoners are two of the men that I saw that morning, I have not the least doubt of it—I went to the station, and there I saw Williams.</p>

Benjamin's property—we never sell any of that class of baskets, they cost half a crown each—I returned to Bakers-buildings, and then went back again with an officer to Wheeler's—we then went to a house in Brick-lane—Skinner and Wood<lb/>ruffe were brought together, and I said to Wheeler, "Which is the man that you bought the baskets of?" and he pointed to Skinner—I said, "These are Mrs. Benjamin's property, I must give you into custody"—he made no remark, and the officer took him to the station—I went to Skinner's house with the officer, to see if there was any more property there, and Woodruffe was close to the door—I gave him into custody.</p>

"What do you think of them I"—there were six barrels to each revolver—there were also two single barrelled pistols, and two daggers, and two or three small bottles—when he asked me what I thought of them, I said they were <hi rend="italic">stunners</hi>—I said "I see you are well prepared for it"—he said, "By G—, they have never deceived me yet, and they are not going to do it either; I am a dead shot with either of these pistols"—he showed me how the pistols worked—he said, "I can discharge every one of these barrels as quick as I can Work my finger"—I then saw him feed the pistols—he loaded them with balls—in some barrels he put two halls, and in some one—he did not load them all—I only saw him load the two six-barrelled revolvers—I did not see him load the single pistols; I do not know whether they were loaded—lie then put them into his bag, and put it into his bunk, where he slept—it does not shut down or shut up in any way; it stands about five feet off the deck—I asked him what was in <hi rend="italic">them</hi> bottles—he said, "Ton can judge," and carefully put them back again into the bag—I saw that the bottles were full of something; it was a liquid—in the course of that day one of the crew went to the boatswain for some spun yarn—he gave it him, and said he must be very careful of it, for they must soon begin to make some—the prisoner laid to me, "Do you hear that? if he lives to see any span yarn made, I am deceived"—on the following day (Wednesday, 20th) the prisoner came to me, as I was coming from the wheel, and said he was frightened that Whittington would have nothing to do with it, "but b—him, we will get his revolver, and then we don't care whether he joins or not; we will talk it over in the next watch; we can settle Whittington; don't you think you and I can manage it?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I will go and sound Jonathan," meaning a seaman of the name of Hugh Kent, who went by the name of Jonathan—he then went over to Kent, who was on the other side of the deck, and had some conversation with him, which I did not hear—while he was with Kent, Whittington went over to him; he came back, and said that they had some brandy there, and the prisoner had asked him to have some; after that the prisoner came over, and said, "It is all right, I find he is staunch as a piece of iron, and we don't care whether Whittington jobs or not now;</p>

William Lewis being at this time at the wheel, sent Mr. Harris, the second mate, with Whittington and Bolitho, to seize the arms in his bunk; they exactly agreed with their description of them, consisting of two six-barrel Colt revolvers, loaded, and in perfect order, two single-barrel pistols, two bowie knives, bullets, caps, and powder")—I made that entry on 6th March, copied from one taken down at the time the statement was made—I took it down at the time from their mouths, and afterwards made an accurate copy of it into the log, and read it over to Whittington and Bolitho—I have not</p>

                  </hi>. I am hawk boy to a plasterer; I live at No. 1, Law<lb/>rence-yard, Queen's-row, Chelsea. On Saturday night, 17th May, I went to the Three Crowns public house in Queen's-row, about a quarter after 10 o'clock—I went into the skittle ground at the back of the premises—it is lighted with gas—there is one burner—there is not light from the house at one side of the skittle room—on the other side there is a door and window—it is the skittle ground window—when I went, skittle playing was going on—there were about ten persons there altogether—the three prisoners were there—I sat down; I was not playing, nor were either of the prisoners—I had a silver-watch in my waistcoat pocket, and a metal chain round it passed through a button hole of the waistcoat—Durkin sat next to me, Sullivan sat next to him, and Vickery was standing on the floor—I saw Sullivan stand</p>

               <p>up and tap Darking on the thigh, and he pointed to my watch in my pocket—Sullivan stood up and went over to the gas; he stood there about four or five seconds, and turned the gas off—I stood up to go out, and Durkin put his hand round my shoulders, put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and pulled my watch out—he <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> me against the wall, and got wrenching the watch off the chain—he gave the watch to his mate Vickery—when they let me go I got to the door, and as Durkin and Vickery came to the door, I saw Durkin give Vickery the watch—there was light from the air—it was an open place where I stood—the night was rather light—it was about a quarter before 11 o'clock—I called out when they had hold of me—the first thing I said was, "Now, Durkin, leave me alone, it is no use your trying to rob me; I know you"—I did not hear anybody else call out till they let go of me—I heard some one call out, "Scale the wall!"—I went out before Durkin and Vickery—I went out of the skittle ground into the yard; I remained in the yard about two minutes—I left Durkin and Vickery still there, and I went for a policeman—I brought one back in ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour—I saw Sullivan there—I told the police<lb/>man that I charged him with <hi rend="italic">outing</hi> the gas—I did not say that in Sulli<lb/>van's hearing—I told the policeman in Sullivan's presence that he was one of the party—Sullivan was taken in charge—I knew all the prisoners before—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a contractor, and live in Millington-street Vauxhall-bridge-road On 27th May I was in the Broad Sanctuary, at Westminster, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the evening—I was walking along the footway—I passed the three prisoners, and two other females—I had advanced some few yards, when Scott came and passed outside me, and put his hand into my right hand pocket, and drew out my handkerchief—I took hold of his hand, and desired him to put it back again—he immediately struck me on the nose, and caused it to bleed—I loosed his wrist, and took him by the collar, and paid him back in return—I do not know whether I gave him a black eye, but he was pretty well scarified before I left him; we had a tumble up and down, and a regular street fight—I was all the time calling for the police—Blackman and Moore were in the mean time assisting Scott, trying to pull me off him; they attempted to rescue Scott from me—there were two other females with them—Scott made his escape from me, and ran into the arms of a gentleman who was following behind me—the females had hold of me—I directly disengaged myself from them, and followed Scott again, still calling for the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Eaton-terrace, Pimlico. On the night of 27th May, I was walking in the Broad Sanctuary—I saw Scott and four women—Scott stepped out from the women, and took Mr. White's handker<lb/>chief out of his pocket—it is rather a narrow passage, and there were four <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> there—Blackman and Moore were two of the females who were with Scott—when Scott took the handkerchief, Mr. White got hold of his hand, and asked him to put it back, and instead of patting it back, Scott struck him on the nose, or close by the nose, with his other hand—the four women closed on Mr. White, and Scott got away—I caught him, and had a severe struggle with him, till Mr. White got rid of the women and came up—I gave Scott to Mr. White and they had a fall up and down; they both went down against a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> wheel—a cabman came up (there were four cowmen, but one more particularly than the others)—he kicked Mr. White—the prisoner with the child (<hi rend="italic">Slack-man</hi>) said to another woman, "Hold my child," and then she tried to get Scott away—I will not swear whether she kicked Mr. White or not, but she was very busy, and she tried to get Mr. White off Scott—Mr. White got up on his legs, and Scott with him, and three women and the cabman got Mr. White against the railings, and Scott got away—I followed and took him again as he was running down George-street—I had a severe struggle with him—he tripped me up—I had nothing to hold by but his handkerchief, his clothes were nearly torn off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father Solomon Harris, at No. 22, Well-street, as tailors and outfitters—the prisoner was our fore<lb/>man for about fifteen months, he lodged in the house—it was his duty to cut out clothes and to receive them when they were made—he had no authority from us to take clothes and pledge them—about five months ago we began to miss clothes—on 12th May, I think it was Thursday, I went into the prisoner's bed room, about 3 o'clock, and found him on the bed—I asked him what business he had on the bed at that time, he said that he had the head<lb/>ache—I told him it was not the place of a foreman to lie down at that time of day, and keep the front door of the shop shut, and he ran down into the shop—I looked under his bed, and found a pocket book with a letter in it, in which I found some duplicates—I went to the pawnbrokers to identify the clothes, and immediately after that, went up stain, and gave the pocket book to Williams, the servant, with instructions—I was in the shop when she came down and said to the prisoner, "Mr. Byrn, is this your pocket book?"—he said, "Yes"—I immediately called a policeman in, and gave him in charge.</p>

I was a shopman in the employ of the prisoner for about ten months—about 27th April last, he called me up stein into the sitting-room, and asked me if I had got a friend that could take care of some goods, furniture, etc—I said I thought I had, and I went to a friend of mine of the name of Clark—I saw the prisoner again the same evening, and told him that my friend Mr. Clark had room to take care of some goods—he requested me to get up at 6 o'clock the following morning, to assist in removing—I did get up at 6 o'clock, and found the prisoner in the shop—Long was not there then—he came down afterwards—Stallybrass was not there—I assisted in removing—there was a van at the door—I believe it was sent <hi rend="italic">by</hi> Chalk—I assisted in getting six bags of coffee into the van, a sofa, a chest of drawers, and two hampers containing glass—I then went with the van to Mr. Clark's, No. 4, Princes-street, Spitaifield's—about two hours afterwards I saw the prisoner again—he asked me if I had taken care of the goods, if I had delivered the goods—I said I had—this took place about a fortnight before the bankruptcy—'! remember a meeting of creditors at the Catherine Wheel Inn—these goods were removed about a week after that meeting—I remember the messenger from the Court of Bankruptcy coming—it was on a Saturday—I do not remember the day of the month—the prisoner was then in the shop—he did not give me any directions just then; in the evening when Stallybrass, the porter, was with me, he directed us to go up stairs and remove some spices that were in the top room—we were to remove a bag of pepper, a ton of spice and a bag of doves, through the trap door, on to the roof—we did so—the prisoner came there while we were removing them—that night after the shop closed I was called into</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Abchurch-lane; I am a lamplighter, in the employ of the City of London Gas Company. On 27th May I was on London-bridge, to put out the gaslights, about 20 minutes past 3 o'clock—I met a female on the bridge—she had a white straw bonnet on, trimmed with white ribbon—there was no one with her—she was on the west side of the bridge—I passed her—she was coming towards London; I was going to the south—I met her about the sixth column of the bridge—she had just got on the bridge from the south—I returned in about five minutes, and when I came back near the spot I saw the same female standing on the outer ledge of the bridge—that was further on towards London, fifty or sixty yards from where I had seen her before—when I saw her on this outside ledge, the prisoner was standing on the seat in the recess—he had hold of her wrist—I did not take notice which wrist it was; she was standing still—I noticed a man lying on the seat of the recess apparently asleep—the prisoner let go the woman's wrist, and I heard him say, "Jump in, go in, I will follow you"—on his saying that, she walked a small distance from him, and then dropped herself over—I went to the prisoner, and said to him, "You vagabond, you have murdered that girl"—he said, "My God! I did not think she would do it!"—I saw the girl in the water; she was floating up towards Blackfriars-bridge—I heard her call out, "Help! help! save me!"—that was when she was in the water—I gave an alarm, but she sank before the boats could get to her—she sank as near off Calvert's as could be—a person named Broom was on the east side of the bridge; he came over to the recess where the prisoner was standing, and laid hold of his collar—the officer took him.</p>

I did not think she would do it!"—he seemed as if he had been drinking a little, but he was not intoxicated, no ways out of the way—it might be excitement, or it might be drink—I have seen other women walk there for a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>—we picked up a lady there on the outside asleep—she sat on the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cook, at No. 139, Bishopsgate-street. On 27th May I was on London-bridge, about half past 3 o'clock in the morning—I was on the side next the London Docks, and coming towards the City—I met Letitia Barry on the bridge, and stopped to speak to her—I was standing still about two or three minutes—I was nearer to the Surrey side than to the middle of the bridge—I saw the prisoner on the other side; I saw him hand a young woman on to the parapet—they both stepped on to the seat first, and then he handed her over the parapet on to the ledge out-side—she left him, and went about two yards from him, and went into the water—I thought he could not have pushed her in; she must have jumped in; I did not see how she went in—he left her hand—I was not near enough to hear the prisoner say anything—I ran over as soon as I saw him hand her over the parapet, and while I was going across the road she went in—I took the prisoner by the collar—he said, "Let me go, let me go"—I said, "I shall not let you go till a constable comes"—a constable came, and he was given into custody—the prisoner might have been drinking—I was sober enough to know what I was doing—I should consider the prisoner sober—I noticed that the female had a white bonnet and white ribbon—I did not notice any other part of her dress—I 'did not see her face—a bonnet was afterwards" shown to me at the workhouse; in my judgment, it was the same bonnet—it was rather wide in front—it was a common kind of bonnet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the partners of the firm of M'Arden and Co.—the prisoner was in our employ, and had charge of the petty cash—we gave him money, and he had to keep it in his cash box supplied to him for the purpose, and he was to pay out of it the petty disbursements of the office—he had a book, and it was his duty to enter in it the money he received, and the payments he made—on 15th May I had occasion to refer to the prisoner's petty cash book, which is here—I found he had not added up either the debtor or the creditor column on 31st Dec.—the ordinary practice of the office is that the petty cash is balanced every month—I added it up myself, and found there was a balance of 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which had not been brought forward to the following page—the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was money that he ought to have had in his hand, which should have been carried forward to 1st Jan., and that is not done—I also found that he had not brought forward his balance from April to May—the balance was struck in April, and is 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that ought to have been carried to 1st May—that does not include the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when the prisoner came in the office, I told him to add up his book, and he did—I showed him the Dec. account which I had added up—between the Dec. and April, balances had been struck regularly every month, without taking in consideration the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told him to add up his book, and we would strike a balance, and the total deficiency was the 89<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 119<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making 208<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I asked him what had become of the money, if he could give any account of it—he said he could give no account of it at all, and it was a very serious thing for him—he sent for his mother—she came to the office, and he then stated (I held not the slightest threat or inducement to him) that he had taken out of the petty cash 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or a sovereign at a time, and that he might have taken to the extent of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my partner then spoke to him, and he said he might have taken 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or perhaps the whole amount.</p>

A. G.—during that time I have never looked in the book, as we had that confidence in the prisoner and Mr. Gordon—there were three clerks in the same office with Mr. Gordon and the prisoner—I used to go in and out of that office—I saw the cash book on the desk—Mr. Gor<lb/>don could have access to it—the prisoner bad the key of the box—there was no other key.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the North and South American Coffee house, Threadneedle-street. I remember the prisoner coming to me at the coffee house on 6th May—he had a basin of soup—after he had gone I missed a salt spoon and saltcellar—these are the articles I missed, I am quite certain—I was out of the room while I went for the soup, but I kept my eyes on the passage so that nobody could come in or out without my seeing him—he was in there alone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did you go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Down a few stairs, and the soup was handed to me across the banisters—there were two saltcellars on the table, one at each end—it was about five minutes after he left that I missed the saltcellar—it was in a different room where the saltcellars were—when he went away I remained in the room all the time; it was my duty to do so—we do not commence to have dinners till 1 o'clock—I know it was about 11 o'clock because I looked at the clock which was in the room—it might have been a few minutes later—the soup was kept ready—he was about five or ten minutes taking the soup—I had never seen him before that day—it was on 26th May that I saw him in custody—our's is a house into which foreigners come from time to time—in the course of a week more than a dozen foreigners come in—the plate passes through my hands several times in a day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk to Mr. Nicholson, the official assignee, I have attended to the matter of Avery's bankruptcy—I hare taken charge of the books, and examined the accounts—I have here a duplicate original of the bankrupt's balance sheet; it is from Jan., 1854, to 30th June, 1855—the deficiency at that time was 4419<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bankrupt petitioned for an arrangement, but it was not carried out—the adjudication is dated 30th June, 1855—the balance sheet does not show when he stopped payment—he appears by this to have been deficient on 1st Jan., 1854, to the extent of 2,5861. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the bankrupt either immediately after or before filing this duplicate balance sheet, and asked him several questions as to the purport of the figures in it, and he made a statement—I made a memoran<lb/>dum on the back, of the answers that he gave.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What statement did he make? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These are the words which I took down: "Commenced business about '45 or '46, in part<lb/>nership with John Hooper; had no capital of his own, but borrowed, in conjunction with Hooper, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Hooper's father, which 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was after<lb/>wards repaid; this partnership was dissolved about '47 or '48; a rough statement was taken then, showing a large deficiency; this statement was not preserved; the deficiency was nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; Mr. Avery took this defi<lb/>ciency upon himself, and continued the business, but he has never taken stock since the dissolution, or made a statement of account showing how he stood"—My object in putting that question was to see whether he had made a balance sheet—those are the exact words he said—I took them down from his lips—I do not know what other questions I may have asked, I took no more down—I have examined the defendant's cash book—there were a number of books, ledger, trade book, journal, &amp;c.—I have ex<lb/>amined those books (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) to see whether the figures in the balance, sheet were supported by them—the ledger was not written up for nearly two years—this is it—it commences in January, 1854, the time his balance sheet commences, and has been written up since the bankruptcy from sub<lb/>sidiary books—the cash book was written up—I believe only the journal, besides the ledger, has been written up since—the contract book appears to be an original book, with daily entries, and is written up fully to the time of the bankruptcy, also the bills of parcels book, and cash book—there are a number of other subsidiary books, of no importance—the cash book ap<lb/>pears to have been balanced daily, I think, without exception—it sometimes shows a balance in hand, at other times overpaid—in the month of April, 1855, I should think there were more balances in hand than overpaid—there are a number of entries of exchanged cheques at that time—here is one on 23rd April, "G. Clark; exchange 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and then, on the other side of the cash book, showing the repayment of it on 24th April, is, "G.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185606160117"/>
               <p>cheques, for I have in some cases found the cheque entered in the banker's I book—I asked the bankrupt about the word "exchange," and he told me that it meant the exchange of cheques—the total amount of such entries in April is 1,840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and in May about 2,070<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not included loans in that—there are entries of loans to the bankrupt—I have not taken out the amount of loans during April and May—on 2nd June the amount in the cash book balances, by bringing to the debit of the cash book the amount overdrawn from the banker's, 405<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the entry is on 31st May—there are other entries on 2nd June, which do not interfere with the balance—on the same day (30th June) there is a previous balance struck of 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. overpaid, and on the same day again another balance is struck of 544<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. overpaid—that represents a deficiency in cash to that extent—there is a balance on 29th May of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I find from the books that he sometimes sold goods at a profit, and sometimes at an amount less than the cost—during the three months before his bankruptcy he sold about 200 or 220 parcels of goods, some at a profit, others at a loss—I have here a detail of the goods account, filed by order of the court—the gross profit during the three months is 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is upon transac<lb/>tions amounting to 19,363<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no statement showing what the expenses were during that time—the balance sheet is for a year and six months, not for the three months only—about forty parcels of goods out of 220 were sold under the cost price—I cannot tell how soon after the pur<lb/>chase those sales were effected, not without tracing them through all the books—he appears in some cases to have bought on credit, and sold for ready money, but I have not traced sufficiently to give instances—the assets returned in the balance sheet as unencumbered, amount to 707<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they have produced up to the present time 365<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—those are the net assets, including the sale of the furniture—there are some debts yet out<lb/>standing; we may make more.</p>

Rickett and Co.—the prisoner did not know of that to my knowledge—there was a cheque for 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Barber; I handed that to Mr. Hewitt, Mr. Avery's solicitor, on the following morning, by Mr. Avery's direction, because he found, I believe, on taking the advice of his solicitor, that it would be advisable to stop pay<lb/>ment; that was on 2nd June—I handed this cheque over to the solicitor in the morning of 2nd June (<hi rend="italic">referring to the cash book</hi>)—on 21st April, I received another cheque from Barber and Son for 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was brought in to the account, it was paid in to Messrs.

               <p>that Mr. Avery had given Mr. Wagner a cheque dated 2nd June, and one to Messrs.

Avery, payable to Messrs. Trindle and Bingham; it says, "Refer to the drawer"—I recollect this cheque being returned, and its being taken up at the Royal British Bank, that bank not having the privilege of the clearing house—when I sent one of the clerks in the afternoon to pay in some cash at Messrs. Spooners', they told him they had paid in that cheque, I therefore sent the cash to the Bri<lb/>tish Bank, and took up the cheque, as I might a bill—that was on 28th May—these two cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced by Mr. Clark</hi>) are for 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 26th May, and 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., dated 28th May—they say "Refer to the drawer"—that means dishonoured; it means that the bankers decline pay<lb/>ing—the prisoner has not told me what amount of cheques were dishonoured—he did not tell me that cheques to the amount of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been dis<lb/>honoured between 28th May and the morning of 2nd June—he did not tell me any amount, nor mention any cheques—I knew before to<lb/>day that these two cheques were dishonoured—I knew it from Mr. Clark, not from Mr. Avery, Mr. Clark came to the counting-house the day they were returned, and told me they had been dishonoured—of course I told Mr. Avery of it, as soon as I saw him—I should say Mr. Clark brought them both at the same time, but I cannot positively recollect—I told Mr. Avery of it at the time, and Mr. Clark saw him—I cannot recollect whether these are the only cheques that I mentioned to Mr. Avery as dishonoured in the course of that week; it is more than twelve months ago—if a cheque was returned, I immediately informed Mr. Avery—I told him of all the cheques that had been returned, as soon as they were returned—I cannot exactly recollect what amount I told him was returned before the 2nd June—I recollect there were two cheques, one to Cook and one to Scott, which I told Mr. Avery of; I think one was for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 68<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I drew bank notes for those two amounts, and went and took up the cheques, by permission of Messrs. Spooner, on the morning after we were informed of it; I got the bank notes by an open cheque, that is, an uncrossed cheque, on Messrs. Spooners, which was honoured, and I got the cash—I knew what the state of the banking account was at Messrs. Spooners' at that time—Mr. Avery knew it—the cheque to Scott is dated 28th May, and that to Cook 29th—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I cannot say for certain whether I had paid any money in to Messrs. Spooner between the dishonour of these cheques, and the drawing of the open one; I paid some money in to the bankers that day, 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Chapman and Son, from Whitehead 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Granger, 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., G. Clark, 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 187<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have only four amounts down as paid in, making 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not obtained by loans, it was for goods—not goods bought on credit and sold for ready money; it was money arising from sales—the sale to Chapman and Son was fifty-three bags of sugar on the 17th, and this pay<lb/>ment was made on the 29th—the other sums were on goods bought pre<lb/>viously, and the warrants obtained on the day the cheques were taken up—there were other amounts paid that day, besides those—on 28th May, we bought of Fairey and Co., goods amounting to 278<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were bought at two months' credit—they were sold the same day for 276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say what was done with the money—the money was not received the same day; that parcel of goods was sold to nine different persons—some of the money was received afterwards, and paid in to the official assignee; some of it was paid in to Messrs. Spooners—there was more than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid to Mr. Hewitt—I do not know what Mr. Hewitt paid to the official assignee.</p>

The prisoner lives right opposite—his father keeps a broker's shop—I have had no quarrel with him lately—he has called me names, but I have not called him any—we did not have a quarrel on the night this happened—on 12th June, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was cleaning out the shop and saw the prisoner standing at his own doorway—he stood in the doorway, and threw something over me out of a cup which he had in his hand, which I thought at first was water—it burnt my face and the crown of my head very much—it marked my dress; I have it here—I saw a medical gentleman about half-past 10 o'clock—as soon as it was thrown over me I went up and complained to my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 4, Judd-place East, New-road. I saw the prosecutrix at the police station on the evening of 12th June—her cheek was slightly excoriated; not very much—there was a small sore produced by some excoriating substance which I tasted; it had a taste like diluted sulphuric acid—I am of opinion it was diluted acid which is used for domestic purposes—it would be diluted in the proportion of seven parts of water to one of acid—I examined her clothes; she had them on then—they were stained with the drops of the diluted acid—there was one hole through the cloth—the colour was gone, but I could restore it with ammonia.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That would show that the colour was not destroyed, but only damaged, would it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would—the hole was in the front of the dress—I am of opinion that it was made by burning, because there was more acid where the hole was burnt—it was about the size of a fourpenny piece.</p>

On that morning I began to draw the bread at a quarter past 6 o'clock—I called the prisoner, and he took it away as usual to carry it into the shop—I looked into the cart before it was loaded, I saw the sixteen loaves, they were part of what I had made that morning.</p>

On Saturday, 10th May, we were coming from Sheerness to London, and called at North Woolwich, that is on the north side of the river, coming up—the vessel is not allowed to carry passengers from North Woolwich to Blackwall—that was the first day we started on that passage; we stopped there to land pas<lb/>sengers, and the prisoners made an attempt to come in at the fore gangway—I told them they were coming on board the wrong boat, and said, "If you were to come here you would have to pay 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece"—I thought they were passengers for the penny boat going over the water—the pier man told them, in my hearing, that I was not allowed to take them—they then made another attempt at the after gangway—I got off the paddle box as they got on the gangway, and met King half way along it, and said, "Now we want no nonsense; you must go out"—I got him on to the pier, and another man, Morrisson, pinned me by the arms—I stepped down, jumped on to the paddle box, and said, "Go ahead;" and as we were going, King threw a tin can at me, which struck me on the lip, and cut it—it bled a great deal, and was so bad that I called the mate to take charge of the boat—I went to Charing-cross Hospital, and had it sewn up—I was an out patient four or five days.</p>

On Friday, 23rd May, at a quar<lb/>ter to 10 o'clock in the morning, Mr. Fletcher came to the station with the prisoner, and showed me a note—I said to the prisoner, <hi rend="italic">"Charley,</hi> where did you get it from?"—he said, "A man named <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Plumley gave it to me, and I got it changed"—I asked him who <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Plumley was—he said, "He was formerly a ticket collector at the gardens; you know him?"—I said, "I may have seen him, describe him to me"—he described him as about thirty years of age, about five feet six or seven inches high, dressed in a shiney cap, and black clothes generally; and he described his features as having a scar, a shot wound, on the side of his face, as though it went right through his mouth—I looked at the note, and seeing the name of Stacey on it, I said "But I see this has got Mr. Stacey's name on it"—he said, "Yes, I only put Mr. Stacey's name on this one"—I said, "What, have you changed some more then?"—he said, "Yes," he had changed one at Mr. Martin's, and one at Mr. Woolcock's—I said, "No doubt they are all forged then; is Mr. Stacey's name on them?"—he said, "No," he had only put Mr. Stacey's name on one—I said, "Did Plumley give you anything for doing this for him?"—he said, "He gave me a shilling"—I said, "What, da you</p>

B. Arnold.")—I sent a load and a half to the Willow-walk station of the Brighten Railway, consigned to J, B. Arnold, on 17th April—previous to that I had seat Mr. Green to London to make inquiries, and had sent samples, and he made a representa<lb/>tion to we, in consequence of which I sent up the hay—on 17th April I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—I shall be down at Rusper on Thursday next about the middle of the day, when I hope to have the plea<lb/>sore of seeing you. Be kind enough to let me have the clover as soon as you can. P.S.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 164), On 6th May I watched at the Brick<lb/>layers' Arms station, and saw Gardner come out with a load of hay. He met the prisoners 400 or 500 yards off, in Swan-street, Old Kent-road, facing the Swan public-house—they walked up to the van, took a piece each, and smelt it, returned it again, and had a conversation for about two minutes, and then Gardner led the horse, and Miller walked along on the pavement—I followed them, got assistance, and, about a quarter of a mile up the New Kent-road, walked up, put my hand on both the prisoners, and told them they were charged with obtaining the hay—Phillips said, "I know nothing of it at all; I have nothing to do with it"—Jacobs made no reply—I handed him over to a constable of the <hi rend="italic">N</hi> division—I found on Gardner the letter produced, but not the order; that came from the railway—Jacobs refused to give his address—Phillips gave his at No. 8, Arnold's place, Newington Butts—I went there, and found the house empty—there was only an old stool and an old broken chair there—I have made inquiries after Phillips's address—I found in his pocket the address, No. 7, Alfred-place, Union-street, St. George's-road, and went there the same night—I watched Arnold's-place from Saturday the 3rd or 4th—I first saw Phillips there on 29th April—I saw him receive a letter there on Monday morning, 5th May, and have seen him there five or six times—I looked at the post-mark on the envelope of the letter; it was "Rusper"—I found on Phillips the key of that house, and found the samples of hay there—I inquired for Balham Villas, but did not find them—I found Arnold, a butcher, on Clapham-common—I have seen him, but he is not an army clothier—it was not this man.</p>

I live in Alexander-street, Old Kent-road—on Friday morning, 16th May, I was going to my work, about 5 o'clock—I know a public house called the Turk's Head—that and the Kentish Drovers face one another on the Greenwich side of the canal bridge—I know Mr. Butler's house—there are two more shops and the gas factory besides Mr. Butler's before you get to the canal bridge—the Turk's Head is on the same side as Mr. Butler's, only lower down—I was coming towards London—when I came out of Alexander-street, I saw two men walking towards the Turk's Head, on the left hand side of the Old Kent-road—I stopped for a moment to look at them—I thought they were gentlemen waiting for the Canterbury mail—they crossed over to the right hand side; to my side—they had been going towards Greenwich, and they turned back and went on my side in front of me—I followed them up—they went on to the front of Mr. Butler's house; they stopped, and I stopped—I do not know who those two men were that were walking—I do not see them here to-day, not to know them—I cannot say that any of the men at the bar were the two men that were walking—when they got to the front of Mr. Butler's I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> come from Greenwich way; it was empty, and it passed on; then another <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came up very fast; there</p>

On Friday morning, 16th May, I was on duty, passing down the Kent-road, about 10 minutes past 4 o'clock—I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about 150 yards from Mr. Butler's shop, on the opposite side—it was standing by the side of the road, and the cowman was rubbing the horse's legs—I spoke to him, and asked him if he was not early for a fare that morning—he said he had just set down one—I asked him where—if he made any answer I did not hear it—he stepped on his driving box, and drove towards town—the driver was the prisoner Coxhill—as he was going away, I took the number of his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; it was No. 1134—when I spoke to him previous to the robbery, he had a pair of dark bushy whiskers on—when I saw him in the cell, on the Tuesday following, he was minus the whiskers, and his hair had been cut, I believe—the whiskers were altogether off—I</p>

On 21st May I was in the neighbourhood of Mr. Morrish's shop, and saw Foster about 1 o'clock—I followed him some short time afterwards and saw him turn round the top of Oakley-street, where I lost sight of him and the other prisoner together—there is a court in North-street—I saw them there with these two papers in their hands open, like this, examining them—I passed by and then returned, and they were still standing in the court; they afterwards came out, and Foster was wrapping something up in a piece of paper, which appeared to me to be these impressions; he put them into his coat pocket—after that I again saw them in Mr. Morrish's shop, but did not see them go in—they came out in about six or seven minutes, and I and another officer followed them, and took them into custody—I searched Foster, and found these impressions rolled up in his coat tail pocket, and these two other papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), on which some manuscript words are—Holler was searched by Sergeant Williamson—Foster refused his address at first—he was asked his name, but I do not recollect what he said; I could not say positively whether he gave it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I am in partnership with my brother, as carcase butchers and salesmen, in Whitechapel In May last we had 300 sheep in Victoria Park—on 16th May I received information, and on 17th went to Bermondsey Skin-market, to the premises of Mr. Williams—I examined thirty sheep skins, nine of which were skins of sheep I had sent to Victoria Park to graze—the other twenty-one were Mr. Askew's—they were obtained through me—part of them were purchased at the Metro<lb/>politan Market, and part came from the country—from what Williams told me, I went to St. George's-market, Southwark, and, after waiting there two hours, the prisoner came—I asked him if he had received any sheep lately—he said he had; forty-six on Wednesday night—about 10 o'clock or half past—I asked him who brought them to him—he said, a person named Bates, or some such name—he professed to have very little knowledge of him, and said, he lived near Edenbridge, in Kent</p>

Dean and Hatton, of Newgate-market, for sale, and four he retained for his own shop—I asked him what he did with the skins—he said he sent thirty to Mr. Williams, of the Borough-market, for sale, and sixteen to Mr. Kelly—I should mention that the thirty skins, when I saw them, were all daubed over with red ochre, to disguise them, but it had not defaced the marks—I went to a room up stairs at the back of his premises—it appeared to have been a dwelling room at some former time, but had been swept out, sawdust put in it, and there was fresh dung in one corner, showing that sheep had been there very recently—there was no con<lb/>venience for slaughtering sheep in a proper way—there was a little place like a cellar—the yard was occupied with pigsties—he handed me very readily the receipt for 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which I think was in cash, and 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a crossed cheque, of which payment had been stopped by Mr. Buck-nail.</p>
