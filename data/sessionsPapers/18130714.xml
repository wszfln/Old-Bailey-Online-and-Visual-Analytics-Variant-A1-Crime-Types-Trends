               <p>Q. to Wilson. Do you know the person of the prisoner - A. I know the person of the prisoner; I was present when he was tried and convicted. He was ordered to be transported for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. He was the person to whom that certificate applies - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver him over afterwards to the hulk for the purpose of being transported - A. I did, in the month of April, 1810. I delivered him at Portsmouth, in the execution of that judgement. I delivered him to Captain Thompson: he was captain of the Captivity hulk at that time; he is now dead. Since that time I have not seen him until he was taken up. I have no doubt at all that he is the man.</p>

            . On the 24th of November I was going through Holborn; a man spoke to me. We went up Brook-street, and after a little conversation we went into a public-house in Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You walked from Holborn with that man, did you - A. No, not that man; the man that was tried here last sessions; I enquired of him where I could get my ten-pound note changed, and in the public-house another man came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the other man is - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner - A. I cannot positively say whether it was the prisoner or not. He was a stout tall man. The other man enquired of the first man that came into the room, if there had been a woman there. We told him, no. He said, he expected to find one there; he was going to be married to her. I did not pay a deal of attention to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Though you did not pay a deal of attention to him, can you say whether it was the prisoner or not - A. I cannot indeed; he was not long in the room. I paid very little attention to him while he was in the room. He told the man that was along with me that he had been gambling with some soldiers. The man with me told him that he was foolish, and he would shew him how he had lost his money, and for each of them to put down a guinea. He took my note out of my hand; he said it was only to shew him the way he lost his money. He asked me to turn my hat over; I did, and then he said he had gained it, and shoved my note into the other man's hand. He was going out of the house. I went and asked him for my note. I returned, thinking I was in bad company. I went back to the man that had got my note.</p>
               <p>Q. You have given an awkward account of all this; where were your eyes; have you no recollection who the man was - A. I never saw the man before. I would not wish to say any thing but the truth. I do not recollect the man. I was perfectly certain of the other man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing of the witness, nor any thing of the transaction. The other man you say had your note - A. Yes.</p>

The brother of the prisoner, as soon as he passed me, he ran down the lane; about four or five minutes afterwards I met the prisoner; he spoke to me, and asked me how I did, and when I came to the door of this public-house I saw this man come out very much confused apparently.

He informed me going along that he had been robbed of a ten pound country note, of the Suffolk and Essex bank. I gave information at the office, and requested them to send an officer to the banking-house to stop the note. The note was stopped, and the prisoner afterwards was taken.

             came into my house; they went into the parlour, and called for a pint of porter. I served it them, and came out. In about five or ten minutes another man walked in, whom I believe to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I have seen him for some years about the neighbourhood. I never saw him in the house before. He called for a pint of ale; I served him. I left them all three in the parlour. There was no other person there. I went down into the cellar, and when I came out of the cellar into the parlour, the parlour was empty.

             was looking after them. I asked him if any thing was the matter. He said he had lost a ten pound note. Mr. Hodges, the beadle, came up. I asked him if he had met any body. I have not the least doubt the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the note; is that the note you lost - A. I believe it to be the note; it answers in all particulars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the transaction. I was not in the house that day. I don't know that ever I was in the house. If I had been in the house the young man must recollect me, I should presume, as it was a gambling transaction. The man that was in the room with my brother represented himself as a stranger. It would have been impossible for me to represent myself as a stranger; my brother and me were twins.</p>

On the 8th of February, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I came down stairs; I was going out; I pushed open the parlour door; I saw the pri-prisoner getting in at the window. I asked him what he did there. His reply was, that he slipped in. His body was in the window; he was overbalanced. I said it was impossible, for the window was shut. I told him he was a thief; he was going to steal. He had drawn the table, which stood in the room, close to the window, with the hat upon it. I said, you are going to steal that hat. His hands were upon the hat, and he had removed the hat. It is a small table, about a yard square. He had removed the table a yard nearer the window. He ran away. Mr. Waddilove pursued him, and brought him back. When the prisoner ran away he left the hat upon the table. I am sure the prisoner is the same person that was brought back, and I am sure he is the same person that I saw leaning in the window. I had been in the room about a quarter of an hour before, and put the window down; there was nothing to fasten it. It lifts up and down, with a Venetian blind to it. No person had been in that room, to my knowledge, but myself.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. I occupy this house, No. 1, Phoenix-street, Hackney-road. I was alarmed by the cry of my wife, saying, here is some person getting in. In consequence I pursued, and when I came out of my door I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of the row. As soon as he saw me he ran away; I pursued, and called out, stop him. He was stopped, and delivered into my hands, and I brought him into my house. I charged him with opening my window, and endeavouring to take my hat. He said, if I would forgive him he would never do so any more. I took the prisoner to Worship-street office; they there knew him very well. This is the hat; it cost me twenty-six shillings. I value it at seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is worth a shilling - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. About twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come in April last to your house - A. Yes. He went to school with my son, and from that there was a family intimacy.</p>
               <p>Q. He was suffered to come to your house - A. Yes; he was like one of my own family. I acted as a friend and mother to him always. On the 1st of April he came to me and mentioned that he was, very poor and low; that he had not eat any food. He asked me for three shillings. I got him something to take, and gave him a cup of tea. My friend gave him sixpence, and I got him three shillings; that was three shillings and sixpence. On Saturday morning, the 3d of April, he asked me could I take a letter for him. I said, I have children of my own; I will do it for you. I then went to my friends, and collected ten shillings for him, in charity. He came to me on Sunday, and took share of what I had; he dined with me; and on Sunday evening, the 4th of April, I was sent for to a friend. I told him he could not stay if I went. I had a son that was at church. I am in the habit of putting the key of my room, which is the garret, under the mat, for my son, or any of the family, to come in. I had not gone from my house half an hour when he returned back, and stripped me of all I had. He took all my things out of my trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go out - A. At half past eight o'clock. I returned about ten; it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark when you went out, was it not - A. It was between the dark and light; the moon was coming on. The day-light had ceased.

A pair of new cotton sheets, two pieces of new nankeen, five pair of new cotton stockings, three or four pocket handkerchiefs, a tablecloth, a napkin, a bottle-green coat, a great coat, and a black coat, a pair of black pantaloons, a black waistcoat, a pair of cotton drawers, and sundry other articles; that is what were in the trunk; and in the bundle there were six shirts; they were old and bad ones; a night handkerchief, and several night and day caps, and one old shirt. They were my husband's property: his name is

               <p>Q. Have you seen any of these things since - A. Yes. I saw them on the 27th of April, in the prisoner's lodgings. I there saw a bottle-green coat, a pair of drawers, and at the bottom of the same house, a chandler's shop, she had given some other things for victuals. I there saw a coat, a pair of drawers, a night cap, and a bottle-green coat.</p>
               <p>Q. No; the bottle-green coat you said you saw in his room - A. I made a mistake; it is in the same house.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw a great coat in his room - A. Yes, and the black coat was in his room, and I think the black waistcoat, but not the pantaloons. The best part of the articles were not found, an umbrella and several other things. Humphreys was with me when I found the articles. He stopped the prisoner when he came home at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Wright, had not you a knowledge that I had the things for three weeks before I was apprehended - A. I did. Suppose that, you was the robber.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give me the things, or lend them me - A. I never gave them, or lent them you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send your eldest daughter to tell me not to say that you lent them me, and that if your husband knew it he would be the death of both - A. I never sent such a message. Such a message was never sent by me, or any of the family.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Wright, when we went out of your room about eight o'clock did not we go to the wine vaults, did not you then desire me to go home and take the things out - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you send your daughter, desiring her to give me that permission, and did not say that you had placed the key of the door under the mat of the landing-place - A. I never sent my daughter at all with any such message.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you request me to write a letter to you, which letter you might shew your husband, that he might see there was no intimacy between us - A. Never, nor never knew any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. After I was taken to Newgate did not you, Mrs. Wright, write to me, requesting me to write again to you - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you whether you have any knowledge of any person calling on me on the 28th of last month, requesting me to write a letter to you, denying any knowledge of that which letter had fallen into your husband's hands, and had caused a quarrel between you - A. I know nothing of it. I never desired any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send a person of the name of Williams, a tailor, who works for the same master as your son Charles did, in Hatton Garden - A. I never saw him. I do not know any such name.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner at his lodgings, No. 4, King-street, Soho; the two pair of stairs front room. I first went there one at noon, he was not at home; in the room I found a drab great coat, a black coat, a black waistcoat, some neck handkerchiefs, three shirts, a pair of stockings; and on his person I found two duplicates<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140006"/>of five pair of stocking, pledged in Russel-street; I found afterwards a twenty-pound, a three-Pound, and a two-pound bad notes. I waited in his room until one o'clock; he then came in, and I apprehended him on the night of the 26th of April. It is a double house, with a chandler's shop below; and at the chandler's shop I found a bottle green coat, a pair of drawers with the name taken out of the hands, and a night-cap.</p>

He said nobody belonged to them but himself; I asked him particularly twice.</p>

            , master side of Newgate. Inside it is more comfortable than it appears outside, any of the turnkeys will shew you where I am. There was a time when you did not fail to oblige a friend; best respects to Mr. Wright.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Wright has sworn to a coat that is not his. I acknowledge these letters to be mine; I wish not to deviate from the truth; I wrote some of them at the request of Mrs. Wright. My lord and gentleman of the jury, I am quite unprepared either by counsel or attorney to defend me. And I always understood from Mrs. Wright that she never would appear against me; I am fully convinced that I must appear guilty in the eyes of this court. I have now no other means of vindicating my cause then a true relation of the facts that has caused this unjust prosecution against me; it was not my wish to divulge disagreeable truths. I am forced to it by Mrs. Wright, who has wickedly come forth and accused me of the robbery, she being convinced that the whole of the prosecution is to screen herself and her daughter from the anger of Mr. Wright. I have no other witness on my part than a Mr. Cox, who I have every reason to believe is gone to Bath, or keeps out of the way, knowing his evidence would establish my innocence. I do not mean to accuse Mr. Wright of being the principal instrument of prosecuting me, I wrote to him several times begged he would see me; I told him plainly if he prosecuted me it would cause a great exposure. I have no doubt he has been exasperated against me by the wife and daughter. I shall now endeavour to relate the particulars.</p>
               <p>I have been acquainted with Mrs. Wright and family several years. I went to school with her eldest son; through him I was unfortunately introduced to the rest of the family. Mr. Wright then was a <rs id="t18130714-4-viclabel18" type="occupation">stay-maker</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

They know their daughter has gone upon the town. I was continually distressing myself for some of the family; of late I have not been upon very good terms with them. I thought it necessary to keep out of the way. A short time back I called upon Mrs. Wright, telling her how I was situated. She begged that I would come and live with her a few days, which I accepted of, and took some things with me. She agreed that Mr. Wright should not be acquainted with it, and gave me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140007"/>key of the street door to let myself in and out, during which time Mrs. Wright was continually complaining of the ill treatment of her husband, and proposed me to take her daughter in keeping, and she to live with us; which I objected having to live with both. I told Mrs. Wright it was impossible for me to do as she wished, as I had promised to marry a young lady. I told Mrs. Wright I must have the bill of sixty-three pounds; that I was in danger of being arrested for it. This she cannot deny. I had many documents in my possession, which I have mislaid or destroyed. On Friday the 2nd of April it was understood that Mr. Wright was coming home. I was plain, and asked Mrs. Wright for my clothes. On the next morning I breakfasted with her. I was very much surprised when she told me they could not be found; at length I understood that they were all pledged. I insisted upon having them restored, or I would take such steps as would get them. She said, if I would call on Sunday the 4th of April, the day she states the robbery to be committed. I should have them. When I went the next day Mrs. Wright said she was unwell. I asked Mrs. Wright if she had got my clothes. She said, if Mr. Wright knew it he would be the death of us both, as he did not like me to be there. She said, if I would wait a few days she would have it in her power to redeem them for me; Mr. Wright would bring some money home with him; she would lend me a few things. I told Mrs. Wright I would wait, if she would let me have a few necessary things. I stopped with Mrs. Wright and her daughter until eight o'clock in the evening, when we went out together. We went to the wine vaults, where I treated them with some drams. Mrs. Wright said she would bring the things down with her, meaning the things now produced. After we came out of the wine vaults I asked her if she brought the things down with her. She excused herself by saying she would send her daughter, Mary, home with them in the morning. I said I wished to have them then. Mrs. Wright desired her daughter to bring the bundle down, and told her the key was under the mat. Mrs. Wright and daughter walked home with me to my lodging. She remarked that the shirts were not very good; they were very clean. Notwithstanding how I had been used I promised to lend her some money to redeem the things she had pledged. After this Mrs. Wright and daughter told me that Mr. Wright missed some of his things, but did not know that they were lent to me, and begged that I would not let him know, as he would kill them. When I left Mrs. Wright she promised to call on me in two or three days. At half after twelve o'clock at night I went home to my lodgings; Humphreys seized me, and asked me what I had in my room. I said nothing but my own, and what I had given to me. On the morning

             came to me, and told me to keep my spirits up. She said, her father had found me out by watching her mother, and had beaten her violently for letting me have these things; that her father had taken me up for robbing them, as they dare not tell the truth. She said her mother was afraid of seeing me herself for fear of being known; she must appear against me, as Mr. Wright would be present. She begged for God's sake I would not tell the truth; they should be ruined. I promised if her mother would clear me I would not. Mrs. Wright sent to me, persuading me to write a letter to Mr. Wright, which I did. I was committed to Bridewell, since which time Mrs. Wright has been buoying me up that nobody would appear against me. I put off my trial last sessions by her desire, that at this time Mr. Wright would be out of the way. This way I have been kept in prison eleven weeks, and find myself the dupe of Mrs. Wright and daughter, who I wonder is not present, as she came to me almost every day in prison. I declare I am innocent of what I am accused of.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Wright. Is it true that you and your daughter met him every day until he was apprehended - A. No, never.</p>

On Friday the 25th of June the prisoner was in the cellar, which is a warehouse. I went and called him out rather in haste. I perceived him put a small key in his pocket. On Saturday evening I made a search; I searched a little box in the cellar. I saw sundry articles in the box; I did not proceed any further, as my employers were not at home. On Sunday the 27th I opened this box in the cellar, and found a pair of silk stockings. No one was with me. After that Slade and me opened his box up stairs. I found in that a number of articles, and three pair of new silk stockings. These are them. I know the silk stockings; they have our private mark upon them. In his jacket pocket I found a few buttons. I know they were the prisoner's boxes; I have seen him lock and unlock them. The prisoner had the keys of both the boxes about him. This is the paper that the stockings were in. They were in our shop September the 4th, 1812. The stockings are new they have not been worn.</p>

            . I am a Thames police surveyor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any time in June, seeing the prisoner in the river Thames - A. I did, on the 19th of June, about half past one in the morning. I was on my duty. I was going down the river; I saw three men in a boat; the boat came round the stern of a lighter. The moment they saw me in my boat they shoved on shore; two of the men ran out of the boat and escaped. The prisoner jumped into the mud, and in trying to extricate himself he fell on his hands, which enabled me to take him. I found in the boat three bags of coffee. The three bags of coffee weighed three hundred weight and a quarter. I afterwards went on board the lighter. The name of the lighter was the Castle Douglas. I found her laying at the entrance of the West India docks. The hatches were on, and the main hatch bar ran along the hatch. One hatch was fast, and the other unlocked. One of the hatch bars were down, with an excise lock, and the other was not locked at all. The starboard was loose; the larboard was secure. By shifting the starboard bar off you might get all the hatches off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any one on board - A. No. When I first saw the wherry she was about one hundred and fifty yards off. She was rowing up the river, but whether her head was inclining on the shore I cannot say; I should suppose not, by the direction she was going in. They landed on the same side at Limehouse-hole. I searched the prisoner. I found a key on him that unlocked the hatch, where they may go out of the weather. It has no communication but to where the cargo was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So you never saw him but one hundred and fifty yards off the lighter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where they were exactly coming from, you could not ascertain - A. No, I could not. When I got in the boat he told me he was a watchman to Mr. Betts. The prisoner desired me to go after the other two men. He said, they were going to Mackilbery's, a house down the stairs; I should find the two men there. I asked him where the coffee came from. He told me that they were watchman of Mr. Betts's, and that they had got it out of the lighter; that himself had been on shore in the watchhouse at the West India docks, and had fell asleep there, and on his coming down to his coming down to his craft he perceived two men heaving something out of the lighter into the boat. He called to them, and asked what they had got there. He then found it was coffee from out of the lighter, and requested them to put it back, but finding they would not put it back he went with them. On my asking him how they came to get out of the boat; first he said they were rowing, and he was sitting aft.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you very freely where they were going to take the property to - A. He did, and he told me he was asleep at the time these persons took the property.</p>

               <p>Q. You heard one bolt of the back door drawn - A. Yes, and I heard the other bolt drawn; afterwards the latch gently lifted up, and the door opened; I heard a light footstep close by the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you are through that door are you in the house - A. Yes. I heard the button that fastens the bar-window undone; I ran out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140010"/>bar, at the bar-door. I ran backwards to the place where I heard the noise.</p>
               <p>Q. When you are in the bar and look into that window, where does it look into - A. It faces the back-door; that window is between the parlour-door and the kitchen-door.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the back-door open into the house, or into the yard - A. Into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as soon as you are through the back-door you are in the house, are you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You ran round to the place where you heard the noise - A. Yes; I ran up against a man. it was dark; I had no light, nor he had no light. I seized the man as soon as I run against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep fast hold of him - A. Yes, I did; and it was the prisoner now at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say whether the prisoner was in any part of the house - A. Yes, he was in the house; the outside of the bar-window is within the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you heard a light footstep could you tell where that footstep was - A. Yes, close by that bar-window. When I seized him, he said it is me Mr. Berry.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you knew him before, did you - A. Yes; he had been employed about the house some time ago. I brought him into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing about him - A. Yes, a piece of wire, match, astick, and a tinder-box. These are them. I sat him down in the tap-room, and underneath where he was sitting I found the tinder-box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that tinder-box within the tap-room or not before he came in - A. No, it was not. This piece of wire was to force the bolt back from the outside. I said, I was sorry to catch him; we were robbed a great many times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Is this your house or Sullivan's - A. It is Sullivan's house. I have the tap to myself; I have nothing but the tap; Sullivan has nothing to do with the tap; I sell beer by commission for him; I have so much a but; I pay no rent. There were four gimblet holes, and through them holes that wire was put in, it forced the bolt back.</p>
               <p>Q. This man formery kept the house himself - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had you examined the bolts of the back-door; do you know whether the back-door was bolted or not - A. It was bolted a little before eleven. I know that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as ever you go through the back-door are you under the roof of the house or not - A. No, there is a light; it is not covered up; it is open all the way up to the sky; the bar-window is under cover, and within the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing you were coming in at the door you heard him unbolt, as soon as he came in there where would he be - A. Under the roof; as soon as he got through he was within side of the house; he might have gone anywhere in the house that he liked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask the prisoner what he wanted, or was anything said what he came there for - A. He said, now, Berry, I will hang myself, I have got rope in my pocket. I had got hold of him then.</p>
               <p>Q. He never said why he came in - A. Not a</p>

I looked on the counter, and immediately missed one pound out of the twelve; I followed the prisoner, and took her in the next shop but one; I took a pound of pins out of her apron; she said she hoped we would not prosecute her, she was drunk and did not know what she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she drunk - A. I cannot say. These are the pins; here is the witness that saw her take them.</p>

            . I am a book-keeper at the Bell-inn, Friday-street. I apprehended the prisoner with the half firkin of butter done up very curious in a frail-basket. The basket was sewed up so that you could not see the contents of the basket. I followed him and asked him what he had got in their ail. I took it from him. This is the firkin that was in the frail-basket.</p>
               <p>Vickrey. That is the firkin I loaded in the waggon; it corresponds with the marking iron.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of that butter - A. Fifteen or sixteen shillings at Axminster.</p>
               <p>Q. to Anstwick. What time of the day was it when you stopped him - A. About nine o'clock on Sunday morning; the waggon arrived late on Friday night. When the waggon arrives the gates are shut, no one has access to it until the next morning; it is a private inn, and on Saturday morning I saw the firkin of butter in the hay-loft.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it about - A. I do not think any thing particular passed that I can speak to. The papers produced were to copy the same as the others, but they were never made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you took any refreshment upon that occasion at the Swan tavern - A. Yes, I think some tongues and wiches, and some sherry.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, in the month of September, had you any meeting at the Horn tavern - A. Yes, we met both on Friday the 4th, and Saturday the 5th.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these drafts received previous to that time - A. Yes, they were received on the 3rd of September; the money was received for them genuine checks on the 3rd of September, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you present them together or separate - A. Together, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you paid for them - A. I think I received a twenty-pound note, and some small notes in payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hill in town at that time - A. No, I think not; I understood he was out of town, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave the checks was any thing said - A. Not by Hill to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you say you had a meeting at the Horn on the 4th, you were there then - A. Yes, Badcock, Cook myself, and I think Brady was there. Brady was there on the 5th I am sure; I am not positive as to the 4th; I am positive Badcock was on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done on the 4th - A. There were some forged drafts sent out for payment then; the check in question was presented on the 5th. It was agreed on the 4th that the whole should be sent for payment; the mode was settled, Badcock was to send them by a porter for the bankers to pay them.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you say they should be sent, you mean the forged checks - A. Yes, a number of them. I was to go and see if they were paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. You met again on the 5th - A Yes, at the Horn tavern; there were myself, Badcock, Cook, and Brady, on the 5th; we four were present. Soon after I went there Brady and Cook went away; I saw them no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been agreed on before Cook, and Brady, went away - A. There were other people in the coffee-room, little could be said; we were to send the check to the house of Robarts and Company, which we did do; Badcock delivered them to a porter; Badcock and I went together; we went to several places, and sent several checks. The check of Burchall and Company that was sent from the White Bear in Basinghall-street; Badcock delivered it to the porter to take to the house of Robarts and Company for payment; I followed the porter to the house of Robarts. I kept him in sight all the way; I followed him into Robarts's house; I saw the check presented; it was received and paid. I had some country notes payable at Robarts's house at the same time; I obtained the country notes for that purpose of having something to do when the check was presented, the plan was my own entirely; it was well understood by them that I should go in under that pretence.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the check actually received - A. I did; I followed the porter to where he was sent off, to near the White Bear; I think he came to him in the street; I saw Badcock receive it. The moment the check was paid I went and informed Badcock of it; I had but little way to go; he was in the neighbourhood; I came out of the house with the porter and got a little way before him; I went and told Badcock that the man had succeeded, before the porter saw him and that evening I accompanied Badcock to the Bolt and Tun Bouvierie-street, there we divided three thousand eight hundred pounds. Badcock retained three fifths, and delivered me two for Cook and myself; the other three were for Hill, Brady, and himself, as I understood. I saw Brady on the following Monday that something was done on the house of Ladbroke. I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was Monday - A. I think the 7th; I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him any money then - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. You have been on board the hulks, have not you - A. Yes, for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen during the period of your life that you have been tried for any other felony, and punished besides that which you have told us - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Cook - A. About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is he - A. A hosier, I have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. He has not been an hosier since you have been acquainted with him - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he got his living since you have been acquainted with him - A. That has already been explained in court.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Brady - A. I have known him some years, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Hill when he kept a public-house in Whitechapel - A. No, I did not; Hill kept a house in Newgate-market. I have seen him once there about two years ago. It may be rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, Richardson, the plan for putting off the forged bills was determined on the 4th of July; it was agreed that Badcock should send them to the bankers; you were to go and see that they were paid; that part of the plan was your own - A. Certainly, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done on the 4th of September was, that Badcock was to send the bills by a porter; it was determined that Badcock should send them by a porter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By any person that Badcock knew - A. I think not, a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at that meeting on the 4th that it was determined by you, that you were to be at the bankers and see them paid - A. I agreed to be there to see them paid, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at the tavern in Sloane-street, where you had the sandwiches, and sherry, that you have told us - A. Not long. It might be half an hour.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140014"/>Q. What was the longest time that any of you might have staid at the Horn tavern - A. I never kept any account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay half an hour. Most likely a waiter came to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you sitting in an open box - A. Yes. It was daylight.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at the Horn tavern various times and had refreshment there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I understand you to say when the three drafts were put into your hand you were sure these were those that were delivered to Cook, or you only believed them to be the same - A. I have reason to believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing about them that makes you sure them are the same - A. I have reason to believe one is the same, because there was the name of Magnay and Pickering on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. At Sloane-street Brady was not there - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of September, when some of them met at the Horn, Brady was not there, only on the 5th - A. I am not sure he was there on the 4th, only on the 5th.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the day that you and Badcock left the Horn to go with this note - A. Yes: Brady and Cook went away; I saw no more of them. Badcock and I went about this transaction with ourselves. I did not see Brady again till the following Monday; we met upon another transaction, and after that time I never saw him until he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. At the division of the money he was not present - A. There was no person present at the divideing of the money but me and Badcock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. From whom did you receive the three genuine drafts - A. From Cook. The three drafts that I received payment for were the very same that I received of Cook I have no doubt.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was present when you received these three from Hill - A. Richardson, and I believe Brady.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these three, and tell me whether you believe these to be the three - A. I would not swear to these three. They were checks upon Robarts's house.</p>
               <p>Q. From the three that were presented to you did you effect forgeries - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the draft for five hundred and sixty pounds; did you forge that from the check of Burchall of nine pounds ten shillings - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had done that to whom did you give them three genuine checks - A. I gave it to Richardson for the forged one for five hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned that you received the three from Hill; did you know at the time from whom Hill received them - A. I understood from Richardson. Hill obtained them from a man of the name of Parsons. I was informed of that by Richardson only.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting Hill at any other place besides the Horns tavern - A. We met at the Swan in Sloane-street. I cannot recollect the time. It was about the time that we met at the Horn tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. How many met of you at the Swan in Sloane-street - A. Richardson, Hill, and I think Brady was there once.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Brady with Hill - A. I cannot say for certainty. We met once with Hill, and once with Brady. I do not recollect their being together. When I met Hill there we had some sandwiches and some sherry wine. That was when Hill was there.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did Hill give you those genuine checks - A. It was understood that I should commit forgeries from them. That was the subject of the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it all settled what should become of Hill when you had done this part of the business - A. I understood he was to be out of town. He was not to be in town when they were presented.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again until after they had been presented - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that day on which they were presented - A. Yes; I think it was on the 5th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th do you remember meeting at the Horn tavern - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day in which it was presented do you remember who you met that morning at the Horn tavern - A. Yes, Brady, Badcock, and Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Either on the 5th, or on the preceding day's meeting, was it engaged in what manner this and other drafts were to be uttered - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and these persons various meetings - A. We had three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mode that you arranged for uttering of the draft; do you remember whether that was talked on that day or the preceding day - A. On both, the 4th and the 5th. It was planned that Badcock should hire a porter, and give him the forged check, on purpose to receive the money at the bankers. Richardson was to see that all was safe. Brady and I left them at the Horn tavern, and went to Moorgate coffee-house, and left them to do the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that day, or the next day, receive your share of the business of that day - A. I did, from Richardson. The notes were sold at twenty pound per cent. discount. I received the product after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140015"/>Q. to Richardson. When you had got two-fifths for yourself and Cook, what did you do with them - A. I sold them at a discount of 20 per cent to Birkett. He knew what we were about; he was to dispose of the bank note, the immediate produce of the forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Birkett - A. The man that was convicted last sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was he - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cook. You say you received the produce of the forged check after the discount - A. I received the produce after that. I received the money at two or three different times. I received from Richardson two hundred pounds at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you taken up - A. On the 1st of January last, on suspicion of forgery; and when I was in custody I made a disclosure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. How long were you connected in this business - A. I decline to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a hosier - A. Yes; I carried on a little business in the honest way.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you keep a shop six months ago - A. I kept no shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry on the business of a hosier - A. At my house. I have no shop in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the goods in the house, and people come there - A. No, not altogether. I sold them to my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this house that you carried on the business, such as it was - A. In the King's-road. I lived there a twelvemonth. I lived in Sloane-street before that. I have not had a shop for twelve or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live in Sloane-street carrying on the business of a hosier - A. I believe about a year and a half. I lived before that in Sloane-square. I lived about a twelvemonth there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before that time - A. Upon my oath, I cannot recollect. I lived in many places.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you where you lived four years ago - A. I think at Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that for the last fourteen years you have obtained your livelihood by hosiery alone - A. No, I do not, but by these depredations now before me, or nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, sir, has Hill the misfortune of knowing you - A. I believe about two years: he may not have known me above one year. I have known him about two years. I have been at his house in Newgate-market. I do not know that he knew me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you executed the forgery - A. At my house in King's-road, Chelsea.</p>

            . I am a hay salesman in Whitechapel market.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August, last year, do you remember being possessed of a check of Burchall and Company, Magnay and Pickering, and Walker and Son, for hay you had sold - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these checks, and tell me whether you believe them to be the same - A. I have seen them before. I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. About a month afterwards you were taken up and examined - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Mr. Hill - A. I do. I knew him before, and at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of taking the checks that you received in business, and giving you cash for them - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever part with your checks to any other person besides Hill - A. Yes, to Mr. Nash, the clerk of the market; to no one else besides.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August, last year, do you remember Hill taking of you some checks one day - A. It might be two, three, or four, or five. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not able to speak to these three checks - A. No, not exactly. They may be the checks. I have no doubt but they are the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. You have had some little doubt whether these are the three drafts; whether you gave these these drafts to Hill; you now have no doubt - A. I have no doubt particular whether they are or are not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the habit of receiving drafts for which you sell hay, and taking the drafts into the city to get cash - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Hill and Mr. Nash has taken them of you. It is more convenient for you to give them to them instead of your going into the city - A. Yes. Sometimes I have given them to farmers.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have given drafts to Hill it was for your accommodation - A. I thought so. I have given four or or five drafts to a farmer at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal very largely - A. In a middling way; as much as some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are indebted to Hill - A. Yes; there is not much likelihood of my paying it. I am losing my connections.</p>
               <p>Q. Hill lived in Newgate-market, did not he - A. Yes. He used to ask me for drafts when he was going to pay his brewer or distiller; he used to say, have you any thing in the city. I used to say, I have a check or two, if you will take them I will thank you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. At the time this transaction took place where did Hill live - A. He had left Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he apply to you or you to him - A. I never applied to him, except in saying are you going into the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Look in your account book the 17th of August; do you find any entry in your account book of the receipt of these checks - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you receive them - A. I believe the day after the hay was sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140016"/>Q. Burchall and Company; what day did you receive that - A. I think I received it on the 15th of August, and Magnay and Pickering is on the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. When you pay the check to the farmers do you or not make an entry in your book - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason respecting these drafts for saving that you gave them to Hill, except your receiving them. Is is it your belief that you did give these three checks to Hill - A. They might be some others. I cannot say any further than that.</p>

I attempted to keep him from me; with that he closed, and I with difficulty threw him down, and my self upon him. There appeared to be a gang of eight or ten upon me, some crying release him, and an immense pressure upon my body, and as I was attempting to rise the prisoner kept holding of me; at last I succeeded in rising; I extricated myself with my torn coat, which the officer has, which with my hat Mr. Lovett took charge of. I then felt that I had my watch in my pocket, and wished to see Mr. Lovett to give it him, but before I could see Mr. Lovett M'Carthy again rushed upon me, and I again threw him in the same situation as before. I found the pressure much greater the second time than before, and was two or three minutes before I could succeed in getting my knees upon him. I immediately placed my hand to my fob: I found that my watch was gone. M'Carthy when I observed I was robbed, immediately let go his hold. I with some difficulty got up; he then pretended to be in a stupified state. The watchman was just coming upon his duty; I gave him in charge, and went with him to Bishopsgate watchhouse. There was a party when I gave him in charge; they went away.</p>

            . On Monday evening, the 4th of June, Mr. Watson and I were walking down Bishopsgate-street, arm in arm. The prisoner came behind us, and struck us both at one time on our shoulders, and likewise parted us at the same time we turned round. The prisoner was behind us; he was just in the act of striking me. I got of one side to avoid his striking me. He then went to Mr. Watson; he struck Mr. Watson; they both fell down together. Mr. Watson endeavouring to get up M'Carthy tore his coat completely off his back. Mr. Watson, when he got up, took the remaining part of his coat off; it was very little for certain. He then told M'Carthy to go about his business; he did not wish to have any thing further to say to him. M'Carthy soon after that struck him again; they both fell down; he kept him down for two or three minutes. When Mr. Watson got up the second time he said, Lovett, I have lost my watch. There appeared to be a gang of them. There were several persons that pretended to help Mr. Watson up; I rather thought they were keeping him down. The watch has never been found.</p>

They left town on Saturday morning to go to Seven Oaks in Kent. After they were gone I received a pair of shoes for Major Horsley. The prisoner was then standing by me. The prisoner was <rs id="t18130714-18-deflabel110" type="occupation">valet and butler</rs>

On the Monday following I had occasion to put some things in the desk; I discovered that the shoes were taken out of the desk; the desk was not locked. I made every enquiry in the house among our people; the prisoner denied any knowledge of it. We had lost several other things in the house, and suspicion fell on the lad I had; he was discharged his service on suspicion. This went on three or four days; we lost other things, and on looking in Murray's room I discovered this pair of shoes that belonged to Major Horsley, and because it should not hurt the house I paid fifteen shillings for the shoes. I mentioned it to Murray's master that I had found the shoes, and I told Murray that the shoes were in his possession. I went in his room, and saw the shoes were taken away. The officer found the shoes at his washerwoman's house.</p>
               <p>- TOWNSEND. I am an officer. I found these shoes at the prisoner's washerwoman's, 151, Swallow-street. They were tied in an handkerchief with two other pair of shoes. There is Major Horsley's name in them.</p>
               <p>MRS. SAYER. I live at 151, Swallow-street; I am a washerwoman. The prisoner came to my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140020"/>house, and asked me to let him leave a bundle, and he would call again. That is the same bundle that Townsend found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bespoke a pair of shoes; they were to be sent home on Friday or Saturday; and when I came home to the hotel, she house-maid told me my things were in the desk; I took them up to my room. I thought they were the shoes that came from Mr. Vaughan, my shoe-maker; I tried them on, they fitted me.</p>

I did, in November I believe, 1809; he was to purchase stock in the Long Annuities, at ten pound a year, more or less. I gave him the money to buy that. I gave him between one and two hundred pounds. I cannot exactly remember the sum. He undertook to make the purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did he give you any paper printed receipt - A. Yes. I gave him the money in the morning; he came in the evening, and gave me this paper either that day or the next day. This is the paper he gave to me. There is my mark upon the paper, at the back. I put this mark to it after I had been to the Bank. It was never out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you find that any thing was wrong - A. Not until he was gone. I applied in the April following. I got my dividend at the Bank. In October following, when I came to compare my receipt with the Bank book I found I was wrong, but I am not the loser by it; he had placed the money there.</p>
               <p>COURT. You went in April and received your dividend, did you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you receive your dividend in October - A. Yes, and ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the sum of ten pounds four shillings was properly transferred into your name - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that sum was properly transferred into your name before you made any enquiry about that money - A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you on the 9th of June last - A. I lodged at Mrs. Young's; she is here,</p>
               <p>Q. How many of you slept in the same room with you - A. Two more; the prisoner slept in the same room. I saw him come in about eleven o'clock at night; he went to bed The mistress took one of the children out of bed to make room for him. I slept in a bed by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you awake in the morning - A. About half past four, or near five, when an alarm was given that the other man got up; when that alarm was given the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search to see whether you had lost any of your own property - A. Not at that time; between seven and eight I missed a pair of shoes, and a hat. I thought nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you miss any thing else - A. About eight o'clock I got up. I missed the key of a trunk out of my pocket-book, and I missed a three-shilling piece out of my other pocket; then I suspected that my trunk was robbed; I went to my trunk and found it locked, then I took out my trunk, and under some old clothes behind my trunk I found my key hid; I opened my trunk and missed nine two-pound notes, a one-pound note, two shirts, a pair of stockings, a pair of trowsers; my hat, and shoes, were gone. I have seen some of my things since; they are in the officers custody. These are the things; I have not seen the notes since; the prisoner took them out of his pocket, and delivered them to the officer. The second day after I lost them I saw the prisoner in Golden lane; he was searched in my presence; all was found on him except a few shillings of the money that he had taken from me, one one-pound note, seven two-pound notes, and some silver; the silver and shirts, where found at the house where he lodged. I was present when the things were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the prisoner how he got these things - A. Yes; I said, you rascal, where is the notes that you took from me; he put his hand into his pocket, took out the notes, and put them into Mettingley, the officer's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. When before this, had you seen these notes in your box - A. The same evening that I was robbed; I took the money out to make a payment to a shoemaker; I put them in my trunk again. The trowsers is mine; these are my shoes, and this is my hat; I had not taken any of the numbers of the notes. I went to the bankers afterwards; they told me they did not take any numbers of notes under five-pound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish him to be asked why he saw me come into the room - A. I saw him come into the room; he slept with another man.</p>

I saw them in close conversation. I went up and asked what was the matter. The prisoner said Mr. Prior had three spoons of his, and he wanted to keep them. Mr. Prior thought there was some suspicion attached to them. He would not let him have them: he gave them up to me before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at the spoons produced by Garrod - A. They are my spoons, and the three produced by Wood are mine. The prisoner told me he sold the other two to a person of the name of Bland. I went to Bland. Bland said he did not buy spoons to keep: he bought them to sell; therefore he took the cypher out. He told me he sold the two tablespoons for twenty-six shillings and sixpence; that would be nearly the value of old silver.</p>

I stopped him in Star-street; that is about two hundred yards from Gravel-lane. I saw him come down Coleman-street, and go into Star-street. I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he coming from Coleman-street in the direction as he would be coming from Gravel-lane - A. Yes. When I asked him what he had he said he had a box which he took from a sailor at New Crane-stairs out of a waterman's boat: he had it at the back of his coat, and he was smoking a pipe also. He told me he was going to take it to a lodging-house; he could not tell me the sailor's name, nor the person's name, nor who occupied the house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140024"/>New Crane-stairs is about as far from where I first saw him as New Gravel-lane.</p>

               <p>- GOSLING. I am a servant to Mr. Monk, a horse-boiler. On the 10th of June, the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140025"/>offered me a horse; he told me it was in Hackney marsh; he took me to see it. He told me that the horse was dead. He said it was his master's, and he was authorised to sell it by his master's order. He said his master cut the horses throat before he left the horse. When I came to the horse he asked two pound; I bid thirty-five shillings for it. We agreed to the price. I told him I should not pay him until I saw somebody that belonged to the horse. The prisoner proposed going to the Five Bells; he said they knew his master. When we got about half way between the two bridges he jumped into the river. I never saw him again until he was taken.</p>

Upon going to the Five Bells I saw the horse lay with its throat cut. The prisoner said he cut it. By commission of his master the horse was killed. He said if we went to the Five Bells, Old Ford, we should find every thing satisfactory. In the way he jumped into the river, and swam across. That is all I know.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner; I found a knife upon him; he said the knife was his own property. I asked him whether with this knife he had done the deed. He said, no, it was not; he had taken good care of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the morning I was coming from Lea-bridge; a bargeman asked me to go as far as Whitechapel, and tell one of the horse-boilers to come down. I went, as he said he would pay me for it, and when I came back I could not see any bargeman there, and seeing the horse lay in an open place I thought I had as much right to it as he had. I never was in any trouble before.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing - A. I did not. About five o'clock, Read, the officer, came; he produced some muslin. I knew it belonged to my master.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners into custody. This piece of sprigged muslin I found in the bundle that was delivered up to me by Mr. Bennett, where they had committed another robbery, in the city. Mr. Bennett, when he delivered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140026"/>it up to me, said they dropped it. This is the muslin that I shewed to Mr. Sonby.</p>
               <p>MR. BENNETT. I am a linen-draper. The prisoners came into my shop, both of them, on the 5th of July, about four o'clock; they asked me for some muslins; I shewed them some; they purchased a quarter of a yard of muslin. Soon after the prisoners were gone I was called down; there was a shawl missing. I overtook the prisoners about three hundred, yards from my shop; I brought them back again.

I could not get him out. He tried to get in the yard, to see if he could go that way. Jones came into my house; the prisoner as soon as he heard a footstep on my door he threw the coat down the kitchen stairs; he ran to the street door; my child got the coat; I threw it in the court. Jones got it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. Did you receive the coat - A. Yes: this is the coat, it is my master's coat; this coat was left in the closet. I had seen it the over night; I looked in the closet and saw it was gone.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On Friday, the 11th of June, about eleven o'clock, I saw the two prisoners follow two gentlemen up Ludgate-hill, towards St. Paul's; they returned back again to the picture shop: they then followed a gentleman part of the way up <placeName id="t18130714-34-crimeloc204">Fleet-street</placeName>

                        targets="t18130714-34-off202 t18130714-34-crimeloc204"/>; I kept an eye upon them all the time; there were three in company: I saw Hall put his hand into the gentleman's right hand coat pocket; he pulled a handkerchief part of the way out; Hall tried again the second time at the handkerchief. I was of oneside of the way, and they were on the other; and when I came to the end of Fetter-lane I crossed over; at that time the handkerchief was three parts out; Hall tried at 
it the third time; there was a hackney coach coming past; I was at the horses head; I saw Hall take the handkerchief further out; on my going round to them I saw Hall pull it out of his breeches, and give it to Hannan; Hannan put it under his armpit, under his coat. I 
laid hold of them both, the third made his escape, and got off. I should know him again if I was to see him. I took the two prisoners into a fishmonger's shop; a mob collected. I could not find the owner of the handkerchief, I think the gentleman did not know that the handkerchief was taken from him; it was the fourth attempt that it was taken, it was taken a little at a time. Hannan said he never picked a gentleman's pocket in his life; he said so before the magistrate. This is the handkerchief; I have kept it ever since. It is a very good one; it is worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Hall's Defence. As I came from Mr. Milbourne's in the Strand, on Ludgate-hill I met with Hannan; I walked with him until we came to Fleet-street I felt something at my foot; I said here is a pretty handkerchief. I am quite innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Hannan's Defence. I know nothing about the handkerchief, nor which way it come.</p>
               <p>Hall called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

No, I was not; nothing was missed until after the prisoners went out; in about two minutes after they were gone a shawl was said to be missing, that was on a stool in the shop. I had seen it not ten minutes before the prisoners came in. I followed the prisoners, and asked them to walk back with me; they came back; I charged them with having taken a shawl, and as soon as they came into the shop

               <p>Q. Do you know whether the bill which is here, this bank post bill, was in that parcel - A. I know this bill was in our house on the 11th of April, and I have an entry here that denotes that I handed it to another clerk. That clerk's name is Mr. Barr; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing to get that bill endorsed by Grant and Company - A. I generally write the endorsement of Messrs. Ladbroke and Company, for them to sign it. The endorsement to Ladbroke and Company is all taken out. This entry is in my own handwriting, as transmitted to Ladbroke, and it is debitted to Ladbroke. I certainly did write the endorsement of Ladbroke, although there is no trace of it now. In the regular course of my business I should write</p>

            , about one in the day; he was then alive. I attended him until he died. On the Tuesday morning following he died. The 26th was Saturday; the Tuesday was the 29th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after his death open his body - A. I did not. I think his death arose from a fever which always attends a mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that mortification occasioned by any wound - A. There was a wound on the leg.</p>

               <p>Q. Had that wound in your judgment produced the mortification - A. I should conceive that the wound was of such a situation that without some other cause there would not have been a mortification.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there have been a mortification if there had not been a wound - A. I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you impute to that wound upon the leg that the mortification that arised from that wound was from the diseased state of the body - A. I compute it entirely arised from the diseased state of the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body in that state that a mortification would have come on if there had been a wound - A. I think if his body had not been in that state there would have come no mortification from that wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his state of body such that without any blow there would have been a probability of a mortification - A. I am not acquainted with any circumstance likely to produce mortification without a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon which part of the leg was it - A. Nearly between the ankle, and the knee rather on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge by what means that wound was produced - A. I should imagine by the blunt edge of a hard body: the kick of a shoe might produce it.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 22nd of last month, I saw the deceased, Cope, strike the prisoner, Roberts, when Roberts had a child in his arms. The deceased struck him violently on the nose; his nose bled profusely. The prisoner put the child down, and struck the deceased with his fist.

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. No; I never saw him but three times. My husband is an hair dresser. In our shop the prisoner produced a gold watch; he asked me to pawn it in my name; I said, no, my name was not known at the pawnbrokers. I got Mr. Robertson to pawn it for him. He said the admiral gave it him for his intrepidity in an action. Mr. Robertson pawned it for him. The prisoner had the money and the duplicate; he gave Mr. Robertson a shilling.</p>

On Saturday the 26th of June, almost at ten o'clock at night, I saw the deceased: she opened my door, and spoke to me very smiling; she did not converse with me long; she wished me good night. She appeared well and sober. She then went into her own room; I never saw her more.</p>
               <p>Q. How early the next morning (Sunday) did you see the prisoner - A. I had been out on Sunday morning; about eleven o'clock the prisoner opened my door; he said, neighbour, will you be so kind as to step into my room; he said, I do not know what is the matter with my wife; she came home last night very drunk; she tumbled down, and never moved more. I went into his room; I saw the poor creature on the ground; she looked black and blue, and blood was coming out of her mouth. She was lying on the floor on her right side. I said, your wife is dead. He said, do not say so. I felt her hand; she was cold. Her face appeared black and blue. I then called in the other inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a sober or drunken woman - A. I never saw her drunk in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what terms did she and her husband live, did they live happily or very unhappy - A. Very unhappy.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been frequently disturbed by them - A. No; they kept themselves to themselves, and so I did. They lodged in the house three or four months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever hear my wife and I fight, or only have words - A. Only have words.</p>
               <p>COURT. How far was your room from the prisoner's room - A. There is a little passage between; his is a back room and mine is a back room.</p>
               <p>Q. When there was any noise in his room was your room in such a situation that you could hear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140032"/>it - A. I could hear, but I could not understand what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. When the deceased came into your room on the Saturday night was the prisoner in his own room or not - A. I do not know. I continued up about an hour after I saw the deceased. I think I went to bed about an hour after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in their room that night - A. Never a word.</p>
               <p>Q. When the deceased left you did she go into her own room or go out - A. She went into her own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person that lodged on the same floor - A. There are two front rooms, and lodgers in both these front rooms.</p>

            . I lodged on the same floor with the prisoner and his wife; they lived very unhappy indeed. I have heard the deceased as she went down stairs call him a murdering rogue. I have heard them wrangle, but I did not notice the words.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her on Saturday night - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise in that room on Saturday night - A. Yes, at almost ten o'clock, as I was unlocking my door, I heard a violent blow against the partition, and when I came into my room I heard another small blow come against the other side of the partition. I neither heard a word or a groan.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that noise was in the prisoner's room.</p>

The prisoner then was standing with the door in his hand. About half an hour after that I was walking across the passage, I heard him say, Mary, why do not you get up.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that was the alarm given that she was dead - A. About half an hour after that, and upon the alarm being given I went into the room; I found her laying on the floor on her right side. All her clothes were on. She was dead. I could not tell from the appearance of her face whether she was a black woman or a white woman. I was frightened. I ran out of the room immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you hear me have any words or fighting with my wife that night - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. You say it was almost ten o'clock at night when you heard the noise in the prisoner's room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue at home the whole of the evening after that - A. No, my husband and I went out together.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the noise you heard like a person falling against a partition - A. I think that was the first noise, the other noise was a very small noise indeed. I neither heard a voice or a groan.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at that part of the room in which you found the body the next morning - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What aged woman was the deceased - A. I don't know indeed. I think she was between fifty and sixty; a little woman, not infirm; she used to go up and down stairs very well. She was a very hard working woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place that you heard the noise near their bed, or not - A. Yes, close to their bed</p>

He said, go along, look and see if you can find any marks upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she cold - A. I did not touch her I said to the prisoner, you old villain, you have killed her; he told me he had not, and if I said so again he would serve me the same.

               <p>Q. You did not hear any noise in her room that night, did you - A. No, not a word; nor any noise.</p>
               <p>Q. Could there have been a noise of a person tumbling down without your hearing it - A. If I had been looking out of my window I could not hear any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you looking out of your window that evening - A. I cannot remember any more.</p>

               <p>Q. On Saturday evening did you see the deceased - A. Yes, about half past nine; I saw her on the stairs as I was going to market; she gave me the wall, she was coming up.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the alarm of her death did you go into her room - A. Yes; her face was quite black; her eye was large, starting out of her head; upon her throat were marks of white; her hand was over her face; she was dressed; her apron and bonnet were off; the ribbon of her cup was on; her shoes I think were off her feet; her cap was tied under her chin with two little tapes. I cannot say it was tied tight. I said to the prisoner, you old villian, you have throttled your wife; the prisoner was very angry; he drew back; he said, a nasty wretch, if I said so again he would serve me the same. I was frightened, and ran into the street.</p>

            . I am parish beadle, and headborough. On Sunday, the 22nd of June, I was sent for, upon the alarm of this woman's death; I came to the house about a quarter past eleven. The deceased was laying upon some rags, which they call a bed; there was a bedstead in the room, but no bed; only some rags like taylor's cuttings; the rags were on the floor; the bedstead was turned up, nothing was on it. The deceased's face was very black; her right eye was swelled very much, as if from a very violent blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any account how she came by her death - A. He said, she came home about eleven o'clock very much in liquor; she was in the act of making the bed, and fell over the leg of the bedstead which was turned up, and she fell against the wainscoting, and struck her eye; she go, up after that fall, and fetched herself some beer,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140034"/>and ate her supper; he went to bed; she would not come to bed; she laid down by the side of the bed. He said in the morning he called her to get up; I think he said about eight o'clock, I will not be certain about it; she making no answer he took her by the hand to wake her, and finding that she was cold he ran into his next neighbour and begged her to come in. I sent for Mr. Brown, and Mr. Wright came.</p>
               <p>COURT. You were examined before Mr. Moser - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not give this conversation - A. No, I did not. The bed seemed to be made of taylor's cuttings, or something of that kind. I looked round the room to see if I could see any thing that could have done the murder; I found this rope.</p>

            . I am a surgeon; altogether I have been a surgeon for twelve or fourteen years. I was called in; I examined the deceased; I found there was a considerable distortion of the integuments of the face and neck.</p>
               <p>COURT. That is the outside of the face and neck was a good deal discoloured - A. It was; the transparent of the corner of the eye was extraversated with blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the white of the eye - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Use language that the jury might all understand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. We are not all surgeons. Was there any bruise upon any part of the face - A. Upon the temple there was a bruise.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that bruise any thing to do with her death - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any appearance of the jugular vein - A. I opened the integuments of the neck, the skin, and several membranes; I found a small quantity of coagulated blood in different parts of the jugular vein; on dividing the jugular vein there was a considerable quantity of coagulated blood issued out of the jugular vein. I opened the windpipe; there issued a quantity of mucus, and a quantity of lymph.</p>
               <p>Q. What death did these symptions indicate - A. Suspension of circulation; in consequence of pressure.</p>
               <p>Q. Pressure, where? -</p>
               <p>COURT. There had been a pressure upon the jugular vein that stopped circulation - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you see any marks outside - A. I saw a small mark.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was there this pressure of the jugular vein on both sides, or only one - A. Only on one side, on the right jugular vein; no pressure at all on the other. There was a small mark on the outside of the neck.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was that mark - A. A black colour, strictly upon the jugular vein.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In your judgment could she inflict that upon herself - A. That is impossible for me to say, sir; the pressure on circulation occasioned her death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see any marks of violence on her neck - A. One mark on the temple, and one on the neck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That was occasioned by the fall.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Mr. Wright. Did you observe a mark upon the neck before you made the incision - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to open the neck - A. Conceiving the woman died in suffocation, in consequence of stopping circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the woman a cap on - A. No, I believe it was off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the mark upon the temple of considerable violence - A. It was of considerable violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the mark such as might be produced by the woman's falling or not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the woman to be stunned by a fall and her cap in ordinary tightness, could that cause the pressure of the jugular vein - A. No, it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing her to have fallen down in a fit, and her cap tied tight on, would that have caused a pressure upon the jugular vein to have occasioned this appearance - A. No, I do not think it would; it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot be sure but her death might be caused by apoplexy - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Might that bruise on her temple be occasioned by her falling down in an apoplectic fit - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you have formed a more distinct judgment whether she had died of apoplexy if you had opened her head - A. Yes, a much more accurate account if I had opened the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Would death ensue by stopping one jugular vein - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing there had been a pressure upon one jugular vein would that cause death - A. That depends upon the pressure.</p>
               <p>Q. A strong pressure upon one jugular vein, the other being left free, would the pressure on one jugular vein produce death - A. No, it would not.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw no more to indicate a pressure but upon one jugular vein - A. But on one jugular vein.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a fall in an apoplectic fit produce blood in the white of the eye - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no symptoms but what would be referable to a death occasioned from apoplexy - A. Not one.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was a bruise on the jugular vein - A. Yes, on the same side as the bruise on the temple.</p>
               <p>Q. From the situation of the two bruises, is it possible that they might be received at one, and the same time by a fall - A. No, not by a fall.</p>
               <p>Q. Would a fit of apoplexy produce a considerable swelling of the neck, or considerable exertion on the jugular vein - A. If it is attended with much convulsion it would.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140035"/>Q. Supposing considerable convulsion to be produce in a fit appoplexy, and any thing tied tight round her, either cap or any thing, might that produce such a wound upon the neck - A. Yes, if the knot was extensive.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the knot of the cap had been tied tight and there had been considerable convulsion, might the knot produce that mark - A. Yes, if the knot had been large.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the deceased to have been killed by a pressure upon the jugular vein inflicted by another person, would the death have been instantaneous, or would there have been a good deal of struggle on her part - A. A great deal of struggle.</p>
               <p>Q. And is it not probable that she would have screamed - A. There is a possibility of it, but there would have been a great deal of strugling.</p>
               <p>Q. What would have prevented her screaming - A. - A. The extreme pressure might have prevented her screaming.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this woman of a full habit or not - A. Of a spare habit. She had the appearance of being much younger than the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the appearance of so much strength as to be able to resist - A. She appeared thin, and feeble.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing that indicated that there had been a struggle, was there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had been throtled by any person is it likely that she would have struggled so that to have been heard in the next room - A. Her voice could not be heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she have struggled without being heard in some one or other of the adjoining rooms - A. That might depend on the position in which he had her.</p>

I was at home, and almost as soon as he was in the shop I came forward to speak to a person who was there. He looked at several, and asked the price of several; at last he asked for some cheaper. She asked him five shillings for one, he bid half-a-crown. I told him he ought to be kicked out of the shop for offering half-a-crown; he then reeled out of the shop.

On Monday the 12th of this month the prisoner came to our house, and soon after he had left the seat we observed we had lost two hats, and having noticed the prisoner coming for some length of time in a very suspicious manner, always with a green bag, caused our suspicion. After we had lost the hats I said I was sure he had taken the hats. About an hour after the hats were missing I was in Gracechurch-street; the prisoner passed me with the bag in his hand. I clearly perceived that there were two hats in the bag. I followed him; he observed me follow him; he attempted in a manner to avoid me. I followed him into the gateway of the Cross Keys, Gracechurch-street. As soon as he saw I followed him there, he went up the yard; I still followed him, until he came into Bell-alley, where I stopped him, and told him a little time ago he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140036"/>at Tom's coffee-house, and drank a glass of punch. I told him there was a friend of his would be very glad to see him there. He answered, he would come by-and-by. I told him I would not leave him until he went to the coffee-house He resisted; I still kept hold of him. By a good deal of persuasion I took him there. I took him up stairs into a private room; I immediately sent for an officer. In the mean time that the officer was gone for, he acknowledged that he had got the hats, but that he would give them up to me. He offered me a pound note to let him go. I told him, that I could not do. I delivered him into Harrison, the officer's charge. Soon after, we took him to the Poultry Compter, where the hats were taken out of the bag.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Monday evening, about half after eight, I was fetched by the waiter to Tom's coffee-house, Cornhill. The prisoner was given in my charge for stealing two hats. These are the two hats. There was also in the green bag this mat tied up as it is now. I searched the prisoner: I found on him: one pound note, a shilling, and a sixpence, two duplicates of eight waistcoats in pawn, and a pencil-case.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. What time of day was he at your house - A. He left the house about seven o'clock in the evening; it was about eight when I took him.</p>

He was by business a farrier. He used to go away at six o'clock of a morning. He used always to call me and my brother James. I and James slept in the accompting-house. On the morning of the 9th of July I was disturbed by a noise in the shop about five o'clock. I got out of bed and looked through the window into the shop; I there saw the prisoner behind the shop counter, making a noise among the halfpence. We kept halfpence there, in three tubs. Directly after, I saw him come from behind the counter with two tubs, one in each hand. The tubs are about twice the size of my hat. He was without shoes, his stockings were on; he could walk softly; and finding he was coming towards me with the tubs I stepped forwards and seized him. Upon my seizing him he begged my pardon, and said he hoped Mr. Green would forgive him; it was his first offence. I sent for an officer directly.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of halfpence did you find in them tubs - A. Ten shillings and upwards in each of the tubs. When the officer came we searched his pockets; we found above thirty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, among those that you found in his pocket were there any five shilling papers - A. Two five shillings that I had left in the tub. Two of the tubs contained ten shillings each, and the third contained thirty shillings, not less, and the tub which contained the thirty shillings was empty except three halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. And you counted above thirty shillings in his pockets - A. I did. Some of the halfpence were good and some bad.</p>

The prisoner seized hold of me by the collar. I had one foot on the curb of the pavement, and the other off. The prisoner seized hold of my handkerchief by the collar. I asked him what he wanted. I took him a little pat by the side of his head. I had two behind me; one took hold of my arm, and the other my leg, and pulled me so that I laid sideways by the post, some part of me up and some part down, while I kept my hold. When they caught hold of me I seized hold of the prisoner, but I did not hold him long. I found myself pretty well choked; I could not halloa. They tore my breeches, and my breeches pocket was turned inside out. Then when I recovered myself I found they had taken two ten-pound notes, two two-pound, and two one's, all bank notes, and I believe there were two three-shilling pieces and an eighteen-penny piece, but I will not be certain. I said I was robbed. I jumped up; they ran away up the alley and I after them. I caught hold of a lad that I supposed to be one of them. He told me he was not one of them. He took me to a place where I knew his master; he was not one of them. I went into a public-house, and described the man. I described the man to an officer. On Monday the man was taken, and when they brought him out of a public-house, I said that is the man, I should know him out of five thousand. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I intended to hit him under the eye, and that is where I took the features of his face. I have never had him out of my sight. I do not know that the prisoner took the money out of my pocket; one of the three did. This is the one that seized me by the collar. I do not know which of the three took the money. It was about half after nine o'clock. There was a kind of a picture shop by; I had a view of his features all over.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your notes ever found - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. You came from the Coach and Horses - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of clothes had the man on that seized you - A. I do not know; I saw nothing but his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a rainy or a moon-light - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you drank a good deal at the Coach and Horses? You went up to a lad and seized him, and said he was one that had robbed you - A. I supposed he was. I am quite sure the prisoner is the man that had me by the collar, and no other. I always said I should know him out of five thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard there is a forty pound reward - A. I have. I do not want a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew him before, did you - A. Yes, and before I went a step further I saw Mr. Mold coming by at the Library, the corner of the passage, in Church-row, by the picture-shop. I saw

             say, have you got it? I passed Mr. Mold; I saw him lean over a post as if he was nearly strangled; his handkerchief was drawn quite tight. He followed me in Church-row to the cork-cutters; he catched hold of me, and insisted knowing who I was I told him it was immaterial who I was. He said he was robbed; he never was done so in his life. I told him he was robbed by the three men that run away, if he run after them most likely he would catch them towards Aldgate. I told him I lived with Mr. Homan He let me go, and walked home with me to Mr. Homan's He told Mr. Homan that he had been robbed in Church-row of twenty-six pounds. I told him then that I knew the man by seeing him in the street at different times, where I am in the habit of going with meat.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the person of Abrahams well, did you - A. I knew him well by sight. I did not know his name at that time. I am quite sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>JURY. Was it light enough for you distinctly to see his face - A. Yes, it was a light night, and at this picture shop in the corner there were two candles in the window. There is where I saw Mr. Mold. I never saw the face of the other men then.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I let the lodging to the prisoner. On the 25th of June last, I let her a one pair back-room at six shillings and sixpence a week, furnished; the prisoner called herself Vergo; I wished to have a reference. She asked me if I knew Mrs. Scott; I said, yes. She fetched Mrs. Scott. The prisoner came on Thursday. On Saturday I met her in the passage with something in her apron; she said Mrs. Miatt, I am going home with my work, I shall pay you in the evening. I did not see her for two or three days after that: she went away on the 4th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she continue in your lodging - A. About nine days. She never paid me any thing, only the earnest. I found my things on Saturday after she went away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was missing - A. The bed-curtains, a candlestick, and a flat iron. I found the things on the premises of Mrs. Scott; I let the things to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Stubbs - A. The person she called her husband; he came there on Sunday, and dined there; Stubbs made no agreement with me. I am sure the prisoner is the person I let the lodging to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your things again - A. Yes, I had Mr. Scott taken up; she well knew them to be my property.</p>
               <p>Q. May be she took it - A. I cannot say who took it.</p>

On the evening of the 24th of November, the prisoner came to my shop with a lady, and asked to look at some ear-rings; I produced them. They looked at several pair; at last the lady chosed a pair of cornelian ear-rings; the gentleman said, take them if you like them, if they are a shilling dearer then you can get them elsewhere. He took out of his pocket-book a bit of paper; he paid me: it appeared to be a two-pound note; I asked him for his name, and address; he said, he would write his name on himself; he took the pen, and wrote the name that now stands on it.

Upon my taking it I asked his name, and address; he gave me the name of Williams, which I wrote on the note; the address, New-road, 17: I wrote it at the time in his presence. I have no doubt he is the same person that gave me the note. I had seen him before.</p>

I received two one-pound notes of Foy; I was searched; I had no other money about me; after receiving the notes of Foy, I went to the prisoner's house, Gloucester-place, Vauxhall-walk; Dale's first question was to me, is there any thing the matter with Walker; I answered no. I asked him if he had any more notes, we wanted some; those that we had were so pale we could not offer them; he said he believed he had none except five's; he would look, and if I would return the others he would alter them for me. He asked me if I could send my son with them, and he would alter them for me against the evening; he shewed me a two-pound note; he asked me if I thought it would do; I said, yes, it would do, and took it. I understood that he had done them with Camel's hair pencils, and Indian ink. He delivered me the two-pound note; I brought it away. I told him I was going to the Royal Oak; my husband was there; I asked him if he would go there with me; he said as he was in his dishabille, he would rather not. I went to the Royal Oak; Foy took the note from me. I had no other in my possession.</p>

I was in company with a gentleman, who I have subpoenaed, merely to prove that I was at the Bush tavern. Mrs. Walker is a wicked abandoned woman; as to the note she says she had of me she might as well say ten. If her evidence it taken in any shape I, as well as all the world, might be hanged.</p>

The prisoner is the same gentleman that was on the stage coach with me from Bristol to Bath; I am positive sure of that; he told me what business he was, that he lived at No. 5, Union-street, Lambeth-road.

He asked me where I was going with the saddle; I told him. He gave me three cherries, said, good bye, make haste home, and then when I got a little further another man came up, and said holloa, what was I about; Mr. Blackwell had been waiting for the saddle ever so long; and after I had walked a little way further a third man came up, and asked the prisoner which was the way to Church-street; then the prisoner said I was to give him the saddle: I said, no; I must take it. He then untied the string that fastened the saddle to my shoulders. The person that came up, and asked the way to Church-street said he would give me some money to shew him the to Church-street.

            . I am stable-keeper. I had been at Mr. Kendall's mews; after I came out of his stable I met two men, one of them had a saddle. I said friend, is that saddle to be sold; he said, yes, for three pounds. I said two pounds ten shillings will do, but I will have the girts with it. They left the saddle at Mr. Prior's. I called again about seven o'clock in the evening; they never brought the girts. The officer came and claimed the saddle as being a stolen one. The prisoner is the man I bought the saddle of, and I paid him for it.</p>

Upon my coming home I looked into my scrutoire; I missed two twenty-pound notes. I deposited the notes in the scrutoire on Saturday, the 12th of June; my boy received them of Bond and Company, and marked them. In about six or seven days after the robbery I went down to Gosport; I there found the the prisoner in a public-house. I employed a constable; the prisoner pointed out his trunk at his lodging; the bill of parcels was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140041"/>found in the prisoner's box in my presence.

Spare me from becoming an exile from my wife, family, and friends. You well know that I can procure respectable persons to whom you are no stranger, who will step forward and be security for the sum which you are deprived of, and if necessary for the amount for which you are bound over to prosecute, should it be in your power to withhold the prosecution, I and my family join.</p>

About the 16th of May last the prisoner came and looked out a parcel of goods to the amount of sixty-three pounds, for which he wanted me to give him credit until he had sold them. I told him it never entered into my mind to give any credit whatever. I told him my young man should go with him, and whatever he sold he was to pay him, and whatever he got above the sum I charged to him was to be his profit. I sent my porter with the goods with a charge not to give them up to him upon any account whatever. The goods were cambric, shawls, and long shawls.</p>

The prisoner then took me to a street in Holborn; he did not sell any there. He then took me to a house in Holborn; he sold ten yards of cambric there, and one scarf. He got the money for it. We came from there to the same house in Bride-lane, Fleet-street; we there sat down together. He asked for the parcel of goods; he said he thought he could sell them to the landlady of the house. He took the goods with him. I did not see any thing of him afterwards. I thought the prisoner long in selling them; I enquired; the landlord told me he had been gone out of the house with the goods some time. The prisoner never returned with the goods or the money.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of June, in Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital. I was coming by at the time that Sabine was running after him. The prisoner said that he had taken the saddle and bridle entirely for want; necessity drove him to do it. I found the saddle and bridle at Mr. Hill's, in Swallow-street, where he told me he sold it. I believe at that time he was in considerable distress.</p>

               <p>(The note read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been some time an inhabitant of Bristol, and I have been in the habit of trading from place to place frequently. I have taken country notes. I have been glad to take bank notes, because country notes would not go in London. I never had a bank note, but what I paid twenty shillings for it. I have received upwards of forty pounds since last February, from that time downwards. In the first place, I received of Mr. Davis half a year's annuities, ten one-pound notes. My finances were poor. I have had a sick wife and a large family. I never gave a false address to man or mortal. I took out a licence to sell any things where I could. On Monday, after my licence was dated, I went from Bristol, and was coming to London. My licence was dated the 29th of February. I carried a good deal of goods with me. I went with the coach to Chippenham. I went to the Antelope; I supped there and breakfasted there; my dinner came to six shillings. I gave a ten pound note. I received change, nine pound and fourteen shillings. There were three or four recruiting serjeants there. I sold dominos there; they gave me another pound note. I got a returned chaise, which took me to Marlborough. I slept at Mr. Cole's, the Coach and Horses. I sold dominos there. On the day following I sold one dozen pair of shoes for one pound two shillings and sixpence; then I sold two pieces of straw plat for one pound in Marlborough. From Marlborough, on the Wednesday night, I went to Hungerford; on the morning following I went to Newbury; and on the morning following I went with a returned chaise to Reading; and the next morning I was looking for a returned chaise to come towards London. There was a returned chaise at Maidenhead, and just at that moment I had to repack my goods; a man came and looked over my goods; he said he was a corn-cutter. He shewed me some boxes of salve, which sold at one shilling a box; he said he would sell me them at eight shillings a dozen. He lived at No. 1, City-road, the corner of Old-street. He paid me three one-pound bank notes for straw plat, and thirty shillings. Then after I came to London I went to Fry's banking-house, facing the Mansion-house, up a court; I there exchanged four country notes for bank notes, and some other notes I changed in Birchin-lane, to about four pound. I was here last October. I came to the Admiralty office to get a discharge for my son; I then went to that public-house, the Shades, with Mr. Withey, and when the girl told Mr. Withey the note I gave her was a bad one, Mr. Withey told them I should come again. I never passed a bad note knowingly. I never had one but what I paid twenty shillings for in trade.</p>

He changed a ten pound note at Chippenham; the change was nine pound fourteen shillings; at Chippenham he sold some dominos; he received a one pound bank note; from there we went to Marlborough; we slept at Mr. Coles, the Coach and Horses. He received three one-pound bank notes at Marlborough of different people; he gave change for one of the notes. My father generally asked for bank notes. He left Marlborough to go to Hungerford. I got up the next morning at seven o'clock to go by the Marlborough coach to Newbury. I cannot say whether he took any money at Hungerford. He met me at Newbury at one o'clock. We left Newbury at seven o'clock the next morning. At Newbury he took three one-pound notes and thirty shillings in silver, of a man who said he was a corn-cutter; he bought plat to the amount of four pounds ten shillings. He said his salve was sold at a shilling a box; he would allow my father three pence a box for selling it. He gave his direction, No. 1, Old-street. the corner of the City-road. I saw this corn cutter pay my father three one-pound bank notes, and thirty shillings in silver My father never marked the notes he took. I cannot speak to them. My father never gave a false name or address.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you find there - A. Mrs. Hopgood, the wife of John Hopgood. The prisoner came in soon after I was there; on the prisoner coming in he was asked to sit down; Mrs. Hopgood said she was glad to see him; he said John was gone to purchase some things for me; meaning her husband. The prisoner then said he had just come from Birmingham, where he was able to get all sort of things; he produced a one-pound note; he said it was one of the things that he had brought with him. It purported to be a bank of England note; he shewed it to Mrs. Hopgood; on which I requested, I believe myself to look at it, and asked him if he had any objection to sell me one; to which he assented. I then paid him; he gave me that same note that I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. You had that note in your possession at the time, had not you - A. I don't think that I had it in my possession at the time; it was handed back again, and then given to him. I then asked Hughes to sell me one I believe; I had returned him that note, considering that note to be dirty, and not sufficiently clean; upon which I received another of him, that was a one-pound note; I put the note in my pocket, remained there some time, and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing with the note - A. I did not, except keeping it in my possession until the following morning, then I put the mark upon it the following morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the note you put the mark upon the following morning was the note that the prisoner gave you - A. I am certain of it, because I ever had it out of my possession; I delivered that note up, into the hands of Mr. Westwood, the clerk in the solicitor of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you delivered it to Mr. Westwood - A. About twelve or one o'clock the day following.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember Hughes producing any thing - A. I saw two bank notes that Hughes had; Hughes had a great many notes; a one-pound note was shewn between Roberts and Hughes; they handed it one to the other; I never had it in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hughes do any thing with that note - A. Nothing further than give it to Roberts; Roberts said here Mr. Hughes is the ten shillings. I did not see the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect before this took place any conversation about Birmingham - A. Hughes said he came from Birmingham; that is all that I heard.</p>

               <p>Q. He offered you one of these notes for thirty shillings - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw one or two bad notes produced by Hughes - A. Yes, I saw two.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the ten shillings that passed would be the balance for one of these notes - A. I did not see the money; he said here is ten shillings. I did not see whether any notes passed between them; he did not say; I could not swear for they sent me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Hughes come there to enquire after one Blissard - A. Yes, I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your husband who is in a distressful situation - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes had Roberts of Hughes - A. I believe he had one.</p>

While I was in the the coach I asked him if he knew Roberts; he said d - n him, he wished he had never seen him; the first time he saw him was in Hopgood's room. He asked me if I had apprehended Hopgood; I told him I had, for the same offence.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that a genuine note or a forged one - A. It is a forged note; it is not from a plate used by the Bank of England, nor the paper, nor the water marks; it is forged throughout, in every respect.</p>
               <p>(The note read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Hopgood's house to enquire for Mr. Blissard; he rented a coach-house of me, in which he made a coal-shed; when I enquired for him Roberts was there; Roberts said it is no matter where he is, he is a d - d rogue. He produced these country notes; he asked me if I would purchase one of them; I told him if I was tired of my life, and when I was I should take up such things as them; I had bank notes in my pocket, good ones. He offered me one of the five-pound notes for thirty shillings; I told him I would not pick up such things if I saw then in the highway.</p>

            , at Brighton. I wrote a letter to her; I got an answer to my letter, which induced me to take him; he came into my service about the middle of May; he had almost a new dress of livery; besides that he had a new blue coat with gold lace button-holes on each side of the collar, and a new linen jacket; he had a dress livery as good as new, that he left; he took with him the new blue coat, two waistcoats, and also two new pair of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you had some friends to dine with you on Monday the 23rd - A. I had to dine, and sup; I had not a vast deal of plate; the knives and forks must be in use. On the 24th I was out to an evening party in Saville-row; I was disappointed of my friend calling for me; when I came home I called for my servant; he was not at home. I was determined to set up until he did come home; indeed I let him in myself. He had the new livery on. I told him that was the last time that the door should be opened to him. The prisoner quitted my service the next morning. I never saw him until after he was apprehended; he never applied to me for any wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your ladyship know whether any of your plate was missing - A. I went and examined it, and found the articles missing in this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you competent to speak to the value of this property - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140045"/>MARY HODGKINSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I do; he came to live in lady Hunloke's family about eight weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he an inventory of the plate delivered out to him - A. He had, a day or two after he came. I compared the plate to the list, and counted it out to him; I saw that it was right; he was to keep it in the plate cupboard, in his own room; it was all right when I delivered it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a silver cup among the articles - A. - A. Two, four tea-spoons, two silver soup-ladles, twenty-five silver forks, six silver dessert-spoons, six silver dessert-forks, six dessert knives, seventeen table-spoons, a plate and waiter, one large waiter, one small, and a marrow-spoon</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with these articles - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. When lady Hunloke had a party was the plate used on that occasion - A. I saw both the cups I am sure; I am not certain as to the others. I saw the plate in use; I did not make any particular observation.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being out late and coming home on the night of the 24th - A. Yes, he came home between two and three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to bed that night after coming home - A. That I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not refused a Imittance - A. No. I heard what lady Hunloke said to him when he came in; she told him it was the last time he should come into the house; I expected to see him about in the morning, but he did not make his appearance; in the morning I went into his room myself about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bed appear as if any body had been laying in it - A. Yes. I looked at the plate-closet, the plate was intermixed one thing with another, it was all confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you compare it with the list - A. I did; after a time I think I went up stairs and I told her ladyship; she sn me for her nephew, Captain Digby; he came and we counted it; I counted the plate, and missed the articles in the indictment. The plated coffee-pot was missing, one silver goblet-cup, four tea-spoons, a soup-ladle, eleven table-spoons, were gone; one silver fork, two or three dessert-forks, and one salt-spoon was missing, and the small plated waiter was gone, and the marrow-spoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find lady Hunloke's livery missing - A. One of the new livery, not the dress livery.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the plate that was left where it was his duty to keep it - A. It was; he never returned to lady Hunloke after the 25th any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any apparel that he left - A. Yes, a coat, a waistcoat, an old pair of breeches, and an old shirt; I believe the clothes that he has on were left behind.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a carpet from the house any time - A. I did not miss it until the patrol alarmed me. About five o'clock in the morning the patrol informed me of the street door being open. My husband and I occupy the parlour only, the other rooms in the house are let to lodgers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband at home when the patrol gave you this alarm - A. Yes, he was, but not awake until I awoke him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the last person up the night before - A. I was I left it on the spring-lock; the door was left unbolted; there is a small string goes through the door for the lodgers to let themselves in.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not one of the lodgers come in and have the door open - A. It might happen so, but I do not know it. When the patrol gave me the alarm he had the prisoner in his possession. There had been no force at all used to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did that carpet belong to - A. My own parlour; the carpet was taken up and moved in the yard, at the back of the house, to have it swept before I put it on the parlour again; no person could have got to the back yard without coming through the house.</p>
               <p>- SAUNDERS. I stopped the prisoner; I had a suspicion that she had stolen the carpet. I first saw her in Archer-street, about a yard from Mrs. Costello's door. I brought her back, and knocked at the door. Mrs. Costello claimed the carpet as soon as she saw it. This is the carpet.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is my carpet; it is worth twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the carpet and a shawl together in the street.</p>

            . I am a servant. On Whit- Monday, the 7th of June, I was in Mr. Cave's yard; the prisoner came down, and asked me if the sawyers had been at work; I said, yes, they were breakfasting. The prisoner then said he supposed they were gone holiday keeping. I said I believed not, they would be there by-and-by; he then went into Mr. Cave's shop; the prisoner went in without any thing; he came out with a saw; he then came up to me and said if the sawyers come tell them I want saw to cut one cut down; he said he was at work at the corner of Red Lion-passage, in Ormond-street. That is all that past. I rather suspected it was not an honest thing. I saw no more of him until the owner of the saw apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Did this man work in Ormond-street - A. No; I understood he is a sawyer; he has not been at work for many years. The saw has never been found; from the description of the man I took him in custody.</p>

            . I am a servant to Messrs. Leigh and Southerby. On the 30th of June, in consequence of instructions that I had received from Wheatley I watched the prisoner; he took this book off the shelf, put it under his catalogue, went and sat down upon a form, and then he put it into his pocket. I informed Mr. Wheatley what I had seen; Mr. Wheatley went up and spoke to the prisoner, and took the book out of his pocket. The prisoner said he had bought it, and he would pay for it. Mr. Wheatley called out who had bought it; I looked in the catalogue, and found that Mr. Prest had bought it.</p>
               <p>MR. SOUTHERBY. I am a partner with Mr. Leigh. When Adkins, the officer, came, the prisoner said he had purchased the book, and wished to pay for It; I said that was not sufficient for me from what I had heard of my servant. The prisoner then was in the accompting-house; he offered twenty pounds, I think he said, rather than it should come public.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I attended different sales of books, where frequent opportunities offered to purchase at a quarter price they were published at. I had two objects; the first was to collect the prices at which the books sold; secondly, to purchase whaever books might be useful to me, and was offered at a low price; I held the book in question under my catalogue as a prop to write on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am in the house of Leigh and Southerby. I accompanied the officer to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140048"/>prisoner's lodgings, on the 30th of June. I, and Mr. Southerby selected the books in the prisoner's room; I selected most of them. I selected Drunken Barnaby's journal; it was in Dr Johnson's sale, which began on the 17th of June; that book was sold, but had not been delivered; Lewis's history of the translation of the Bible was also in Dr. Johnson's sale; it was sold to Mr. Ogle, but had not been delivered; Massey's Origin of Letters was in the Doctor's sale; I believe it was sold to Mr. Willoughby, but not delivered; Dr. Oakes's history, I missed that day it was to be sold; the grammer of seven languages, that book had not been sold; I remember it wanted a title, this was in Dr. Johnson's sale; also Whittaker's History of the Britons, that I do not speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any that Mr. Southerby selected that you can speak to - A. I remember this book by it wanting four leaves; it is the art of wooing; it does not mention imperfect in the catalogue; Coleby's Cape of Good Hope, I know that; it is only one volume we have the other volume I left on the shelf, that was in Dr. Johnson's sale; Levi's Jewish ceremonies, I remember this book very well it was lost; and Granville on Witches had not been sold; I know all these books.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at Balaam's Ass - A. I know that by the coat of arms; that was in Dr. Gossack's sale; it was not sold.</p>

            . I live in Southampton-row; I keep a hotel two doors from Lady Briscoe's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What morning was it that you observed the prisoner and any other person - A. The morning of last Sunday week.</p>
               <p>Q. What first drew your attention to them - A. Some conversation I heard in the street; I was induced to look out for my own safety; I saw several persons walking; I saw the prisoner there; another person was with him; they were talking under my window; they were watching about, walking backwards and forwards; I thought they were no good. I saw the person that was with the prisoner, he went and unlocked the gate, came under my window again, and the prisoner went very diligently and opened the area-gate; he went down the area-steps; I watched him close for about five minutes; I then put on my clothes, and down I went; I opened my door, and out I went to the person in company with the prisoner; I said what are you; he said he was calling the servant up. I said, I will soon see what you are about; he ran away; he was off in an instant; I went down Lady Briscoe's steps, and went into the kitchen. I hollooed out holloo, what are you, who are you; in about a minute I heard the prisoner running along the passage, over my head; I saw him coming out of the front door; I called out to the people coming along opposite, to stop him; I saw him running as fast as he could; he then crossed the way; I kept as close to him as possibly I could; I pursued him; he went into Southampton-court, that court leads into Queen-square; a man stopped him between the posts.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this - A. The time he stopped him was about twenty minutes after six. It was broad day light.</p>
               <p>COURT. The sun arose before four, you had an opportunity of seeing him before he went into Lady Briscoe's house so as to see his person minutely - A. I had a particular view of him just as I might be looking at you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time he ran away until he was stopped - A. Yes, I lost sight of him about half a minute; there was no person intervening but the person that stopped him. I lost sight of him when he turned the conter. When I saw him I was sure he was the same person; I had been watching him a quarter an hour. I saw him searched; when I went down in the kitchen I saw some keys taken out of his pocket, thirty skeleton keys, and a small crow.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down in the kitchen tell us what you saw, and where - A. The kitchen was dark except at the door where he entered; I saw a knife and three silver tea-spoons laying on the dresser in the front kitchen close to the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you gone out that morning before this breaking in was effected - A. Yes, out of the kitchen door, and up the area steps, and out of the area gate. When I went out I locked both the doors after me. I went out just after the clock struck six.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the things, the spoons and the knife, whose property are they - A. Lady Briscoe's.

The knife I believe was in the cupboard; I know the spoons were.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the things in the little case, whose property are they - A. They belong to me. The case and the silver pencil case, a silver thimble, a good</p>

            ; I live just by the Maypole side, in Barking, Essex. I come to London to sell poultry occasionally. On the 29th of July I was selling poultry in Whitechapel at the corner of Winfield-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner near you part of the time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any thing to do with a gentleman of the name of Sims - A. Yes; I sold him sixteen chickens, and took two one-pound notes of him. I at that time had a one-pound note in my purse; that two pound made three. After I had dealt with Mr. Sims I put it into my bosom, and when I came to Petticoat-lane I had my purse in my bosom until I came to Winfield-street. Mr. Sims bought the Poultry at his house near Sun-tavern fields, and when I got to Winfield-street I sold two geese to a man; I took a one pound note of him; then I had four pounds. I took the purse out of my bosom, put the note in my purse, and put the purse into my pocket. After I had done so I saw the prisoner near me; I sold one chicken to a woman that keeps a green-stall. I put my hand into my pocket to take my purse out to put the shillings in; I missed my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner near you when you missed your purse - A. No; he was gone when I missed it. I judged the man that bought the two geese. I judged that he must know where my purse was.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was the prisoner taken after you missed your purse - A. About half an hour; he was brought into Winfield-street, where I was; he was searched; there was found upon him five one-pound notes; I had but four; they were altogether in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sworn to the notes - A. No. Mr. Sims was sent for at the magistrate's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the note that you had of Mr. Sims was in your purse when your purse was taken away - A. Yes, and I put my purse safe into my pocket.</p>

            . I am an headborough of Whitechapel parish. I took the prisoner in Winfield-street, adjoining Petticoat-lane. I took him to a neighbour's house, and searched him along with the prosecutrix. I found five one-pound notes upon him. These are the notes; they are all one parcel, folded up just the same as they are now. Another man took the prisoner in hold for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Q. to Prosecutrix. Had you charged any body else with taking the notes - A. I told the man that bought the geese it was likely he must see the purse, or know of the taking it. When I accused that man he went into a place where the men were gambling, and picked the boy out, and held him until the constable went and took him.</p>

I said I must not leave it with anybody whatever; he said he would give me a shilling if I would let him have it. I told him I must take it myself; he then again said he would give me a shilling. I told him I wanted to see the young man; then he swore, and used threatening language. He knocked me down, took my bundle from me, and run away. I ran after him, hallooed out stop thief, and got close up to him. He said he would cut my throat if I did not hold my tongue. I ran after him until I was out of breath. I lost him at last.</p>

The gardener had given me them. I was met by a female; she said I had a nice bundle. I kept on, and I felt the the bundle jirk out of my hand. I turned sharp round to seize the bundle, and these men made up to me; Briant struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see when you turned round who took your bundle - A. Yes. I saw the woman had it; I made my way after the woman that had got my bundle, and after I had almost overtook her Briant gave me another blow. I put my hand out to take the woman; he gave me another blow. I collared him; then Hildrith came to trip me up; then after that I found that one of them had got hold of my neck. I called out for help; a watchman came up. When the watchman came up Hildrith was in company still.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay with your brother - A. Not long. I came out, and perceived that the mare and the cart were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in the cart - A. Three casks, the apron with a peck of peas in it. They were empty casks that I had brought for yeast. The two casks that I lost were worth about one pound, the cart and harness three pound ten shillings, my apron sixpence, and the peck of peas ten pence. The mare was worth five pound: she was old, but in good condition.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the mare, cart, and harness again - A. Yes, on the next evening I saw the mare and one cask in the cart. I think it was about half past eight. I saw it in Mile-end-road. There were two men in the cart, driving it with reins.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 22nd of June, the day the cart was taken away from Chiswell-street, do you recollect seeing the prisoner that day - A. No, I did not; he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these two men in the cart, was the prisoner either of them - A. No. My neighbour went on and stopped the cart, in consequence of seeing my cart going along. They said that somebody had it at St. Giles's. These two men brought me back my cart. It was the same mare that had been taken away my apron and peas, and two casks were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of your own knowledge you do not know any thing that leads you to say the prisoner was the man that took it - A. I do not know any thing of the prisoner taking it. It was the same mare.</p>

            . I am an ostler at the Maidenhead inn, George-street, Bloomsbury. The prisoner brought me the mare in on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. No, I never saw him before. I am quite sure of his person. The prisoner came in with the mare and the cart between six and seven in the evening; he asked me if I would take the horse in. It was a mare in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there in the cart - A. One cask in the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any green pease in the cart or any apron - A. No. He asked me if I would take the mare. I took it in, the same as I would any other horse. I took in the mare, and he went away. He never came near it until the next morning about six o'clock. The cart was left in the yard, and the cask. I am sure the same man returned in the morning as he came in on the evening with the mare. He brought another man with him in the morning. In the evening he was by himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for what the mare had - A. The prisoner that brought her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner act in all respects as the owner of the mare and the cart - A. Yes; he told me that he had given ten pounds for the mare and cart. He asked me what he had to pay for the mare's keep; I told him eighteen-pence; he paid me; he and the man went out of the yard with the mare and the cart; they both went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you saw him again - A. He came again twice towards the evening; he said he had lost his horse and cart; he came to know whether the other man had brought it back again, and he came again the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you heard that this had been a stolen horse and cart - A. No; I never heard it until afterwards. He came again the third day to know whether I had seen any thing about the horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the prisoner was a stranger to you - A. Yes; I had never seen him before to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon his bringing you that did you have any conversation with the prisoner - A, I told him I was surprised, and that he was doing himself a great injury. I suspected him, and had him taken in custody afterwards. I went to Queen-square office.</p>
               <p>COURT. After he brought you his letter when did you see him again - A. I never saw him after until he was brought to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken - A. A serjeant was sent down to the Tower, and he was taken in custody. He was not taken in custody at Chelsea hospital. He was brought to the office in some little time after.</p>

My lord, I was taken in entirely altogether by a man that came to me at the Tower; he stated himself to be an old soldier of the regiment; he asked me some names, whether I knew them. He asked me of serjeant Ring, whether I knew him. After that, he met me again in about eight days; he told me on Tuesday to draw this prize money. We were drinking together; he told me if they asked me any questions, to say I was the man, and to ask if serjeant Ring's wife had

I went back and told the man; he asked me which day I should go again; I told him I was ordered on the Friday. I gave him the certificate back. On the Friday following I was going up to Chelsea with two letters; one for the serjeant-major, and the other for the quarter-master-serjeant at the depot, Chelsea. This man laid his head down on the table; he said he had been up the night before; he told me I might do his business as well as himself. He handed me the certificate. I went and told them that I had come for

I told him there was a William M'Coy, whom he thought was in town, and lived at the Cumberland coffee-house; he told me to bring the servant that gave me this certificate. I went back to the man at Charing-cross, and told him what this gentleman said. He said, do you go presently and say Mr. M'Coy is at the coffee-house; he gave me this letter with the certificate: he said that would get the money, and he would give me a drink out of it. He said they would not ask any questions when they saw this. I gave the letter to the gentleman, not knowing what was in it; he kept the letter; he said it was a defraud between me and the servant, or somebody else; he told me to go away, and come another day. 
I went off, and went to the Tower barracks. In the evening a serjeant ordered me out of the ranks, and ordered me up to Chelsea.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in George-street, St. Giles's. I told him for what I had taking him; I asked him what he had done with the horse and cart; he said he did not know where it was; the man that he had with him had drove it away. I asked him how he came to drive the man's cart and horse away; he said he was afraid he had made a bad job of it; he had taken it, and he did it through distress. I asked him if he had any friends; he said he had, but they all turned their backs upon him, and he did not care how soon he was hung.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he say this to you, did he appear to be perfect in his senses - A. He did; he appeared to be perfectly in his right senses when he was apprehended, but when he came before the magistrate he acted as he does here. The magistrates were loath to commit him until they had seen his brother, and had an interview with his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. I suppose you have kept your mare and cart ever since it was restored to you - A. Yes; I have not brought it here. The same cart and mare was restored to me that was taken away; I took it to the office in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. to Skinner. Was the mare and cart that you saw at the office the same that was brought to your yard by the prisoner - A. Yes, the same.</p>

            . On Friday, the 17th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was carrying the coat to Mount-street, the prisoner spoke to me and asked me if I was in an hurry; I told her yes. The coat was done up in that handkerchief. She asked me to carry her bundle, done up in a towel round the corner to a butcher's shop in Grovesnor-street; I took the bundle of her: I was to tell them that Mrs. Johnson would call to-morrow. She asked me then for my bundle; I told her I could not spare it. She said upon her word and honor, she would not go away; I gave her the bundle; I turned round and saw the prisoner running away: I hallooed out. I could not overtake her; I told Mr. Watkins what had happened; Mr. Watkins pursued her. I stopped at the corner of Mount-street; he sent a boy for me; I went to the public-house, and saw the very same woman that run away with my coat. I told Mr. Watkins that was the same woman that run away with my coat; my father afterwards came and claimed the coat.</p>
               <p>Barclay. This is the coat, and this is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my coat; I made it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw the child in my life, until I saw her in Marlborough-street office; I met a young woman in Grovesnor-square, she took me to this public-house; she saw these men coming in, she gave me the coat in the handkerchief, and ran out at the back door; I stood there, I had not sat down.</p>

Yes, on Friday, the 30th of June; I had seen them in the parlour at eleven o'clock at night, and the next morning at seven o'clock they were gone. The prisoner worked for a lodger in my one pair of stairs; the prisoner told me that she slept on the stairs all night, and that she went out in the morning.</p>

I served him with the tobacco. This flask of oil was within his reach; I saw him take something from where the oil stood, and on my coming round the counter I missed the flask of oil. I took the prisoner within ten yards of the door, with the flask of oil under his coat.

            . I am a plumber's labourer. Me and my partner were at work in the building, in the two pair back-room about half past two o'clock. I had to go down to the back kitchen; we had a fire there; we were making a joint to a leaden pipe; I was going down the kitchen stairs; I heard a rustling noise in the shop, I cast my head round; I saw the prisoner with a basket, and one or two saws; he threw the basket down with the tools, and pushed by me, making a queer sort of noise. He endeavoured to escape along the passage; I called to him to know who he was; he made no answer. I followed him; he got through the place where the board was loose, that he had come in at; I catched hold of him by the skirt of his coat, and the board being on the swing struck me on the head; the prisoner did that, which made me leave my hold; I followed immediately afterwards, and secured him; I never lost sight of him; he went only to the next door the wine-vaults. This is the basket he had.</p>

               <p>Burgess. These are mine.</p>

The prisoner robbed me of my gown; I took the prisoner to take care of my family while I went out to work; I returned home at one o'clock; I missed the prisoner out of my room, and I missed my gown at night; when I came home the prisoner was there; I asked her where my gown was; she told me that she had left it at a person's place for sixpence.

               <p>- CAVILLIER. I am an officer. On the 9th of June, I took the prisoner into custody. I asked her what she had done with the gown; she said she had pawned it at Mr. Thimbleby's for eighteen-pence, in the name of Davis. I went to the pawnbroker, and there I found it. Mrs. Grainger saw the gown before the magistrate.</p>

I asked him what he had got; he said a pair of boots and some grub. He said he had a brother lived at Woodford; he gave it to him. He put the bag down; I found there was no grub in it; there was a pair of boots and about a pound of butter fresh from the churn, not made up, three cabbages, some beef, mutton, and bacon, some cheese and some dripping. The constable went down to Woodford, and found where it came from.</p>
               <p>MR. GARVER. I am a constable of Hackney. Between twelve and one o'clock on Sunday morning, the 20th, the patrol brought the prisoner to the watch-house, and the things that he has described. The prisoner first said his brother gave them him, and afterwards he said it was his wife; she lived with Mr. Inglish, in Snakes-lane. I went down in the evening and saw his wife; she said she gave him all the things the bag contained, and that they were given to her.</p>


               <p>Prosecutor. I have every reason to believe the prisoner's wife gave them to him.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that he took them - A. I am well aware that he took them, because he and the other person run; I pursued him, and by the assistance of a guardian of the night he was taken to the watchhouse. The shoes were taken from him by the beadle of the watchhouse. I pursued him directly the goods were gone; I saw him run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them taken away - A. Yes; I did not exactly see them taken away, but seeing the man run I came out and pursued him. They snatched the goods, and away they run. I cannot say exactly whether the prisoner stole the shoes or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. At the watchhouse did you see the shoes drop from the prisoner - A. Yes. They were new shoes. I think it was the other man in the smock frock that stole the shoes, but the prisoner was in his company.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a patrol of the parish of Hackey. On the 27th of June I stopped the prisoner in Back-lane, Clapton, between five and six in the morning; he had a wooden sign of a bunch of grapes in his hand, and some other articles, which turned out to be his own. I asked him what he had there; he said they were all his own, except the wooden sign, and that he picked up in an hedge a little of this side Highgate. He said he had been bay-making. I took him to the watchhouse, and delivered him up to Mr. Carver.</p>
               <p>MR. CARVER. I produce the wooden sign; the prisoner said he found it.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On Friday night, the 2nd of July, I received information from Gentery that he had been robbed of his watch. The next morning I apprehended the prisoner at her lodging; I desired her to give me the watch, or the duplicate of the watch that she had taken from a person a night or two back; she accordingly fetched it me, stating that she had had taken it from a person on Wednesday; he had only gave her four pence; she did not think that enough. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He asked me for a ticket of a thimble; I said I had a ticket of a watch; I went and got it him.</p>

On the 30th of June I saw several articles behind a bag of wood in our house. I looked at it, and found it belong to these boxes left under my care. I informed my husband of it. They were afterwards removed by the prisoner. There was no other person had access to the place besides our own family.

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. On Friday the 2nd of July, in the evening, I went to Mr. Claxton's house; Mr. Claxton informed me that he had suspicion of the prisoner taking some things that were under his care. At eight o'clock at night I saw the prisoner going out; I did not conceive that he had got any thing upon him; I would not interrupt him, and stop him. On Saturday I attended again at one o'clock at noon; the prisoner went out to his dinner. Mrs. Claxton went into the warehouse, and informed me that the towel was gone, which she had seen there a few minutes before. I then immediately went after the prisoner, and apprehended him within two doors of his own house; I told him his master wanted to speak to him. I took him into his master's parlour, and searched him; I found two candles in his jacket pocket; they are the property of his master; they are not in the indictment. He took his hat off, and in the hat I found this towell marked I R. I searched him. I searched his lodging; his wife was in the room. I told her I had apprehended her husband; I was come to search the lodging; in the drawers, and upon the top of the drawers I found all the things in the indictment.</p>

When the gentlemen had done playing he played two or three games of billiards, and we were coming home; it was half past ten, or rather later.

After I had been in some time I fell asleep; he awoke me with his right hand in my waistcoat pocket; he took some silver out of my waistcoat pocket: I had a watch without a chain in my pocket; he took that out, and took the silver that was under it; he let the watch fall; that awoke me. After a few minutes he put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took all my silver out of that; he then took my silk handkerchief out of my right hand coat pocket.

I followed him an hour at least. I took the prisoner out of the mob, and searched him; I found upon him these seven handkerchiefs, and one pistol, it was loaded with gunpowder only; I have advertized the things, nobody has come forward to own them. I have made a particular enquiry of the prisoner, and found he has an excellent character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose your nails - A. I cannot say exactly the day; I was directed where to find the goods, and the moment I heard he was in the habit of selling these things; I examined the property. He had been selling to Mr. D'Valky; I told the prisoner that he had been selling nails to Mr. D'Valky, and I suspected they were mine; he told me he had bought them at a sale. I said I was surprized that he should have money to go to market that way; he then said he took them for a bad debt. In a day or two I went to Mr. D'Valky, I looked at the first bag, I saw they were mine, they had been returned from a customer.</p>
               <p>MR. D'VALKY. I live upon Saffron-hill. I bough the nails of Mr. Truman, I gave either five-pence or five-pence halfpenny a pound for them. The prisoner brought his wife and children for me to suit with shoes; he then said I'll go and fetch the nails.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property; the value of both the bags of nails was about nine pounds before any of them were used. I can swear that I never sold either of the bags.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 16th of June, near twelve at night; he was in company with another. I knew the other very well. I first saw them at the corner of <placeName id="t18130714-106-crimeloc612">Bow-street</placeName>

They both returned back to Bow-street again. I saw them both attempting there to pick pockets. They left there, and went under the Piazza's; two gentlemen came from the play-house door into King-street; I saw the prisoner try at a pocket once or twice before he got the handkerchief out, and as they were walking along I saw the prisoner take the handkerchief out in <placeName id="t18130714-106-crimeloc614">King-street</placeName>

I called out to the gentleman, and told him that he had lost his handkerchief; he said, yes, I have. I told him I was an officer of Bow-street. He said he would attend in the morning; he never did attend. The gentlemen were both strangers to me. As soon as I apprehended the prisoner his companion took to his heels, took a handkerchief out of his hat, and threw it away. I have both the handkerchiefs. This is the handkerchief the prisoner took; I think it is worth five shillings; the other handkerchief is worth two shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the coach-glasses were all safe when you came to take up your master - A. Yes. I did not see the glasses taken away. When I moved I saw the coach door open; I got down to see whether all was right, and the glass was gone. It is a plate glass; it is worth ten shillings. I saw the glass again in two or three days afterwards at the office, and the prisoner then was in custody. I know it to be my master's glass.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner near the play-house - A. Yes, and I have seen him at the watering-house in Charles-street; he is one of the cadee's to hackney coachmen. On the evening of the 17th, I was watching him and two more in his company some time; they were hanging about the carriages. I saw the prisoner go to the carriage door, and take the glass out. I was looking through the spokes of a hackney coach wheel; I saw him take the glass; he put the glass under his coat, and walked away; the other two walked away from him. He was between the carriages, towards Covent Garden. I pursued him, and got up to him; I laid hold of him at the end of Russell-street, the end nearest Covent Garden; he made way for me to pass him; I told him I did not want to go by; I wanted to see what he had got under his coat. I took it from him. I said, it is a glass; he said, no, it cannot be a glass. I took him by the collar with one hand, and the glass in the other. At the corner of Bow-street he resisted. The hackney coachmen at the end of Bow-street formed a line to prevent me from going by, and attempted to break the glass. This is the glass. I got him into the Bunch of Grapes, and secured him. I gave the glass to the landlady; she ran down stairs with it, or else the glass would have been broke.</p>
               <p>Q. You perhaps did not know the very carriage again from whence it was taken - A. No, I did not. I made it known to all the coachmen, and the man appeared and claimed the glass for Mr. Wilson.</p>

Then the prisoner Wells pulled it a little further out; then Gosling took it right out. Gosling wiped his nose with it, and put it in his pocket. While the handkerchief was being pulled out in my judgment the gentleman did not perceive it. The prisoner Gosling turned round and saw me; he went across the road, and left the other two immediately. I took hold of Gosling; I told him it would not do. I took the handkerchief, and sent to the gentleman; the gentleman returned; he claimed the handkerchief in Gosling's hearing. The prisoner said he was sorry for it; he was in distress, and had had no work for some time. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140062"/>gentleman gave me his address; his name, I think, was

I shewed him some of various sizes; he asked the price; I told him forty-eight shillings a pound; he said, weigh me out ten pounds, which done he asked me if we had any white three cord silk. I shewed him some of various sizes; then he said, weigh me out five pounds. He then asked if we had any blue three cord; I shewed him some; he desired me to weigh him up two pounds weight. There was not quite enough of the blue; I put in two skeins of the white to make up the two pounds. He then said that he was recommended by Mr.

No. Young then said that he had been purchasing that morning, and had laid out one hundred and forty pound, and had paid ready money; now, he said, I hope you you will let me have this as low as you can.

The porter took the receipt in his pocket. I deducted the discount by his request. He told me he should pay me ready money when he took the bill of parcels. He said, make them up securely, to keep them dry, and send them up to the Cross Keys, St. John-street. He introduced himself that he kept a grinder's shop at St. Alban's.

I packed them up in three parcels, and put the name of Young upon them. I then wrote a receipt, and gave it the porter, (his name is Price) together with instructions not to leave them without the money. The prisoner, Young, said, send the goods and the receipt by the porter, to the Cross Keys, and I will return the money by the bearer.</p>

Mr. Dickman gave me a receipt; I put the receipt in my pocket, I was to deliver the goods<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140063"/>to the prisoner Young. I met him in the gateway. On my delivering the goods the money was to be returned. Forty-two, pounds seven shillings was the money I was to receive. I met the prisoner, Young, in the gateway; he asked me if I had not got some goods for him. I said, yes. He asked me to walk into the parlour, and the money, he said, should be paid immediately. He asked me to drink. I had some rum and water with him. I took the goods out of the bag; I placed them on the table near me; I asked the prisoner, Young, whether Molloy belonged to him; he said he did; Young said he was his servant. Molloy heard this. Young said he always took him with him; he had a horse and chaise up the yard. Young took the parcels off the table, and gave them to Molloy; he said, take them up to your mistress. and bring down forty-two pounds seven shillings. I should not have let the parcel have been taken out of the room if the money had not been talked of. I, at the moment, believed that the money would be brought down directly. The prisoner said that he had a house and a little land at St. Alban's, (that was after the goods were taken up stairs), which enabled him to pay ready money for the goods he bought. In the mean time he called for another glass of rum and water. I told him I did not wish for any more; I was waiting for the money. He then said his servant was gone a good while for the money, but his wife had got some friends up stairs in one part, and he had his friends in another. He then said, you will excuse me, I'll go up stairs and fetch down the money. My curiosity led me to enquire at the bar. I then went home. I have since seen the silk at the office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever see Ralph during this - A. No, I did not. On my going home I met Mr. Dickman; I told him every thing that had taken place. Then Mr. Dickman and I went back to the Cross Keys; we made enquiries after Young and Molloy; we were unsuccessful. There were no such persons there, nor had there been any horse and chaise in the yard of theirs.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Ralph and Molloy in Red-lion-square, on Thursday, the 17th of June, about one o'clock. I told them I took them about silk. They laid it all to Young. I apprehended Young on the same day, in Kingsgate-street. I told him what he was taken for. He said his wife had brought him into a great deal of trouble. I went to Carr's house after I took Molloy and Ralph, and brought the silk to the office. This is the silk.</p>
               <p>Dickman. This is the same silk and the same writing on the parcel. It is the property of Messrs. Brant and Delannay.</p>
               <p>Young's Defence. I bought the goods with intention to pay for them. I sent for the money. I had been deceived by my wife. These other men had no concern in it.</p>
               <p>Molloy's Defence. Young told me he wanted a suit of clothes; he asked me to take measure of him, and to go with him to St John-street to buy the cloth. He gave me a pound note at the Cross Keys; he said take this to the bar to my wife, and tell her to come in with the contents of the bill. He came after me, and said, is she here? I said, no. He then said, she must be in Gray's-inn-lane, give me the parcel. I gave him the parcel, and he went out.</p>
               <p>Ralph was not put on his defence.</p>

After she went out I had my watch, and before she returned I fell asleep. The first thing when I awoke I missed my watch. The prisoner was in the room. I charged her with taking my watch; she denied it. The watchman was going by. I called the watchman in. The watchman saw the prisoner pull the watch out of her pocket. He took it from her in my presence.</p>

            ; I keep a haberdasher's shop. On the 9th of June the prisoner came to our shop between five and six o'clock; she asked for some narrow ribbon. I shewed her a drawer of narrow ribbon. She said none of that suited her. She asked to look at another drawer. I put in the first drawer of ribbon before I took out the other. She did not approve of any thing in the second drawer. She staid some time. I asked her if there was nothing that suited her. She said, no, she had come for another person. She was in the shop ten or fifteen minutes. I asked her if any thing had dropped. She said, no. I looked at her hand; under it I saw a piece of narrow ribbon that had been in the drawer. That ribbon is worth about two shillings. I insisted upon seeing what was in her right hand. She drew her hand off the counter, and threw the ribbon behind the counter. My husband was behind the counter; he picked it up. She then said she did not throw it down. I know her person, and always suspected her.</p>

            . I lodge at this public-house, in Rosemary-lane; between eight and nine in the evening I was coming down stairs; I saw the prisoner on the stairs with something in her apron, which proved to be these pots; I sent for an officer: she searched her, and found these pots upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she doing in your house - A. She was enquiring for a Mrs. Hamilton.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Robson. Look at these pots - A. Two of the pots are mine, and the candlestick; the other pot belongs to a man that keeps the Fourteen Stars, in Rosemary-lane.</p>

I said you know me very well, I have a right to enquire; I seized him by the collar; the other two went across the ditch, and Crouch threw a bottle of wine away;

We went about six yards further, there he and me had another scuffle, we went down again; I begged my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140067"/>boy to take the wine up. He took hold of the apron, and the bottles fell in the ditch. We went a little further; we were down again; he got hold of me by the throat, and I got hold of his throat; he tore my throat and neck all to pieces; at last I secured him by the assistance of a baker: he resisted desperately; I took him to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was employed by Mr. Smith to watch the meadows. About half past one in the morning, I saw two men come into the field, and take a large cock of hay, and put into the barge: there were three men, I only saw two active. The short prisoner steered the boat, and the other was steering; there was only hay in their boat; there was no hay in the other boat. We weighed the hay, it weighed eighty-five pounds. I saw them put it in the boat quite plain.</p>

On Thursday morning I went down to my stall; the padlock was taken off. I missed four pair of shoes unfinished, and three lasts. On Friday morning, news was brought to me that a man was in custody at St. Martin's watchhouse, and we had information that he had a stall in High-street, Bloomsbury; Westcoat, the officer, broke his stall open, and there was my property.</p>

I went with him to Golden-lane, Barbican, and when we came to a public-house Smithers said here is the man in the house. I then said to the prisoner where do you live; he said fifteen miles down in Kent. I said I am sure you do not, what made you here; he said let me have a drop of porter, and send to my wife. I took the prisoner in custody. On the Monday after the prisoner had his hearing I went down to Pinner to find the prosecutor, and the lads, the witnesses; I slept at the King's Head, kept by Ball; I asked Mrs. Ball if ever she remembered Collie coming there; yes, she said, very well; he was in the house the evening that Mr. Cushion's copper was taken away.

               <p>Q. In the Spring of this year did he happen to call upon you for any sum of money for Mr. Johnson for soda water - A. Yes, two pounds sixteen shillings; I think he first applied about February; I told him I believed it was paid; he assured me upon his honor it was not. I told him the person that conducted my business had delivered up all the receipts; he assured me it was not discharged, and I had no reason to doubt his integrity; I told him if he would call again in a few days I should be able to meet with the person who had conducted my business; I should be able to ask him more fully upon the subject; upon that he went away. In about a week he came again; he brought me a letter purporting to be writ by Mr. Johnson; stating that he requested immediate payment of the money, or he should prosecute him, and discharge him from his situation; I then told him to make my best respectful compliments to Mr. Johnson, if in the course of three days I did not see this man that carried on that part of my business, I would then pay it.</p>
               <p>COURT. What was the name of the man who attended your business. - A.

            . I think the defendant said he would deliver that message to Mr. Johnson, but he was that kind of positive character it would be of no use; he left me, and returned in the afternoon of the same day, he then presented me a summons, and said Mr. Johnson's compliments, he believed that was the best way of settling this; I did not attend the summons; one of the commissioners sent their compliments, and fixed another day, on which my son attended; I paid the defendant on the 17th of March; he said he had positive instructions from Mr. Johnson unless I paid he should take out an execution. This is the receipt.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see him again - A. Not till the 24th, he was stopped on the 24th in consequence of information from the house of Luck and White; I saw him stopped at the house of Luck and White, on the 24th of April.
