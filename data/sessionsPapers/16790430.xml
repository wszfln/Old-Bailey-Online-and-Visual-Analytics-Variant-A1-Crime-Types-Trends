This last was admitted by the Gentleman now at the Bar, to lie with him in his Chamber, and understanding that the Owner of the next Chamber had a considerable sum of money there, they resolv'd to possess themselves thereof: in order to which, knowing that his Beds-head stood just opposite to theirs, they first remove their own Bed, then take down a large piece of Wainscot, after that, at convenient times, when they knew their Neighbour was abroad, fell to work on the Brick-wall, which they dug through, and pluckt up the Hanging on his side, and forc'd away the Bed, till they got room enough to enter. Then they break open his Closet and Trunk, take away the Money, very neatly carry off all the Rubbish that had faln in on that side, return into their own Chamber, pluck his Beds-head up close to the wall, and set their own in its former posture; so all seem'd cleverly performed: Then they share the Money, 200 l. being left, and since found in a drawer in the young mans Chamber; the rest the other two take, and ride down into Kent. The Owner of the Chamber, at his return, perceives himself robb'd, but could not imagine which way, finding his door double lockt, and all the Chamber to appearance sound; at last removing the Bed and Hanging, discovers the Breach. That night the Gentleman now a Prisoner, coming home-late, was seized, and the 200 l. found. Some time after the other Prisoner coming to London, was apprehended; but the third Criminal, with the far greater part of the Booty, got clear off. They were both found <rs id="t16790430-3-verdict13" type="verdictDescription">
