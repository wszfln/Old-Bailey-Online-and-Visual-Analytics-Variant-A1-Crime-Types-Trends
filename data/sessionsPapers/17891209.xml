               <p>I was robbed on the 5th of July last, on the highway; I left Lincoln's-inn a little before eleven o'clock; I was going into the north; there was another gentleman with me in a post chaise; it was a very rainy morning; nothing particular happened till we got to <placeName id="t17891209-1-crimeloc4">Finchley Common</placeName>

                        targets="t17891209-1-off1 t17891209-1-crimeloc4"/>; when the first thing I observed, was two men rode up past the chaise, one on one side, and the other on the other, and called out stop! stop! not having the least idea of a robbery at that time of day, I let down the window, and called out, what do these fellows want? the gentleman that was with me in the chaise, called out, want! d - n me, why we are stopped and robbed; the man who was less than the prisoner, was on a bay horse; the other man, whom I took to be the prisoner, was mounted on a black horse; and the other man rode up to the side of the chaise, and presented a pistol, and said, your purses, your purses; they both presented a pistol; then the taller man that was on my side of the chaise, who staid longer with the postilion than the other, came to my side of the chaise, and presented a pistol, and said, your purses, your purses; he first asked me for my purse. I said something to him, that I was surprised at such a thing happening at that time of day; he immediately said, no talk, your purse I immediately gave him my purse, in which there were six guineas in gold, and some silver; I cannot say exactly the quantity; but I remember there was six guineas in gold, and some silver; as soon as he had my purse, he said, your watches gentlemen, your watches; the other man had taken my companion's watch; I told him I had no watch; he said, no watch! and I said, no, I never travel with a watch? and he said, pho, pho, I know who you are very well; I know you do travel with a watch, give it me; I thought before I denied having a watch any more, that I would look down, to see if it was visible; and I looked down, and saw the seals hanging on my thigh; then I said, if you know so much about the matter, you must have the watch; and I gave him my watch; there were four seals, three cornelian, and one white chrystal set in gold; then he said, now Sir, your rings; and I said, rings, Sir, we have no rings; he seemed to be satisfied with that; he said, your pocket books; he said, you must have pocket books; and I pulled out a red morocco tweezer case, and said, you; surely will not take it? and he said, no; and I was going to put it back; and he said, yes, I will take it too, and there was an imperial farthing in the tweezer case, a pen knife, and a pair of scissars; I mentioned that in my examination at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner, and tell the gentlemen of the jury whether you can swear positively that he was the person that committed this robbery? - I do verily believe the prisoner to be the man that committed the robbery; I had seen him before, and I was very much struck with the circumstance of his saying, that he knew me; and when he was gone I began to recollect what highwayman it was likely I should know; and seeing the prisoner at York, which I once or twice had the pleasure of doing; I said to the gentleman that was with me, if I was not sure that

             was out of the kingdom, I should be sure it was him; I knew that considerable pains had been taken by myself, and others to get him out of the kingdom; I did at that time think he was abroad: I had some reason to think it; I have mentioned to you, that while he was arguing with me about my watch, he held the pistol to my head, and I said, Sir, we are totally unarmed, and can make no defence, therefore I should be obliged to you to point the pistol another way; upon which he turned his horse a little, and either by accident or the wind, the crape flew up, and I saw the lower part of his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090004"/>face very distinctly, about as far as his nose; I saw across his face, and I saw the lower part of his face very distinctly.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot positively say the prisoner was the person? - Whatever strong belief I might have in my own mind, as I did not see his face, I certainly would only chuse to say what I have said, that I do believe him to be the man, but I did not see his face; he has a pretty strong Irish brogue, as you will hear, if you hear him speak.</p>
               <p>You had some knowledge of the prisoner before? - Yes, my lord, he was at York some time, and during one summer assize, I saw him repeatedly at Mr. Sinclair's house, that was four or five years ago; he lived at Mr. Sinclair's house then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Mr. Heywood, I am very glad that in the latter part of your examination, a circumstance has come out, as it explains what you said of knowing the prisoner at York, because, when Barristers talk of knowing a prisoner at York, it makes impressions; I believe when you knew him, it was in the character of a gentleman visiting at a very respectable house in the country of York? - Certainly, it was, and very respectably he behaved; I thought him a very agreeable young gentleman; I know he was introduced by a very respectable gentleman; I believe he is of an excessive good family in Ireland.</p>
               <p>You have given your evidence, as all of us, who know you, expected you would, with great candour and fairness; is not the appearance of the prisoner exceedingly altered from that which you remember to have seen of him at York? - Yes, he is grown much larger and stouter.</p>
               <p>But the opinion you took up was from the circumstance of having known him before? - Yes, and which circumstance, I am told, made a much greater impression upon me than it should; for I am told it is a very common thing for them to say that they know people: I never saw him since the robbery, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Heywood, I must ask you a question, which we frequently ask witnesses, to discredit their testimony; you will do me the justice to believe that I do not ask it you with that intention; soon after the robbery did you meet nobody on the common that you might have communicated this to? - I had the pleasure to meet you, Sir, on the common soon after.</p>
               <p>And very kindly let me go on to be robbed, I believe? - I had no idea that you would be robbed.</p>
               <p>I had the good fortune to escape your kind wishes? - I dare say you had; I do not think you was in any danger of being robbed.</p>
               <p>Court. Would the prisoner say any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. No, my lord, I would not advise him to say any thing on this occasion.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. No.</p>

               <p>I am coachman to Mr. Capper; I drove his carriage on the 19th of November; as my master was going to town in his coach, about twelve, he was stopped by two highwaymen, upon Stanmore Common, near Stanmore; one stood before me with a pistol, and the other with another pistol at the coach door, and demanded my master's money and watch; I saw the man sometime with my master, about five minutes, it might be longer.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the persons of either of the men that stopped your master's carriage? - The prisoners are the two men; I have seen them; I am certain sure they are both the two men; I never saw them since, before to day; their horses were very wet and dirty; one horse had a star in his face, and his ears put back; I have seen the horses that the prisoners rode, but I cannot swear to them; I saw the prisoner Crew put my master's watch into his pocket.</p>

               <p>I am a smith and farrier; I live at Elstree;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090006"/>through information of a robbery being committed in Hertfordshire, I pursued these highwaymen, on the 19th of November, between the hours of eleven and twelve, I believe it was when I set out after them: I pursued them from Elstree, from my own door; I took the road about two miles from the St. Alban's-road; I found the prisoners at Pinner; they returned back again, and crossed the Common; it is between three and four miles from Stanmore Common; I found them at a publick-house, in a room together.</p>
               <p>What were they doing when you went in? - They were standing with their backs to the fire when I went in; nobody was with them; I found the horses in the stable before I found the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Was you present when either of the prisoners was searched? - Yes, close by; that was at a publick house before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Who was that magistrate? - Colonel Miles.</p>
               <p>State what was found on either of the prisoners? - I cannot particularly state it, but the property was found on both of them; they are here (produced); there were three watches found concealed in the hat of Crew; and these two purses were found, but I do not know which on either; there is another purse that was found in the room; this handkerchief was found on one of the prisoners; that purse was found in a closet in the room, with pistol bullets at one end, and powder at the other; these keys were found upon them; there was another watch found upon them, which I have not got; and a brace of pistols were found on each of them; I do not recollect any thing was found.</p>

               <p>"It was not from any desire in us to evade justice, that we, at our arraignment, pleaded not guilty; but from a wish that every circumstance attending the commission of the offence with which we stand charged, might be made known to the Court and the Jury; and that we might have an opportunity of informing your lordships of our conduct and character in life, previous to that day, when we unhappily first thought of resorting to so unjustifiable a means of procuring money.</p>

We are not old offenders. We are not, I assure your lordships, hardened in iniquity; and the grief under which we at present labour, is not because we are detected thus early in the commission of our crimes, but because we have so widely strayed from that golden rule, which from our infancy we were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090007"/>taught, of doing to others, as we would they should do to us. We fear it is now too late to hope for such an extension of the royal mercy, as to afford us an opportunity of convincing this part of the world, of our contrition of mind, and the reality of our repentance. But we do humbly presume to hope, that the gate of mercy will not be wholly shut against us. We have made no bad connections; we are not experienced in the practices of vice; we are very young men. The distress we have occasioned our parents and friends, is a source of the most painful reflection to us. Every possible lenity and indulgence we have experienced from those who are under the necessity of prosecuting us; and we hope to meet their forgiveness for the injuries we have done them. Should mercy be extended to us, our future conduct shall, as far as it is possible, atone for those offences which have reduced us to the disgraceful situation in which we now stand."</p>

               <p>Did you see him throw the bundle down? - No, I did not; I took him within two yards of the bundle; and there was nobody at the same time by, nor for three or four minutes afterwards; these are the things that were in the bundle they have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>To Drew. What sort of night was it? - Rather a moon light, but the moon was rather in a dulness; I was about five yards before the lady; the prisoner ran up Eyre-street; I am sure there were no other persons there; there were two turnings between Piccadilly and King-street; he turned first into Eyre-street, then into Castle-street; I never lost sight of him; I was within twenty yards of him.</p>

               <p>I was going from my work in Charles-street, Westminster; I supposed my master would be here; he is not; I stopped in the Hay-market at half past eight, and drank part of two pots of beer; and from thence went down to Piccadilly, to a public-house there, to a friend of mine; he was not at home; I went from there up the haymarket; I went to look for the foreman of a shop in Glass-house-street, to enquire whether I should be wanted; in the next street, at the top of Eyre-street, Piccadily, seeing the lady and this man together, coming down Eyre-street; a man went up to this lady; they were there for a moment; I saw the man run; the lady screamed and run; I ran almost down to the top of Castle-street; the rim of my buckle flew off; this man came and caught hold of me; and asked me what I had done with the bundle; he said he saw no thief but me; he caught me by the collar, and I was taken down to the watch-house; my witnesses are not here; it was not ten o'clock; the watch was not set.</p>
               <p>Court to Drew. Were there two persons running before you, or only one? - Only one; I swear positively; it was rather better than half past ten.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had the person you was pursuing, a bundle under his arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That was my own coat? - I am sure it was the prisoner; I saw a bundle on him while I pursued him; I never lost sight of him.</p>

               <p>Did this happen in Berner-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it a moon light night? - No, it was not; I saw by lamp light, and by the watchman's lanthorn, which he held up for the purpose of my being satisfied that that was the woman.</p>
               <p>Is the prosecutrix the woman? - She is.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner do any thing else? - Not besides knocking her down.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner attempt to take any thing else? - No, I cannot say I saw any thing done to the gown.</p>
               <p>Are you sure, by the light of the lanthorn, that was the woman? - Yes, and by the watchman's bringing her back.</p>

               <p>Do you know whether there is any reward for this prosecution? - I do not know I am sure; I do not know any thing about it; I do not do it for the lucre of gain.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Was you in liquor at that time? - No, I was not; she beat and bruised me in that manner.</p>
               <p>Court to Coachman. Was the prosecutrix, the carpenter's wife, at all in liquor? - Not that I discerned at all; the blow she gave her, stunned her; she could not call the watch; she hit her in the face, which knocked her down.</p>
               <p>You say you know the prosecutrix to be the wife of a carpenter? - Yes; she is a very well behaved woman; I never saw her in that line of life; her spouse has worked for Mr. Harefall and Mr. Johnson, for seven years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses; there was nobody by of my acquaintance; there was some of her acquaintance, that walk about where she does, that were laughing at her at the time; they walk in Adam and Eve-court, where she walks herself.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long before, had the other women came in? - While they were chusing the first neckcloth, which the prisoner Taylor bought and paid for.</p>
               <p>Was your father in the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe you gave a signal for your father to come? - I gave no signal at all; he happened to come.</p>
               <p>Did your father desire these two other women to appear before the magistrate? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>You was before the magistrate that evening? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you, or not, to any body before the magistrate, express your opinion, that the other two women had taken your property? - No, indeed I did not.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect speaking to a person of the name of Roberts, belonging to the gaol? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not say any thing in his hearing? - Yes, I might.</p>
               <p>You did not, however, say, that you had reason to believe that the other two women stole your cambrick? - I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Taylor bought some cravats? - She bought one, and paid for it.</p>
               <p>Do you remember some papers being picked up on the floor? - There were some papers picked up; it was the papers of cambricks; the papers in which these cambricks were contained.</p>
               <p>I believe you said that was immaterial, these were only waste papers? - I never said so; somebody said it, but I cannot say who.</p>
               <p>But these papers contained the very cambrick that you were in search after? - They did so.</p>
               <p>You know that this indictment imputes a capital offence to each of these prisoners? - I do not know the manner of an indictment at all.</p>
               <p>You did not know, perhaps, that this indictment affected the lives of the prisoners? - I did not; I should be very sorry.</p>
               <p>I verily believe it; there are many reasons why you should be sorry; I believe before the prisoner Taylor had well got to the window, you asked her some such words as these; you asked her to give you the cambricks? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What did you first say to her? - I told her that either one or the other must have taken the cambricks; I never said I will thank you for these cambricks; she said, she had no cambricks.</p>
               <p>In point of fact there was no cambricks in her possession? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Your father has been in very distressed circumstances: on the oath you have taken, is this trade carried on for your sole benefit; or whether it is not for your father's? - It is not; it is for my sole benefit, and my sister's; her name is

               <p>You are in partnership? - Yes, she is in partnership with me, and no other person; my father has no interest in the business at all but what I chuse to give him; it is one thing to assist a father who is in distress, and another to be a partner.</p>
               <p>Did not your father set you up in this business, and has not he a right to demand against you and your sister a certain proportion of the profits of this trade? - It is not so; it never was so; the trade is quite independent of my father; he is not answerable for any thing that goes in, or any thing that goes out.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there any other name to the place? - Not as I know off; I was riding down the lane, and I saw two people walking before me, one on one side, and the other on the other.</p>
               <p>Was you on horseback? - Yes; as soon as I rode up betwixt the two they laid hold of my mare's bridle, and presented a brace of pistols to my breast, and demanded my money; the prisoners are the two men.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen them before? - I cannot say I did, but I then knew their faces.</p>
               <p>Was it light or dark? - It was not dark, it was getting dusk; they declared if I would not give up my money directly, they would blow my brains out; and they searched me: one of them put his hand into my pocket, and took from my pocket two guineas, and a sixpence, and a silk handkerchief; and the other took five penny worth of halfpence: I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did they oblige you to dismount from your horse? - No, they would not let me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Fletcher. Who took the halfpence? - The man in the light hair (Fletcher); I knew their faces; I knew them to be natives of the place.</p>

             addressed me thus? my dear, I should be much obliged to you, if you would change me a bad halfpenny; I refused: at that instant the prisoner Yardley made a blow at me with something that cut my coat in the middle; I threw my arm out, and a man jumped across immediately, and hit me across my hand; one of my fingers bled; Yardley and Brown instantly fastened on me.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this a public street where there are passengers backward and forward? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And nobody happened to be passing at that time? - No: I said, do you want to rob me; I know you: and the prisoner Brown said, b - st his eyes, give him a bloody topper; the other one, Guest, said no, no: immediately as that expression occurred, with my left hand I caught hold of the wright wrist of the one that had the weapon, that was Yardley, and I held it; at the same time she advanced a pair of pattens about as high as my head, and threatened me with them; at that instant I expected to receive a stab from one or the other; I stood at that instant so easy, that a child of ten years old might have taken what I had from me; the prisoner Brown was behind, she thrust her hand into my pocket, and drew out what money there was; the other one, Guest, put her hand into my fob, and drew out my watch; I had two books, one in each pocket in my under coat pockets which they did not touch; in an instant they left me, the other one, whose wrist I held, seemed to wish the same; the spot to which they went might be about thirty or forty yards; they went into a court almost opposite this place where they attacked me; I let them advance a little distance, but I kept them in my eye; I saw the house they went into; I went immediately to the watch-house and enquired for the officer; he was not there; but a person there said they could do as well; there were five of them went; I laid hold of a staff and we all went; when we came there, we placed ourselves to the best advantage as we thought; I stood on the outside, two yards from the door, two of them at the door to the best of my knowledge, and two went up stairs; they came down and said nobody was up stairs; they listened at the lower room, and hearing talking, and seeing some persons through the crevises, they insisted on being admitted into the lower apartment; the instant they opened it, I went in, and there were four women and a man below stairs, that was the three prisoners and another woman and a man; I instantly said to the headborough or beadle of the night, I give you charge of these three persons; they are the persons that robbed me.</p>
               <p>At the time they made this attack upon you, was it light enough to discover their faces in the space of ten minutes? - There were three lamps, the light reflects very strong, and I have seen these women before; I pointed to Guest, and said that is the one that took my watch; I pointed to Brown, and said that is the one that took my money; I said six shillings and six-pence; I had no particular mark upon them, but there was a half crown among it; instantly one of the patrol searched her pocket, and there were four shillings and a half crown, and some halfpence; I then went up stairs with Riches: before I went up stairs it was hinted to compromize matters if I would receive my property; I said I would not; I looked upon them as dangerous persons, and if they committed murder afterwards, I should think myself accessary to it; one of the patrols called to me and Riches, informing us that the watch was found; I came down and said, do not describe the watch to me till I describe it to you; it is a particular one; I said then, it was a metal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090020"/>one, there were images on the inside case, but the outside case was exceedingly loose, and would rattle if shook; I said it had a black ribbon instead of a chain; then Riches said, there it is as you said.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - I live about three minutes walk from where it was done; I live at No. 10, Crispin-street, but my business is in the country; I came to Butcher-row, near Temple-bar; I had been at an auction of books, and bought these two; I had been there two hours and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Guest. Whether at the time of our examination at Justice Wilmot's, whether he was persuaded by Riches and Harrison that he was intitled to three forty pounds on conviction, if he was punctually to swear to us; and he said he had been at the London Tavern at a feast, and it was in Gun Court.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Upon my oath it is not true.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about three rewards? - Not a syllable of the kind; I can call people to prove I am not so straitened; I keep my family genteel and lay by for a rainy day.</p>

               <p>I am a patrol, on the 18th of November, about eleven o'clock; I was called on by the prosecutor, to go to the house of these women; he came to the watch-house, and said he had been robbed; I asked him of what; he said in Widegate-alley, he said they were run over into our parish; he said he could shew where they were, for he followed them up to the two pair of stairs room; we went to this two pair of stairs room, and there was a padlock on the door; we found no such people; we came down again, and my partner thought they were in the lower apartment; we knocked at the door, it was some time before any answer was made, at last he told them to open the door, or he would break it open; accordingly, as soon as he came in, the prosecutor looked round, and said, that is one, that is another, and that is the other; them are the three women says he; I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you search them all, or any of them? - I searched them all, and found on Brown, a half crown piece and two shillings in her right hand pocket, and in her other, there was some silver and some halfpence; that she refused to let me have, and that I took from her; I returned to the officer; I found nothing on the other two particularly: the key of the padlock of the two pair of stairs room was taken from one of them; I do not know which; the watch I had from a man who is now in custody, out of a dust hole: for the prisoner Brown said it was not up stairs, it was hid in a dust hole; accordingly she and me went to the dust hole and found it; I had the watch from out of the dust hole, this is it.</p>
               <p>(Produces a Watch.)</p>
               <p>You say that was delivered to you by that man that was in their company? - Yes, the prosecutor ordered me not to let him see the watch, till he had given me the description of it; he described it as a metal watch, with images on the outside case, and a black string to it; it answers that description; he told me the maker's name, and every thing, it has been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the Prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the watch that was taken from me; I am quite sure of it; I think I have had it about three years.</p>

               <p>Was the prosecutor with you at the time the room was open? - Yes, there was a man and a woman which he said he cohabited with; the prosecutor picked out them three, and he said the man was not the man that was with them when he was robbed; he did not charge the fourth woman with the robbery; he first charged the little woman, and we searched her, and I found half a crown and five shillings, and the middle woman said that one of them shillings was her's, for she lent her a shilling; one of the shillings was claimed by the prisoner Yardley; after that she gave them the key to go up stairs to take care of the watch; I went up stairs; they searched her some time; I was informed that it was below; and I called him down;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090023"/>one of the patrols had then a dark lanthorn, she went to look for it but could not find it; I then said, do you go in and find it. Riches went in with her and found it; I said to Riches keep it private till I see what sort of a watch it is; the prosecutor said it was a watch with images at the bottom of the case; the watch answered the description given; the women and the man were taken before the Justice.</p>

               <p>Upon which of them? - I cannot say which, the watch was found concealed under the stairs, but I did not see the watch found. There was another person with us, but there was a mistake that he was not mentioned on the back of the indictment. That man was present.</p>

               <p>I was at this house with the other witnesses, when we went into the house we saw these people; Fogg said those were the three women that robbed him: I went to seek for the property, I could not find it. I searched the prisoner Brown's pocket, and a half crown piece and other silver was taken out of her pocket; after that she said as how she believed she could find the watch; after that a man went into the hole under the stairs, and brought out the watch which was given to Riches: we brought them to the watch-house. I saw the man pull the watch out of the hole, and put it into Riches's hand. I heard Fogg describe the kind of watch that he had lost; and when it was produced, it answered that description.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. Ask him whether he did not take 9 s. 6 d. out of my pocket? - I cannot say how much was taken out, I saw half a crown and 2 s. taken out, and some halfpence besides.</p>

               <p>I had been to Tottenham-court-road, Mrs. Yardley was with me, she was taken with a violent pain in her stomach, I called a coach and went with her; I turned down Smock-alley, I asked for Gun-court, to get a band for a bonnet; the gentleman was enquiring for a Mrs. Edingsfield; a woman rushed through from me, and asked for a place; she opened the door immediately to me. The gentleman saw what property the woman produced out of the box. She said she would make me up one against the morning; I never set sight of the people in the room, nor of Mrs. Brown. These had been some words in the court, the man said so, and he supposed they had taken the advantage of the neighbours; this man said his room was his castle, he would not open the door; the gentleman pitched upon every one, except one, that the gentleman said was his wife. I had no money about me;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090024"/>my witnesses were here the first day; they are very poor people, and live as far as Woolwich; they would have spoke to my character.</p>

               <p>I had been with this young woman Guest, coming from there I had a violent pain in my stomach; we hired a coach the bottom of Holborn, and told the coachman to drive down to the bottom of White-row; I paid the coachman 18 d. he gave me one shilling out of half a crown. We was going to this young woman that makes up the hats and bonnets, there was a great noise in the neighbourhood, about that gentleman being robbed; this gentleman stopped us two in the court, and said we were the people, afterwards he came to this house, where we were taken, all three, to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER BROWN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Coming through the alley, I met a woman, she said there was two women kept in custody on account of a watch and money, and she told me where it was, and I went to the house, and told them where it was, and I was detained on that account. I know nothing of these women any more than the dead.</p>

               <p>I am a plumber; on Thursday the 19th of November (the last witness made a mistake in the month) the prisoner at the bar and two other of my people had been changing the lead from the sewer and the cellar to the yard; we had taken up between five and six hundred weight of lead at Mr. Pott's, when we are taking up old lead I always attend; it was lead that was to carry the waste water off, we could not take it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090025"/>away till the bricklayer had cleared the way, it laying under the pavement; when we came from breakfast the ground was cleared and we took away what we could get at, but this lay near the cellar window. I wanted to persuade the prisoner to lay a few more bricks that I might get some new lead in, but he would not stay; the next morning the prisoner did not come, upon which he was suspected, and I heard he was in the watch-house, I went and examined it, and found it was the lead that was taken from the cellar window; there was another piece in the basket which matched with the first piece I took, they exactly fitted, and I tried it at Mr. Pott's, and they exactly corresponded with the nails; they had neither of them been separated from the houses by any of my men; I received the lead from the constable who brought it from the watch-house, or his man,

            , stands indicted for taking from the person of the prosecutor his money privily and without his knowledge; I state this so precisely, because you will find the case involves two questions, for although from the statement of the case you will find what the prisoner has done, amounts to what is commonly called, picking of pockets, it may not be carried on in that manner which brings the prisoner under the most penal part of this indictment; you will therefore keep your attention to these two circumstances: you are first to determine whether he took the money of the prosecutor from his person; and next whether he did it privily and without his knowledge. Gentlemen, this indictment has been preferred so long as two years and a half ago, as you have already heard; and had it been tried soon after the indictment was preferred, I should have had to produce to you a witness that you would have thought very material; I state this, because I think it is incumbent on the prosecutor in every case to remove all doubt, and to produce every person to the Jury, that in his apprehension can assist in such removal. Gentlemen, the person I allude to is Mr. Adeane, who you will find would certainly have been that material witness; that gentleman has an estate in the West Indies, he has been called and has remained there for two years; therefore it would have been impossible to have had the trial put off on his account; it would have been improper, and the Court would not have suffered it: Gentlemen the circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090029"/>of the case are these: The prosecutor was at <placeName id="t17891209-18-crimeloc99">Drury-lane play-house</placeName>

Gentlemen, to prove this, I shall produce to you the prosecutor, he will tell you how the whole transaction passed more minutely than I can; he will tell you whether it was possible that any other hand could be in his pocket, but the hand that he took hold of; if any doubt should remain, you will have recourse to that which in doubtful cases has weight; he will tell you that the prisoner appeared very confused, intreated to be let go; discovered a great desire that his person might be concealed; you will attend likewise to the circumstance of his having escaped; it is not the mere flight of a man that is in custody; in this case the escape is of that kind which absolutely constitutes in the law another crime; therefore you will be less able to believe that an innocent man would commit that crime to cover this. Gentlemen, I should now leave the case in this situation, if any other person but the prisoner was now to be tried; but I believe you and I have reason to expect that you will probably have appeals to your passions; for I am told at the time when the prisoner last stood in that situation -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I feel myself under the necessity of interrupting the learned gentleman, if I only did it on the entire novelty of the case; for I submit that Mr. Le Mesurier cannot give in evidence that which he is stating to the Jury; I am objecting to that sentence which has been already uttered; Mr. Le Mesurier has already said that which is no secret; therefore I do not object to it on that ground, but I object to it, because it is incompetent to lay it before the Jury by evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. It is better to go on in the cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, not to talk of former trials.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. I was going to desire you, Gentlemen, to look on that man as a perfectly new man; as though you had never heard he had been indicted or convicted before -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Or acquitted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. Gentlemen, I was going to remind you, that if either the prisoner, or any man for him, should tell you, you ought not to give the full force to the evidence, because you might be biassed by the knowledge you have of the prisoner, or by the impression you have of his character, you should dismiss that entirely from your memory; but, Gentlemen, I trust you are above all temptations of every kind; I trust if I should press you, which I do not mean to do, to give any attention to his bad character, or to increase any conviction which may have been wrought on your minds, so as to suppose that you are to be biassed by any thing but that evidence which will be offered to your consideration, that you would totally reject my attempts: Gentlemen, I will not endeavour after what has been said, to anticipate any thing further which will be alledged by the prisoner; and yet after so much mention has been made of his long imprisonment, I must say that that imprisonment has been continued by the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090030"/>prisoner himself in a great measure, because he might have been brought before the Court of King's Bench many terms before the last; and therefore I only conclude with observing, that if any appeal should be made to your passions from that length of imprisonment, that you will consider how that happened, and you will give it no other weight than that to which it is entitled on the observations I have made.</p>

               <p>Was you at the play-house in Drury-lane, on the 19th of January, 1787? - I was; I saw the prisoner there; it was at the end of the play: I left my party to meet my servants, whom I had appointed at a part of the house opposite myself: as I came into the Lobby, I observed I was excessively crowded; a circumstance had then struck me which had transpired on getting into the carriage to come there, and that was, I happened to take out my purse, and a Lady in the carriage observed there was a great deal of money in it; her maid was at the door; she pressed me very much to give my purse to her maid, telling me I was very wrong to carry so much money as well as a valuable watch, which I had, about my person, to the play, on such a night; I made light of it, saying, I never had been robbed: I state these circumstances, because they led me to be extremely on my guard, when I got into the lobby; not only for fear of losing my purse, and watch, but for fear of ridicule. When I got into the lobby, I put my watch chain very deep in my fob, and put my left hand down, in this manner, to guard my pocket; I went along, pressing through the crowd to get to my servants, I felt my purse move, and on feeling my purse move, I immediately got my hand up in this manner, with my right hand, and with my left I turned round to seize the person whose hand I had, and I seized the prisoner's hand close to my pocket, and with the other hand I turned round and I seized his person; I did not say any thing to the prisoner, my aim and wish was to recover my purse, which I thought was in his hand; I had not time to seize upon him, for a Gentleman, a Clergyman, whom I have since found to be Mr. Adean, stept up and said, sir, you are right, I saw him do it.</p>
               <p>Was there any other person at the time it was done so near you, that you thought it could be done by any other person but him? There were people all round: on Mr. Adean's stepping up to me, on my having his hand up still, a Gentleman from the other side called out, sir, here is your purse; and delivered me my purse.</p>
               <p>That was while you had hold of the prisoner's hand? - instantly after Mr. Adean had seized him.</p>
               <p>Was there any interval between the time of your feeling a hand in your pocket and seizing the prisoner's hand, to leave any doubt in your mind that the prisoner was the person that took your purse?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. That is a question to the jury; I object to that question; I take it Mr. Le Mesurier is desiring the witness to draw that conclusion; I do not object to his asking what the length of the interval was; I do not object to his asking whether it was one minute, or five or ten; but he adds to that, have you any doubt whether the hand that you found in your pocket was the hand that stole your purse? that is the whole question in this case.</p>
               <p>Court. But there is another way of putting the question; that is, considering the situation of the prisoner, considering that there were other people about you, was there any person about you, that you had reason to suspect other than the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, undoubtedly your question is quite unexceptionable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. From the interval that passed, was it possible that there could be any other person than the prisoner? - There was no interval whatever; it was instantly on feeling my purse move, that I caught the hand; there was no interval whatever; I wish to state the circumstance, because it appears to me you are in an error, in supposing the prisoner's hand, or any hand was ever in my pocket, my breeches<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090031"/>was never unbuttoned; my purse; although it contained twenty-three guineas and a half, which is a weight, got through my pocket without being unbuttoned, and on examining my breeches afterwards, I found that my breeches was cut through, which convinces me that -</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Never mind the conclusion, state the fact? - My pocket was cut through, no hand was in my pocket; Mr. Adean and myself kept possession of the prisoner's person; after having recovered the purse, I had the care of it, and it being known there was money in it, I got hold of his person with my left hand; there was a great deal of trouble; we were shoved about: But I ought to state, that the prisoner on my seizing him, and on Mr. Adean's assisting me, he said, what do you mean? I am a gentleman; and I felt as if I thought he meant to follow me, but on Mr. Adean's coming to me, he said, consider sir, what you are doing, I am a gentleman; only consider the consequence of this, for God's sake consider; the prisoner was extremely pale and confused; I kept asking him, who are you? to which he gave me no answer, only saying he was a gentleman; we called out for a constable, and after some time a constable came; we asked the constable, who was the unfortunate Blandy, if he knew him; he looked at him very hard, and said, no, I do not know the prisoner; after a great deal of difficulty he was had to the Brown-Bear, where I delivered him to the custody of Blandy, I attended the next day at the office in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner there? - He was not there.</p>
               <p>How came he not to be there? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What kind of purse was this? - A striped silk purse.</p>
               <p>How much money was there in it? - Twenty-three guineas and a half.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Le Mesurier, I wish you to describe a little more particularly the manner in which your breeches was cut? - It was merely the lining of the pocket, perhaps a couple of inches, through here, between this part of the lining and the lining of the pocket. (N. B. it was the upper part of the pocket.)</p>
               <p>You having your hand off the pocket, turned round expecting to find your purse in the hand that you seized? - Yes, it was instantaneous.</p>
               <p>Have you any conception in the world that it was in the hand at the time you seized it? - I really cannot tell.</p>
               <p>No I fancy not: what distance was the person that gave you the purse? - He was close; he must have been perhaps the next to me.</p>
               <p>At the time you seized the hand did you find any sharp instrument in it? - I did not open his hand.</p>
               <p>I beg your pardon, I will not give you much trouble? - I wish a little indulgence.</p>
               <p>You cannot want any indulgence; you say the prisoner was confused: I should rather suspect one should be confused on such a charge; you would have looked pale I believe? - I certainly should have been confused; I do not know whether I should have looked pale or red.</p>
               <p>It would have had some effect on your spirits, and your spirits would have affected your veins and arteries, and that would have driven the blood either to your face or from it? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>It would not have been an effect of pleasure, satisfaction, or gratification? - No certainly.</p>
               <p>It confuses an innocent man more than a guilty one who is used to it, I should think; now another thing, Mr. Le Mesurier, I believe, very soon you was told this was Barrington, before you left the lobby? - Yes, but we were a very long time in the lobby; I was not persuaded of it till a long time after.</p>
               <p>It is my duty to put questions, your's to answer them, not to argue; the inference from the questions is not for either of us, it is in better hands: before you left the lobby you had heard it was Barrington? - I am trying to recollect myself; I had heard it was Barrington, and I heard it was not Barrington; I had heard both ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090032"/>And do you recollect it being stated by some persons in the lobby, that whether it was Barrington or not, or whether it was the first merchant in London, it was necessary to go before a magistrate? - When the constable said it was not Barrington, Mr. Adean said, I saw him take it, and I will lay down my life on the occasion.</p>
               <p>You introduce that which is not evidence, instead of answering my question; did any body say so Sir? - It is very probable, but I really do not recollect.</p>
               <p>I wish you would? - But I really do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Perhaps my stating to you your answer may bring it to your mind; did not you say upon that, there is no use in my going to the office, for I am not certain of him, and know nothing that can affect him? - Oh Sir, I never said any thing like it.</p>
               <p>At Bow-street, do you recollect saying, you seized a person's hand near your pocket, which hand appeared to be the defendant's, and that you therefore believed and suspected the defendant was the person that robbed you? - I believe I did.</p>
               <p>I will repeat the words to you, that you seized a person's hand near to your pocket, which hand appeared to be the defendant's, and that you therefore believed and suspected that the defendant was the person that robbed you? - I believe those were the words at the examination in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>I observe some of the gentlemen of the Jury are so good as to take down the words; therefore, with my Lord's permission, I will repeat them (repeats them.) How early was it after the transaction in the lobby, that the information was made? - It was the next morning about 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>When the thing was fresh in your recollection? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had taken advice, having the advantage of very good advice? - I had my brother with me.</p>
               <p>You could not have better advice or better assistance; I venture to say you knew what was meant by that telling you that was Barrington? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will not trouble you with any more questions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. You stated something that Mr. Adean said, was it in the hearing of the prisoner? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. If I had asked a question that led to this answer, the prisoner must abide by the imprudence of his counsel; but it cannot possibly be a proper subject of reexamination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. I meant what Mr. Adean is stated to have said in the lobby.</p>
               <p>Court. Is Mr. Adean here? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot certainly make what he has said evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. It was said in the lobby.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In the confusion of the lobby; my objection is, that the counsel for the prosecution has not come into it in chief; it has not come out fairly in my cross examination.</p>
               <p>Court. But the evidence was given in chief.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Therefore it is the less fit to repeat it now; I submit, my Lord, that the counsel for the prosecution cannot re-examine but to any subject that arises out of the cross-examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. Do you recollect with respect to the words in Bow-street, - I cannot particularly recollect; I do not know that they were the particular words I made use of; I conceived in Bow-street that I was to come before a Court of Justice; I was not anxious.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean to have it stated that anybody put words in your mouth when you are upon oath? - No, certainly not, what I declared in Bow-street was perfectly true.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. You did not declare them so fully? - Not so fully.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you seized the prisoner, was he on your right hand or the left? - He was behind me, the person that gave me the purse was on one side; I was standing in this manner, I had the prisoner's hand, and the first idea I had, was, it belonged to the person that was before me, but jerking it up, I found it belonged to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090033"/>Court. You say the prisoner was behind you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where was the hand? - The hand was close to my pocket, and he was behind me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you keep fast hold of him by the hand till you laid hold of him with the other hand? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why had you any doubt in Bow-street? - I had no doubt, my idea was the hand belonged to the man that was before me, and I wanted to know to whom the hand belonged, and jerking it up, I found it belonged to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Yes, but you said in Bow-street, that it appeared to belong to the prisoner, and you suspected it was him that robbed you? - That word appeared I never meant, and if I made use of it in Bow-street, I never meant it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is a matter of observation certainly, and very proper.</p>
               <p>Jury. The person that delivered you that purse, had you any reason to suppose he was an accomplice of the prisoner's? - By no means.</p>
               <p>Was he a gentleman? - He appeared so, I never saw him; my only doubt was to whom the hand belonged.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say when you seized hold of his hand your purse was in your pocket? - Pardon me; as my purse moved, I took hold of his hand.</p>
               <p>Was your purse in your fob or in your breeches pocket? - In my breeches pocket, just the lining of the breeches was cut.</p>
               <p>Mr. Le Mesurier. Do you believe Mr. Adean is out of the kingdom? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether the prosecutor had any intimate acquaintance with Mr. Adean? - I never knew him or saw him before that day; I never knew him.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard before or since any circumstance discreditable? - Nothing that I know of; I know nothing of Mr. Adean, except that circumstance.</p>
               <p>You never heard it mentioned that he was insane and flighty, and that he was not of the best principles? - The only thing I heard was, that he was a gentleman that lived about town.</p>
               <p>Lived about town, by what means?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, as the prosecutor has thought proper to bring forward the mention of Mr. Adean's name, for the manifest purpose of inflaming the minds of the Jury, or at least for strengthening the evidence; I think it but fair that he should also state to the Jury what he has heard concerning this witness he has wished to bring.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you ever heard that Mr. Adean was a man of bad character or subject to insanity? - Never. Calling at his lodgings about this business, I have found him not up at twelve in the morning; that is all I know of him, I never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>When you said a gentleman that lived about town, you meant a dissipated man of the town? - No, sir, that is not my idea; all I meant, is that he lay in bed late of a morning.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prosecution. My Lord, I have done, I think it unnecessary to call Townsend, he would only prove facts, not immediately in evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, do you wish to say any thing in your defence?</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; the benignity and candour which mark the judicial proceedings of this country, of which I have recently met a distinguished proof, induce me to hope, with the utmost humility, that the indulgent attention of the Court will not be withheld on the present occasion; but that it will be extended, not through the merit of any thing I may urge; but from the generous and impartial impulse of your own minds, towards every one who is so unhappy as to stand here, the subject of accusation; and if ever there was a case which called for the calm, I will not say the compassionate, consideration of your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury, it is perhaps the present, as well from the heavy affliction I have sustained for many months before I could obtain a trial; as from the newspaper calumny<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090034"/>that has been levelled against me, even under the pressure of a long imprisonment, and to the very hour of my trial.</p>
               <p>It is but too true that I had the misfortune to be at the play about the time mentioned in the indictment; I had sometimes an opportunity to obtain an order for the play, through the medium of a respectable though no very intimate friend, and it is unnecessary for me to say, that the part of the house is not thought material in general when an order is given; I was going through the box passage on my way home, when some one said, it is certainly Barrington, and almost at the same instant I was addressed by a person who requested me to tell my name; I asked his reason for the enquiry; he turned from me, and said Mr. Le Mesurier, is this the person? the prosecutor said he had lost his purse, and that I was near him, but no more; the passage was extremely crowded, and this conversation excited the general attention: some of the bystanders requested I would give my name; I told them I should decline giving my name there; the matter being of an unpleasant nature, but that, if there was any charge against me, I had no objection to going before a magistrate; some gentlemen close to the prosecutor observed, that such a step would be quite unnecessary, if I would call on any gentleman present; while others said that my name was Barrington: the prosecutor in the mean time was no way active on the occasion, or like a man that was at all convinced in his own mind, and an altercation merely about my name continued, I may venture to say pretty near half an hour; when the approach of the constable was announced, the crowd was so great it was with great difficulty they could come near; and then being asked concerning me, he said he could not recollect me, or words to that effect: some gentlemen continued to suggest the propriety of my calling on some person that knew me, which they said would entirely do away all imputation; while others said, Mr. Le Mesurier, you should go before Sir

            ; Mr. Le Mesurier then absolutely replied, what is the use of my going there? I am not sure; I can say nothing to affect him: this, Gentlemen of the Jury, was really the language of Mr. Le Mesurier then, however it may have been forgot; however it may have been changed since to answer the present purpose: some little altercation further continued about my name, when some one said, here is Towsend of Bow-street, he perhaps knows something of the prisoner, let us hear what he says; when he mentioned my name, some Gentleman said, I told you how it was; when several other gentlemen observed that my name was then quite immaterial from the declaration that Mr. Le Mesurier had made; that if Mr. Le Mesurier had been convinced of the fact in his own mind, I ought to have been taken before a Magistrate, whoever I was, or whatever my name was; but that as he had declared, he was by no means certain, it was neither fair nor reasonable that a man should be criminated because his name was Barrington. This, Gentlemen of the Jury, was the opinion of many gentlemen; some of whom I am satisfied Mr. Le Mesurier well knows to be such, and the majority of the company concurred in that opinion: the altercation still continued about my name; and it may appear strange, perhaps incredible, that I, who about half an hour before was accused with a breach of the peace, and as an offender, should be then actually employed as moderator in endeavouring to appease the generous impulse that prevailed in my favor, by requesting that the matter might have a legal hearing: such, however, Gentlemen was the fact. I was conveyed to the publick house, the Brown Bear in Bow-street; and however the unhappy circumstance of my withdrawing from thence may have hitherto operated to my disadvantage; I trust that when the circumstances of the case are duly and candidly considered it will lose that effect; I found myself there under a charge that I clearly perceived looked up to something for its support, beyond facts and circumstances; I had just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090035"/>seen a striking proof what prejudice may be attached to a name, and it was impossible for me to say how far it might not extend. Under apprehension at once natural and alarming, an opportunity occurred to enable me to withdraw, and I embraced it - unfortunately embraced it! I broke no gaol nor watch-house on the occasion; no judicial prosecution or commitment had taken place; and I trust that it may fairly be construed rather as a retreat from prejudice, than as a flight from accusation: In leaving that place, Gentlemen, I neither used violence or pecuniary influence, whatever has been suggested to the contrary; and here it is impossible for me to forbear most solemnly declaring, in the presence of the Court and the World, that the unhappy man who was convicted for suffering me to escape, was neither wilfully or wittingly consenting thereto: if I was of a disposition to rejoice at the calamity of a fellow creature; I perhaps had some reason for it there; for this poor man, instead of doing me any kindness, was perhaps one of the greatest enemies I had in the world: so far, Gentlemen of the Jury, as bringing up my name constantly in the minds of the public every night at the play house; and if I was two hundred miles from London, if I was at any part of the universe, it was immaterial to him; this was still done, it was his constant rule. It is true that the unhappy man was convicted on evidence; for Townsend swore that he must know of my retreat. Gentlemen of the Jury, this poor man was a tradesman, and a shopkeeper; this took up his attention in the day, and in the evening he attended his duty as constable; and he was besides that, an old infirm man, and perhaps in the best of his days he never possessed that keenness of sight which they do who are runners by profession; and I trust Gentlemen, that some little attention will be paid to what I say on this occasion; I have now no longer any interest from it, and he, poor man, can bear no part of it; he is freed now from the strife of life, and not entangled with the perplexities of justice; but it is a tribute due to the memory of an unfortunate man, and I think myself bound to pay it, whatever my own case may be. And, Gentlemen of the Jury, it is with very great concern indeed, that I find myself under the necessity to say any thing, which perhaps may appear invidious or impertinent; I wish not to say any thing that may look like a reflection on the conduct of the prosecutor; and if his memory had not been of the strange nature that I know it to be; I certainly would not say any thing on the occasion, but it is a memory of the most convenient nature; for it can forget circumstances which happened, because they were in my favour; and can fancy others which never did happen, and it can remember only those which may injure and tend to convict me: I therefore, Gentlemen, am compelled to say some thing about the conduct of the prosecutor; the veneration I feel for the wisdom and beneficence of the Court, whose judgment restored me to to the dearest privilege of the subject, the trial by jury, will not permit me to say any thing concerning the law itself, and but little concerning the prosecution; yet thus much I hope I may be allowed to say without incurring the displeasure of the Court; that outlawry is the greatest possible advantage that can be taken by the law of this country, that it sets aside the invaluable privilege of the subject, the trial by Jury, and condemns a man to death unheard; that it was an advantage which the prosecutor derived from real ignorance on my part: that the prosecutor, if he had been the most vindictive and the most cruel man that ever lived in this country, could not have attempted to do more against the blackest traitor, or the most foul murderer that ever appeared in the shape of human nature. Gentlemen of the Jury, I am very far from attempting to extenuate the offence I am charged with; I am conscious of its enormity; I never will commit it; but I hope I may be allowed to say, that there is an immutable distinction in crimes; that policy and humanity demand the preservation of that distinction; if I had been the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090036"/>most violent, if I had been the most inhuman man that ever lived; it was impossible that Mr. Le Mesurier could have proceded to greater extremity than he has done, with respect to me. Among the vices incident to human nature, and the crimes which have so lavishly been imputed to me by newspaper report, there are two which I trust neither the accusing spirit, nor the recording angel need blush or weep at on my account; I mean cruelty, and calumny, which is perhaps the worst of cruelty; for I have ever been more happy to remove than to cast aspersion, and I have never been so tenacious of my life, as to fear risquing it to save a fellow creature from ruin: this is a consolation of which the united efforts of all the paragraphists that now live, or may live hereafter, cannot deprive me; this is a consolation which has supported me through life, and which I trust will attend me to that bourn from whence no traveller returns. Gentlemen of the Jury, if Mr. Le Mesurier had wished to have impressed you with an idea of his candor, he might effectually have done it, by waving that advantage which ignorance on my part gave; and had he, instead of calling an unfortunate fellow creature before the judgment seat, to demand sentence of death against him, and to urge it with all the rigour that a furious mind could dictate; had he omitted this in a moment when the most liberal and humane sentiments seemed to prevail in every part of the world; had he done this, you might have had some opinion of his candor; it would not have tarnished the lustre of his beneficence, or diminished the same of his moderation and modesty. The language of Mr. Le Mesurier, the counsel, I will not much mention; I am convinced it speaks for itself, and will operate more in my favour in any liberal mind, than any thing I can say against it: and perhaps he has been led to such vehemence, by being at once the brother and counsel of the prosecutor: and I wish, I wish, Gentlemen of the Jury, that Mr. Le Mesurier may not have been advised to such extremity from a quarter where of all others it ought not to have proceeded: public justice is a good and necessary thing, but there is something due to individual justice; and a persecuting spirit should never be suffered to overpower the sacred rights of truth and humanity. And permit me humbly to observe, that the question is not now, what the private opinion of individuals concerning

            , Esq; privily from his person. Mr. Le Mesurier is called, and he tells you, &amp;c. [Here the learned Judge summed up the Evidence, and then added] Gentlemen, this is all the evidence in the case, you have heard what the prisoner has said in his own justification; you are to give what weight you think proper to that; but at the same time, as one part of the defence goes to affect the prosecutor, I cannot help making some observation on that part of it; the rest I shall leave to your consideration: he imputes cruelty to the prosecutor, in having prosecuted him to outlawry; and he imputes cruelty to the law in suffering a person to be proceeded against by that mode, as it is taking it out of the hands of the Jury: Gentlemen, it is an antient law which has prevailed in this country; and to be sure a prisoner has no right to complain of cruelty, who withdraws himself from the reach of justice; nothing is imputable to Mr. Le Mesurier on that score; for when once the outlawry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090037"/>was compleat, it was not in the power of the prosecutor to give it up, the law had then attached upon it; suppose the outlawry was good in point of form, certainly there cannot be any improper conduct or cruelty attributed to Mr. Le Mesurier in the steps he has taken; so far I think fit and necessary for me to say in exculpation of the prosecutor; for though a prisoner is permitted to say any thing in his own defence, yet it is not altogether so proper to cast reflections on that prosecutor, and more particularly when those reflections are unfounded; now with respect to Mr. Adean's not being called here to confirm this prosecutor's evidence, he is abroad; therefore the question must rest on the evidence of Mr. Le Mesurier, it must rest on the facts he has disclosed to you: now, Gentlemen, to be sure, there are some facts arising from Mr. Le Mesurier's evidence, which seem to apply pretty close to the case of the prisoner; there is one fact particularly, which came out upon the cross-examination, which may be material for your consideration; that is, that Mr. Le Mesurier told you, at the time he felt his purse move, the prisoner was standing behind him, but his hand was close to his pocket; now to be sure, in the natural position one would expect for a man who stood behind another person, it is not very probable that his hand could be so far advanced before Mr. Le Mesurier, as to be at his breeches pocket; therefore that observation in point of probability, seems to apply very hard against the prisoner; he tells you further, that the moment he felt his purse moving in his pocket, that he instantly took his hand from that part which was over his purse, and caught hold of the wrist of somebody that was near his breeches pocket; that somebody, whoever it was, to be sure in point of probability, does appear the most likely person to whom we could attribute it; he kept hold of the hand and turned round, and with his other hand he seized on the person to whom the hand belonged, which proved to be the prisoner at the bar: these, Gentlemen, to be sure, are strong circumstances; it has been imputed to Mr. Le Mesurier, that he had at the time he went to Bow-street office, said, when he was told he must go the office, it is to no purpose for me to go to the office, I know nothing about it; but he positively denies that he held any such language; he says, as near as he can guess, what he said was this, that he seized a person's hand near his pocket, which appeared to be the prisoner, and therefore he believed him to be the person. Therefore, Gentlemen, it is for you, on the whole of this evidence, to consider whether the prisoner is, or is not, guilty of the crime that is now imputed to him: As to any general knowledge you may have of the prisoner, or of his character; that you are to lay totally out of the case on the present occasion; for every cause must be tried by its own circumstances; therefore you are to consider now only of the particular evidence, and how it must apply. Now, if you believe the account given by the prosecutor, that at the time the purse moved in his pocket, he immediately took hold of the prisoner's hand close by his breeches pocket; and more particularly, if you believe that the prisoner was standing behind him at the time with his hand near his pocket, I am sorry to say it does amount to very strong circumstantial proof, in regard to the prisoner's being guilty of the fact: there has been no evidence called to contradict the account that he has given. Gentlemen, crimes of this kind are generally done in such a manner, as to make it more difficult to detect than most other crimes; it is on account of the frequency of the crimes, and the crime being done secretly, that the difficulty of detection arises; and in order to discourage the practice, the law has thought fit to take away the benefit of clergy from any person accused of such a crime; therefore a reasonable certainty is every thing you can have in cases of this kind; therefore it is your duty to consider on the whole evidence; if you are satisfied that the prisoner is not guilty of the crime, then certainly you ought to acquit him; but if from all the circumstances laid together, you think they do so strongly apply to the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090038"/>that he is guilty; in that case you will find him so. Gentlemen, there is one thing that I ought to inform you of; indeed it was given up by the counsel, which is the capital part of the charge; for it was laid to be stolen privily from his person. Now there have been determinations, that whenever the person is sensible of the thing at the time, that that takes off the capital part; therefore the capital part you will acquit him of; but it is still open to the larceny, and the capital part is given up by the counsel on the opening.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. It may happen that you may swear this to be your property; by what marks do you understand it? - There is a method we have in trimming beef for salting to go abroad, a different method from any other beef that is salted, and the larger piece is what we call a veiny piece, it was of my own putting into salt on the Saturday in the evening; it is a rule to lay it in salt on Saturday, and to resalt it on Monday; I know these pieces of beef to be my putting in salt; I will swear to the whole of them, from the mode we chop them, and trim them.</p>
               <p>But knowing that you are in a considerable way of business, you do not chop and trim a great deal? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Do you swear these were your own chopping and trimming? - I swear that the largest piece was mine.</p>
               <p>I wish we could have seen them as they were salted? - They are not here.</p>
               <p>I suppose that in that part of the world, there are some butchers who salt for shipping besides yourself? - Numbers; there is one person in that neighbourhood, that now and then does a little matter; I mean to swear that I know all the pieces of beef, which were four, to be mine.</p>
               <p>You talked of six just now? - That was a mistake of mine.</p>
               <p>That proves that you are mortal, that proves that you are fallible? - We are all fallible sometimes.</p>
               <p>Might not you forget the number of ribs, and the size of the piece, and the manner of trimming it? - There is but one mode of chopping.</p>
               <p>Then there was a veiny piece, and you remember putting a veiny piece into pickle some days before? - Yes, Sir, but I do not verily believe, because I wish that to be out of the question; I swear directly to that veiny piece of beef, to be a piece of beef of my own trimming, and on the Saturday night having salted it.</p>
               <p>Now will you swear another thing as directly; that is, that it had not been sold? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many people sell in your shop? - Four or five.</p>
               <p>You are not always at home? - I am much at home.</p>
               <p>Then these four or five people might have sold this, if it had been applied for? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Were the two prisoners in the number of those that might have sold for you? - They were.</p>
               <p>And there were three other persons that had the same right? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long had your shop been shut up that evening? - It had not been shut up.</p>
               <p>Court. Were those pieces all salted beef? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to have in your slaughter-house at that time, any salted beef that you had borrowed, that was not your own? - No.</p>

I was in Brick-lane when she picked me up; and she asked me for some liquor, but we had none: I had not been in the house two minutes before she tore my pocket off: there were four other women in the house when we went in. The prisoner and me went up two pair of stairs, and she cried out murder; and up came three girls and a man, who took me by the throat: as soon as I could I ran out of the house, and told the constable I had been robbed; we could not get into the house. I did not say any thing to the people that came up stairs. The next morning I took her. I lost four guineas and half a crown; I received the money the same day, but none of the money was found upon her.</p>

I asked her for my bundle; she swore I never brought any bundle there; she then gave the candle to her younger sister to light me down; she would not; then the prisoner took the candle and lighted me down: I said I would not go without my money and bundle; then she said, if I would not by fair means I should by foul means; she took me by the two shoulders and shoved me out of the room, and from thence out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090048"/>the house; I asked the daughter to shew me into Holborn; she would not. I met two watchmen, and told them I had been robbed; they told me I was a woman of the town, and said I was a dirty hussey, and if I did not go about my business he would take me to the watch-house; I then met another watchman, I told him; he went with me to the house, but we could not find any thing of mine; then I saw Mr. Treadway, who searched the room, and found a cap, a black cloak, two handkerchiefs, and a cotton stocking.</p>

On Saturday night last between two and three o'clock the watchman brought in the two prisoners; I went and searched with a candle, and broke open the door, and under a fish basket I found a black cloak in the ashes, this handkerchief under the bed, this cap and apron, this handkerchief in another corner of the room; I found nothing else. The prosecutrix was in liquor: she said the prisoners forced her to drink gin.</p>

               <p>I am constable and patrole of Billingsgate Ward. On Monday the 2d of November I met with Briggs first with a bundle at his back, about fifty yards from the Queen's Head; I asked him what he had got? he said, his clothes, he brought them from Gravesend, and said, he was going to the Tower to get a boat, to go down the river: I took him to the watch-house; going along Farrer came up and called Briggs; as soon as he came up I took him, with the assistance of the watchman, and put them both in the watch-house: Farrer had the prosecutor's coat on; several other things were found upon them, which I have kept separately; here are two coats, one blue, and one black: these things I took from Farrer, viz. one lamb skin waistcoat, value eight shillings, two black satin waistcoats, value ten shillings, two pair of satin breeches, value twelve shillings, an oldish black coat, value fourteen shillings. These things were taken from Briggs, viz. a blue cloth coat, value three pounds, a black cloth coat, value three pounds, four corded dimity waistcoats, value two pounds ten shillings. (Produced and deposed to.) Briggs had all the new things on his shoulder in the hammock.</p>

The 19th of November the window was broke; I was in a little back room joining the shop, and I heard the window crack; as near as I can guess it was eight; it was quite dark; I heard the shop window break; and there was a light in the shop, and I saw something like a person's arm drawing out; and the window was broke, and the shelf all clear facing the square of glass; it was cleared of the shoes that stood before the square of glass; they were red morocco shoes; I cannot say how many pair were lost, but on Saturday two pair were brought into our shop to sell with my husband's writing in them, they were brought by a woman that is in court: the shoes are here: I am sure those shoes were mine; my husband's hand writing was on the bottom and the price they were to be sold at: we had not sold any of that sort for some time back, as red morocco shoes are not so much worn in winter; but these came back tacked together as they are now.</p>

               <p>I am a hair dresser; last Saturday night between seven and eight, I was going out of my master's door, No. 52, Friday-street; I heard the cry of stop thief from the Bell Inn; I crossed over the way and saw a man with a truss in the gateway on his shoulder, it was the prisoner; I saw his face, he threw it down in the gateway, he was coming down when I first saw him; he ran out of the gateway and up Friday-street, to the end of Angel-court, he made a stop there, and walked down the street as far as Watling-street; I saw an acquaintance of mine, and told him that was the man that had stole the truss; and he pursued, and I ran after him; I never lost sight of him till he was taken, and he was taken back to the house, and Bancroft said he could not swear to the man, he only saw his back, Mr. Bancroft took the truss.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What time was this? - Between seven and eight.</p>
               <p>Was it dark? - Yes; there is a lamp in the gateway.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen him before? - Yes, about an hour before.</p>
               <p>Did you run after him? - Yes, as far as Angel-court.</p>
               <p>So when he walked, you walked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you the first after him? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it? - I don't know, I kept my eye on him all the while.</p>
               <p>Did you see his face after he came out of the gateway? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>When he had stopped and turned round, you said that was the man, and not before? No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Court to Bancroft. Is the direction on the things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long had you received it? - About ten minutes; I told the porter to put it under the warehouse window.</p>
               <p>Court. First on this parcel there was a direction to Honiton, and you saw it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of truss or parcel was it, on which this direction was? - It was this very truss, the very shape and size, and the truss has never been out of my possession; I was not above two or three yards from it, when it was put under the window, I observed Tucker of Honiton.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I cannot say it was moonlight, but there were three lamps, and it was under one of the lamps, against a house that had been just whitewashed; on the Tuesday I could not get out of my bed; on the Wednesday I went and gave information at the office; I knew the men; I worked in Petticoat-lane, and knew Marks by the name of Foreman John; I never spoke to him: I think they were taken on Thursday; I saw them at the publick-house joining to Mr. Wilmot's office, in Worship-street; there were other people at the publick-house at the same time; I picked out the prisoners; I am sure of all the three prisoners.</p>

I then said I knew all the men very well by sight, but not by name: I saw Bastin safe home, and then went home myself: we were coming the strait road home from the publick-house, when this happened; I saw the prisoners when they were taken up, at the publick-house, in Worship-street, next to the office: there were ten or twelve people.</p>

There was a kind of twilight when this happened, and there were three lamps in the street, and it was just under one: I lost a hat, but I could not say who took it. There was a girl said she knew all their names; she gave us the names; but she gave them by the names that they went by, not the names they are now indicted by: I snatched at a hat, and tore out a lining: and I picked up this hatband and buckle.</p>

               <p>I am another patrol, I went with the last witness and took Clarke; and we went to his room, and received the lead from Conway; he has had the lead; I marked it, and the same night we measured; and there is a piece that seems something similar to fit it; all this lead was taken from under the stairs; here is an iron hook that was placed in the wall to support the pipe, and the lead appears to be pressed by it.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. Barnett, Hoare, and Hill. On the 9th of November the prisoner presented one of the drafts in the indictment to me for payment, as near as I can recollect about two o'clock; I asked him what he would have for it; he said, money, or if I pleased a bank note: I shewed it to Mr. Barnett, and he detained the man, and sent for a constable: I have had the draft from that time to this, except a few hours; it was taken with the prisoner to Bow-street, as I understand; I put no mark on it then; it went out of my hands the same day it was presented to me; I cannot say who had the care of it, but one of our clerks went with it in a coach; I gave the note to Mr. Barnett; he is not here.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this note which you have in your pocket was the note which you parted with, and which you received from the prisoner? - I can, by some marks on the back; there were several sums on the back of it, by which I am sure of the identity of the draft, that induced me to stop the prisoner; because I was informed of those marks, and if they were on it I was not to pay it.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what those sums were? - Fourteen pounds eight shillings was one sum, and two or three ten pounds, in black ink, it was dated the 9th of November, 1789, drawn by W. Austin, the sum was ten pounds; it was on our house.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the figure? - No. 84, or 84; I do not recollect whether there was No. or not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp submitted to the Court, whether the draft should be now produced, as it had been in other hands, the law requiring the best evidence.</p>
               <p>The Court was of opinion it was a fact to be left to the jury.</p>
               <p>(The note handed to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot read this note, it is not the note he has described; here are no sums of ten pounds, but one sum of thirty pounds on the back? - I said two or three ten pounds; they are comprized in one sum, thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. I never can take it in that way.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090075"/>Jury. Is there fourteen pounds eight shillings upon it, my lord.</p>

               <p>The Court then informed the jury that this note, which was offered to be produced, not corresponding with the note described by the witness; and the notes not being traced from hand to hand, there was therefore no evidence against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath did you see the Bath stove off the ground? - Upon my oath I did; I saw his hands under it; it was six inches from the ground.</p>

               <p>Had you left the gown there? - I had not; I left it in the kitchen; I asked her what brought her there? she said she came to see one Mrs. Williams, who had lent her five shillings; I missed the gown which was drying in the kitchen, and found it in the place where she had been.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Let us understand a little the situation of this kitchen; you found the prisoner in the cellar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is that under the kitchen? - On the one side of the kitchen; as I was going up stairs, I heard a person making a noise below stairs.</p>
               <p>How was the street door situated? - You go down about a dozen steps, and all the way along the passage.</p>
               <p>Is not the street door of your house nearer to the kitchen door, than the way down to the cellar? - No, it is about nine or ten yards length between the street door, to go down to the cellar.</p>
               <p>Have you never said at any other time, and particularly before the magistrate, that the gown at the time it was found, was at the distance of three or four yards from the prisoner? - No, I never did.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I was talking to the watchman a little before half past one, and five minutes after half past one; I heard a rush of shutters; and instantly a window broke, a pane of glass: I have an assistant patrol goes with me: and we instantly went to the place, and saw the prisoner close at the spot, just at the very front of the shutters; nobody else was there; we followed him across, and collared him: says I, young man, you have been breaking into that house: says he, gentlemen, do not use<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090083"/>me ill: we took him back to the house: and as we went, the watchman was coming past: as soon as he saw the watchman's lanthorn, he shoved his right hand in his pocket, and took out a decanter: he took it up, and threw it down on the foot pavement with great violence; he took out the other, which dropped either on his foot, or some dirt; it did not break; he tried to break it with his foot; I took him to the prosecutor's house, and there the window was broke: says he, gentlemen, I hope you will not take me from my business, I belong to the India-house; I have two or three shillings in my pocket, I will give you them, and let me go; we took him before the constable, and he would not tell his name; he was secured.</p>

               <p>I am assistant patrol: last Thursday night, the 10th instant, about half past one, just as the watchman was crying half past one, I heard a noise of some shutters: and instantly, I heard a crash of glass breaking; we ran a little forward, almost opposite, and he was running away; I could see him perfectly by the lamp; I ran across the way, and we both seized him: we asked him, what have you been doing? he said, nothing: we said, you have been breaking the window? he said he had not; he said he lived in the neighbourhood, and his father was a person of property, and worth 30,000 l.; then he took a decanter out of his pocket, and dashed it against the pavement, all to pieces: and another dropped from him; he tried to stamp his foot on it, but it did not break: we went and knocked at the prosecutor's door, and took the prisoner to the watch-house: going along, he begged us to let him go; he said he belonged to the India-house, and had three shillings and six-pence in his pocket, which he would give us to let him go.</p>
               <p>- QUICK sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; I saw him in custody: and I saw a bottle in his hand: he dashed it on the stones, and I picked up some of the pieces; I was not present when the other decanter was dropped; I saw it in the patrol's hand; I have the pieces in my pocket now.</p>
               <p>(The pieces and the decanter produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I found the stopper at light, under where the window was broke.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I have no Counsel to plead for me; I wish to ask this witness a question or two, if you please; have you any other decanters like this? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Did you ever sell any more decanters besides those? - What do I get them in for but to sell them?</p>
               <p>Answer the question, sir? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Can you, on your oath say, that that is not the decanter you had sold? - I had not sold that decanter.</p>

            , spinster, and breaking out of the same: I have had him in my custody a long time; he received his majesty's mercy in September last, on condition of transportation for life; he broke his chain on the 10th of November last; here is the certificate of his conviction.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Please you my lord, and Gentleman of the Jury: when that iron was first put upon me; it was nearly cut through, and quite rusty; I did not perceive it; I hope<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090087"/>you will consider; I broke no prison; I used no violence before I got away; I was in the custody of Mr. Akerman; I made my elopement, and went to a friend, to go to Bristol, and from thence to get on board a ship to America or the West Indies; and I am very confident that there is not a convict in the prison but would extricate himself out of the prison if he knew how. If you had a bird, Gentlemen, that you was ever so fond of, and kept it so that it wanted for nothing but liberty, it would get away if it could; and who would be to blame, the bird or the keeper? Gentlemen, ask the keeper if I have not a good character.</p>
               <p>Sibley. He always behaved remarkably well in the prison, and always remarkable for his cleanliness.</p>
               <p>Owen. I say the same.</p>

               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury; I am counsel for this prosecution, which imputes to the prisoner at the bar the offence of rape; and Gentlemen, these are cases in which Courts and Juries find considerable difficulties in the consideration; because from the nature of the offence, it is almost always attended with a secresy which makes it necessary for Courts and Juries to find their way as they can, and to judge from the probability and improbability of the story told by the person who complains of the injury:</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the circumstances stated to me, attending the commission of this offence, are extremely bad, and extremely gross; but whether they will be made out in evidence, in a satisfactory way to you, it is not for me to anticipate: I am quite sure you will look at this case with attention and care, and not be drawn to a hasty conclusion either way; and least of all to a hasty conclusion of guilt. Gentlemen, the prisoner is a <rs id="t17891209-91-deflabel434" type="occupation">runner to one of the public offices</rs>

               <p>Gentlemen, on the 8th of November, the prisoner came home to his house; he found this young woman in the act of drying some clothes; he laid hold of her and desired her to come to him; she refused, and he pulled up her petticoats; taking her on his knees and held her towards the fire; stating to her, that that was to warm her. Gentlemen, it is stated to me, that he behaved to her with an indecency and grossness, which is fitter you should hear from the witness, as you must of necessity hear the account of it once (which is certainly once more than will be pleasant) somebody knocked at the door, and the prisoner took this young woman into the kitchen, which is behind his shop, and there made threats to her, that if she made any noise he would murder her; he then took her on his knees, let down his own breeches, laid her on an easy chair with its face upwards, and on that chair perpetrated the offence of rape: Gentlemen, as to the fact of the girl having been lain with by some person with some violence, will not depend on her evidence: Gentlemen, you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090089"/>will naturally enquire whether she cried out; it is stated to me that she endeavoured to do so; but the prisoner, from his large size, and a large loose great coat which he had on, prevented her from making any noise or alarm: Gentlemen, in this situation, it is stated to me that the prisoner committed the offence of rape; and after that, he is stated to me to have taken her into another room, and there to have again attempted indecencies of a gross and abominable nature to this young woman; and that on her resisting he behaved in a very shocking manner: Gentlemen, you will hear the evidence, and it is for you to decide: it is not material for me to press upon you any argument that may be favourable to the prosecution; and as for the prisoner, I am sure every thing that may come out in evidence favourable to him, will be stated to you with much greater ability, intelligence and authority than myself, or indeed any of us at the bar, can ever pretend to; and upon the whole you will give such verdict as your consciences shall enforce you to do, after you have heard the whole of the evidence.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He is a runner belonging to Shadwell office? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long have you been servant to him? - A week. He used me very ill, he began on Monday night; I went there on a Wednesday; when he came home from his office the first night, that was the Monday night; he took me and set me on his knee, and kept stroking and cuddling me up.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by stroking and cuddling you up? - Stroking me about my head and face and kissing me; and when he kissed me I cried out, Mr. Cole, if you please, to let me go and do my work, for if my mistress comes home, I shall have anger; he said, never mind your mistress; you may kiss her b - kside if you like; then I said I must not do any such a thing as that, and I must not say any thing to my mistress! oh says he, I will lick you if you are not quiet; then he kept cuddling me up; but did not do any thing more that night.</p>
               <p>Did you tell any body of what he had done to you? - Not that first night I did not, because he did not hurt me the first night; I did not take much notice of that.</p>
               <p>When did he do any thing to you again? - The second night when he came home from his office, I was in the shop by the door, and he laid hold of my hand, and said, come here, I want to speak to you; and I thought it was about some business; then he took me on his knee and pulled up my petticoats; then he kissed me, and told me to go and do my work: I mentioned that to our lodger, when she came to get some milk, she came into the kitchen; that was on the Wednesday, about noon time; I acquainted her of it; I said to her, says I, Mrs. Ross, when my mistress comes home I dare say I shall have a noise, my work is not done, and Mr. Cole is so rude and so nasty with me, that I cannot bear myself: then I told her how he used me the first night, and the Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>You described it to her exactly? - Yes; she said I must tell my mistress, or my mother and father, and if I told them, they would either have him put in a prison or hang him.</p>
               <p>That was the advice Mrs. Ross gave you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090090"/>When did you see your mistress after this? - I did not see her till past eleven at night; my mistress went out almost every night; I do not know what for; and sometimes she brought company home with, her a lady and gentleman, Mr. Morgan and Mrs. Morgan.</p>
               <p>Then you did not see your mistress till after all the mischief had been done? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see your father and mother after the time that Mrs. Ross spoke to you, before the prisoner used you ill again? - Yes, they were both of them together; they were going to bed; they lived up at the corner of King David-lane, very near; I had a great deal of work to do.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it? - I did not see them till after eleven o'clock; not till after he had used me ill.</p>
               <p>Court. Then as I understand you now, you neither saw your mistress nor your father and mother till after the fact was done? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Describe, and go slowly, what he did to you on the Wednesday? - It was between seven and eight in the evening, on the Wednesday, he came home, I was in the kitchen hanging some towels across the line before the fire place, and he caught hold of me round the waist and the arms, and took me in his lap, and pulled up my petticoats, and held me before the fire, as a person would hold a child to the fire to warm; he took me across his two arms with my petticoats up, by the fire side; he held me for about five minutes, then he let down my petticoats, and let go of me; and I went to run away, and he got hold of me, and called me a little bitch, and said he would not do me any harm; I need not be afraid of him, for he did not like to hurt any body's child.</p>
               <p>[Here the witness proceeded in a narration too indelicate for publication, which, however, did not amount to legal proof of the crime charged against the prisoner in the indictment.]</p>

               <p>Tried by the second Middlesex Jury before Mr. Baron PERRYN.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I think the Jury would have run a great risk of doing wrong in finding the prisoner guilty of a capital offence; but his conduct has been so gross and indecent, that I feel it my duty to pray the Court, that he may be detained to be tried for an assault with intent to commit a rape.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. My lord, I have had no opportunity of answering this charge, because in point of law he was entitled to an acquittal; but I do assure your Lordship, I have a strong denial to every one single circumstance, so strong that the magistrate admitted him to bail.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him be detained in custody till the end of the session, and let a bill of indictment, for the assault, with intent to commit a rape, be preferred before the grand jury for the County of Middlesex, who are now sitting at Hicks's Hall. It appears from the testimony of

               <p>I found the parcel by the side of Mr. Vincent's wall; he is a pump maker, opposite Mr. Calvert's, the vinegar Merchant's; I was going home, and just as I came to the timber yard I met these gentlemen; I told them I had picked it up, and I did not know what it was; they took me to the watch-house; they searched my house, and found nothing but my property. I have been a house keeper, in the parish of St. Luke's, thirty years: I never was in any trouble, or in a gaol before; my character was always unspotted, and I was always looked upon to be, what I really am, an honest man.</p>

               <p>He did not say how long he had found the things? - He was not asked.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bowles. Do you remember in November last, packing up a pair of pearl ear-rings in a little box? - Yes, directed to Mrs. Dingworth, Rouse's buildings, Hampstead; I delivered it at the coach office in Holborn, for the Hampstead stage; it was in the evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. There are a good many Hampstead stages? - Yes, I left it at the office; I delivered it to Mr. Potts.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A jeweller.</p>
               <p>You packed up these ear-rings? - Yes, in a new box; I first wrapped them in a fine paper; put them in the box, then shut the box up and inclosed the box.</p>
               <p>I believe you have seen the ear-rings since? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>I believe you have seen them in a box of the same sort? - I have no reason to doubt but that is the very same box.</p>
               <p>You found them wrapped up in the same sort of paper that you sent them in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were of the value of twenty guineas you suppose? - More than that.</p>
               <p>They were very good pearls? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were they of the same setting? - They were.</p>
               <p>Had there been any attempt to alter the setting? - Not perceivable.</p>
               <p>Would it not have been perfectly easy to have taken those pearls out of that setting, and have appropriated the setting to some other purpose without much loss? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I fancy if the pearls were loose, you could not have swore to them? - No.</p>
               <p>Or even put into another shape? - No.</p>
               <p>If these drop ear-rings had been put into a cluster, you could not have swore to them? - No.</p>
               <p>How many days had they been out of your possession? - Some few days.</p>
               <p>Plenty of time to make them twice over.</p>

               <p>I am a coachman; I drive the Hampstead stage from the Change; I remember receiving a parcel, directed to Mrs. Dingworth, from Mr. Potts; it was half past seven in the evening; I took up two ladies at No. 9, in Lombard-street; Miss Gibson, Miss Eastwick, and a Mrs. Jackson, whom I set down at Warren Place; Mrs. Jackson got in in Holborn; I put the parcel the right hand corner behind the horses.</p>
               <p>Had you any gentleman in the coach that night? - Yes, there was a gentleman came up, just as I was going off in Holborn, and asked if I was going to Hampstead; he got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Do you know that gentleman again? - I cannot positively say; I was in a hurry.</p>
               <p>Did you put the parcel in before the gentleman got into the coach? - Yes, I sat down about half way, near the Fitzroy Arms, in Warren Place, about two miles from Hampstead, there Mrs. Jackson got out on the near side, the side I let her in.</p>
               <p>Court. That is the side the parcel was? - Yes, I got off the box and knocked at the door, and the servant came and opened the door; and I immediately went and opened the coach door, and the lady got out; nobody got out of the coach but her.</p>
               <p>Had she any parcels? - No, I stopped next at the end of Pond-street; I asked the gentleman twice over, whether I should set<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090104"/>him down? he said no, he would go out and walk.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was quite a fine dry night.</p>
               <p>Was it frosty? - Rather frosty.</p>
               <p>When the gentleman got out, did you see him walk from the coach? - Yes,</p>
               <p>Did he go fast or slow? - He went quite fast down Pond-street.</p>
               <p>Had he any parcel? - Not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Did you see him go? - I saw him go about thirty yards, he went very fast.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stop to pick up any thing? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the night perfectly light? - It was a glimmering moon.</p>
               <p>When did you stop next? - At Mr. Gibson's, New Inn, Hampstead, there these two ladies got out.</p>
               <p>When did you look for the parcel? - Immediately as they got out, while the coach was before their house.</p>
               <p>Did you find the parcel? - No, I got a candle and looked every where, and I could not find it.</p>
               <p>I suppose you made the loss as public as possible? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is not uncommon for a gentleman to walk a few steps down the street? - No.</p>

               <p>Had she any parcel? - None in her hand, not so much as her cloak.</p>

               <p>Who got out there? - The gentleman got out.</p>
               <p>In what manner did he get out? - There was no particular hurry in getting out as I saw.</p>

               <p>Moonlight I presume from that? - Yes Sir, it was a beautiful moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner when he got out of the coach? - Yes, I did; I saw him pay the coachman: I saw him run down Pond-street, with his hands in one another.</p>
               <p>Did he stop to pick any thing up? - No.</p>
               <p>If he had stopped, should you have seen him? - Yes, I should, because Miss Eastwick and me were at the same window.</p>
               <p>Was it a frosty night? - Rather.</p>
               <p>At what distance could you see him? - About ten or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right, the gentleman sat on the right hand side? did he? - We sat facing the horses, and the gentleman sat facing me.</p>
               <p>Then he sat on your left hand? - I sat on the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Which side did Mrs. Jackson sit? - She sat on the same side as the gentleman did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowles. Of which side did Mrs. Jackson get out? - The lady got out of the left hand side; the gentleman on the other side.</p>
               <p>Did you see the parcel after the gentleman was out of the coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass respecting the parcel afterwards? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have been examined several times on this subject, I take it for granted? - Twice.</p>
               <p>Twice before magistrates; but you talked this matter over very often? - At home I have.</p>
               <p>It has been a good deal the subject of conversation at Hampstead? - I have not been much at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>I do not recollect when I had the pleasure<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090105"/>of seeing you last, madam; that you recollect this circumstance of his running down Pond-street? would you venture to swear now, that you told Alderman Le Mesurier that he ran down Pond-street? - I said the very same words, whereever I mentioned it.</p>
               <p>Court. After Mrs. Jackson got out, did the prisoner move at all? - Sir, he put his hands behind him as he moved to the place facing Miss Eastwick.</p>
               <p>Was that the side of the coach where Mrs. Jackson sat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then after Mrs. Jackson got out, he moved to that place where she sat? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>MISS EASTWICK sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You went in company with your sister, Miss Gibson, from London to Hampstead? - We both sat facing the horses; Miss Gibson sat with her right hand next the coach door.</p>
               <p>Who sat opposite you? - Mrs. Jackson.</p>
               <p>Who sat opposite your sister? - Mr. Bevan; that is him to the best of my knowledge: so we proceeded to Hampstead: Mrs. Jackson got out on the side where she sat, nobody but her: she had no bundle.</p>
               <p>You then proceeded two miles further, and then the gentleman got out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did the gentleman get out? - At the end of Pond-street.</p>
               <p>When he got out did he make any stop, or go off immediately? - He paid the coachman and went off immediately.</p>
               <p>Between the time of his going off and the lady, Mrs. Jackson, getting out; had the prisoner continued in the same? - Yes; then he put his hands rather behind him, as if to assist him rather further on where Mrs. Jackson sat.</p>
               <p>Mrs. JACKSON sworn.</p>
               <p>I went in the Stage to Southampton Place, just by Warren Place.</p>
               <p>Had you any bundle with you? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you observed a little parcel before you got into the coach? - When I got into the coach at Holborn. I sat upon a little small box, which I took-up and asked if it belonged to either of the two ladies which were in the coach; they told me no, it was the property of the coachman: I threw it down on the other side, not to be inconvenienced by it any more.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you put it behind you, or in the corner, or where? - I am not sure where.</p>
               <p>On the same side where you sat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. you threw it as you describe now, and as you mentioned before the magistrate, carelesly out of your way that it might not inconvenience you? - Just so.</p>
               <p>- TWYCROSS sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any application to the prisoner respecting a pair of pearl ear-rings, that was sent to Mr. Dingworth? - Yes. I went to the prisoner and told him I was informed he had a pair of pearl earrings; I went to the prisoner's house in the minories; he denied having them, and repeatedly denied it; and I told him several times that I had the best information that he was in possession of the ear-rings; I also was informed, I told him, that he was in the Hampstead stage that evening, which was Saturday, the 31st of October: after some hesitation, and on my repeating it; he acknowledged he was.</p>
               <p>What did he say at first; did he say one way or other, whether he was in the Hampstead coach or not; give me a direct answer? - He hesitated a little; he continued still to deny knowing any thing of the ear-rings after that; Mr. Dingworth then came in; I told him Mr. Dingworth was the gentleman the ear-rings belonged to; that they were advertised to be brought to my house: we went all together in the parlour, and were there some time; Mr. Dingworth wished the prisoner to acknowledge having them; which he did after some time: he said he had had the ear-rings, but they were not in his possession; he said, he would go and fetch them; but we thought better to go with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090106"/>Did he consent to that proposal at first? - Yes, I believe he did; he said they were at a gentleman's, a friend of his, in Great New-street; we went there, and the prisoner asked for Mr. Wiltshire, and for the ear-rings; and it came out, that Mr. Wiltshire was out with them; Wiltshire came in afterwards, and the prisoner asked Wiltshire for the ear-rings; and Wiltshire took the ear-rings out of his pocket, and gave them to the prisoner, and the prisoner gave them to me, or Mr. Dingworth; but I had them directly afterwards: Mrs. Wiltshire said in the hearing of the prisoner, that he told her he found them in Walcot-place.</p>
               <p>Where is Walcot-place? - The other side of the water I believe; the next day he was taken before the sitting alderman, and was committed; I produce the earrings; I knew them before; I know these to be the ear-rings: I had them to alter, to make some addition to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. We have learned from your servant, that they were packed originally in a box like this, and wrapped up in fine paper like this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many days had they been out of your possession? - From the Saturday to the Friday.</p>
               <p>So that there had been abundance of time to have altered the shape of them? - They might have broke them to pieces in the time, and set them again.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, if you had seen the pearls loose without the setting, you would not have ventured to have swore to them? - It would have been very difficult to have done it.</p>
               <p>Was not this man admitted to bail by the Court of King's Bench? - Yes, I believe he was.</p>
               <p>And has surrendered this morning to take his trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, when you went to him, you did not explain to him that you had any peace officer or search warrant? - No, I did not, till we got to Wiltshire's.</p>
               <p>The man walked with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He carried you to Wiltshire? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is Mr. Wiltshire here? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Wilkinson was the gentleman that came to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know where he is? - No, I believe not; we went to find him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bowles. You have done all you could to find him? - Indeed I have.</p>
               <p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Hampstead, in Rouse's-buildings; there were some ear-rings which were sent directed to my wife, the 31st of October; I never received them; in consequence of some information I received from an advertizement, I went to the house of the prisoner Bevan; me and Twycross and a constable went together; Twycross went in first.</p>
               <p>After he had been there some little time you went in? - Yes; I stood at the door, and looked through the window all the while; it was not above a minute.</p>
               <p>After you came in and saw Bevan, tell us what passed? - I went into Mr. Bevan's shop, a register-office for hiring servants, in the Minories; I think, No. 104; I told him my name was Dingworth, that I lived at Hampstead, and was the owner of the ear-rings which had been advertized to be brought to Mr. Twycross the other gentleman, and which we were informed were in his possession; he denied knowing any thing of the ear-rings, or being at Hampstead, or even in the Hampstead-coach on that day, which was the 31st of October; I told him we had positive information of their being seen in his possession, with a direction to Mrs. Dingwall, Rouse's-buildings, inside the box, legible; and that he had been shewn the advertisement, to be carried to Mr. Twycross's house; he still continued persisting to deny knowing any thing about the matter, and said a great deal about honour and reputation and character, and things of that sort, which are not material; he still continued to deny; I told him he must know whether what he had told us, was true or not, and we only wished to have a decided answer; all this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090107"/>passed in the shop; after this, he asked us (Twycroft and me) to walk into the parlour; he walked backwards and forwards in his back parlour, but still continued to deny knowing any thing about them, till I was tired out with the parlying and altercation; and I told him he must determine in two or three minutes, whether he would continue to deny, or confess, for our opinion was not to be changed; I repeated the clear and pointed information we had, and that there could be no mistake; I did not mention the informer's name; I told him it would be better for him to acknowledge, it would save himself and us both trouble; I told him I really had come there with the most favourable intentions towards him, in hopes he would acknowledge having them, that we did not wish to expose him; and he at last confessed that he had them; he gave us some account of the manner in which he had come by them, by handing a lady out at Warren-place; that he had handed a lady out at Warren-place, that he rang the bell at her gate, the maid servant opened the gate, and he helped the lady to carry in several bundles and parcels from the coach into the lady's parlour; that on returning from her parlour to the coach, he kicked something under his foot that lay in her passage; that he picked it up the outside of her gate or door, and put it in his coat-pocket; that he then stepped into the coach again, and was drove to the top of Pond-street, Hampstead, where he was set down; that was what passed. I then asked him where the ear-rings were now? he told me he had delivered them to a particular friend of his, I think, the day before, who lived the other end of the town; we asked his friend's name, and where he lived; he said his name was Mr. Wiltshire, and he lived in New-street, Shoe-lane; I then asked Mr. Twycross, who lives close by, if he knew of any such name? he said he did not; the prisoner then proposed sending somebody, or writing a letter, to Mr. Wiltshire, to send or bring the ear-rings; I objected to that, but that we would go with him; I then asked him whether he was certain that the ear-rings remained in the same state, as our information led us to suppose they were broke up; he told me I might be perfectly easy on that score, for that his friend was a man of strict honour and integrity, and fortune, and character; and that there was not the least danger to be apprehended on that account; we then asked him to go with us immediately to Mr. Wiltshire; and the prisoner and myself and a servant went off; we had a constable waiting outside the house, but we never mentioned any thing of it to him; Mr. Twycross and the constable followed us: as we went, the prisoner was very desirous that this matter might not be made public, or any thing that might injure his reputation, as he had lived many years in credit; and a circumstance of this sort getting wind, might injure him in the opinion and credit of his neighbours; I told him I certainly had no wish to do so, or to act hostile all to him in any shape that I could avoid; I told him I could make no promises, but it must depend on future events; (I did not yet know whether Wiltshire had the ear-rings); I begged of him to relate to me in a plain and simple manner, the means in which he had got possession of the box; he had told us something about it in his own house, yet I was not satisfied.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Garrow objected to this, after what the witness had said, that it must depend on future events; and the Court was of opinion, that after what he said, it ought not to be given in evidence.)</p>
               <p>I had no wish; I certainly did not mean to make any promise; when we got to Wiltshire's, we went into his dining-room; there were three or four women at dinner, and one young man; we asked Mrs. Wiltshire if Mr. Wiltshire was at home? she said, no; we asked her where he was? she said she did not know where, nor when he would be at home; we then asked her if she knew if he had in his possession, a pair of pearl ear-rings, which the prisoner, Mr. Bevan, had delivered to him? she said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090108"/>had, and they were locked up in the bureau; we said, as that was the case, and as she was not certain whether he would be at home before night, this person that was with us was a constable, and had a search warrant; we had not mentioned the constable before; and that if she pleased, the drawers might be opened if she had a key, or a key could be found in her presence, in order that we might get the ear-rings; she was very unwilling, and would not hear of that; she said his bureau contained things of great value, and he never suffered any person to open it; but finding we were determined, she then said they were not in his bureau, but that he had carried them out in his pocket, in order to have them valued: and she particularly named a shop, a Mr. Field, in Holborn; we desired her to send to find him, and bring him home; and accordingly she sent to several places, and he returned in some time, about an hour, but could not find him; then Mrs. Wiltshire, as we had related to her the conversation, and what he said of finding them at Warren-place; she said that was different to what he had told her, for he had told her he found them at Walcot-place, in Surrey; that he was riding on horseback, saw this parcel laying in the road, and got off his horse and took it up; there was a good deal said about this, his giving different accounts, as it was in the presence of Mr. Twycross and the constable and the ladies that were there; mean time, a coach stopped at the door, and Mr. Wiltshire was in it; Twycross went down stairs; what passed between them below, I do not know; but he presently came into the room, and Mr. Bevan the prisoner, told him these gentlemen were come for the pearl ear-rings which he had given him; he put his hand in his coat pocket, and took out a large silk handkerchief, and pulled out the box, and delivered it to the prisoner; the prisoner offered to deliver it to me, but I declined taking it; I desired him to give them to Mr. Twycross, who had made them, and altered them lately, or I had not seen them since they were altered, which he did; I desired Mr. Twycross to examine them, and see that they were in the same state, which he did, and found they were in the same state; nothing more material passed at that time; they are my property; I knew the drops, because I had not had any alteration in them; I had had them twenty years; I gave them to my wife when we were married; then the prisoner desired to know whether he was at liberty? I told him I apprehended I was not justified in letting him go, till he had been before the magistrate who granted the warrant; and the constable insisted on taking Wiltshire also, but that I had no hand in.</p>

               <p>Please to state what he did with it, and what passed on the subject? - When he came to my house, he said he had picked up that parcel at the top of Pond-street; he brought the box openly in his hand; I asked him what it was, and he told me he could not inform me; I took it in my hand, and from its lightness, I said I supposed it was a box of medicine; it had not been opened; I did not see any direction on the box: the direction was defaced with the dirt of the road; the prisoner endeavoured to make out the direction; he made out some buildings; and he asked me if I knew it? I told him I never heard of such a name, nor have not since: I desired Mr. Bevan to open them to see; there were my servant, my husband, and myself, that is Mr. Radford and

            ; I said, if they were medicines, that the servant should endeavour to find out the direction, if she walked all night; when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090109"/>were opened, and I saw they were earrings; I thought they could not be of any consequence, to deliver that night; Mr. Bevan and me desired the servant to enquire in the neighbourhood if there was any such buildings as those we concluded was on the direction; and that if any such parcel should be enquired after, by describing it, and applying to our house, they might have it; Mr. Bevan desired me to take care of them; he gave them into my possession, and I put them into a bureau, and I desired my servant, when she went out, to get me a newspaper; which was produced to me on the Monday; I read it through, to see if such things were advertised; I saw no such thing: Mr. Bevan left the house on Monday morning, at six o'clock; he desired my husband, if they were not owned before he went to town, to bring them to town in his pocket; and my husband took them to town in the box, in which they were, as they were not advertised; I said, I supposed they were of no consequence; I am no judge of the value of pearl, for my own part; I did not think them worth half a crown.</p>
               <p>When did your husband come to town? - On Wednesday, at one o'clock; these things continued in my possession, at Hampstead, till the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>If in that time they had been applied for, and described by any body, should you have delivered them? - Most certainly I should; it was the particular desire of Mr. Bevan.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you look in the papers after the Monday? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Twycross. When did you advertise them? - Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Mrs. Radford. Did you mention this to any body yourself? - I did not; it was left to the servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Pray madam, what may Mr. Radford be? - He is at present with Mr. Bevan, has an annual salary from him, and has had for a year and a half.</p>
               <p>In what business? - In Mr. Bevan's business.</p>
               <p>Then he is a clerk to Mr. Bevan? - So you may term it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bevan, a register-office, in the Minories: your house is at Hampstead? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This parcel was produced before you; the direction was very much defaced: a wet night perhaps? - I cannot charge my memory.</p>
               <p>Was it a frosty night? - I cannot say; I believe it was a moonshiny night; but whether wet or dry, I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>When it was produced to you, where did he say he had found it? - He said he had picked it up at the top of Pond-street.</p>
               <p>Getting out of the coach? - I never heard him mention the coach; he said, he had picked it up at the top of Pond-street.</p>
               <p>He did not know how it had dropped there? - I never heard him mention it.</p>
               <p>How many houses are there from the top of Pond-street, to your house? - Upon my honor, Sir, I cannot tell you.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - A twelve-month; I never numbered the houses.</p>
               <p>Whether there are four or five, or a dozen? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You could not see the name at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>The only word that was at all legible, was either Rouse's or Rowl's-buildings, or something of that kind? - Yes; that was not legible.</p>
               <p>But you could see, either Rouse or Rowl upon it? - Upon my word I did not particularly look at it; I desired Mr. Bevan to open it immediately.</p>
               <p>I should have thought curiosity would have led you to read it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did he rub the mud off? - He endeavoured to do so.</p>
               <p>With what? - With his hand.</p>
               <p>Not with a cloth at all? - No, but with his hand.</p>
               <p>And there was something of buildings you saw? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But whether Rouse or Rowl's, you cannot tell.</p>
               <p>It was very wet mud, I take it for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090110"/>granted? - Upon my word I cannot say; I did not look at the direction.</p>
               <p>Yes you did, because you saw the word buildings, either Rouse or Rowl's upon it? - It was very much dirted with the road dirt.</p>
               <p>No cloth was attempted to wipe it off? - No.</p>
               <p>And you saw the word buildings? - Yes, and something of an R, either Rowl's or Rouse.</p>
               <p>You did not know such a place as Rous's-buildings? - No, Sir, I never heard of it in my life; I fancy the hour might be about nine, but I am not positive to the hour.</p>
               <p>And early on Monday morning you sent for the advertiser? - Yes; I fancy it was the Gazetteer and Daily Advertiser; it was the Monday's paper to the best of my knowledge, but I cannot particularly say; I looked the paper particularly through; but I never looked at any other paper; I desired the servant to enquire when she went about her business; I never made any enquiry, nor mentioned it to any body: I did not send to the stage, nor to our post office.</p>
               <p>How near is your publick-house to you? - I very seldom have any thing from the publick-house; but I told my servant, she happened to have a very shallow memory; she did not enquire; on Sunday I sent her to town, to fetch some friends; she then omitted it; on Monday she did make some enquiry.</p>
               <p>When you saw it, you knowing so little of pearls, thought they were not worth half a crown? - I did; I would not have given that for my own wear; I never heard there were any different kind of buildings at Hampstead: I go out very little.</p>
               <p>Was the word Hampstead to be seen? - I saw nothing but the word buildings.</p>
               <p>Nor the name of Dingworth? - I never saw it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Radford: I know Mr. Bevan; I remember his coming to my master's house, on Saturday night, the latter end of October; he walked up to the dresser, and said, see what I have found; my mistress replied, she thought it was an apothecary's box.</p>
               <p>Had it been opened at that time at all? - No; my mistress had it opened; and my mistress said, if it was apothecary's stuff, I should endeavour to find the place, if I walked all night; it was opened, and I saw one ear-ring; I cannot tell what it was; I am not a judge; my mistress said she thought it was a poor paltry thing, not worth a thought; if it was of property, she should soon hear of the owner: I had no direction, that I heard that evening.</p>
               <p>When was you directed to do any thing? - The next morning they said I should make enquiry; on the Sunday morning I was sent to town on my mistress's business; as she had company in the evening, which took up my time.</p>
               <p>When was you directed to do any thing about this box? - On the Monday morning I enquired of Mrs. Bournell's niece; she was indisposed; (Smith is the name of the publick-house) I asked him for the place which I thought was described.</p>
               <p>What place was that? - Upon my word I cannot tell now; it was of so little consequence to me; it was some buildings, I had never heard of the place.</p>
               <p>What became of the things on the Sunday, or the Monday? - I never saw them after the Saturday evening; my mistress put them in a drawer, to take care of them till she heard of the owner; and then to return them to him; I could not find out where these buildings were; I mentioned it to one or two more; nobody applied for the things; I went to the publick-house, Mr. Smith's, by my master and mistress's desire, to ask for their paper; that was on the Monday morning; Mr. Smith's reply to me was (I went twice for it, and it was not at home) if your mistress wants any advertisements, Mary, there are none in our paper.</p>
               <p>Did you get any newspaper at last? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090111"/>Yes; I returned back, and my mistress desired I would go to the George; I replied, we did not deal with them; and I got a little boy to borrow it for me; and I took it to my mistress.</p>
               <p>Had you any directions to keep it a secret, that this box was there? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>If any body had described it, they would have had it given to them? - Certainly, they would.</p>
               <p>When did Bevan go to London? - On Monday morning, about six; my master went on Wednesday, about one; I believe he took the box to town; I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing Mr. Dingworth? - Yes, on the Tuesday morning that Mr. Bevan had his hearing; I saw him in my master's garden; he brought with him Mr. Smith, the man of the publick-house; that was the 10th of November; Mr. Dingworth asked me if I knew a woman of the name of Jackson; and said, she resided at the Half-way-house, and that she was a woman of the most infamous character; and if he could meet with any person, whom he thought he could father that on; he said, he was sorry for the poor devil, for that he had traced a lady's character, whose name was Jackson, which was a very infamous one; he said, he would free the poor devil, if he could.</p>
               <p>You did not know any thing of Mrs. Jackson? - Never heard of the name in my life.</p>
               <p>And you told him so? - I did.</p>
               <p>What more did he say? - He said, the Hampstead gentlemen had joined in a committee, and obliged him to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>When you say you saw Mr. Dingworth in the garden, did he go to the house, or how? - No, he came to the front of the house, where the garden is; I never saw the gentleman before; I assured him I never heard of the name in my life; he asked me if I could tell him of any body else that he could father it on; because he said, he understood such people came to our house.</p>
               <p>What people? - Bad people, I suppose he meant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You did not know Mr. Dingworth before? - I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>And he came to you, to ask you if you knew any body that he could father it on? - Yes, that was the word.</p>
               <p>There had been an examination the Saturday before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And on the Tuesday afterwards he came to you, and said as you have described? - Yes, Sir; and Mr. Smith, the landlord, heard him; he is in Court.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it rather odd, that Mr. Dingworth, whom you did not know, should apply to you? - I could not say any thing to it.</p>
               <p>But did not it strike you as something odd? - That is what Mr. Dingworth asked me.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived with Mr. Radford? - Almost four years.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is with Mr. Bevan; he keeps an office; he was formerly an haberdasher; now clerk or partner, I do not know which, with Mr. Bevan.</p>
               <p>The parcel was very muddy, you know, when Mr. Bevan brought it in? - I never had it in my hand; I could not see whether there was any direction; my business took me another way.</p>
               <p>And never looked at all on the direction, nor whether there was any one word at all upon it? - I cannot answer to it; the place they made out to me, they desired me to enquire for.</p>
               <p>What place was that? - I cannot tell; I did not know I was to be called on.</p>
               <p>Did not you see them take the dish cloth, to wipe off the mud? - I was about my work; I did not see what was done.</p>
               <p>Then you do not know whether it was muddy or not? - I heard my mistress say it was.</p>
               <p>Did not you look? - I did not look.</p>
               <p>Where did he say he found it? - At the top of Pond-street: they read some buildings, and desired me to enquire into it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090112"/>they desired me to make more enquiry than I did; this was Saturday night; on Sunday I made no enquiry; Monday I was at Smith's publick-house, and saw Mr. Smith; I made no enquiry there, only asking for the paper.</p>
               <p>What did you want to find? - My mistress wished for the day's paper.</p>
               <p>For what? - To look for the advertisement.</p>
               <p>What advertisement? - To see whether the ear-rings were advertised.</p>
               <p>Therefore you knowing that, went to Smith's for the paper? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you say a single word of it to Mr. or Mrs. Smith? - No.</p>
               <p>How near do they live to you? - About one hundred yards.</p>
               <p>And then you was desired to go to the George? - Yes; I did not go there; I procured the paper.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiries at any of the stages? - No.</p>
               <p>At the post office? - No where.</p>
               <p>Who is Mrs. Bournell? - She is in Court; my master and mistress rent a house of her; she keeps a private house and lets it out in lodgings; she lives at the adjoining house.</p>
               <p>There is a communication, I understand, between this house and her's? - Yes, there is a door that opens sometimes, between our house and Mrs. Bournell's.</p>
               <p>What is that door for? - Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Then your enquiries did not extend farther than your next door neighbour? - Nobody else.</p>
               <p>Mention the name of any one reputable housekeeper in the town of Hampstead, or any person of character that you enquired of? - I cannot give you any more information than I have done; I was desired, but I really neglected it.</p>
               <p>How could they come to you; for nobody knew this, but you and Mrs. Bournell's niece? - I looked upon it of so little consequence; I enquired as much as I thought of.</p>
               <p>But you did not think of it at all, it seems. Now the conversation that passed with Mr. Dingworth was in your garden, Smith, the publican being present the whole time, and hearing the whole of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Dingworth that you had received no directions at all to enquire about it? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - Upon my oath.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I understand you live at Hampstead? - Yes: I remember Mr. Bevan coming home the 31st of October, between eight and nine, and brought a box, which he said, he had found, and the directions were dirty; they were wet and muddy; he opened the box.</p>
               <p>Did he endeavour to make out the direction? - He did, but could not.</p>
               <p>Did you make any thing out of it? - We could make out Hampstead and Rowl: the box contained a pair of pearl ear-rings; and my servant was to endeavour to find out the place; my wife thought they contained medicines: Mr. Bevan left Hampstead on Monday morning, at six o'clock; he left them in our care; if they were enquired for, they were there; if not, when I came to town I was to bring them in my pocket: Mr. Bevan likewise desired the servant to say, if they were enquired for, that they were at our house.</p>
               <p>When did you come to London? - On Wednesday morning, about eleven; I brought the box with me; I kept it about two hours; I know nothing of it further.</p>
               <p>Did you know any such place as Rouse's-buildings, if you had heard this was to go there? - Never.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to S. Radford. How long have you known Mr. Bevan? - Eleven years.</p>


               <p>You are connected with him in business I understand? - I am now for two years; he is as worthy a character I believe, and am sure, as any gentleman in Court, that has been his general reputation.</p>
               <p>If any body had applied at Hampstead on the Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, before you came to London, and described this, would it have been delivered to them? - Certainly, by the direction of Mr. Bevan, I looked for the advertisement on the Tuesday morning; I believe I sent to the publick house that we deal with; but they take in only a Sunday paper.</p>
               <p>If you had found the advertisement in that paper, would you have returned the earrings? - Certainly I should.</p>
               <p>Are you sure, whether it was Monday, or Tuesday? - I am not sure, but I believe it was the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Had the servant directions to make a general enquiry in the neighbourhood on the subject? - She had.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. It was late on Saturday night that you saw the parcel? - Yes, we thought it was in the Sunday paper.</p>
               <p>How could that well be? - Upon my word I do not know.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A haberdasher by trade; I have been assistant to Mr. Bevan near two years; I live at Hampstead, and Mr. Bevan generally comes there on Saturday nights.</p>
               <p>What did he wipe the wet and mud off with? - With his own handkerchief.</p>
               <p>You did not give him a cloth? - Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>What do you not remember your wife giving him a cloth? - Upon my word I do not know that; I did not take any notice till the box was opened.</p>
               <p>Where did he say he found it? - At the top of Pond-street.</p>
               <p>Coming from whence? - From Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did he say he was getting out of the coach, or how? - Getting out of the coach, he said, he kicked it before him; not getting out of the coach, but after he paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090115"/>the coachman, and wishing the ladies good night, he kicked it before him, and brought it to our house; the parcel was very dirty and wet.</p>
               <p>Was it a wet night? - No, it was a fine night; if I recollect right.</p>
               <p>It was not wet at all? - No.</p>
               <p>The word Hampstead was plain? - Hampstead was plain; I am sure I do not know, whether Row, or Buildings, or Street.</p>
               <p>Where was she to enquire? - I did not give it a thought.</p>
               <p>Therefore you did not say, perhaps it belongs to the coach? - It did not occur to me at all.</p>
               <p>Now the word Rowl, you do not know whether it was there, or Rowe? - Indeed I do not know.</p>
               <p>You never made any enquiry at Smith's, or any public house? - No.</p>
               <p>How did you come to town on the Wednesday? - In the stage.</p>
               <p>I suppose you mentioned it to the stage coachman of course? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Why you knew that Mr. Bevan was desirous of returning it? - Yes, but I did not mention it to a single person; I did not give it a thought.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Wilkinson? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Do you remember seeing him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - The Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - At Mr. Bevan's house; nothing passed then about it; Mr. Bevan asked me if any body had owned these things, or if they had been enquired for, or if Mary had taken them home; says he, have you brought them to town? I said, I had not; I said there was not such a place known in Hampstead.</p>
               <p>What place? - As some buildings, or row at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>Court. No such place as what? - As Rouse's Buildings, or Rose, or Rowl; I cannot say: on the Wednesday evening Mr. Wilkinson, who had been in the line of jewellery; Bevan asked him whether they were pearl or beads; he declared them beads of about fifteen shillings value; and that they would of course not be advertized; and Mr. Bevan said, well, if I go to Hampstead again: I will put them into my pocket, and make the servant endeavour to find out the place; if she walks from the time I go, till I return: on Thursday Wilkinson brought in a paper, and said, Bevan, I have news for you: says he, these very same ear-rings are advertised five guineas reward.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to the day? - On Thursday, we were at dinner at the time; Mr. Bevan went up stairs and put on his hat, and said, I will take them home immediately: five guineas was an object to him at that time: Wilkinson's answer was, that Bevan was a damned fool if he did; for if they were advertised five guineas, they must be a mixture of pearl and beads, and that in the course of two or three days; between that time and Monday they might be advertised twenty: Bevan was not satisfied with that; but insisted on taking them home for the five guineas; and Wilkinson dissuaded him from it; I observed that he might lose the reward, which was five guineas, and he said, says he, no, if it is a month to come, he will have the same reward, as it is now advertised.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You are sure it was on a Thursday? - Yes, the next day Bevan was apprehended; I was was not in the way; I heard no more of it till Bevan was in the Compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It was when you was at dinner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Twycross. What time of day did Wilkinson come to you? - On Friday morning between ten and eleven.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Dingworth. You have heard what that young woman, Morris, has said? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you any such conversation with her? - The conversation I had, was in the presence of Mr. Smith, the master of the White-horse; on Monday, after the first examination, Mr. Bevan told me he had left directions with Mr. Smith at the White-horse, in case any body enquired.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you such conversation with him as has been stated? - No: I had a conversation, but not such a conversation.</p>
               <p>Had you any thing like it? - No; what I said to her was, Mr. Smith was anxious to know whether she had said that she enquired at his house, or gave any sort of notice in any shape whatever, to him or his wife, or any person in his house, about the loss of that parcel; because Mr. Smith said he was very much hurt to hear that it had been said, that she had mentioned it to him or his wife, or any person in his house; upon which,

               <p>What was said about it? - Mr. Dingworth said they thought that Mr. Bevan had found the things at the Halfway-house, at Mr. Jackson's; and if at the Halfway-house, he could prove it clear against her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did Mr. Dingworth say about Mrs. Jackson's character? - But little; I do not recollect that.</p>

               <p>Look at Liscomb? - Yes, I knew him before the robbery was committed; and it was a moon-light night, and done under a lamp; I had a full opportunity of viewing their persons.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner Stone do any thing to you? - He was in company with them, and assisted; but he neither struck me, nor unbuttoned my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Why, you described Stone as coming up the second time, when the woman called? - He did; he assisted along with the others in striking my wrist, and making me let go my hold; but he did not assist in unbuttoning my breeches, and taking away my property; three of them ran away; I went and gave information; Cluff I swear positively struck me while Liscomb was taking the money out of my breeches.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the woman before this time? - Yes; they live in that street; I have seen them all, and knew them all; I described them to the officer, before I took them: and I went in and picked Stone out the next day, among thirty or forty people at the public house.</p>
               <p>How came there to be so many people there? - Why there were a great many benches and tables; they were as thick as they could be; it is called the Prince of Wales, the corner of George-street; there we took Stone; and from the Black Swan in Rosemary-lane, we took Liscomb and the woman; there were a great many other people there.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any thing else besides your three half crowns? - A pocket handkerchief; but I did not think it worth while to put it into the indictment; it was an old one; I lost a silver pencil and pen; that is not in the indictment; nothing else; I lost my hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Liscomb. Has not he taken up three besides us? - I took three more, but then as there were six or seven in the scuffle, I would not venture positively to swear to them all; I could only swear positively to these three; I fixed my mind on them; and I remarked more when I came to the corner, and when Mr. Staples asked me to be sure and certain of them; I do swear positively to them all; I am very confident.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Liscomb. He has taken one of the others again, and afterwards swore to him, and then acquitted him; and the justice said he did not think that it was any thing but an assault; Cook and Brown are the two officers that apprehended them.</p>

            ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long? - About five months ago; I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Do you know how he came by his death? - I cannot say particularly; I know he was in a room, called the strong room.</p>
               <p>How long before he died, was he confined in the strong room? - I was in bed, and came out of the prison before he died, and how long it was before, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You do not at all know what was the occasion of his death? - I heard the deceased say, that that place would be his death, or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long have you been out of the Fleet Prison? - Perhaps three months, or not so much.</p>
               <p>You was discharged by the Thatched House Society; of course you have not been at the Fleet lately? - Yes, I was sent for within this four or five days, by Mr. Barkley.</p>
               <p>You have not talked with any other on this subject in the Fleet Prison? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Was you in Chancery-lane last night, or with Mr. Jackson yesterday? - I was, not on this business: what carried me to the fleet, was, Mr. Barkley's sending for me.</p>
               <p>Tell me, when this man was put into the strong room, was it not in the summer time, in the month of July? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Was you examined before the Coroner? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Are you any relation to the deceased Hart? - None at all.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of July, Mr. Hart was put into the strong room? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Do you know that Mr. Hart was a very drunken man; used spirits very much? - I know he would get drunk sometimes.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that he was not as notorious a drunken, debauched man,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090121"/>as ever lived on God's earth? - I do not know that; the man would get drunk sometimes.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of July, this man was put into the strong room; he was out when you left the gaol? - I cannot say; I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Have you been out a month, two months, or three months, or how long? - I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>On your oath, was not you discharged in the month of August? - I believe I was.</p>
               <p>Do you not know that this man left the strong room on the 8th of August, or at least was it not early in the month of August he was turned out of the strong room? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>How long was he in? - When I got up on Friday morning, he was in.</p>
               <p>And he was put out on the 8th of August, and did not he live till the 24th of October: pray what sort of a place is this strong room? - It is a room like a cellar, almost, rather under ground; I suppose about three feet and a half.</p>
               <p>How high? - I never measured it.</p>
               <p>During the time, was there not people that lived there by choice nine or ten months together, and do not you know that Mr. Jackson lived in the room with Mr. Hart? - He was put in the night before Mr. Hart was.</p>
               <p>And was not Mr. Hart put in because he swore he would pull down the gaol, if Mr. Jackson was not let out? - I said before I was in bed when he was put in.</p>
               <p>Is not this strong room as big as fourteen rooms on the same floor, in which prisoners live with their families; has it not a fire place, and had not he a four post bedstead in it? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Do you not believe he died by being confined in that strong room? - I do.</p>
               <p>What effect had it on him? - When he came out he was not so well as when he went in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. But he lived on till October? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often did you see him sober in that time? - I have not to my knowledge seen him once, because I left the prison shortly after.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of November, I was robbed of two shirts, of the value of about three shillings; my wife had been up stairs, and came down and told me she had been robbed: suspicion fell upon the prisoner, he having been up stairs two or three times; I went up stairs and accused him with it, and he denied it; I took him to the magistrates; they searched him and found some duplicates, although not mine, yet they led to my things, as he owned to the constable where he had left the duplicates belonging to my things, and shewed him where he put it; the constable's name is Elliott.</p>

               <p>I am a constable, the prisoner was delivered into my custody at the magistrate's, where was brought on some other things, and he told a person in the Court, whom he took aside, that he would disclose where the duplicates was; the person's name I know not.</p>
               <p>Was there any promise made to the prisoner in case he would disclose where this property was? - Not to my knowledge, and on my coming up to him, he said, he would go along with me, and would shew me where it was; which he did, and went up with me, near St. Giles's Church, and went into a place like a necessary-house, where he put his hand up a hole in the wall, and pulled this duplicate out; (the duplicate produced.) It imports that the goods were pawned at Mr. Fear's, Little Poultney-street; I produced this duplicate to him, and he brought the things to the office in the evening.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178912090128"/>Mr. HODGSON</p>
               <p>RESPECTFULLY returns his most grateful Thanks to his Employers and Pupils, for the Preference they have thought proper to give to his Mode of teaching and writing SHORT-HAND, which he flatters himself is at once as concise and correct as any other System; he continues teaching in four Hours, by four Lessons, the whole necessary instructions in this much approved Art. He also takes Trials and Arguments with the utmost Care, which are copied so expeditiously as to be sent home the same Evening, if required.</p>
               <p>A new Edition of HODGSON'S TREATISE ON SHORT-HAND is just reprinted, Price Eighteen pence; also</p>
               <p>"SHORT-HAND CONTRACTIONS, adapted to every System;</p>
               <p>"to which are added, a Comparative Table of Alphabets, and two Extracts by way of</p>
               <p>"Specimen, with two Copper-plates annexed," Price 2 s. 6 d. Sold by J. Walmsley, Chancery-lane, and also by Bladon, Matthews, Bell, Brown, Clarke, Egerton, Fourdrinier, and all the Booksellers.</p>
               <p>Letters (post paid) from Purchasers of either of his Books, directed to Mr. Hodgson, No, 14, White-lion-street, Islington, or No. 35, Chancery-Lane, will receive immediate Answers; and all Orders from Gentlemen in the Profession of the Law, and others, immediately attended to.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen who send in haste to Islington, are requested to send a Porter, and not trust to the Stage or Penny-post.</p>
               <p>The numerous and particular Trials which have been much enquired after, Mr. Hodgson has reprinted for the Accommodation of his Customers.</p>
               <p>N. B. As many Gentlemen who have taught themselves Systems of Short-hand, not formed on this Plan, and wishing to exchange them, have found the Attempt too embarrassing; Mr. Hodgson has recently succeeded in introducing the peculiar Brevities of his System into others, without altering the Alphabets, and has found the Practice (though novel) perfectly easy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson has a compleat Set of Sessions Papers, for the last thirty-three Years, to dispose of at the usual Price; or any person wanting any particular Trial, may have a Copy of it at Six-pence per Folio.</p>
