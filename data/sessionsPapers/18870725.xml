                  </hi>. I am a dressmaker, carrying on business at 310. Regent Street—some time in March the prisoner called on me and said she had heard of me through a Miss Johnstone, whom I did not know—I asked the prisoner who she was, and she said she was Miss Hughes, and she wanted several dresses made at once—I told her I would make them, and she then ordered some dresses—she said her mother was a rich woman, living in Wales, and had a large establishment, keeping carriages and horses, and sent her a cheque once a month to pay her accounts, in<lb/>cluding her dressmaker's bill—she also said her father was a master of hounds—she said she wanted some things made in a hurry, and I took the order and made the dresses—the first address she gave me was at Streatham, where she was staying, and after that she gave me an address at 25, Angel Road, Brixton, where the dresses were to be sent—she called on different occasions after that and ordered different things—when the first of the following month came she explained to me she could not pay me, because she had not received her cheque, that she was going to bring her mother to give me an order—these are the three invoices (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the things I supplied to her—the dress she is wearing now is the first one I supplied to her—she spoke to me two or three times about her mother coming to see me—I believed the statements that she made with regard to her mother, and it was in consequence of what she said that I let her have the things—I afterwards went to one of the addresses she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188707250002"/>
               <p>gave me, and could not find her, and I then communicated with the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I know a lady of the name of Lynn—she did not in<lb/>troduce the prisoner to me—she came in once with the prisoner, after the order had been given—I don't know what Miss lynn is; I don't know her—she is not a customer of mine—I did not ask the prisoner any ques<lb/>tion as to her family; she told me without being asked—she mentioned that she was a singer, and said that one of these dresses was to sing in—she did not tell me that her father had been dead seven years—she told me her father was alive and was a master of hounds—she did not tell me what sort of hounds—I said at the police-court that she said her father was a master of buckhounds, but I was not sure—the goods were sent to Angel Road by my messenger—I did not ask him anything when he came back as to what apartments the prisoner lived in—on two or three occa<lb/>sions I asked the prisoner to settle her account, and she said her mother was in Clifton at the time, and would come and pay it, and on another occasion she said her mother was in Paris, and was expected in town every day—I went to Angel Road, Brixton, but the prisoner had gone from there—I saw Mrs. Pear there—she did not tell me till afterwards what address the prisoner had left, but she told me she had kept the prisoner's goods, because she had not paid her rent—I went there again, and she gave me an address in Dulwich Road, which the prisoner had left—it was nothing unusual in the length of time this account went, only the prisoner kept promising the money and did not pay, and then I sus<lb/>pected something was wrong—I have had bills go longer than two months, but I generally know the person—I don't arrest every customer because they don't pay a month or two afterwards—no person has offered to pay the bill—Mrs. Hughes offered me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after the arrest—I was not offered 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 328, Brixton Road, and am a dressmaker—the prisoner came to me last September—my first hand saw her first, while I was away for my holidays, and when I saw her she said her ma was away, that her pa had been dead seven years, and that her mother allowed her 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month for dresses, and if she had not the money at the time she had her own banking account—she told me she sung at Covent Garden, and more than once asked me to go and see her, and said the brougham should call for me, but I said I was too busy—she said she got from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a night—she also said they had a large place at Streatham, and asked me did I like grapes—I said "Yes," and she told me she would tell the gardener to send them if I would not mind them being sent on Sunday—I said "No," but I never got them—when she came again I said "Miss Hughes, I have not had the grapes"—she said "You have not, that awkward old gardener"—the woman who I now know is her mother was brought to my place once by the prisoner, and she said it was her dear old nurse, and she wanted a cloak to give to her, but I did not let her have it—she stood in the hall, I saw her there—the prisoner got goods from me valued at more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She once wanted a white dress, as she said she had to sing at Covent Garden, and asked me to go there and hear her sing—I did not institute this prosecution; I knew nothing of it until I was subpoenaed to appear here—it was about the end of February the last dress she had from me, but I took no steps then, because her mother came</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Harry Smith, and live at 80, Pennington Street—on the night of 1st July I went to bed about 10 o'clock—the win<lb/>dows and doors were all fastened up then—about three or four in the morning I was awoke by the dog Darking, and I listened and heard something in the sitting room, and then the prisoner opened my bedroom door, and I awoke my husband and said "There is a man, a thief," and the prisoner went out of my bedroom window into No. 79—I know the prisoner very well, and have seen him sitting on the doorstep smoking his cigarette—my room is on the ground floor—I then went out into the street and halloaed for a policeman, and then went to Leman Street and got one, and I saw the prisoner taken at No. 82, and heard him say "I was not there"—only a little piece of tobacco was taken off the chest of drawers, and he dropped that in the yard as he went out of the window—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am sure it was the prisoner I saw.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness and am a butcher—on this night my <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> awoke me, and I saw the prisoner go out of the window and go through a little window into the next house—I had seen him two days before—he afterwards came to my house and said "You say I was the man that came to your house in the night"—I said "Yes, of course you was"—he said "I want you for five minutes outside"—he was given in custody—this is the same piece of tobacco as was stolen; it was lying on the drawers—a sailor friend had given it to me—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 309). About midnight on 1st July I was called to Pennington Street to the house of the last witness—I examined the window of the sitting room and found it wide open, and the sofa underneath the window had marks of mud from boots on it—there is a window in the wall in the yard which leads into the next house—from what I was told I examined the window and found a three-cornered dent on it, and I found a pair of compasses on the prisoner which would remove the catch—they are very old houses—I also examined the window in the next house—it is a window with two bars across, and there is whitewash on the outside, which had marks on it as if someone had entered by there—from information I received I went to No. 82, and saw the prisoner, and told him I should tike him in custody for burglariously breaking and entering No. 80—he said "I was in bed"—I said "In this house, 82?" he said "Yes"—I then took him past 79 and 80, and when he came there he said "I might as well have my hat"—I said "Where is it?"—he said "In here"—that was 79, and I got the prisoner's brother to bring it out—the prisoner said "It is not my hat"—I fitted it on him and it fitted him—the prisoner said he had bought the compasses from a boy the night before for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the marks on the window corresponded with them.</p>

I am married and live at 79, Pennington Street—the prisoner lives there—that house adjoins the prosecutor's house—there is a small window between the two yards, and you can get from one house to the other—on the night of 1st July the prisoner was in my company till he went to bed at two o'clock in the morning—his bedroom is on the top floor—I was awoke about four o'clock in the morning by hearing Mrs. Smith screaming—I said "What is it, Mrs. Smith?"—she said "Esther, your husband or your brother has broken into my house"—I said "How can it be my husband when he has been lying by the side of me all night?"—I then went up to the prisoner's room—my husband had been up there before me, and told the prisoner to get up, and he went straight to next door and said "Do you accuse me of breaking into your house?" and the prosecutor said "No, not me, my wife"—the prisoner said "If I knew it was you I would punch your head."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the confidential enquiry regard to losses of letters passing through the Finsbury Park Post Office I was instructed to make inquiries, and accordingly on the 3rd of July I made up two letters, and addressed one of them to Mr. A.C. Luscombe, 201, Seven Sisters Road, and put in that two 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. postal orders, and four pawn tickets, and the second letter was addressed to Mr. T. Smith, pawnbroker, 257, Seven Sisters Road, and in it was put tow 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. orders, six penny stamps, and a pawn ticket—I put my private mark on the orders and the stamps—I made the two 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. orders payable at the Seven Sisters Road Office, and left the name of the payee blank, and the two 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. orders I left quite blank with nothing on—I then fastened the letters up, and posted them at the Northern District Post Office at 5 o'clock the same day, and gave certain instructions with regard to them—on the morning of 14th July I had certain information with regard to those letters, and in consequence I saw Frank Carew, and had a conversation with him, and after that I went to 158, Marlborough Road, Upper Holloway, in company with constable Bick—I did not see the door opened, but I went upstairs afterwards and heard what took place in the room—Bick said to Winifiel "Where did you get the order as from that you cashed this morning?"—she said "I have not cashed any orders this morning"—he again asked her where she had obtained them from, and produced the two 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. orders—she said her brother had given them to her to cash for him—Bick then said "Your name is not E. Clarke?"—she said "He told me not to put my own name upon them"—he then asked her about the pawn tickets—she said she had not seen any pawn tickets, but after<lb/>wards, I heard her say that her brother had burnt them on the fire in the next room—I then asked her where the stamps were that were with the orders, and she said "They are here," and she took them out of an album—I looked at them, and saw they were the stamps I had put in the</p>

               <p>letter, and pointed—them out to the prisoner—she was then asked where the other orders were, and she said she did not know; she would go and see, and went into the next room—Bick followed her—she said she was very much upset, and came back again, and took the two As. orders from her dress pocket—these are the orders and the stamps (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the orders were both signed "E. Foster"—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the two 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. orders—the signatures to the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. orders are all in the same writing—she said her brother had given her the stamps—she said to me "Did you send the letter, Sir; cannot I pay the money?"—she was then taken to the Hornsey Road Police-station, and confronted with her brother, and I said to him "Your sister has acknowledged receiving these orders from you; what have you to say?"—he said "I may as well take the blame; I did steal them"—I afterwards showed him these ten postal orders, and spoke to him about them, and I afterwards showed them to the prisoner and said "Your brother has admitted giving you orders to cash for him, and the writing on these resembles yours; what have you to say"—she said "I recognise the handwriting being mine, but I don't recollect the papers"—they have all got writing upon them and different names, such as M. Smith, M. Palmer, and M. Clark, and were cashed at different offices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Her brother was in custody when we went to where she was living, I heard Bick tell her he was a police constable in the service of the Post Office, so she knew some person had come from the Post Office to make inquiries about these letters—I have looked over the amounts of these orders, and find there is only one for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the others are for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and so on—her brother has been in the service of the Post Office since August, 1886, about eleven months—when I showed her these orders she admitted the writing at once—there was no attempt on her part to disguise or conceal the handwriting—all these orders have been cashed at post offices; they can pass from hand to hand like cash—it is not necessary for a person to write her name unless it is made payable specially at that office—the brother and sister were not together when I produced the ten orders—the brother said, behind the prisoner's back, that she did not know where he got them from—a Mr. Hill went with Bick.</p>

I am overseer at the Finsbury Park Post Office—Frank Carew was employed there as an auxiliary postman—on the 13th of July I received a bag from the Northern District Office at 5.53; that bag left there at 5.35—I saw it opened, and in it I saw the two letters described by the first witness—I locked them up in my desk till next morning, and then put them amongst the letters of Frank Carew's walk—that was at 6.40, the prisoner having come on duty at 6.20, and would leave for his delivery at 7.15—these two letters were not on his delivery, and therefore he should have sorted them up to another man to deliver—I searched that man's letters, and failed to discover these letters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the post-office receiver, 192, Seven Sisters Road—these postal orders were presented to me for payment on the 14th of July at 9.30 a.m. by the female prisoner—they were signed "A. Clark" at the time they were presented—I had previously received instructions with regard to two orders—I asked her to write her name and address on the back, and she wrote" A. Clark, 20, Cornwallis Road, Upper Holloway"—I gave her the money for the orders—I saw her again the same day at Marlborough Road, and identified her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I had seen the brother before I saw her, and he had replied to questions put to him by Mr. Mann—I asked her if she kept the money herself—she said "I always gave it to my brother"—there was a fire in the other room, and there were fragments of burnt paper, but nothing that could be identified.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This said that he took the rooms at</hi> 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year, and was signed A.J.

I live at 9, Clarence Road, Hackney, and am managing clerk to Mr. Musgrave, a solicitor—I took instructions from the prisoner to write these two letters on 31st May, and wrote and sent those letters with others. (<hi rend="italic">One of them stated that Mr. Musgrave was instructed to give notice that Mr. Bundy had no connection with the firm of Adams, Eck, and Co.</hi>)</p>

I am exhausted; my back is broke"—I said "How did you come here?"—she said "I jumped from the window"—I asked her what she done it for—she said "I don't know"—the prisoner and I took her to the hospital—my mother has threatened to commit suicide on several occasions, five or six times—about three months before she jumped out of window she went to the drawer to get a razor; she said she wished to be in heaven, she wished to be with her Maker—she got the case; I took it from her—she said she would throw herself from the window because she wished to be with her Maker; that was the kitchen window—she was very constant in her attendance at church—the prisoner has not been in constant work all this year—when he had constant work he would allow my mother money—he has had none lately—the week when this happened was a very bad one; he had not many hours' work because it was holiday week—he was paid so much per hour—my mother said she could not serve two masters.</p>

Cox."—I looked at this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) every week—it was shown to me with this entry in it: "Bill—Cox, speaking tubes, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and that satisfied me that the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid to Cox—after the prisoner was in custody on other matters I asked the clerk to bring me all the papers, and among them I found the receipts which have been produced—I never could obtain receipts from the prisoner, he seemed to think it very strange that I should not trust him—I have not been able to find any receipt from Cox in English—this letter of the 15th May, 1887, is in the prisoner's writing; it is in French.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have an estate in Burgundy—this is the badge of the <hi rend="italic">Legion d' Honour</hi> in my coat—I am a partner in a firm at Bordeaux—I came here last summer on business—the prisoner was introduced to me by the servant of one of my friends, and he told me had a scheme—this is it (<hi rend="italic">A pamphlet</hi>)—he asked me to find money to carry it out; to make a company and I found it all three months afterwards, and the company was formed—the prisoner was the vendor and I was the purchaser—I gave him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month for it—this is the contract. (<hi rend="italic">Between the prisoner and the Turf A B C Company, by which the prisoner engaged himself to the Company for two years at a salary of</hi> 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year for two years, and one fully paid-up share in the Company for every preferred share issued by them</hi>)—52 preferred shares of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each were issued, representing 5,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the deferred shares only had value when the preferred shares were paid—I put in 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my own money, and I bought 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a gentleman—the Imperial Bank are the Company's bankers, and mine also—every<lb/>thing is in my name; there never was any account opened for the Turf</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188707250041"/>
               <p>A.B.C.; there is only one account, and that is in my name—I pay in the funds I receive on behalf of the Company in my name, and the prisoner knew that—he went to Mr. Owen and said "You think the Count has 1,200 shares, but he has only 500," and I then bought fifteen 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares of Mr. Owen, and paid him 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them by giving him some bonds which he may realise to-morrow if he likes—I gave him a proxy on my income, and he was pleased with it—I did not buy the shares back in consequence of any threats—they were worth 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, but they never were in the market—I get 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month as managing director—the prisoner was in custody for embezzlement when the clerk found this forged receipt among his papers in his cupboard—he was acquitted—I also found 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., his petty cash, which I confiscated—he was charged with 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I found 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his private cupboard—on the day that he was arrested a committee was going to be held, but it was postponed, and he came to me and said in joke "If you don't put the accounts in a more regular manner and pay the accounts of the Company into another account, I shall denounce you"—he had threatened to murder me two or three times before, but he never threatened to expose my irregular practices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I became acquainted with him he was in want—I was obliged to give him money the first three months to enable him to live—there is no pretence for saying that this is not a genuine Company to which I have subscribed a large sum—when I bought Mr. Owen's shares they were worth 115<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per share—the 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the balance of the prisoner's petty cash which he had in hand, and therefore the Company's property—he was in custody for large embezzlements, of money which he had to pay the workmen—there is not a particle of truth in the suggestion that this receipt was written by me.</p>

"—this "5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." in the receipt looks as if it had been altered, but I swear the signature is not mine, it is the same writing as the other part—I do not owe the prisoner any grudge, he gave me the work as a kindness.</p>

I said 'No.' They asked me to meet them at the King Lud public-house, Ludgate Hill, that night at 9 o'clock; I met them; they asked me if I was willing to earn something; I said Yes; they asked me to meet them next night, which I did at the same place; they told me they were auctioneers, and all I should have to do was to take a room and they would give me a reference, which I did. They said several letters and parcels would come for them, and all I should have to do would be to take everything that arrived to them. I was to have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of each week. I then went to 33, Berwick Street and took a furnished room in the name of John Lewis Banks. I was to be sure and not open anything. When I was at Berwick street some letters did come I think six or seven parcels also. I never opened them, but I took them to the two men each day at Ludgate Hill Station. I never received a farthing from them. The last time I saw them they said it was getting very hot for me, and they said I had better get out of London alto<lb/>gether"—that was all he said, he did not give the names nor any description of the two men—he said "I should know them again if I saw them"—I searched him and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some keys—he gave his name Herbert Taylor, and said he was a clerk.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was dressed as he is now—I cannot say he seemed in great poverty—he gave his address as at a common lodging-house, Belvidere Lambeth—the second time I inquired there they said he came there about the same time that he left Berwick Street—it was a lodging-house at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a night—he did not give me the name of one of the men as Banks—he has never given me a written description of either of the men—he was detained at the station on this charge, and I was sent for—he gave me a description of where the lodging-house was—I received some money from him, which I have given up—I threw away the paper he gave me—I think it was simply the address of the lodging-house, and I did not want it.</p>

I am chief engineer of the s.s. <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi>—I left Cardiff on 7th May in that ship—the prisoner was a fireman and was shipped at Finn, discharged at Cardiff, and shipped at Cardiff again—we went to Constantinople, and then left there on the return voyage for Hamburg, the prisoner being fireman as before—on 18th June, at 9.30, when we were on the high seas (I cannot tell the position of the ship) I ordered the prisoner to draw the ash pit—at 10.30 I went down in the stoke hole and found he had not done it—I went on deck and found him sitting on the fidley, which is a casing round the funnel and over the grating, a way down to the stoke hole—I said "Why have you not done what I told you?"—I spoke in English, which he understood sufficiently—he began grumbling and growling in his own language; he got excited and told me in English, "I won't trim any more and I won't work till four o'clock in the morning"—the trimmers are men told off to help the firemen—the prisoner was trimming at the time and wanted to go firing—I said he would have to go down below to do his work—I followed him across the fidley to the stoke hole grating and gave him a shove with my hand towards the grating; he did not fall—he brought his arm round and struck me just below the ribs—I could not see what with, as it was dark—I felt his hand—I then gave him two or three blows and knocked him down—no one else was near enough to strike me but the prisoner—I stepped down from the fidley to the deck and put my hand to my side and found it was wet—I called the second and third engineers up and went and told the master what had occurred—I took off my shirt and found I had a wound, clean cut, about three inches long—it had cut through my flannel and shirt; it bled profusely—the captain sewed it up and plastered it—I took to my bed and stayed there for five days; I could not move—seven days after we arrived at Hamburg, where I saw a doctor—I was nearly well then—I had seen the prisoner with a black clasp knife when working in the engine room before this—the wound has not healed up altogether yet—at Hamburg we were all taken before the Consul and</p>

I tried to explain my case to the captain of the port at Hamburg, but as he could not speak Italian he could not understand what was said."</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my wife and daughter at 41, Great Wild Street, Drury Lane—we live in the front room, second floor—the prisoner and his mother live in the first-floor front—Mr. and Mrs. Suckling live in the third-floor back—on Saturday, 2nd July, I was out with my wife and daughter selling programmes—we went to public-houses—about 5 minutes to 12 that night we went home—I had had a share of five or six pots of shandy gaff—I was not the worse for liquor, I knew what I was doing—we went upstairs with Mr. Driscoll—as we passed McEllicott's door Mrs. McEllicott was waiting for my wife, and they <hi rend="italic">glarmed</hi> her</p>

I am the wife of the last witness—when we went home on this night the prisoner's mother and aunt were on the stairs—the aunt <hi rend="italic">dragged</hi> me in the face—my little girl thought there were too many, and took me upstairs—Driscoll went into the back room, and we went into our own—the prisoner came to our door and threatened my husband, and asked him out to fight, and said "I have a piece of steel waiting for you a long time"—my husband wanted to go out to him, but I opened the door and asked him to go down to his own place, and I went down with him—my little girl came down and said "Mother, come upstairs," and he deliberately struck her in the right shoulder—I had turned to go upstairs, and had my back to him—I did not see what he struck her with; he had something in his hand, I thought it might have been a tobacco-pipe—my daughter screamed out "Mother, he has stabbed me," and she screamed upstairs "Father, <hi rend="italic">Billy Mac</hi> has stabbed me"—he stood about a second, and then went down the first flight of stairs, and I saw no more of him—I pulled off my daughter's jacket and saw the blood, and that frightened me—there was no noise or confusion at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his statement before the Magistrate and in a written defence stated that he had had too much drink, and met a man who told him to drive the horse and cart to Hounslow, which he did, but he had no intention of stealing them, and that he gave the name of White not to bring grief upon his family.</hi>

               <p>months for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I agreed and he left saying that he was going to see Mr. Smith in Fleet Street, and would come back later on, which he did and said Mr. Smith was unable to call and see me as he was obliged to go down to Essex—I then arranged with the prisoner for the insertion of my advertisement in those two papers, and gave him this cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. payable to Thomas Smith or order—it was not crossed—it is now endorsed, and I should say it is in the same writing as the other—he gave me this receipt—I should have sent the receipt to Mr. Smith, but the prisoner took out this receipt with a printed heading of the <hi rend="italic">Kilburn Times</hi>, signed "F.H.

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of 86, Kingsdown Road, Upper Holloway—in the beginning of last year my wife had a business to sell, of which I was the manager—on 3rd February the prisoner came in and said that my wife had asked him to sell the business, and he had advertised it in the <hi rend="italic">Telegraph</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Hackney and Kingsland Gazette</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Islington Gazette</hi>, and produced these receipts for the advertise<lb/>ments—the one for the <hi rend="italic">Daily Chronicle</hi> was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that for the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said that he had just come from the offices—I wrote down the amounts, and he gave me this receipt for the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I will not say whether I told the Magistrate that the prisoner said that he had just come from the offices—I have never asked the prisoner to give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle the matter—I did not say to him on the first day of the Session "Give me half of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and keep the other half, and I will get the Grand Jury to throw out the bill"—that</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner came to me about settling the case—I proved the evidence his son gave at the police-court—when the prisoner Drought the receipts he asked me to let him have the money, as it was usual.</p>

I have had experience in making plans—I have made these three plans connected with the house the subject of this inquiry; the first shows the outside, it is a three-storied house, consisting of a ground-floor, first-floor, and second-floor; the ground-floor consists of two rooms, a bedroom and kitchen—there is a passage running through, so that you can get into the back yard with<lb/>out going into one or other of the rooms—a short staircase of nine or ten stairs leads to the first-floor, which consists of two rooms, one back and one front, and another short staircase leads to the top floor, which con<lb/>sists of only one room—the first-floor window is 12 feet from the sill to</p>

               <p>the pavement—I did not discover any marks on that window-sill—the second plan is a plan of the first-floor front bedroom, which was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Angel; it correctly shows the door by which you enter, and the position of the bed—it is 1 foot 2 inches from the floor to the bedstead—beneath the bed I saw an egg-box 9 inches high—there would be 5 1/2 inches between the top of that box and the bedstead—I went up the stairs from the first to the second-floor—there is a small window through which you can look from the staircase on to the bedstead, it commands a full view of the bed; there was a thin muslin blind inside at the time, it has since been taken down—you could see through the muslin and have a full view of the bed and of anyone lying on it—there were some nails on the wall on which some clothing was hanging at the foot of the bed—this third plan is a copy of the Ordnance sheet, made to a scale of 5 feet to the mile, showing Batty Street and the surrounding streets—No. 19, Batty Street is nearly opposite No. 16, you would be perfectly able to see from 19 to 16—the street is 26 feet 9 inches wide from wall to wall—one end of it runs to Commercial Road and the other to Fairclough Street; going down Fairclough Street you come to Back-church Lane, and at the corner is Mr. Lee's oil-shop, which is 229 yards from 16, Batty Street—Mr. Schmidt's shop is next to Lee's—Dr. Kay's surgery is at the corner of Batty Street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I live at 37, Philpot Street, Com<lb/>mercial Road—I am a native of Poland—I have not been in England 12 months—I am a stick maker, and at one time I worked for a Mr. Macartz, of Watney Passage, Commercial Road—during the time I worked there the prisoner was working in the same employment, and continued to be there up to 20th June or thereabouts, till the Jubilee week—the boy Pitman was also employed at Mr. Macartz's—on the Saturday of Jubilee week, 25th June, I met the prisoner, and he said that he had made for himself a workshop, and said, "You come to me to work," that he didn't earn much at Mr. Macartz's, and he said he would give me regular wages, and I went to work at his place on Tuesday morning at 7 o'clock—I went there on the Sunday before the Tuesday, and they were making samples, and it was then arranged I should come on the following Tuesday to begin work at 7 o'clock—on Tuesday morning, the 28th, at 7 o'clock, I went to the front door of 16, Batty Street and knocked, and the prisoner came down and opened the door—he was dressed in trousers and shirt, and was barefooted as we go to work—I went into the house, and went with him up on to the top floor—there was only the prisoner and myself there then—he then gave me some points to bend, which were to be put on the tops of sticks; they had to be filed, and I filed them—the prisoner also commenced to do some work, but only worked for a few minutes—at that time there was only one vice in the room, and he said, "There will come another man, a filer, and he will require another vice, and I will go and buy another one and a sponge for the boy to varnish with"—he did not say anything else as to the filer, as to who had recommended him, he only said that he would come to work—before the prisoner went out he put on his boots, and a short coat, and a hat—it was such a coat and hat as these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), only there were no stains on the coat then—I did not hear him shut the street door as he went out—after a short time he came back, and said, "The shop is still closed"—he meant by that Macartz's shop where he went to buy the vice—I cannot tell how long he was out, because there was no clock—he did no work after he came back, but went up and down the stairs till the boy came to work about 8 o'clock—he came up directly after the boy came in the room, and said, "I am going to buy a sponge for the boy to varnish"—I don't know the boy's name. (<hi rend="italic">The witness Pitman was here called in.</hi>) That is the boy—the prisoner then went out to buy a sponge—he was then dressed in the same way as he was when he went out on the last occasion—after he had gone out a man came up into the room. (<hi rend="italic">The witness Schmuss here came in.</hi>) That is the man—he did not speak much, as he did not stay long, he spoke in his own language, <hi rend="italic">Yueddish</hi>—he remained there a little time, I cannot say about how long, 15 minutes or it might have been longer—the prisoner did not return again, and Schmuss left and went away—the boy was then with me in the room—I cannot say whether it was an hour or an hour and a half after the man left that the boy left; I cannot say how long it was—he went away for his breakfast—I did not leave that upstairs room from 7 o'clock till I heard the disturbance—I did not see the prisoner any more after he went out a second time—it was about 11 o'clock I heard the distur<lb/>bance,</p>

               <p>and the mother-in-law said, "Come downstairs"—I heard clap<lb/>ping, and knocking, and screaming, and the boy ran downstairs—I cannot say when the boy returned, but he did come back into the room at the top of the house, and stayed with me until I heard the disturbance downstairs, and then he and I went downstairs into the front room on the first floor, and saw Mrs. Angel lying dead on the bed, and the women inside the room.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not half an hour in Lipski's room on the Sunday—I cannot tell how long I was there on the Tuesday before the boy came; there was no clock—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were the sort of things I was working upon; they would require fine filing with fine files—when you are doing that you can hear a little, but not much—the boy did nothing at all while he was there—I don't know whether on this morning I did a dozen or a whole two dozen or not—I cannot say how long it takes to file one of these things, because I am not a filer; I can only file a little—I spoke to the man (Schmuss) in my own language, <hi rend="italic">Yueddish</hi>, not in English—I cannot speak English—I did not know him before; it was the first time I had seem him when he came up—I never told the boy that I had known him before, because I cannot speak English—I can swear that I did not speak a word to the boy in English—I never told the boy that Lipski had gone for a vice, nor did I tell him that I had been in this man's company before—I did not hear any knock when this strange man came, and I did not hear any knock when the boy came—the window of the room in which I was was a little open, and the door was also a little open—I had breakfast in Lipski's room, bread and butter; the boy saw me—shellac and varnish is used in the business of a stick maker; the shellac is put into the varnish—they call it varnish when the shellac is dissolved in spirits—I don't know how they make the varnish—I have been engaged in the stickmaking business since I have been here, about eight months—Lipski did not ask me to get him some brandy—I don't know whether he used the brandy with his coffee in the morning—he did not give me a farthing to get any brandy with for him; I can swear it—he never said anything to me about wanting change—he never sent me for brandy—I went upstairs and went to work—I did not know that Lipski had a watch and chain; he had a sort of pin in his necktie—I was not standing with the strange man outside the door of Mrs. Angel's room when Lipski came back—I did not know who lived down there; the door of Mrs. Angel's room was not partly open at that time—I will swear in the Temple I was not there when the door was partly open—I did not at any time before the alarm took place on that morning stand before Mrs. Angel's door—I was not standing just outside the door and the strange man just inside the door of Mrs. Angel's room—I did not have any parcel in my hand when Lipski came up the stairs the last time; I can swear that, and I did not throw the parcel down and say to the strange man "He is here, come on"; that is all lies; I did not say it—the strange man did not catch hold of Lipski, nor did I catch hold of him; it is all lies—I did not force open Lipski's mouth; I am not such a strong man as that—I did not force open his mouth while the other man held him; the other one was not there; it is all lies—I come from Plotz, 17 or 18 Polish miles from Warsaw.</p>

               <p>Batty Street—we live at the bottom; I let out the first and second floors—the prisoner lived on the top floor—Mr. and Mrs. Angel lived in the first-floor front—the prisoner did not know Mrs. Angel—on the Tuesday morning my husband went out to work about half-past 6 o'clock—I got up about half-past 8 o'clock—I went into the kitchen; there was no one there—directly after I got there the prisoner came in; he was fully dressed—he had his coat and hat on—he asked me to go and get his coffee for him—I had been in the habit of doing that every day—I went and got some hot water taking the coffee pot with me and buying the hot water and bringing the coffee back ready to drink—he said nothing more to me at that time—he asked me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "I have not got it; go to your young girl's mother; she lends you so much; she will lend you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. too"—he said "I am ashamed to go to her; she only gave me last night 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—Mrs. Lyons is the mother of Kate Lyons the young woman I spoke of—the prisoner spoke to me in Hebrew—it was after that that I went to get the hot water for the coffee—he said "Go for the coffee; I shall be here when you come back with it"—I went out to Backchurch Lane and there got the hot water—I left the house just about half-past 8 o'clock—the door was open when I went out—I paid for the water—I got back in about 20 minutes—that would be some<lb/>where about 10 minutes to 9 o'clock—the door was still open—I went into the kitchen; there was no one there; the prisoner was not there—Mrs. Levy met me in the passage—I put the coffee pot on the table, and went and called out to the prisoner "Come down and have your coffee;" there was no answer—I called a second time, and the boy answered "He aint here"—I then had my breakfast and sent the children to school—about half-past 9 o'clock my mother, Mrs. Ruben—stein, came down—she lodged in the same room with Mrs. Levy—the coffee was still on the table—about 10 o'clock I went out with Mrs. Levy to shop in Petticoat Lane—I had not seen the prisoner again up to that time—the coffee was in the same place—I could not say whether anybody came in and left the house during that time, I was busy with my children for school; I did not see anybody—when I left I left my mother in charge of the house, and gave her certain directions about the coffee—I was away just an hour in Petticoat Lane—I came back with Mrs. Levy somewhere about 11 o'clock—when I came back I saw my mother sitting on a chair in the passage outside in the street, and Mrs. Dinah Angel, the deceased's mother-in-law, met me in the passage; she spoke to me and then went into the house and went upstairs—I did not hear her try the door—she called down to me; upon that I told Mrs. Levy to go upstairs—she went up and then called out something to me, in consequence of which I threw everything down and ran upstairs—I did not try the door of Mrs. Angel's room, T went up beyond the first floor and looked through the little window; I could see through from the staircase—there was a muslin curtain over it—I saw Mrs. Angel on the bed; she looked to me a little like fainting—I then came down to the first-floor landing and burst open the door—I did not try the door much, because Mrs. Levy and Mrs. Dinah Angel said it was locked—the three of us together burst the door open—I pushed with my leg and knee—I cannot tell whether all the three pushed with the knees—I did not fix myself against anything so as to be able to push harder, I just pushed my knee against the door—my back was not against anything—we were only a second before we got it open;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188707250082"/>
               <p>we had no difficulty in getting it open, I pushed with my knee, and it opened—we all three went into the room together—I went round to the bed on which the woman was lying—I was the first to get round there—I took her by one arm arm and shook her, and called to her; she did not answer me—her face was sideways, I could not tell you in what direction; see if any portion of her body was exposed; she was half covered, the other half was uncovered—she was wearing a chemise, no night-dress—I noticed like burnt in front of the chemise—I did not notice how her hair was—there was some furniture in the room—I did not notice any sign of disturbance of the furniture—when I found this I began to run down and scream in the street, leaving the door open—I went for Dr. Kaye, he was out—I returned to the room, and then went a second time for Dr. Kaye—I saw an assistant, and then returned to the house, and as I was returning I saw the doctor in his carriage—he came to the house directly and went up to the room where the deceased was.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner had been lodging with us for nearly two years; he was a steady, respectable young man, and always bore a good character with every one—he wanted the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his work—he told me he had borrowed 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from his intended mother-in-law the last night; that was true—he was then fitting up his room for the purpose of making it a workshop, and he was purchasing materials to some considerable amount, some pounds; his rent was increased from 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—Mrs. Angel had borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Levy the day before, to pay her rent—the lock of Mrs. Angel's door fitted properly; one portion was not too high, it just fitted—after the 28th, Mr. Angel left the house, and we let the room to other people—the lock remained on the door while the other people were using the room—it remained on the door three weeks before the policeman came and had it cut off—the box of the lock was not higher than the lock itself, it would just fit—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this correct?"Where the old lock had been a hole was left large enough for three fingers, and the box of the lock was higher than the lock itself"—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this is also correct, "With the key inside I could catch the key from the outside, through the hole left from the old lock;" you could just touch it, you could not lock it from the outside.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MCINTYRE</hi>. The lock was taken off just exactly two weeks after; it was sawn off—Mrs. Levy went out shopping with me on the 28th—my mother was the only person left in charge of the house—she can see a little, but very little; she is obliged to feel as she goes about—the street door is sometimes left, so that any one pushing against it can come in; that is the ordinary way—I had a pawn-ticket belonging to the prisoner for a gold chain—he had a silver watch until just at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not know whether he had it on this Tuesday morning—I know he had a watch; I saw him with it one Saturday, I cannot recollect when—I do not know that he pawned it, he did not tell me—I did not see him with it for some time, I cannot think when—nothing had been done to the lock of the door before it was sawn off;</p>

               <p>I had not had a locksmith to do anything to it—it was used to lock the room up—the police came with a man and cut off the piece.</p>

The lock was good on this Tuesday—nothing happened to it till a man belonging to the police broke open the door—I was out at the time; when I came back I saw the door open—I saw the lock; it was then broken, hanging down—that was a fortnight after the woman's death—I saw the man who did it, it was a detective, it was Bitten—I said "What have you done this for?" and he said he would send a carpenter to put it on again—the carpenter did not come—a week after the detective came with two men to saw off the lock altogether—daring the fortnight before Bitten came the lock was as it used to be; the woman used to lock it.</p>

When I went into the room for this purpose I merely opened the door, just turned the handle—I never found the door locked so that I could not get in; I did not force it in any way or damage the lock—Mr. Angel had left the room then; somebody was occupying it; I do not know the name, they were foreigners—I went there on 13 or 14 occasions—I never forced the lock—the lock produced is exactly in the same condition as it was on the night of the occurrence—there might be some little difficulty to explain about the locking of this particular lock (<hi rend="italic">Taking up the lock</hi>)—this is the inside of the door, and this is the hole that has been spoken of—the landlord is here who put it on, and he can explain it—on the day of the occurrence these screws had been forced out so as to get the door open—this is an actual piece of the door and doorpost.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sometimes when I went there there were no persons in the room; sometimes Mrs. Lipski would come up with me; the occupier of the room opened the door to me on one or two occasions, but it takes a time to make it plain—a week before she went there, when the room was unoccupied I used to open the door in the usual way—if you locked the door it would not answer, only just to keep the wind off; if you just touched the door it came open.</p>

My son lived with his wife at 16, Batty Street—I saw her on the Monday evening before this happened—she used to come to me to breakfast; her time would be sometimes half-past 8, sometimes 9 o'clock—on this Tuesday she did not come to breakfast, and about 11 o'clock I went round to her house—there was no one at the door when I got there, I saw no one—I afterwards saw Mrs. Rubenstein—I then went up to my son's room—I had seen Mrs. Levy but not Mrs. Lipski before that—I went to the door of my son's room and tried it, and it was closed—I saw Mrs. Levy try the handle, and she said "The key is inside," and then she went up the stairs and looked through this place in the partition—I knocked at the door, but could get no answer—Mrs. Levy was there when the door was forced open; we got it open by forcing it with the hand; Mrs. Lipski was not there then—I and Mrs. Levy both went into the room together, ran to the bed, and I thought my daughter-in-law was fainting; she laid with her hands so, and her head aside, and Mrs. Levy put her hands aside and moved her head, thinking she was fainting—she then saw she was dead, and went out and created an alarm—she was lying on the bed with her head aside</p>

I am the wife of Abraham Levy, but I am living apart from him and have been lodging at 16, Batty Street—on the morning of 28th June I came down about a quarter to nine, and shortly after I looked out into the street and saw Mrs. Lipski in the street coming to the house with a coffee pot in her hand—I called up to the prisoner, telling him that his coffee was ready, and the boy answered from upstairs—I went out with Mrs. Lipski at 10 o'clock that morning and returned at 11—Mrs. Angel, senior, was coming in at the time—she went upstairs and knocked at the door of her daughter's bedroom—I then went up and looked into the bedroom through the little window and saw young Mrs. Angel lying on the bed—she looked very bad—Mrs. Lipski also came up and looked into the window—I said "She looks bad"—the mother-in-law then said "Perhaps she is fainting"—the three of us then came down from the landing to the bedroom door and the mistress said would she open the door—then the whole three of us pushed the door open—before that was done I looked through the keyhole and saw the key inside in the lock—when we pushed open the door we went into the room and saw the woman as she lay in bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Kay, surgeon, in Commercial Road—on the Tuesday morning I was stopped in the street, and went to No. 16, about half past 11—I went at once upstairs and into the front bedroom on the first floor—at that time Dywein and Rosenbloom and two or three women and perhaps another man were in the room—I saw the deceased on the bed lying on her back, with her head inclined to the right towards the wall, with her right arm more or less over her breast, her parts exposed, the chemise rolled up to just underneath the breast, so that I could see the lower parts exposed, the right leg was drawn up—I at once went to her and moved her head towards me—I moved her arm; I found she was dead—I put her back in the same position as I found her—I then looked round and cleared the room; I told the people to go out—I noticed the window; there was a top blind down, and an ordinary curtain across the lower panes—the sash of the window was shut, and the upper sash was slightly open, 1 1/2 or 2 inches—I saw a female's clothes on a chair, as if undressed from the night before, and a pair of trousers lying on the floor—there was a square pillow on the floor—the woman was lying on the bare sacking of the bed; the ordinary covering was pushed down towards the foot of the bedstead—I did not notice at that time how far the bedstead was from the wall—I saw a table in front of the window—there was a glass on the table which I looked at and smelt; it appeared to be beer or stout—that is all I noticed at that time, except that I saw yellow marks of acid on the floor and on the woman's chemise and face, her mouth and lips and chin—I did not notice whether her face was injured at that time—that was all I noticed before I proceeded to leave the room—when I went to the door to leave the room I saw the key was on the inside of the door in the lock—I took it out and went to shut the door, and I then found the lock had been locked, so that the bolt was shot, and that prevented me from shutting the door completely to—it had a queer look, so I went back and unlocked it from inside—it was shot, and would not come to—the bolt came on the box; I had to unlock it—the box was slightly loosed, and when the bolt came on thereat got more forward, so that it would not shut—I am quite sure this part into which the bolt shoots was loose—it is a spring lock; only one part is spring—it appeared to me by pushing against it it forced it away, and would loose the box into which the lock shoots—I found it was locked—I then locked it from outside, putting the key in on the outside—this is exactly as it was—it has been tightened since—I did not touch the box</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188707250088"/>
               <p>of the lock at all; I did nothing to it—afterwards I went outside, pulled the door to, and locked the door from the outside—the room at that time had been cleared, and nobody went in—I took the key out, and kept it my possession—I went and fetched Dr. Kay, my principal; he returned with me a very few, perhaps 10, minutes afterwards—there was one constable on the outside of the door, keeping the crowd back—I unlocked the door, and Dr. Kay and I entered the room—several others came in, I cannot tell who; Dywein and Rosenbloom, people who were there—the police came in shortly afterwards—Dr. Kay examined the woman—I saw this bottle, not then, but subsequently, in the room—it was not exactly found, it was pointed out by Rosenbloom to the constable; it was then lying in one of the folds of the feather bed—there was no cork in it; I put one in—Dr. Kay took it—we both looked at and smelt it—there was just a little stuff in it; I formed the opinion that it was nitric acid, commonly called aqua fortis—I saw the prisoner there—in searching for the bottle Dr. Kay got on the bed to remove the pillow, and discovered this man lying between the bed and the wall—I think I assisted someone in pulling the bed out—it was pulled out, and then we both got down on that side and Dr. Kay examined the man and found he was not dead, so we woke him up—he was in his shirt-sleeves, which were rolled up—I did not see his coat or hat found there—the police and Dr. Kay were there—then the police took charge of the prisoner, and he was taken to Dr. Kay's surgery first, then to the station-house, and afterwards to the hospital.</p>

On Tuesday, 28th June, about 12 o'clock, I was on duty in Commercial Road and was called to 16, Batty Street—I went up to the room on the first floor and found Dr. Kay, Mr. Piper, and Harris Dywein—at that time the body of the woman lay dead on the bed—Dr. Kay spoke to me about the body of a man underneath the bed, and I helped to pull the bed away out of the recess—the bed was some little distance from the wall when we began to pull it; we pulled it a little further away, quite a yard I should think—then the prisoner was seen lying on the other side of the bed on the ground—he was on his back in his shirt sleeves which were rolled up—instructed by the doctor I assisted to lift the man up from the ground—he seemed to know a little—his eyes were opened when we lifted him up—I noticed yellow stains on his shirt and hands—when we had assisted him up he could see the de<lb/>ceased as she lay; he fell down backwards again—in consequence of what the doctor said I got a cab and took him first to Dr. Kay's and then to the police-station and afterwards to the London Hospital, where I left him</p>

On the Tuesday I was passing through Batty Street, and in consequence of what I heard I went to the first floor front room, where I found Dr. Kay, Mr. Piper, and Sack—after Sack took the prisoner away I searched the room—I found this hat of the prisoner at the foot of the bed on the near side as you approach the bed, covered over by a pillow—this old coat, which has been identified as the prisoner's, I found at the foot of the bed near the wall under the bed on the floor—there was this other newer coat over it—over them was a row of nails or pegs with clothes hanging on them—I did not notice anything particularly the matter with the good coat at the time—I noticed it was lying down as if it had been laid down, as if it had not fallen—on the old underneath coat I noticed stains and also smelt a very strong smell coming from it; it burnt the skin off my fingers when I picked it up—it was very wet—I saw an old pair of trousers lying on the floor against an old egg box under the bedstead—there were some old clothes in the egg box—I did not see where the waistcoat was found—the things hanging on the walls were female clothing, such as dresses and petticoats, and another coat I believe there was—I took charge of the prisoner's coat on the floor and the hat—I left the other, the better, coat there—afterwards I took the coat wet with the stuff on it to the station and handed it to Inspector Final.</p>

I live at 222, Romford Road, Stratford, and am the leaseholder of 16, Batty Street—for about 20 years I have been accus<lb/>temed to fixing locks and doing repairs of that description myself—I remember fixing a lock on the door of the first floor room of 16, Batty Street; it was about a fortnight or three weeks before this sad affair—it was a brand new lock and a very good lock, I believe—after I had fixed it I tried it to satisfy myself; it would unlock and lock, and then I saw the deceased sitting by the window and tried to make her understand to come and try the lock herself, but I found I could make no effect on her—then I went to the door and tried it backwards and forwards and beckoned her, and she tried it and bowed and went away—it was then in perfectly good and working order to my satisfaction—this is the lock and the box, but the wedge that I cut was not split in this way—I imagine it has got split in wrenching the door open—I put the wedge to complete it, that the box might be placed on it, and so that it would be steady—the lock was in my opinion perfectly available to lock the door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said something about a trial to the prisoner at the hospital—it possibly arose from my custom of being used to it—possibly what I said at the police-court to him was "You are not bound to say anything; what you say will be put down"—I told the truth there—he was not charged for some days after 28th June—I don't admit that I am confusing what I said at the hospital with what I said at the police-office—the word trial is so used to me that possibly I might have used it—my impression is that I did use the word trial in Hebrew—I was only at the hospital once—at the police-station the prisoner was formally charged in my presence, and he made a reply—so far as the police are concerned those were the only two occasions on which I saw him and made a charge to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). This is a copy of what was taken at the bedside in the hospital: "At 7 a.m. a man working for me came; he asked me for work; I told him to wait; I would buy a vice for him, so as he could work. I went to purchase a vice. I went to the shop, but it was too soon. As I was going along I met another workman whom I knew at the corner of Bagchurch Lane. I went back. The shop<lb/>keeper wanted four shillings; I offered him three shillings. He would not take it. I returned and came into the passage, and I saw the man that I met in Bagchurch lane. He asked me 'Will you give me work</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188707250093"/>
               <p>or not?' I said 'Go to the workshop; I am going to get my breakfast, then I will give you work.' I then told my landlady to make some coffee. I then told a man (meaning the first man that called at 7 a.m.) to fetch some brandy. Then I went to the yard. I went upstairs to the first floor. I then saw both these men. I saw them open a box; they took hold of me by the throat, and threw me to the ground; there on the ground opened my mouth and put in some poison, and said 'That is the brandy.' They got my hands behind me, and asked me if I had any money. 'I have got no more than the sovereign that I gave you to get the brandy with.' He then asked 'Where is your gold chain?' I said 'It is in pawn.' They said 'If you don't give it to us you will be as dead as the woman.' They put a piece of wood in my mouth. I struggled; they put their knees against my throat. One said to the other 'Don't you think he is quite dead?' The reply was 'He don't want any more.' They then threw me under the bed, and there I lay for dead." <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know who these two men are? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know one who formerly worked with me. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know his name and where he lives? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His name is Simon; I don't know where he lives. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know anything of the other man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know him; he is a stranger to me. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is his name Simon Rosenbloom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know if Simon lives in Philpot Street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say. I have nothing further to say." On 2nd July I read the charge to the prisoner at the police-station, and cautioned him, and the prisoner replied in German "I have not murdered her; I have not done it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine and Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and I practice at 100, Commercial Road, the corner of Batty Street—on Tuesday, the 28th June, I was called to 16, Batty Street, and went up into the first floor room at a quarter to 12—my assistant went with me from the surgery, and he and others followed me into the room—on the bed I saw the woman lying on her back dead, with her hair dishevelled; her mouth had a stream of yellow coming from the corner on the left-hand side—her neck had two or three splashes; her breast had a splash—her hands were covered with the stains of nitric acid—the yellow stains were nitric acid, commonly called aqua fortis—she was covered up to her breast with one of the German feather beds—I turned it down to see if any violence had been offered to her—her chemise was pulled up to the breast, and the body was exposed—I noticed blood on the feather bed; splashes of blood and acid mixed—the effect of administering this stuff would cause a person to cough very violently—there were no marks of violence on the lower parts of the body—I formed an opinion she had been dead about three hours—the body was not quite cold—<hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> was absent—three hours must be pretty near the time—she was a stout woman—I have taken into consideration the state of the room and the weather and her condition of body in forming my opinion as to the three hours—I did not notice any marks on her face at all then, except those of the acid—I looked about the room to see what she had drunk it out of, and saw a glass containing beer—I looked about for a bottle—Dywein was there—I pulled the bed away from the wall, and stooped over the corpse and looked down between the bed and the wall—the bed was near to the wall or I should not have pulled it out—I looked down to see if there was any bottle there, and I saw the prisoner lying on his back—I could see him without moving anything—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188707250094"/>
               <p>was in his shirt sleeves; he looked pale; his eyes were partially open—I could see the white of the eye and part of the pupil—I felt his pulse and said "He is alive"—I put my finger on the cornea to see if he was unconscious, and he was—then I slapped him on the face, and he opened his eyes wide—he said nothing to me—I called for police to help me out with him from the corner—one on each side of him took hold of his arms and pulled him out—the bed was pulled round and the prisoner taken round the end; pulled round on the bare floor boards near to the window—I next looked in his mouth and saw he had taken some of the nitric acid; not so much as the woman—after getting him round the bed the police held him up standing—he did not fall down again; they had hold of him—I asked him some questions in English and German, and shook him, but he did not answer—I don't think he could understand what I said to him then—then the police took him away—I had examined his arms and hands to see if there were any scratches; his forearms were bare—I saw there was a little stain of acid on his hands; not much—when I was examining the man on the floor and my back was turned to the bed, Mr. Piper called to me "Here is the bottle"—Mr. Piper then had it in his hand; there was no cork in it—it is a 2-oz. phial—a few drops of the stuff were left, and from those I could tell it was the ordinary nitric acid of commerce; it smelt of that, and I tested it on copper—I made a post-mortem examination next day, the 29th—she was a well-developed woman; six months gone in the family way—I saw no signs of violence on the lower part of the body, and no signs of recent connection—her right eye was discoloured, black and swelled—I noticed a yellow stain at the corner of her mouth—there were no other external injuries—I then cut the scalp and turned it back—I saw over the right temple extravasated blood—the muscle was lacerated and bloody, and in a pulp from violent blows; there must have been more than one blow—I should think at least four blows, and very violent blows, and they were such that they might have been given with a man's fist—the brain was not congested—that does not come on immediately from violent blows; it must have time—she would be rendered unconscious by such blows; she would be stunned—her mouth was injured by the poison; the back of her throat was all charred with the acid—a portion of this stuff had gone into the stomach, and a portion had gone down the larynx and trachea and bronchial tubes, the wind pipe—that would indicate that it had been poured down her throat while she was insensible—the glottis, the covering to the windpipe, was open; in the ordinary course of swallowing that closes, to protect the liquid or food from going the wrong way—the greater portion of the acid appeared to have gone down the windpipe; the approximate amount of stuff used was about half an ounce—her hands were stained with the acid all over the back and front; all over—the cause of death was suffocation produced by the acid acting on the wind<lb/>pipe and closing the passage for the air—it would produce great con<lb/>vulsion of the parts; it would close the windpipe about three minutes after administration—every part of this coat of the prisoner's is marked with the acid—it has the effect of burning away woollen goods—I see one slight stain on Mr. Angel's coat; that might come from resting on the other coat; I could not swear to another stain—the waistcoat is stained with nitric acid, that might come from resting on the other coat—I found no trace of blood on the coat, but on the bed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I attributed at the time the blood on the bed to the woman coughing to get rid of the poison—the post-mortem examination and putting the discharge under the microscope completely convinced me there had been no recent connection; there was no evidence of it—the man was not unconscious from the effect of poison; I attributed it to mental perturbation—he was not very unconscious; a slap roused him—I have seen a woman thrown into such a state from mental causes that I could put my finger on to her cornea without her flinching; I don't remember a man—if a man were in a state of mental perturbation, and had drunk a certain quantity of nitric acid, one would help the other to make him unconscious, but the nitric acid was not sufficient in my opinion to cause unconsciousness—I saw the prisoner about a quarter to 12—I frequently have known a woman remain unconscious from mental causes for two hours in spite of all restoratives, mustard plasters, and ammonia—I have not seen a man unconscious from mental causes—violence would tend to produce unconsciousness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house physician at the London Hospital, and was there when the prisoner was brought there on 28th June—I made some remarks to him in English, which he seemed to understand—I saw on the fingers and finger-nails of his left hand some yellow stains, and on the second joint of the third finger of the right hand a slight stain—they were such stains as would be produced by nitric acid—I noticed some trivial scratches on the backs of both his hands—on the back of the right wrist was a scratch longer than the rest—there were some slight scratches on the forearms—the skin was partially rubbed off both elbows, abraided—there were one or two slight scratches on the forehead, and noteably one on the right temple—I do not think the appearances I saw were indicative of any serious violence of any kind—I examined the mouth and thought the injuries were produced by the application of some corrosive fluid; there were some white patches at the back of the tongue and on the left tonsil, and little white patches on the pharynx—I noticed nothing more about the mouth—I thought those appearances were caused by the action of a corrosive fluid, such as nitric acid—those injuries were not serious in their character—I examined the throat on the outside—I found no marks of violence upon it—there were no marks of violence or of injury on the body beyond those I have given—the injuries on his person were not, in my opinion, such as would prevent a man from crying out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, of 121, Holborn Hill—on Saturday night, 18th June, I left my premises safe about 11 o'clock—a young man, a caretaker, lives on the premises—there are wooden revolving shutters outside my shop, and in one of those is a small opening cut about five inches deep and two inches long, for the police to see down the shop—a hand if it were fiat would go through the opening—I examined the shop on Monday morning—the hole had been cut a trifle larger—there is a very thick plate-glass window, and watches were hanging in the shop just in front of the hole—if a hole were made in the glass just behind the hole in the shutter, and a hand inserted, it could reach a great number of the watches and other articles of value—the hole was 5 feet 5 inches or 5 feet 6 inches above the path outside—we missed nothing—there was blood on the glass, as if fingers had been inside the glass and got cut—I could not see finger marks, but a splash of blood—that was on Monday, about 9 a.m.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Plain clothes City Policeman</hi>). About 3.30 on Sunday morning, 18th July, I was on duty in Charterhouse Street—about 10 minutes past 3 Sergeant Shillocker made a communication to me, in consequence of which I watched the two prisoners—I saw them go round on to the Viaduct by St. Andrews Churchyard and look over the bridge into Shoe Lane—they then went up Holborn by Wallis's. and came down Holborn by Mr. Gamage's shop, back down Charterhouse Street, up the back of the Meat Market—they went back again up Holborn several times backwards and forwards, then they came back to Mr. Gamage's shop about 4.10—I got behind the statue in Holborn Circus, and saw Bryan stand on the edge of the footway opposite Mr. Gamage's shop, 121, Holborn Hill, opposite Mr. Wallis's—Bryan stood on the footway looking up and down, and Gordon looked through the peep-hole in the shutters—I then saw him striking his right hand against his left three times—they then went up Holborn to the urinal in the centre of the street, and came back by Mr. Gamage's shop again—I got the assistance of Mr. Smallman, watchman to Messrs. Wallis—I followed the prisoners down Charterhouse Street and Shoe Lane, up St. Andrew's Street to Holborn Circus—at the corner of Holborn Circus Gordon looked over towards Mr. Gamage's shop window and said something to Bryan which I could not hear, and they walked hurriedly down St. Andrew's Street and St. Bride's Street—I arranged with Smallman to come up and I walked in front of him behind the prisoners in St. Bride Street—I turned and took hold of them and said "I am a police officer, I want you two"—they said "What for?"—I said "For breaking a plate-glass window on Holborn Hill"—Gordon made a desperate kick at my privates, I turned aside and caught it on my knee-cap"—they struggled; Bryan broke away, Smallman chased and caught him in Shoe Lane—the prisoners were conveyed to Snow Hill Police-station—I went back with Shillocker to Mr. Gamage's premises, and in the gutter opposite the shop I found this piece of a small skittle, with fresh stains of blood on the shoulder—I noticed at the station that Gordon's left hand was bleed<lb/>ing profusely and had a handkerchief round it—we rang the caretaker Payne down and measured the broken hole—it was 3.10 when I first saw the prisoners—they broke the window at about 4.10—I watched them loitering about for a whole hour.</p>

I am an engine driver of 11, Dyot Street, St. Giles—on 3rd July I came out of Lincoln's Inn Fields into Great Queen Street about 12.20 p.m.—the prisoner came up to me and knocked me down by getting me by the collar and putting his hand against my chest—he said nothing—it was hardly a blow, but a swing—he rifled my pockets of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, which was in my right waistcoat pocket—he felt</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer and publisher, of 12 and 14, Catherine Street, Strand—up to 4th June last the prisoner was in my employ as canvasser and collector—he was paid 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week salary, and commission for orders he received—his duty was to pay in every day amounts he collected, to myself or my cashier—on 28th February 1 guinea was owing to me by Mr. Tann; that has never been paid me, and has never been accounted for by the prisoner—on 29th April Mr. Fletcher owed me 1 guinea; that has never been paid nor accounted for—on 1st June Miss Hewitt owed me 3 guineas; that has never been accounted for—these are the receipts signed in the prisoner's writing; I got one from Mr. Fletcher and the other from Miss Hewitt—my name is written on the back of this cheque in the prisoner's writing; I never authorised him to write that—it has never been paid to me—I gave him notice, and he left my service on 4th June—I saw. him again on 24th June at the station—I charged him with having embezzled 3 guineas from Miss Hewitt—he said he thought he had paid it to my son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After the prisoner left I told him he would be entitled to full discount for all canvassers who don't receive salary; that was 50 per cent, on all orders—canvassers pay money in directly they get it—I have never known them keep it till next morning unless they kept it altogether—on the Saturday they have a weekly sheet of payments—an account is made up on Saturday of amounts received and paid over—I cannot produce the week sheet for the time that Tann's account ought to have been paid over—I don't profess to keep them, but I have kept some—they are only memoranda—I make up the accounts with my books—I and my cashier balance my books <hi rend="italic">every</hi> day where cash is paid—I see to the balance next day; I look after it myself—I look at everything in the business myself—the cashier enters money received in the cash-book; if he did not and I was on duty I should do so—the prisoner was entitled to deduct his 7 1/2 per cent, commission, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a guinea at the end of the week—he does not deduct it; he gets it—he was entitled to 35 per cent on new orders—he drew money each Saturday—if he told me he wanted 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I should let him have it, and deduct it at the end of the week—I never allowed him to sign my name to letters sent out of the office—I have stopped many of them from doing it—I never allow letters to go out without my signature or that of someone authorised to sign for me—it is the custom of the canvasser to write for orders expecting to get money, and I have to sign my name after their own—every letter was brought to me for inspection before I gave postage for it—the prisoner never signed my name to letters with my knowledge—I</p>

               <p>Terrace, Vicarage Lane, West Ham, when. I gave evidence before the Magistrate; I have since moved—on the afternoon of 2nd July, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in Angel Lane, Stratford, and saw the two prisoners standing outside a draper's shop in conversation, and as I came along they separated, and one went to the entrance of the draper's shop and looked inside, and the other went up to a counterpane hanging outside the shop and gave it a tug, but it would not come down—Wilson then left the entrance of the shop and came back to Usher, and they stood a moment talking—a young girl then came out of the shop and looked round at both prisoners—I walked on a little way and waited a few minutes—both prisoners then turned round and looked at me and said something again—when their backs were turned I ran across the road sharp, and stood on the other side, and while standing there both prisoners looked at the place where I had been standing, and could not see me there because I was opposite—they held a little conversation together again, and then separated, and Wilson crossed the road to the other side and left Usher standing there, and he walked before the draper's shop once or twice, and went towards Mr. Budd's, who is a butcher and tripe-dresser—Wilson walked by on the other side of the road several times, and made motions to Usher, and Usher then walked right by Mr. Budd's shop—he then came back sidling very close to the shop next to the tripe-dresser's—Wilson made an inclination of his head, and Usher looked round the end of the shop and drew back again, put his right foot forward, and took an ox heart down from off the gas-pipe or rail, and put it under his coat—he looked again to Wilson, who laughed—Usher made off down the side of the Lion public-house down Angel Lane—I ran across to tell the butcher, who came across the road with me, and I pointed out Wilson to him—I said "This is the associate that has been making the motions to the one that stole the heart; keep your eye on that man, and perhaps by that means you will find out the other, and don't let him go"—Wilson said "You think you know, you know nothing at all about this matter; who are you? you think you can do anything; I will have a go at you now," and he challenged me to fight—he said to Budd "He thinks he knows a lot about it, take his name and address"—I gave my name and address, and went away—I was going fishing with my two boys—after I got home I was brought to the police-station, and identified Usher and Wilson.</p>

On 2nd July, about 3.30 p.m., I was on duty at West Ham, and received information and went to the Lion public-house, Angel Lane, and saw the prisoners inside; Usher had a quart pot in his hand, he asked Wilson to drink—I called them, they did not come out—I went inside with Budd, who touched them and said he should charge them with stealing a bullock's heart—I asked him how he knew them; he said "A gentleman has pointed them out to me"—the prisoners heard that; Usher said "Let us have a drink"—I asked the prosecutor if he had the gentleman's name and address, he said "Yes," and gave it to me—I took the prisoners and told them they would be charged together, with stealing a heart—Wilson said "I don't know that man," meaning Usher, "I have only been with him half an hour"—on the way to the station Usher said "He has been with me all the afternoon"—Wilson did not contradict that—they were taken to the station.</p>

               <p>not there—I made a thorough search in the iron chest—I have sent for some of the pledges from Mr. Hamblin; I got some of them from him at the prisoner's request—I found that some of the pledges of which I had the tickets at the shop, and entries in the book were at Mr. Hamblin's; they had been received from the prisoner and I got them from Hamblin—the things so obtained were delivered to the people who applied for them—although I went there as manager and receiver, the prisoner remained on the premises until he was taken in custody on 29th June, I think—he was appointed sub-manager and acted under my instructions—he remained on the premises till 28th June—I cannot tell what has become of these articles.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have another order besides this appointing me—I was put in as receiver in the interests of Captain Burnie—I had to render an account to him—I have been there for the last three months to watch the business on behalf of Captain Burnie or his executors—half the profits in the business went to Captain Burnie's estate; that was the arrange<lb/>ment come to between the prisoner and Hamblin; the other half went to Mr. Hamblin—after the prisoner was in custody Mr. Hamblin offered to bring the iron safe, containing a quantity of pledges, to the pawnbroker's house—the articles were deposited with him as security; I objected to that arrangement—from time to time I have advanced money to the prisoner to redeem 40 or 50. pledges from Hamblin—when a person has produced a ticket and I have not got the article I have advanced the prisoner the money, together with half the interest, and he has gone to Hamblin and got it, and then he has returned the pledge to me, and I have kept it until the party has come for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The 40 pledges I spoke of were cases where people came to the shop with their tickets and money and wanted their articles—some of those people came half a dozen times, and then I not having the things they could not have them—ultimately I have advanced the money to the prisoner out of the till that he might get from Mr. Hamblin the property back—at times the prisoner has got them himself out of his own pocket; there has been no transaction with me then as regards half interest—Mr. Hamblin was to have half interest—when he gave up property which had been given him as security for his debt he shared the interest with the prisoner and with Burnie's estate—the prisoner had a weekly salary; only a nominal sum—this extended from 1st April up to the time he was taken into custody—the safe removed from the premises was Mr. Hamblin's.</p>

I am a tin plate worker, of 46, Adam Street, New Kent Road—on 21st June I was in the Crown and Anchor public-house, New Kent Road, with the prisoner—he and I had been out during the day—after we had been in the house about 10 minutes the deceased man William Sault came in—we had a van with us, and he and his friends took some boughs off the van and slashed them about—there was then a sort of disturbance, and the prisoner and Sault had some angry words, and Sault stripped off his coat and vest and challenged the prisoner to fight—they went outside and fought, and I saw the prisoner strike Sault on his face, and he fell on the back of his head—I only saw him fall once—he remained on the ground after he fell—while he laid on the ground the prisoner kicked him in the upper part round his chest; I am quite sure of that—I got assistance, and carried Sault to Dr. Payne, but he was not in, and when he was conveyed home about 9.30 he was unconscious—I saw him again on the Wednesday morning, and he was still unconscious.</p>

I am a shoe-black, of 46, North Street, Walworth—On 21st June I was in the Crown and Anchor, and saw Sault and others coming home with their van about 7.30; the wagonette had not come up at that time—a man named Fox came out first and challenged the men, and then Sault came out and took Fox round the waist and carried him up as far as the urinal; then he came back and took off his things and challenged the best man in the company, who had come up in the wagonette, to fight—the prisoner was there, and Sault took hold of his vest and pulled him right outside and struck him in his face the moment he got out—they then had two rounds, a fair stand-up fight in the road, and in the first round the deceased fell with his back on the shafts of a small trap standing there—another round was then fought and Knight hit him somewhere about the face and he fell, and never moved till he was lifted up by the van boy.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was taller than the prisoner but not quite so stout; I daresay if he had hit the prisoner he would have given strong blows—except in self-defence I did not see the prisoner strike any blow—I am quite sure that the prisoner never kicked him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at Guy's Hospital when this happened—the deceased was brought there on the 24th, about the middle of the day; he had then been dead a few minutes—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination; there was a bruise at the back of the head and a fracture on the left side of the skull which had laid open one of the arteries, and there was a clot on the left side of the brain, and also bruising of the brain on both sides—there was the mark of an old bruise on the left side of the chest, but no recent bruising—the cause of death was pressure of the clot of blood on the brain, which was caused from the wound of the artery, which was caused by the fracture of the skull—the other membranes were healthy—I did not see Dr. Payne.</p>
