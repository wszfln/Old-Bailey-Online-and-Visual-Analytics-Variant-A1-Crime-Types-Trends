I said, "Do you think I have done any thing?" he said, "I think you know the party." I said, "If you think so, give me in charge;" the policeman took us both; he was very reluctant in doing so, the man being drunk. Next morning, seeing the prosecutor in different clothes, I said, "Are you the man that was robbed?" he said, "Yes, I would not blame any girl for robbing a gentleman, but it is a shame to rob any body in my situation; if I had a sovereign back, I would not prosecute you, as it may disgrace me in my situation."

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at No. 14, Swan-street, Minories. On Thursday night, the 7th of April, between eight and nine o'clock, I was at the corner of the Minories, and saw the prisoner and an<lb/>other man following several gentlemen—I had suspicion, and followed them to Leadenhall-street, where they followed two gentlemen, who were walking arm-in-arm, and crossing over by the East India Company's ware-house, I saw the prisoner take a handkerchief from one of the two gentle<lb/>men's coat-pocket—I do not know his name—he retraced his steps—the gentleman proceeded a few yards, put his hand into his pocket, and turned round—the prisoner then crossed over towards Billiter-street—I went up and secured him till a policeman arrived—he dropped the handkerchief at my side—I cannot swear this is the same handkerchief, but I saw him draw something from the gentleman's pocket, which appeared to be a hand<lb/>kerchief—the one he dropped has two initials upon it—I was on the other side of the street, but opposite to him—I suppose the street is twelve yards wide—I could not discern the colour of the handkerchief distinctly—I had my eye on the prisoner, and the gentleman went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business on my own account at Worcester. I was formerly in the service of Messrs. Wynn, Ellis, and Mr. Everington—there are three partners—on the 22nd of April last my department was at the Manchester silk counter—that counter is close to the door in St. Paul's Churchyard—Amos was at that time one of the porters—there were some piles of silk in the piece called Gross de Naples on the counter, close by the door—it is the practice of the house to mark goods of that kind in pencil—this piece of silk produced is marked "No. 19"—it is Messrs. Ellis and Everington's property—there are 97 1/2 yards of it—it is not an en<lb/>tire piece by about ten or twelve yards—it has been cut, which, as well as the mark, enables me to identify it—if it had been sold it would have passed through the books in account—I have examined to see if it has done so, and it has not—there is no such thing—the books are here—it is a very unusual thing for a wholesale house to have a piece cut off—I cannot tell when the piece was cut off—there is a small green mark on the silk, which I recollect very well—every entire piece of goods that comes to our place, has the manufacturer's ticket on it—the usual length of an entire piece it from 108 to 112 yards—there has been about as much as would amount to a dress taken from it—I have since examined the goods in the warehouse for the purpose of finding the piece from whence the dress was cat off—I have not been able to find it.</p>

About half-past six o'clock, on the morning of the 28th of April, the prisoner came to our house and asked if I would trust her with some gin—I would not—she staid a few minutes, and I missed a glass—she went out, I followed her, and saw a policeman—this is the glass I missed—it is my master's.</p>

On Friday, the 29th of April, I was on duty at Turnham-green, and saw the prisoner—I called out to him by his name, Manning—he said hit name was not Manning, but Fearce—I told him I was sure that was his wrong name—I knew him personally, and had a warrant out against him for stealing plants—I told him I should take him into custody on the warrant—be said he would not go with me—I took hold of him by the collar of his coat, and he flung me down and got upon me—I got up again and he ran away—I took up my staff and struck him with it—he then told roe he would come with me quietly—he came about twenty yards, and then went into a garden, which he had come out of, and where he was at work—he then took up a stick and struck me in the forehead with it—I used my staff as well as I could—he then hit me on the body, legs, and arms, with the stick, and told me he would kill me—he then struck me on the head, cut my head, knocked me down, and ran away—I got up and followed him across the garden, over the wall to the water side, where he was stopped by Wakeman, and taken to the station—Mr. Pickering, the surgeon, attended me—the warrant against the prisoner is in the hands of the constable—he is not here—I had had it in my hand, and read it—I also had verbal directions to take him, from the inspector—it was not in my possession when this occurred.</p>

About four o'clock on Friday, the 15th of April, I was in the shop—Lawrence came in, and requested to look at some watches, I showed him some—he selected four—I showed him some chains also—he selected four chains also—I put the watches in a small bag, and tied the chains up in paper—I was about to pack them altogether in brown paper, when he produced a box, and wished to have them put into it—after they were packed up, Lawrence went out of the shop—he returned, and two or three minutes afterwards Wasserman came in—he asked for a 1. brooch, which was marked in the window—I turned to get the brooch down, and while Wasserman was paying for the brooch, Lawrence got up, and went out—immediately Wasserman had paid for the brooch, be got up, and went out also—I opened the box, and found the box produced had been substituted for the one the watches had been put into—I ran out immediately, and secured Wasserman, brought him back to the shop, and gave him into the custody of an officer—on the Monday following Lawrence was brought to our shop—some copper coins were substituted in the other box, in place of the four watches and chains—the value of the watches is about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the guards 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw them safe just before Wasserman came in—the boxes must have been changed while I was taking the brooch down—I did not see them changed—the prisoners did not appear to know each other—about two minutes after Wasserman had gone, I saw that some<lb/>thing was wrong—no one had been in but the prisoners—when I took Wasserman I told him I wanted him—he asked what for—I said he must inquire of some one else—I called for an officer, and gave him into custody—I am sure the prisoners are the two men that came in on that occasion.</p>

Caldecot and Company, and found Wasserman had been there—it was addressed to Mr. Lawrence, No. 1, Curzon-street, May-fair—the property has never been found.</p>

On Monday, 28th March, I was going across Long-lane, and saw a man offering the horse for sale; knowing that Wooster wanted one, I told the man I knew a person in Whitecross-street who would buy it, but he would not be at home until the next morning; he said he would put the pony up at the Golden Lion, St. John-street, which he did; I asked him-where he lived; he said at the Falcon, Stanmore, and that his name was Charles Miles; that the pony belonged to his father, and the reason they were going to sell it was, that they were not allowed to keep it in the farm because the gentleman was come home; he then went into the Bull's Head and asked the landlord to write "Charles Miles, Falcon, Stanmore," which the officer has produced; he gave it to me, and said be would pay me for my trouble, if I would go with him next morning. On Tuesday morning, about ten o'clock, I met the man in Smithfield, and we went to Wooster's together; I said to Wooster, "Here is a man has got a pony for sale, I think it will suit you;" we all went together to the inn; the man brought the pony out of the stable and ran it down the yard three or four times. Wooster said to the man "What do you want for it?" he said, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said that was too much; he said, "What will you give?" he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the man said, "You may give me another crown, for I am to pay that man for his trouble."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 12, New-street Hill. I was formerly in the police—I have had a great many cases of this description here—on Saturday, afternoon, 7th of May, about half-past six o'clock I was on Hol<lb/>born-hill, and saw a gentleman going up the hill, and the two prisoners following him—M'Carty laid hold of his coat-pocket, took out a handker<lb/>chief, and gave it to Connell, who tucked it in his trowsers pocket—it was raining very hard at the time—I looked up and down the hill to see if I could see the policeman that was on that beat—I at last saw him standing under Union-court gateway—I ran and told him—I then followed the prisoners to the corner of Hatton-garden, and gave them into custody to the policeman—in going to the station, I followed behind, and saw Connell slip the handkerchief out of his trowsers-pocket, and <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it in a door<lb/>way in King-street—I do not know who the gentleman was—I tried to speak to him, but lost sight of him while speaking to the policeman.</p>

On the 4th of April I missed two Venetian and one red Turkey morocco skins from the back room where the apprentice-boys sleep—I received some information, in consequence of which I accompanied George Cheeseman, a leather-seller, about three days after I missed my pro<lb/>perty, to a shop in Little Earl-street, Seven-dials, kept by Collins—we found three of the skins I had lost—these produced are them—they are mine—when I went in they were on the counter—she deals in what are called pieces of skins, of various colours and all descriptions—I examined the skins, and knew them perfectly—Collins was not there when we went in—she came in afterwards, and we accused her of buying the skins know<lb/>ing them to be stolen—she was asked who she bought them of—she said she bought them of an Irish woman—she was asked if she knew her—she said she did not, she never saw her before—she first of all said she had given 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—her son contradicted her, and said, "No, mother, you gave 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—she then recollected herself, and said we were wel<lb/>come to take the skins away, or something of that kind—the officer asked her if she had entered them in a book—she said no, she had not—the officer afterwards came to my house, and made a little inquiry—the next morning Collins's son came down and identified M'Carthy as the person that had sold the skins—she denied it—search was made in my presence in the kitchen, and two skins were found under a box at the bottom of a standing-press against the kitchen wall—they were my skins which I had missed—the skins now produced are mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Harlington, Middlesex. On the 12th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking with my daughter Harriet Julia from Harlington to Hounslow along the road—I saw the two prisoners sitting on the edge of the path, with their feet over the dry ditch—I walked along the path, and when we got near them, the prisoner Wil<lb/>liam arose, and asked the other to come on—the other said he was not ready—he was in the act of lacing his boot, and a piece of bent wire or hook laid by him—William took the hook up, and said, "Come along"—Joseph said, "I am not ready to come"—I went on, and patted Joseph, sitting on the bank, and came up to William—he turned round, and asked me to give him some halfpence to help him on the road—I said I had none—he said, "I must have some money"—he then snatched at the child's bag, which hung on her arm, but did not get it from her—he got hold of it—I think it tightened on her arm—he laid hold of her arm, and drew her towards himself, from me, and she fell down—I struggled to save her, and in doing so was thrown down myself—I screamed "Murder," and then ran away with the child—I do not know whether any body followed me—the next thing I am conscious of was finding the child hang heavily on my arm—on turning round I observed the prisoners on the path—William had a atone in his hand, and said, "Murder? ay, I'll murder you;" (not meaning to murder me, but as a threat at my having called "Murder")—I do not know that they had thrown the stone—some carts were coming towards us, and they both, ran away—Joseph did nothing whatever to me—they ran away together—I had never seen them before.</p>

I will murder you," and took up a stone and threw it, but it did not hit her—I saw Joseph get up, take up a stone, and have it in his hand—William put his arm up to prevent his throwing it, and he did not throw it—Joseph said, "If I had been in your place I would have made her halloo louder."</p>

                  </hi>. I am twelve years old, and live with my mother, in Parker-street, Drury-lane. The prisoner lived in the next room to my mother—on Saturday, the 23rd of April, about three o'clock in the after<lb/>noon, the prisoner told me to get her a pint of beer, and half-a-pint of gin—I went, and she gave me some gin—I afterwards went into my mother's room—the prisoner went down stairs, then came up, and called me—I went into her room again, and she locked the door, told me to sit down, and said, "Pour the gin out, and drink"—I said, "No, you drink first"—she drank, and then I drank—she said, "Pull off your handkerchief, for fear it should choke you"—she was drunk—I took my handkerchief off, and drank the gin—she then gave me a halfpenny to go and get some Pease pudding, which I got, and came back—she told me to sit down again—I said, "Will you have a bit?"—she said, "No, eat it yourself," which I did—she said, "Get the bread and butter out of the cupboard, I will cut you some," which I did—she told me to cut it for myself—I cut it, and just after I swallowed the last bit, she said, "I want to speak to you"—I went to her—she laid hold of me by the shoulder, and cut ray cheek—she got up—I pushed her back by the fire-place, ran to the door, and then she cut my throat with a razor—she was very drunk at the time—I had given her no offence—she only said, "I want to speak to you"—she had a pipe in her mouth all the time—I was carried to King's College hospital—here is the mark on my cheek, and on my throat.</p>

               <p>he had been having something to drink, and scolded him for it—the pri<lb/>soner came and said, "Don't scold him, he is a good little boy, and don't deserve scolding"—I said, "I am very angry with him, and not best pleased with you, Ellen"—presently she came and asked if I would allow him to fetch her a pint of beer—I said, "Yes"—he went out—I afterwards heard a terrible scream from my boy, I ran to the door, and found it fast—I shook the door, and said "Open the door"—the child opened it at last—I saw the razor at the child's throat, and her arm round his waist—she had the razor—she was at the child's throat, as if in the act of cutting it then, and he was bleeding tremendously—I screamed and put the razor back with my hand—I flung her away, pulled the child to me, took my handkerchief, end bound it round the wound—I called out, and people came to my assistance—the wound was sewn up at home, and he was carried to the hospital.</p>

I live in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane—the prisoner was a globe colourer, and worked in Chancery-lane—a long while ago I missed a cloth cloak—the prisoner was at that time working on the premises. On Thursday, the 7th of April, I went into the shop where he works, and saw a cloak hanging on a peg where he generally hangs his hat—I thought it resembled the one I had lost, which induced me to look at it, and there were sufficient marks to enable me to swear to it—I said it was my cloak—the prisoner said at first it was not, but soon after he said he hoped I would forgive him for this, it was the only thing he had taken—this is my cloak, and the one I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Richard Attenborough, a pawn<lb/>broker, in Crown-street, Finsbury. About half-past six o'clock on Mon<lb/>day evening, the 11th of April, the prisoner came to our shop with another man—they wished to look at a pair of trowsers, which were taken down and shown them—they did not purchase them, and left the shop—shortly afterwards I heard an altercation between the shopman and the prisoner at the door—I went out, and saw a roll of silk waistcoating sticking partly out of the prisoner's pocket and partly under his coat—it had been hanging up inside the shop pinned to a piece of cotton—I collared the prisoner, and took him behind the counter—he was very violent, resisted, and tried to make his escape over the counter—I charged him with stealing the silk—he said he did not take it—we sent for a policeman—when he found he could not get away, he took a pair of shears out of his pocket, and said the first person that offered to take him he would stab them—I and three fel<lb/>low-shopmen closed it on him, and held him till an officer came and took him.</p>

About half-past six o'clock in the evening, on the 16th of March, the prisoner came to my shop, in the uniform of the police of the Eastern Counties Railway Company—I had seen him on duty there, and knew him as an inspector of their police—he came to me in a hurried manner, and said, "Mr. Hall requests you will send a sample of your best silver watches, with the lowest tender, as it is their intention to supply the police on the line with silver watches; you are to send a sample with the price you will do them at"—he told me to seal them up, and direct them to Richard Hall, Esq., Carnarvon Hall, Essex—I gave him four watches, all different, for the purpose of being shown as samples—I did not consider they were sold—I thought one would, be selected, and an order given perhaps for a dozen—they were invoiced at 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but they were ticketed higher—I enclosed the invoice in the parcel to Mr. Hall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Upper Whitecross-street, and am a boot and shoemaker. The prisoner has been in the habit of coming to our shop for seven or eight years, and sometimes stopped an hour or two, or three hours—when out of work he would come and work for me for two or three hours—I cannot say whether he was at my house on the 5th of October, as he was so frequently there—I have lost boots and shoes daily when he has come, and I gave orders for him not to come again, but he did come—I went to a pawnbroker's from information, and there found this pair of boots, which I can identify as mine—I have missed such, and the prisoner had an opportunity of taking these.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, living in Bennett's-gardens, Bell-street, Hackney—the prisoner lived at the back of my house. On Tuesday, the 12th of April, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I saw him in my front garden, lurking about outside the washhouse—when he saw me, he walked away—I said nothing to him—I had a copper fixed in brick-work inside the washhouse—I saw it safe at six o'clock at night—there were two gallons of water in the copper, and a glass bottle—the washhouse was covered with lead—the next morning, I got up about six o'clock, and saw part of the lead was gone from the top of the washhouse, and missed the copper—I have never seen the copper or lead again—this is my bottle that was in the copper—I know it by a mark inside, caused by some oil stand<lb/>ing in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter, and live with him in Bennett's-yard. On Wednesday, the 13th of April, I saw some lead in the washhouse between eleven and twelve o'clock my father told me to carry it away—he put it into a basket—I took it past Lady Frampton's house, which is a little way from my father's—my father came after me, took the basket from me, and told me to go home—I did not, but followed him as far as Cambridge Heath-gate—I then missed him, and went home—I had been in my father's washhouse the night before, and saw no piece of lead there then—I found this glass bottle in the washhouse—my father saw it, and told me to carry it up stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant overseer of the parish of St. Marylebone. The prisoner was a pauper in the Union-house some months before the 3rd of April last—I ascertained from him that he had been an attorney's clerk, and I employed him a considerable time in the office as a copying clerk—I did not give him any wages—on the 3rd of April we had a family chargeable to the parish, which we wished to remove to Leatherhead—I provided a conveyance to take them to Leatherhead, and gave the pri<lb/>soner instructions to start with them early on the Monday morning, to de<lb/>liver the papers to the overseers at Leatherhead, and to get an abandonment of the order of removal signed by the proper officers there—I furnished him with a bill of 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at the same time telling him not to wait unless the amount was immediately paid, but to come back—I anthorized him to re<lb/>ceive the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and bring it back to me—this is the bill I gave to the prisoner—it is in my own handwriting, besides which I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to provide the family with a little refreshment on the road, and what he could save out of it for himself he might keep—that was quite distinct from the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had no authority to keep that—I provided a person to drive the cart—the cart came back about twelve o'clock the same night with the driver—the prisoner arrived about three quarters of an hour afterwards the worse for liquor—I asked him for the papers, which he gave me—I said, "Have they paid you the money?"—he said, "No, but the overseer will send it you in a few days"—the master of the workhouse ordered him to bed—I do not know whether he did go—I left the house then—he left the workhouse next morning—I inquired for him at the office at ten o'clock, and found he had been sent out by the master, and finding he did not re<lb/>turn as he should, I discharged him from the house—I believe he was not there again—I never saw him till the 16th, when he applied to me fur the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to enable him to purchase a coat—that sum had been ordered to him by the Board of Guardians in February last—he said he had a situation, and wanted the coat to enable him to go to it—on that occasion I said to him, "Keene, what have you done with the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—he said, "What 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>?"—I said, "You must be aware that by this time I have written to Leatherhead, and I have a copy of the bill and receipt now in my possession"—he said, "I have never received the money," on which I gave him into custody—he had never accounted</p>

                  </hi>. In April last I was overseer for the parish of Leatherhead, in Surrey. On the 4th of that month the prisoner came to me with a family from Marylebone—I consented to receive them—he presented this bill to me, together with another paper, and said, "I am requested to produce these to you from Mr. Messer"—I said, "Very well, I will sign the other paper and this, and send you up the money in the course of a few days"—he then pointed out to me that the bill being al<lb/>ready receipted, not doubting but what we should find it right, and pay it immediately, he of course could not leave it unless I paid him the money—I made enquiries of the paupers, and after that I gave the prisoner a sover<lb/>eign, and he returned me half-a-crown out of it—he then left me this paper—(<hi rend="italic">the receipt upon this paper was as follows: "April</hi> 3, 1842, <hi rend="italic">Received the above for J. J. Messer, assistant overseer,</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">W. H. KEENE</hi>")—I paid the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the prisoner for the Directors and Guardians of Marylebone—he brought the receipt ready written—it is dated the day before—he told me it was his own handwriting.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When Mr. Messer gave me the account to receive the 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., he said if the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not enough to pay the expences, I could take some of that money and account to him. I have the account made out how the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was expended. My expences came to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which made me press Mr. Billinghurst for the money, not having sufficient without. I perhaps took a little too much, and when I got back the master of the workhouse ordered me to be locked up in a cell, and next morning sent me out to look for the horse and cart, which all the while was in their own possession. I said I did not know where to look for it; he said if I returned without it he would have me transported, for making away with it, and I was afraid to return to the house on that account. I admit that when Mr. Messer asked me if I had received the balance I said I had not, but I only intended to retain it till the morning, and then make out the account, but no opportunity was given me of doing so. I had no inten<lb/>tion of appropriating the money to my own use.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About nine o'clock on Thurs<lb/>day morning, the 14th of April, I was at the Lamb public-house, in Kingsland-road—I saw the prisoner Mitchell drive up in a cart which was loaded with sacks, apparently containing potatoes—the other two prisoners were inside the house—when Mitchell drove up they went out—some conversation passed between the three—the cart was then driven into the yard, and the gates were shut—in about ten minutes they all three came into the house together—they then said, "Let us go and do it now," and they all three went out—I had some suspicion, went out, and looked through the chinks in the gates into the yard—I saw Mitchell and Phil<lb/>lips in the cart, untying the sacks and taking some potatoes out into a high basket, which is here—Burberry was standing by the side of the cart with this flat basket on his head, into which the other prisoners emptied their basket—he then carried it into the stable—I saw one of my brother-constables pass, gave him information, and we took the prisoners into custody.</p>

There were silver spoons in the room, and the bar contained money; there was a hatchet I could have used, got the door open, and got the money and silver spoons; I certainly did take the coats when I came down at six o'clock, but it is entirely the prosecutor's fault; it is his duty to see whe<lb/>ther his windows are shut or not.

I was in King-street, Soho, on the morning of the 10th of April, about three o'clock, and saw three men standing together close to the bar-parlour shutter of Belk's house—they were all three together at first—I saw them separate, and Barrett standing at the front door of the same house, and the two prisoners standing by the shutters—I watched them, and went from King-street into Grafton-street, and staid there—I was then about twenty yards from Mr. Belk's house—I saw them very busy at the shutters—I thought they were trying to get them open—after some time I saw the two shutters open, while they were there, and heard two panes of glass break, one after the other—I then saw them close them again—I kept watching, till a gentleman crossed out of Monmouth-street into Grafton-street, and I left the place to tell him to fetch assistance—I returned in two minutes—I had left the two men at the shutters, and the other standing at the door—when I came back I missed one of the men at the window, and saw one at the front door, and one at the window—the other was out of sight—as soon as my brother constable came up I turned my head to speak to him for about two minutes—I then saw the one at the front door and the two at the shutters again—I told my brother constable to come with me—we went across the road towards them—Connell, No. 136, came up at the time, and got in between the three of them—I told him to secure Stillman, which he did, at the door, and I was going to take Able—he tried to escape—I followed him into Green-street, Leicester-square, where he was taken by Metcalf—I lost sight of him in turning the corner—when I got round the corner I found him in custody—there was only one gentleman in the street then—Able was run<lb/>ning when he turned the corner—I knew him again, having seen him be<lb/>fore—I knew him by sight, and am certain he is one of the men I had seen at the window shutter—I brought him back to the house, searched him, and found in his trowsers pocket a clasp knife, a purse, and four duplicates—the knife had the point of it broken off—I went to the shop window,</p>

               <p>tried the shutters, and found they were loose—on pulling them they both came open—two panes of glass were broken, and the window was thrown up—Harwood got in at the window.</p>

I was on duty in Green-street—I heard a rattle springing, and saw Able running out of Castle-street into Green-street, round the corner—I stopped him—there was a gentleman running after him, crying, "Stop thief"—Sheppard came up shortly after—when I took Able, he was near an area—I heard something fall from him, which rattled, and fell down into the area—at the same time a penny-piece dropped on the pavement—I said, "You have dropped something down the area as well"—he said, "It is my money"—I took him back, and gave him into custody—after<lb/>wards I went back to the area, and found a gimlet, which I have tried to a hole in Mr. Belk's shutters—it exactly fits it.</p>

On Monday morning, the 25th of April, at five o'clock, he came to our house and asked me for a light—I told him to take one, which he did, and then went out—I went out and shut the door after me quite safe—it is a false latch, and when shut would seem as if it was locked—there are two latches to it—anybody knowing the way of the door, by putting in a bit of stick, could open it—when I went out I left the prisoner walking up and down the road—my father was in the house in bed up stairs, in the back room, and nobody else in the house; before I went out I had occasion to go to the drawer in the front-room, and touched the trowsers—I saw them in the drawer—I am certain these now produced are them—I know them quite well by seeing them so often, and they are not finished at the bottom—my father made them for my brother, but did not finish them, as he did not know the length—on the Tuesday when my brother returned home he missed his trowsers—I was not present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Jocelyn, who keeps the Red Lion public-house, Basinghall-street. On the evening before Good Friday I remember two persons coming into my house whose appearance attracted my attention—the prisoner Reynolds came in, looked round, and said, "It is all right," to a little man who was close behind him—the little man named Potts, had a bundle on his arm, and gave it into the prisoner's hand—it was a good sized bundle tied up in a dark shawl with a narrow border—I should say not wider than this—(<hi rend="italic">shewing her finger</hi>)—I cannot say what was in it—they laid it down with great care, as I thought, as if there was something brittle in it—they did not sit down—the prisoner turned to the little man and asked what he would have—he said a little drop of beer—he had half a pint, and the prisoner had three-halfpennyworth of gin, which he drank with his left hand—he never moved his right hand at all—they stopped a very few minutes—he said to the little man that he was very tired—the little man asked him to sit down—he said no, he was on very unpleasant business to-day, and he was afraid he must have some more, and would make the best of his way home, as he had some things to sell in the morning—the prisoner went out at the London-wall door, carrying the bundle in his left hand—he took it off the seat in front of the bar, and went away with it—the little man opened the door for him.</p>

               <p>with a velvet collar—the policeman first came to me about the middle of last month—he merely asked me if I remembered any thing that happened on the 24th of March—I said, "That was Thursday fortnight"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Let me alone"—I went into my bar parlour, and asked myself a few questions—I went to look at my book, and I had good reason to remember that night, for that evening somebody went into my tap-room and stole three brass knobs off a kitchen range—that was the day be<lb/>fore Good Friday—when I came out I told him I recollected you and a little man—he said, "What sort of dress"—I described it—he said, "Have you any objection to come up and see if it is the same man?"—I said, "Not the least"—I came and picked you out of a score of people—I noticed your taking the bundle with your left hand—I saw how it was put down—I suspected you of doing wrong, you looked about and seemed to have your eye over every body—you looked with suspicion at every body, and I had suspicion of you from your manner—my husband has kept the house seventeen years—the little man had a very shabby hat and dress—I cannot say what was in the bundle—I did not see the time-piece sticking out of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was at Godwin's trial—at that time nothing was known of the prisoner with any certainty—I remem<lb/>ber his name being mentioned in the course of the trial—I knew him, and in consequence of what passed I and other policemen endeavoured to find him—I succeeded in finding him out on the 14th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, at No. 8, Collyer-place, Collyer-street, Pen<lb/>tonville, in a house by himself—there was nothing but an old chair in the house—I know his wife, she lives at No. 1, Paradise-street, King's-cross—I went to her house once to look for him, but could not find him—she was living there—when I found him in the empty house, I told him I wanted him for a robbery of Mrs. Lewis, in Silver-street, which Godwin was convicted of—he said he knew nothing about it—I told him it was for stealing a time-piece and cloak along with Godwin—he said what was Godwin to him—he had put Godwin into a good thing, if Godwin bad known how to make it out—making it out that Godwin did not know how to go on with it—he said he did not deny but what he was with Godwin at Mrs. Lewis's that evening, but Godwin had taken away the time-piece and cloak, what was that to him.</p>

I declare solemnly I never was in the house, and never saw the little man in my life, and he positively denies bringing me the bundle; he was locked up because he would not say he brought it to me, as they wished; if he did, must he not have received it knowing</p>

It has been said I went there and put some metal on the woman's premises, then sent Godwin there to get it, merely to entrap him, to transport him; now it is proved I did not bring any bundle in, or she must have seen it, which fully proves the falsehood of the report; the trial is to convict me, to get a commuta<lb/>tion of his sentence, but the prosecutrix proves he robbed her on the way to the station; I wish to call Leigh Wood, the City policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Cox's-square, Houndsditch. On the 6th of April, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I went into a beer-shop in the Fulham-road—I had a bundle, containing some shawls, with me—I called for a pint of beer, and afterwards for another pint—Mrs. Salmon and another woman were in the bar—I was there about half. an-hour—I was tired, and said to Mrs. Salmon, "Can you tell me where I can get a lodging?"—she said, "I can accommodate you with a good lodg<lb/>ing, you can sleep here"—I left my bundle in her possession, went into the tap-room, and dozed for about five or ten minutes—I then went to the bar<lb/>again, and saw my bundle—I thought it felt different—I opened it, missed four shawls, and said, "Mrs. Salmon, I am robbed, and nobody has robbed me but you"—she said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I took out the four papers the shawls had been wrapped in—Mrs. Salmon directly took and threw them on the fire—I said, "I am a poor man, give me my pro<lb/>perty back again, and I won't hurt you"—she said, "I know nothing at all about it"—in about ten minutes another woman, who was in her com<lb/>pany at the time, and M'Cormack, came in—they called me a b foreign I b——, and the other woman gave me two slaps on the mouth, which I had I the marks of for a week—I said to Salmon, "Look how I am served; I am robbed, and beat into the bargain"—she said, "Serve you right, why I say you were robbed? you were never robbed in your life"—in about fire minutes in came her husband—he said, "What is the row?"—she said, "This foreigner says he is robbed; he has drunk three pints of beer, and won't pay me; and I won't give him his bundle up, because he has no money"—I had no money—I had paid 2 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave her a pin for the rest—her husband said, "What is the matter?"—she said so and so—he said, "Why don't you <hi rend="italic">split</hi>? then you are clear"—she would not say—another woman said, "That woman next door"—I went to one police-man, but be would not take the charge—I got another policeman, told him what had happened, and we went next door, where M'Corroack lives—she was with Mrs. Salmon when I gave her my bundle to take care of, and another woman too—we went up stairs into M'Cormack's room, and the policeman found one of my shawls under the bed—she was down stairs at the time—I directly gave her in charge—she said she knew nothing at all about it—it was very lucky there were two policemen to protect me, I might have been killed, for in about a quarter of an hour there were more than thirty women round me.</p>

On the 20th of April I put some pieces of cloth away in a bundle—on the 24th I missed them—I suspected the prisoner—on the Monday morning when I went into the shop I found him with his hat on ready to go—he said, "I am up before you this morning"—I said, "Yes, and so you were on Saturday morning, I suppose"—he said, "No, I was not"—I attended to my work—in about half an hour he said, "Well, I think we had better have a <hi rend="italic">tussell</hi> to get the street-door open"—I had locked it to prevent his going—I said, "Very well," and directed my mother to call a policeman—I returned to the shop—the prisoner said, "You had better open that street-door, or else I will make you"—I said, "You will?"—he said, "Yes, I will upset you in about two minutes"—I bolted him in, he began kicking as hard as he could, and got something to wrench the door</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pot-man, at the Baker and Basket, in Worship-street, Shoreditch. On the evening of the 25th of April, the prosecutor and prisoner were in my master's tap-room—the prose<lb/>cutor was sitting at a table drunk, and the prisoner was sitting oppo<lb/>site to him—the prosecutor put his hand into his pocket, took out some silver, and put it on the table—the prisoner was reading the paper at the time—he passed it over to the prosecutor with his right hand, picked up the money with his left, and went out at the door with it—he afterwards returned and drank some beer, and went out again—I followed, and asked if he knew the prosecutor—he said he did not—I asked where the money was which he had taken off the table—he said at first he had not got it—he then took out 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and threw them down on the tap-room table, and said that was all, and he had picked them up—the prosecutor took them up and put them into his pocket—the prisoner was searched in the tap-room, and some silver and halfpence found on him, but no sovereigns—I am sure I saw him take up some silver—there was more than 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the table—I saw half-a-crown amongst it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in St. James's-walk, Clerkenwell. About five minutes to seven o'clock in the morning of the 6th of May I was in Harrison-street—I saw Jones standing with his back to an area—I leant over, and saw Melvine down in the area, about to secrete some bread, which he had tied up in a handkerchief—he came up, I seized him, a policeman coming up with Jones, and I gave him into custody—Jones ran away as soon as I called out—the policeman stopped him, and brought him back—they were both taken to the station-house—this rope-ladder was hanging down the area.</p>

I did not see him again after parting with him till I was standing in Harrison-street; the man came up and asked me what the rope did down there. I said I did not know.

The prosecutor was in a bad state of dirt and filth, and was cut in the face and hands. I stood looking at him, and after that Livermore came up I said, "Charlotte, look at that poor old man, he has been drinking these four days at the Wheatsheaf." I said, "Bring a cloth and wipe his face;" he went in, and Tyler soon after came in, and asked him to send for a drop of beer; he went for a pot; he dropped sixpence out of his pocket. Tyler picked it up; he behaved in an indecent manner to me and Livermore. I went out and went home. I stole no money; my money that I had was given to me in the fields.</p>

                  </hi>. Previous to and on the 8th of March I was a pri<lb/>soner in the Fleet. the elder prisoner lived in the room exactly opposite to roe—the other prisoner is his son—the elder prisoner was in the habit of coming into my room frequently—his room is what is called a <hi rend="italic">whistling-shop,</hi> where people can get any thing to drink, a sort of canteen, and where now and then you can dine, to save the trouble of employing servants about the place—my room is No. 10, in the Coffee-gallery—I hired the room of Mr. Shepherd, one of the turnkeys—I was the sole occupier of it—previous to this Clark had a piano-forte standing in my room, and other things, and from his coming there he had the opportunity of seeing the position of dif<lb/>ferent articles in my room—no other person had the same kind of general access to my room—a few days before the 8th of March I lent him a couple of sovereigns, which he paid me again—on the 8th of March I left my room, about a quarter after nine o'clock at night, and locked it—it was considerably after the prison gates had been closed for the night—about a week or ten days before the robbery I was in the prisoner's room, and heard him and another man conversing about cashing bills, and I acci<lb/>dentally said to the prisoner, "Why, if I had known you cashed bills, I should have got a bill cashed some time ago, which I have had done since I have been here"—he asked me the amount—I said 66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then asked him what per centage he asked—he said 50 per cent.—I said I had had mine done for the regular per centage—when I left my room on the 8th of March I left a leather coat-bag and my writing-desk on the portmanteau in the room—there was a small German clock—the writing-case contained two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and other things much more valuable to me than money, documents, securities, and correspondence—I locked the padlock of my door, and put the key into my pocket—there was no other lock to the door—I went along the Coffee-gallery, up the stairs leading from the Coffee<lb/>gallery—as I was going up I met the elder prisoner at the bottom of the stairs leading to the upper gallery, with a bason of sugar in his hand—I was leaning over the gallery, and he came up, with, I believe, one foot on</p>

               <p>the stairs, going to ascend—we entered into conversation there—he informed me he was taking it to No. 11, in the top—meaning the other gallery—he asked where I was going—I replied, to the room of an acquaintance in the next gallery—he inquired bow long I should be—I said about half<lb/>an-hour—this at the time made no impression on me, as he kept a <hi rend="italic">whistling<lb/>shop,</hi> and people sometimes assembled there, I thought be might wish me to go into his room, or something—I then proceeded to my friend's room—I do not swear positively, but my impression is, that instead of going up stairs, he went back—when I left my own room his room Was wide open, and there appeared nobody in it—the candles were lighted, and nobody else in the gallery at the time but him and me, which is a very rare occurrence—my impression is there was nobody in his room—it is possible somebody might be in a corner without my seeing them—I suppose it is not above fifty or sixty yards from the prisoner's room, No. 3, to the staircase where I met him—I returned in about three quarters of an hour—I should say it was about ten o'clock, and found the padlock and staple wrenched off my door, and on entering the room, and lighting a candle, I found my writing-case gone—I looked for the padlock and staple, and they were gone also—none of the contents of the writing-case were left behind—the clock was not taken—I had seen the two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes safe in the writing<lb/>case that very morning—it was impossible I could have opened the cast without seeing them—by a memorandum which I made I am able to speak to the notes I lost—I had a recollection in my mind of the notes—I would not even trust to myself, but next morning I sent about them—I know I had three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes of a certain number—I know the numbers and dates from the note I gave away—I know it to be "No. 3," the other two consequently must be "Nos. 4, and 5," that were stolen—I have no me<lb/>morandum made before they were lost—I made this memorandum myself merely to bring down here—the three notes had been brought me by my sister with other money—I had had the notes in my possession from about the 23rd of February—I cannot tell the numbers from my memory—I bad frequently seen them—I cannot tell the numbers from my memory—my memory in numbers always fails me—I know the one I gave my sister was "No. 81, 303," dated the 10th of December, I think 1841—the other numbers must have been "4, and 5," as they were consecutive.</p>

PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you in the Fleet? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I came for the order for the Olympic—I came in to see Mr. Clark—he was to get me the order—I had been there about an hour when I was sent for the coat—I got it from no. 13, in the 3rd gallery—my mother, who was there, gave it to me from a box in the bed-room—I threw it on the table—Mr. Clark took it up, and showed it to the gentleman, and put it on the back of a chair—about an hour or two after he told me to take it up again, which I did—Mrs. Clark was there till I took it back—it was about twelve o'clock when I went up for it—I went to the Olympic on the 18th—that was the only time I went—that is the way I know that it was on the 16th—I did not at that time go to Mr. Clark's more than once or twice a week—I live with my sisters, no. 4, Bedford-row East, Old Kent-road—they are no business—they are Mrs. Clark's children, and live on their money.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the army, but have left the service. I was confined in the Fleet in March. I remember M'Donald's father applying to me for orders for the Olympic—I gave one on the 16th for the 17th, St. Patrick's day—I was not then aware it was a benefit night—on the following evening, I went into Clark's room about eight o'clock, and learnt by the ladies having returned, that the order was not admitted on account of it being Miss Mitchell's benefit—I gave another order for the 18th—that enables me to be certain of the 16th being the day, having applied to the books of the theatre on that occasion—M'Donald was there on the 16th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You know nothing of the coat being produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw a coat produced in Mr. Clark's room on the 16th—I cannot say who was present, nor what sort of a coat it was—I will not swear whether it was the one produced or not, as I did not look at it—Mr. Clark said, "I will show you a coat, I recommend one of you to have something made from as a pattern"—it being so long back, I cannot say who "one of you" was—I cannot swear any one was present but Mr. Clark and M'Donald—I cannot say whether the younger prisoner was present—there were two besides—I cannot say whether Cook, the tailor, and James Clark were there, my memory does not serve me—I have had a great deal to do with the Olympic—I have the power of giving orders.</p>

               <p>Olympic, but not to his friends, I will swear—I will not swear I never gave another order in his room but I know this was on the 16th, because it was a private box order, which I did not often give, and St. Patrick's-day is a clue to my recollection—I knew some time before that Miss Mitchell was to take her benefit on St. Patrick's-day, and when they came back, I said, "God bless my soul, I forgot it was St. Patrick's-day, or I would not have given you the order, I should have known it was Miss Mit<lb/>chell's benefit"—I was not called before the Justice.</p>

On the 4th of April, the prisoner came to me with this watch-case broken up as it is now—I asked her how she became possessed of it—she said it belonged to a cousin of her's—I asked her how it came to be in this condition—the said her cousin destroyed it in a drunken fit—the case appearing new I asked how long he had had it—she said five years—I knew her and let her go—I asked her address—she said No. 7, Osborn-place—she was to come for it the next morning, but she did not.</p>

The prosecutor and the pri<lb/>soner came—they called for coffee and bread and butter—the prisoner paid for it—he was there about an hour—he said his time was very short, and he should like his friend to lie down for an hour—I showed them up stairs to the front-room, and offered my services to assist the prosecutor to bed—the prisoner desired me to go below, and said he would attend to his friend himself—I went down, and in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I went up to see why the prisoner had not come down, and he was pretend<lb/>ing to put the clothes on the prosecutor—the prisoner came down some time afterwards, and went out—I called him back, and stopped him—he was searched when the prosecutor awoke—two sovereigns and a half, and tome coppers and silver was found on him—he said he had got at much money to give the sailor, if he would give him part of it back again.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, the 8th of May, the prisoner and another woman came to my shop—(we do not sell goods on a Sunday, unless any one happen to knock at the door)—the prisoner asked for some white plates with blue edges to them—I told her we had none—she then asked to look at some white ones—I showed her some—she then asked to look at some blue plates, which I showed her—I missed a jug—this is it—it is my husband's—I am sure I lost it that day, and I did not sell it to her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I and Sarah Edwards went in together. I bought two plates. I asked for some sugar, while she turned to get it, Edwards took the jug off a shelf on the right-hand side, and put it under her shawl. I gave her a shilling to get a pot of beer.</p>

I was at this publichouse—my father got up, and said, "That man has robbed me"—I detained him—we both fell on the floor—he got from me, and ran—there was no one there to run after him—I followed him to the Green Man, and there gave him in charge, about half-an-hour after the money was lost—no money was found—he was in company with one or two others at the Green Man, who he seemed to know.</p>

I took hold of the prisoner near the Green Man—he asked me what I wanted him for—I said, "For felony"—he said, "What felony?"—I said, "For robbing Cull"—he said it was no such thing—coming up to the Green Man, he said, "There is a person in here, that can satisfy you that what this man says is incorrect"—he then broke from me, and went into the house—I was not strong at that time; indeed, I am under the doctor's bands now—I afterwards found him in Hammond-square, behind some bricks—he went from there to Dennis-place—he there struck me, bit my hand, and threw me down—"Now," he said, "you b—y b—r, I have got you, I will serve you out"—I called out, "Murder"—he ran away, and I lost sight of him altogether—I was laid up for ten days in consequence of his violence.</p>

About half-past nine o'clock on the night, of the 13th of May, I saw the prisoners and two others come out of Field-lane, and proceed down Farringdon-street—the prisoners took the right hand, the other two the left—they proceeded up Ludgate-hill—I saw Williams lift up a gentleman's pocket, but he was not able to extract any thing—they then west into Cheapside, and tried another gentleman's pocket—Jenkins then went into two pastrycook's shops—after he came out, I went in, and made inquiries—after that Moran went into Wills and Withers', a hosier's shop, in the Poultry—Jenkins and Williams waited on the opposite side close together—I Watched them, I suppose, for ten minutes—they watched Moran very attentively—as he came out they made a signal to him, and they both ran across the road to him—Williams took off his hat, and put something into it which Moran passed to him—I then went into the shop, and made inquiries—when I came oat the prisoners were gone on a-head—I then proceeded on till I got a constable—I told him to take Williams while I took the other two—after a desperate resistance I captured the other two—they beat me and kicked me, but I kept hold of them—they laid down, entwined their legs in mine, and tried to throw me—I was obliged to call for assistance.</p>

S."—I took a pair of gold ear-rings out of her ears—while I examined the box, I saw her put something into her bosom, and took from her bosom six silver tea-spoons and a pair of sugar-tongs—I took her to my house—her uncle came to see her there, and requested her to tell the truth about the mat<lb/>ter,</p>

               <p>introduced to me by my son Edward, who is nineteen years of age—the prisoner said he was the proprietor of the Yarrow Steam-packet hotel, at Port Philip, that he had come from there to London to receive from 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and when he had settled his business and received his money, he intended to take some young persons back with him to Port Philip, and to get situations for them, and as my son had been speaking to him about it, he asked roe whether I was agreeable for him to go—I said as he wished to go, and he had met with so respectable a person as I understood him to be, I was agreeable to trust him under his care—he said he would take him, get a situation for him, and be a father and a friend to him—we had three meetings—I do not know that he told me all this at the first meet<lb/>ing—he afterwards told me that he had agreed with the owner of a ship to take seven passengers, and the next time I saw him he said the ship was the <hi rend="italic">Pathfinder</hi>—he said he had paid a deposit on each passenger, and he was to pay 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the seven—I agreed to give 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my son, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the passage, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for extras—it was to be paid partly in goods—the prisoner said the goods would be of more service to him at Port Philip than the money, for he could make more than double on the goods there, than he could on the money—I made him several presents' to induce him to be<lb/>have well to my son—he said a great deal about the country, about its being a very prosperous place, and that my son could get a situation with-the out any trouble the moment he got there—I settled with him on Saturday, 9th of October, and the vessel left the Docks on the Monday week fol<lb/>lowing—we went to take the luggage to the docks, and found the vessel was gone to Gravesend—the prisoner, my son, and myself, went by the steamer to it—he did not mention what money he had paid—I thought every thing was all right with him and the ship's owners—I remained on board the ship for some time—I said nothing to the captain—I merely saw all my son's luggage placed on board, and then came on shore—I saw several boxes on board, belonging to the prisoner—he said nothing to me about them—the <hi rend="italic">Pathfinder</hi> sailed next afternoon—three weeks afterwards I went down to Plymouth, and there found my son, young Williams, and his wife, who was the prisoner's sister—I had known Williams some time—he introduced the prisoner to my ton—all their money was gone—I brought Williams's wife home, and kept her at my house for a long time, till I got her into the Union work-house, and she died a few days after—I heard no more of the prisoner until six weeks ago, when I received this letter from him, enclosed in one directed to young Williams—I know them to be his handwriting, and he acknowledged before the Lord Mayor that they were so—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. J.

Oh, that I could recall the past, and restore to you that peace of mind and comfort you enjoyed before the unfortunate circumstance occurred which caused my ruin and wretchedness to you.

               <p>to you if you would allow me to see and speak to you.

I enclose a note to Mr. Marklew, if you will be kind enough, if I may ask such a thing, to deliver; and likewise permit me to see him, if he will consent, at your house; per<lb/>haps things may be better arranged by what I propose; still if not, I will then on to-morrow morning go to the Mansion-house, and then trust to Him above.

                  <hi rend="italic">Letter to Mr. Marklew.</hi>—"Wednesday morning. Sir,—You will no doubt feel much surprised at having a note from me, but I write to you with the hope that however culpable I may appear, yet on hearing some circumstances from me you will find I am not guilty. I have arrived in London with the sole purpose of letting justice prove the truth; and though I would fain the matter might be settled if possible in a different way, yet should you not be enabled to listen to what I can say in palliation of what has occurred, I am determined to abide by the laws of the country. Allow me to say, Mr. Marklew, that you are indeed very much mistaken in supposing I am the villain stated in the public papers. I can prove, I trust, to your satisfaction, if you would hear me coolly and dispassionately, that no intention ever existed in my mind of injuring any one party. 1 could also prove, if matters were now settled peaceably, how much better it would be for all parties concerned. This I can do if you would con<lb/>sent to meet me alone at seven o'clock this evening at Mr. Williams's. I have many persons to prove the truth of what I might say to you, and all I ask of you is to hear me first; all may yet be able to go well without loss to any one; and such is my earnest wish that it may. Should you refuse to see me, I can only add, the thing must take its course, and no benefit to any one will then ensue; acceding to my request of conversing together for a short time may prove of mutual advantage. I must again state that you are very much deceived in judging me as you do. I enclose this in a similar note to Mr. Williams, begging him to be kind enough to present it to you, and all I entreat of you is, to beg you will hear me.—</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. I was intro<lb/>duced to the prisoner by Williams. I was present at conversations between the prisoner and my father—I heard him say, in my father's presence, that he was the proprietor of the hotel, and he had come here to receive money—I do not remember what sum he mentioned—I heard him say he had paid a deposit for the passage of seven persons, of whom I was one—I was not present when my father paid him the money—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Pathfinder</hi> at Gravesend on the Tuesday afternoon with the prisoner and his wife, and Williams and his wife—Williams's wife is the prisoner's sis<lb/>ter, and the prisoner's wife is Williams's sister—we sailed about three o'clock on Wednesday morning—we started from the Downs, I think, about the 20th or 22nd of October, and meeting with an unfair wind when we got to Dungeness we were obliged to return to the Downs—the priso<lb/>ner and his wife left the ship on Sunday afternoon, and said he should be on board in four days—he asked the captain whether he would allow him four days—he promised to meet us at Plymouth in four days—two boxes and one large box were left on board belonging to him—the prisoner did</p>

               <p>not meet us at Plymouth—we went on shore there to the Royal Hotel as he had directed us, and stopped there two days, but he not coming, we went on board again on the Friday, when we were informed that only 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid as a deposit for our passage, and if he was not forth<lb/>coming with the rest, 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, we could not be allowed to remain on board—they would not allow us to remain—I received a letter from the pro<lb/>prisoner of the Royal Hotel and went back there—Williams and his wife went to the Brunswick Inn—my father came down on the Wednesday evening—I was put to great inconvenience, and was in a state of distress, disappointment, and anxiety—when we found the prisoner was not forth<lb/>coming the captain took on himself, in our presence, to break open hit boxes to see if there was anything in them worth the passage-money—the two first boxes contained a little wearing apparel, but nothing like the quantity which ought to have been in them—the third contained old colo<lb/>nial papers, log-books, and some wood, bone, and iron, not worth a penny to us, and more especially if we had taken them to Australia—they were not worth anything either in Port Phillip or anywhere else—when the pri<lb/>soner left us he said, "Take care of that box, for in it is all my hopes."</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner read a long defence in which he stated that he had been en<lb/>gaged by the agents of the ship in which he first left England to manage the hotel at Port Philip—that his health obliging him to return to England, he with their consent transferred his licence to another party, who agreed to take the house at the rent of 700l. per annum, and he came over with the money he had obtained, intending to take back his poor relations to settle at Port Philip, where he had sufficient influence to procure them good situations. He denied ever representing to any one that he had to receive 700l. or 800l., or that Mr. Marklew gave him the money and goods stated. He declared that he had no fraudulent intention, but that being unable to obtain sufficient money to pay the remainder of the passage-money for which he had become security he was induced to leave the vessel with his wife, and proceed to Caen, in Normandy, where his step-father resided, in hopes of procuring it from him, but without success, and that his return to England was prevented by a severe attack of illness; had his intentions been not to have gone with the vessel, he should not have paid any deposit to the owners, nor have gone to any expense in fitting up the vessel for the accommodation of the passengers; that the contents of his trunks were not rubbish, but of much greater value and importance than was stated; he produced several papers, the inspection of which, he said, would corroborate the truth of his statement.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am out of business at present, and live at Stock, in Essex. In the early part of 1839 I carried on business in Queen-street, Cheapside, in partnership with Mr. Taylor, and resided in the country—I became acquainted with the prisoner in May, 1839—I rendered him some service at that time—in August, 1839, the prisoner and his wife called on me at the warehouse in Queen-street—his wife said in his presence that her husband had a valuable property case for a person named Wall, at Whet<lb/>stone, and from the great kindness I had rendered him in his distress, it was his determination I should receive a portion of the property when recovered—his wife said that, and he rejoined by stating that I had been a great friend to him, that, this property would amount to a very large sum, and it was his intention that I should have a share of it, but at the same time they stated their circumstances would not allow them to carry on the suit unless furnished with money for the purpose, and also for their support during the time the Chancery suit was in hand—his wife said this, and he himself stated so afterwards—shortly after, in October, 1839, he brought me a copy of a will—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said he brought it for my satisfaction, to show me that there was such a Chancery suit in existence, and to satisfy me as far as was in his power—he said he could show me that there was such a property to which this Wall was entitled, and he would introduce me to Wall, and also to other members of the family—he did introduce me to Joshua Wall, I think in September, 1839, at the Anchor in Newport-street—that was previous to his bringing me the copy of the will—on the 24th of January, 1840, I gave him a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I produce—previous to my giving him that cheque he said that he was desirous of relieving Wall's family until the business was settled—I asked him what he proposed to allow Wall and his family until the business was settled—he said he thought 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week would be sufficient—I told him to make the most he could of the money that I advanced him, but I should have, no objection to his advancing from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to Wall until the, business was settled—on the 22nd of February he came to me again at Queen-street, and stated that he was going to the Court of Chancery, and it was his intention to make a present to some of the clerks—that he found the clerks in the Court more ready to attend to the business he had in hand if he made them presents—no one was present but our two selves when he stated that—he got from me a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion—he said he was going with Mr. Taylor to the Court of Chancery—that he (Mr. Taylor) was the acting man in the business at the Court of Chancery—this cheque is dated the 22nd of February—on the 2nd of March, he came to me again, and said he was going to the Court of Chancery with Mr. Taylor, that they should have to discharge some heavy fees at the Court, and on that occa<lb/>sion he obtained this cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was in my warehouse two or three times a week on the average, all the year round, and was constantly pestering me for money—I drew so much from the firm that it almost embarrassed us, and caused a dissolution of partnership between me and my partner—about the beginning of December, 1840, as near as I can re<lb/>member, the prisoner went to town—before he went, he expressed his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184205090192"/>
               <p>opinion that he should find the business settled—and when he came back, he said it was just as he had thought, that he had seen the attorneys, that the Chancery business was finally concluded, that the cheques were drawn for the division of the property, and that he had nothing more to do but to bring up Wall and the members of Wall's family to receive; that he should require a suit of clothes to appear in at the Court of Chancery on that occasion and also a great-coat—in consequence of that I wrote to Pearson, my tailor, who came down to Leytonstone, and measured him for a suit of clothes and a great-coat, of the most expensive cloth—I was present when they were brought in by my tailor, and saw the prisoner in them afterwards—they were furnished on my credit—the prisoner has had three suits of him on my account altogether—I have seen him wear that particular suit frequently, and the great-coat too—it had a velvet collar, and the waist<lb/>coat was a figured velvet—I believe the suit cost 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this letter, (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is the prisoner's handwriting—I received it from the hands of his wife, and gave her a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note when she brought it—it is dated Jan. 22, 1841—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Mr. Hinton, 2, Forest-place, Leytonstone,—My dear Sir, I write merely to say that the business is concluded with the exception of fetching up Wall, which I intend doing to-morrow, and must beg a little of the needful from you to enable me to do so. I should have come down to you, but I am afraid I should increase my cold, which is very bad, and my boots are too thin to attempt to come through this deep snow; my wife is coming back to me to-night, and I wish to start early in the morn<lb/>ing, and she will bring to me what you choose to send,—I am, dear Sir, your's truly, Richard Hitchcock."—at the latter part of 1839, the prisoner said that Messrs. Shave and Taylor had sent out two agents to Antigua, who had proved the identity of Wall as the heir of the property: that they had returned, and had successfully accomplished their mission—some time after he said the Lord Chancellor had issued the decree in favour of Joshua Wall.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, on your oath, was it not during the time you were living there that some of these sums were paid? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What I speak of the pri<lb/>soner having had, was expressly for Wall's business—I found money for the housekeeping—I lived at Herman-hill from April to June, I think—I went to live with him originally in May, 1839, and we continued to live together, from one place to another, till January, 1841—the prisoner's wife had the management of the house—I cannot say exactly how much I paid them for housekeeping during that time—I kept no account of it—on my oath the prisoner had 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me for the purpose of carrying on Wall's business—the prisoner did not pay the whole of my wedding expenses—I paid for the whole of them—Mrs. Hitchcock received the money in my counting-house last March—I cannot say the precise amount—I kept no account of it, but she, the prisoner, and all the family, had new suits of clothes—I have received money from him to the amount of a few shillings, not to the amount of several pounds—I think Wall came to my warehouse twice, and met the prisoner there, with some other members of his family—they met for the purpose of talking of this law-suit—I should certainly not have trusted to the prisoner unless I had seen Wall—what I heard from Wall and other members of his fauie mily, and from his friends, certainly impressed the belief on my mind that he was entitled to the property—unless that belief had been impressed on my mind by Wall and his friends, I should certainly not have trusted to the prisoner's representations.</p>

Teasdale and Symet, solicitors, in Fenchurch-street—in consequence of that reference I went to Messrs., Teasdale and Symes's, leaving the prisoner and the man he called Wall in my office—I came back and told them that the suit had been disposed of by the Court of Chancery, and there was nothing for Wall, he had applied too late, or something of that sort—the prisoner did not em<lb/>ploy us as his attorneys for Wall in the Chancery suit—I never saw the prisoner afterwards till he was in custody—I did not go with him to the Court of Chancery to pay for the costs, or any thing else—there was no pretence for saying there was any suit going on about Wall's property in our office,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer, and live at Woolwich. On the 19th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the sign of the Duke on Horseback. The prisoner was then sitting on my right-hand side, close to me—after sitting some time I found his hand in my pocket, and caught hold of it—I missed my money, and collared him—he tried to get away—I charged him with robbing me—Inspector Browne came up outside the house, and I think the prisoner said, "I have got your money"—I can swear I had two half-crowns, a sixpence, and some halfpence, but I cannot say how many—I missed my handkerchief from my hat, which was on my right-hand side—there was nobody but us two sitting there—I had given him some bread and cheese and beer, because he asked me for charity.</p>

On Monday night, the 18th of April, about half-past eleven o'clock, I was in New-street, Deptford, and found some person's hand in my coat-pocket, unknown to me—as they drew their band from my pocket, I caught hold of their left hand with my right—it escaped from my hand—four half-crowns and five shillings were taken from my pocket by some one, who I do not know—I consider it was a female by the clothes.</p>

These six pairs of trowsers and four small pieces of cloth are my master's—I am sure of that—on Thursday the police<lb/>man came, and I gave the male prisoners into custody—John Cochrane, Jun. was only given into custody on suspicion—the elder Cochrane came in, and on undoing his trowsers he pulled out this piece of unmade trowsers from between the waistband of his trowsers and handed them to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Mr. Beardshaw called me a few minutes after four o'clock on Saturday morning, and gave me information—I examined the place—I am positive no woman could have got over the wall—it is a back yard where they got in from the adjoining yard—a boy could get in at the bole, but it was not big enough for any body else—when I was coining off duty at six I saw the prisoner coming out at the door of a coffee-shop which is about 200 yards from the prosecutor's house—a boy was with her—they seemed confused—the boy went one way, and the woman another—I asked the prisoner what she had in her basket she said she had nothing—I told her I thought she had—she said, "Yes, I have got some money in it; I am going to market with it"—I said, "Let me look at it; you are the very person I want "—she said, "That money I found in the Grove"—I took her to the station—I found nine packages of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers, and two broken ones which I produce.</p>

               <p>the Excise weight marked on the pockets—the Excise weight on Pye's pockets was much heavier than on those we lost—nine of the pockets pro<lb/>duced by the police were marked "William Pye, Cuxton, Kent, 1841," and the other, "L. Starn, of Leigh, Kent, 1841"—the hops bear no resem<lb/>blance to Pye's or Starn's.</p>

               <p>that Ginbey went with him, but in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Ginbey came down, and said those pockets would not do, they were not long enough—I said some of them were tucked in straining them, per<lb/>haps if he pulled them out he would find them long enough, if not, I could not help it, it was of no consequence whether he had them or not—Bean said, "Perhaps they will do"—I then went up with them—they examined what pocketing we had, and Ginbey, in Bean's presence, selected fifteen—I believe some of Pye's were among them, but I am not positive—I did not take particular notice of the marks—I have since seen nine pockets marked "Pye," and one marked "L. Starn"—I should say those pockets were in our possession when we bought the hops of Messrs. Thackere—Bean paid for them.</p>

               <p>him if he would allow me to examine the chaise and the stable, previous to going to Wandsworth, to search for the trowsers—it was a four-wheeled chaise—he said, "Yes"—I and the two lads then walked into the stable-yard—I saw a little boy about ten years old running about, who I have since ascertained is the prisoner's child, called Daniel Good—I desired the elder lad Speed to stay by the prisoner while I examined the chaise and stable—we were then in the stable-yard—I proceeded to search the har<lb/>ness-room and the stable—while searching the harness-room the prisoner walked over towards the chaise—he said, "We will go to Wandsworth now and settle it"—at that moment a man, who I have since ascertained is Houghton, the gardener, living on the premises, came into the yard, and asked what was the matter—I told him I had come to take the prisoner, and was searching for the trowsers—he seemed much surprised—I told the prisoner I would not go till I had searched this stable—he was standing at the stable-door with the door just open, ajar—he then allowed me to go into the stable—he had not prevented me, but stood at the door as if he wished me not to go in—I went in with the two lads, Houghton, the prisoner, and his child—when I got in I desired Speed again to stand by the prisoner—I commenced, and searched the first and second stalls of the stable, found nothing, crossed over to search the corn-bin, and while search<lb/>ing the bin the prisoner said, "Let us go to Wandsworth, and have it settled"—I said, "No, I will not go till I have made a more diligent search"—the prisoner then walked down to the fourth stall himself—there are four stalls all in a row—I saw him move a truss of hay from one side of the stall to the other—I followed him down—there was nobody in that stall—I went to it, and desired him to go and stand by Speed, saying I did not require any of his assistance—I then moved the hay from where he had put it—it was in the direction he had moved it to, but there were several trusses there—I cannot swear it was the same truss—I moved two trusses and some loose hay which was underneath, and discovered something laying, which appeared to me to be a goose—it was a piece of flesh—I said, "What is this? this is a goose" loud enough for every body in the stable to hear—at that moment I heard the stable-door shut, looked round, and the prisoner was gone—I ran to the door, tried to open it, and found it was fastened outside—Speed found a two-pronged hay-fork in the stable, and commenced prizing the door—I assisted him, but could not open it—I went back to be positive as to what I had seen in the stall—the two lads and Houghton followed me—I moved the remainder of the hay off, and thought it was a pig—I found it was the trunk of a female, the body—it was laying on its abdomen with the back uppermost—Speed turned it over—I had no difficulty then in discerning that it was a woman—the arms were cut off at the shoulders, and the legs cut off at the upper part of the thigh; the head severed from the body at the lower part of the neck, and the thigh-bone was taken off right at the hip—it was quite gone—the belly was cut open, and the bowels taken out—I then went to the door, and succeeded in breaking out—the head and all the four limbs were gone—I made a further search an hour and a half after—(I had not left the stable)—I searched in a third stall with another constable, removed several trusses of straw, and under it found a mattress rolled up, and two blankets rolled up in it—I unfolded the mattress, and discovered a large stain on it, apparently of urine—it was not wet—I saw some blood close to where</p>

                  </hi>. I am eighteen years old, and live at Wands<lb/>worth. On Wednesday, the 6th of April, I went with Gardiner to Mr. Shiell's, at Roehampton-lane—we went to the house first, and afterwards to the stable, to a small private gate—I rang the bell—the prisoner answered it, and the young woman, the daughter of the gar<lb/>dener—they came to the gate—when we were at the gate, Gardiner told the prisoner he had come for a pair of trowsers he had stolen from Mr. Collingbourn—he said he had no black trowsers—when we got inside the premises Gardiner told me to take care of the prisoner—we were then in<lb/>side the premises, not far from the stable—we afterwards went into the stable—the prisoner went first—I saw him open the stable-door with a key—I saw him turn the key which he produced from his pocket before he got to the door—I saw him turn the key—we all went in, and I kept near him—Gardiner commenced searching, and after searching some time the prisoner went into the place where the body was found—Gardiner told him to stand back—before that, I saw the prisoner begin taking the hay from one side of the stall, and putting it over where the body lay—it was on that Gardiner told him to stand back, he must make a more diligent search—he stood back nearer to me—we were about two yards from the stall Gardiner was searching—while Gardener was searching he said, "What is this?" loud enough for the prisoner to hear—I stepped forward to see what it was, and the prisoner rushed back towards the stable-door to escape—I saw him as he had the door in his hand going out, and imme<lb/>diately heard the door locked—I heard the sound of the key turning—I afterwards saw the body.</p>

               <p>Shiell, at Putney—I went into the stable-yard that evening, and found the prisoner and policeman there—we afterwards went into the stable—I did not hear the policeman make an exclamation—the prisoner made his escape, I believe, without any one seeing him—I afterwards went into the harness-room, which was in the prisoner's care—no one else had access to it—I cannot tell how it was entered that night, as the policeman had ex<lb/>amined it before I came—the prisoner kept the key of it, and lighted the fire in it—about six o'clock on the Tuesday morning, the day before the policeman came, I observed a smoke coming from the harness-room—it was common to have a fire as early as that, and earlier in the winter—I had not seen a fire there for perhaps more than a fortnight, I think.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state was the stove in the harness-room on the Wednesday evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an immense preparation of wood and coals with straw underneath ready to light—it was very considerably more than there would usually be for a fire—I should consider there were three times as much as would answer for a common fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you been in the harness-room before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had never been there for months before—I have seen a fire there through the window, but do not know the time I was in the harness-room or stable, for the prisoner and I have not been friends for some time—in fact I never went near him at all—one window of the harness-room looks into our kitchen-garden, and the other, which is opposite, into the stable-yard—there are two windows—I am in the kitchen-garden every day, generally from six o'clock in the morning, at the time in question, and had been so for the last three or four days—I work till six in the evening, but as I live on the premises, I do not go away often—I live at a cottage on the farm connected with the premises, and with the kitchen-garden—I should think my cottage is not more than fifty or sixty yards from the stable—my wife, daughter, and son, live with me—my wife, daughter, and myself, sleep in the cottage—my son has slept in a room over the back of the stable for some time past—the bed-rooms all join together over the stable, but are separated by a par<lb/>tition—nobody but my son sleeps in the bed-room over the stable—the prisoner sleeps up at Mr. Shiell's house, and boards there—it is a quarter of a mile from the stable—my wife and daughter sleep about fifty yards from the stable—it is one range of buildings—a cow-house, a tool-house, seed-room, fruit-room, then the stable—there is no communication without going out. side—you cannot go into the stable without going into the stable-yard—you can get to the stable-yard from the kitchen-garden, by coming into a pas<lb/>sage, without coming into the highway—that yard leads to the stable in question—when we have no hot-house fires to attend to, we generally go to bed about ten, or half-past—my daughter is nearly thirty years old—she sometimes retires to rest before me, and sometimes not—I went to bed on the Sunday night before this about ten, or a little after, my wife and daughter about the same time—I got up at six—my son is under-gardener, to assist me—I sometimes have occasion to go into the stable-yard—there is an iron gate, separating the stable-yard from the garden and other pre<lb/>mises, which any body can open.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The stable-door, which was locked, I presume is the door leading out to the highway? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; there is a colonnade over, and a stable on each side—the door opens under the colonnade—there are large gates for the carriage to go out, they lead to an open yard, and the stables are right and left—the doors facing each other—I do not know when I have seen</p>

               <p>the stable in question unlocked, except the prisoner has been there himself—I have not been there much latterly—he has been in Mr. Shiell's service about two years and three months—master keeps two ponies, that is all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How does your son go to bed over the stable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a door opens close by the harness-room which leads up stairs, to what we call the outer door—it turns to the left when you get to the top of the stairs, and this door faces him—there are two rooms beyond where he sleeps, and one on the right of him, where the stableman used to sleep—my son's room is part over the back harness-room, where the dirty harness is kept—his window looks into the garden—he would come along the garden into the stable-yard to go to bed, and by the harness-room—it is an open stair<lb/>case—I have two men and a boy besides my son—they do not sleep on the premises—a fire is necessary in the harness-room in wet weather, to dry the harness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The two harness-rooms are on the ground-floor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, my son sleeps over the back one—that is not where I saw this great pre<lb/>paration for a fire—that was in the large harness-room—the prisoner locks the harness-room up, and always keeps the key—you do not go through the stable to it—it is a separate door on the left of the stable, and very near the stable—when in the stable, you do not come into the yard to get to it, but into the colonnade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could any body in the stable-yard see any thing which is going on in the colonnade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They can, if they were to look into the harness<lb/>room itself, through the large window, any body who was in the stable-yard could—there is no curtain to the window that I know of, to either of the windows which face the garden—the glass is frosted, that people should not look in out of the garden—no body in the garden can see through, unless they get steps or something, and look through the upper panes, which are not frosted—they are rather higher than a man's head—any body can see into the harness-room from the stable-yard.</p>

I went to Mr. Shiell's stable on the night of the 6th of April—I arrived about a quarter past eleven o'clock—I went into the stable, and saw the trunk on a female, and proceeded to search the harness-room, the door of which was locked—I got the key from the elder Houghton—I unlocked the door—I beg to correct myself, I was called by the superintendent to go into the harness-room, which was then open—it was at a subsequent search I got the key—the superintendent ordered me to break open a flat wooden box, which was there, locked—I found in that a quantity of clean linen belonging to a male, and some books—I searched the drawer of a table there which was shot, but there was no lock on it—I found in it this knife closed as it is now—I examined it, and observed what appeared to me to be stains of blood—I found it had been newly sharpened, and on this part of the handle was what appeared to be a stain of blood, and the knife appeared to be rusty after it had been sharpened—the stain of blood was partly on the handle, and partly on the blade—I showed the knife to Dr. Ridge the next day—I found some keys in the drawer, which sergeant Palmer has possession of—I laid them on the table—on the right-hand side of the fire-place, in a corner, standing by the chimney, I found this axe—I did not examine it that night—I kept possession of the key of the harness-room myself—I looked at it, and could not distinguish whether there were stains on it that night—I locked the room when f left, and took the key with me—I observed next morning what appeared to be stains of blood, one mark on the pole of the axe, and one on each side the edge along here—I do not think they were more visible than they are now, because I have kept it so carefully—there were lines across the room to hang clothes on, and on a line next the fire-place, I found this piece of silk handkerchief, which appears to be marked with blood in several places—I found divers clothes, but not on the line—the articles of female wearing apparel I found in a saddle-rest in the harness-room—here is what appears to me to be part of a flannel petticoat, forcibly torn in two, and one part cut in the seam—these two pieces were together as they are now, and correspond exactly where it appears cut at the seam—they also correspond in quality; they were both together, thrown over the saddle-rest—I found what appears to be part of a calico petticoat, close to the saddle-rest, underneath a box-coat, which was thrown over the chair, and one of these was knotted as if tied together, but it became untied after<lb/>wards—both are marked with blood, and on one of these there are marks of blood close to where there have been pieces cut out—they are not drops but splashes of blood—not as if dropping from a person's nose—I found also a pint bottle, under the window; there were a few drops of liquid in it—I poured it into the palm of my hand, tasted it, and believe it to be milk—I found the bottle on the 8th, but I had always kept the harness-room locked up, and had the key—on the night of the 6th I assisted in searching the fire-place, and found a quantity of calcined bones in the ashes—the fire was laid with straw, wood, and coal—I removed them, and searched underneath—there was a pair of brand-irons at the fire-place, so as to bring the fire out further from the chimney—I believe it was a Cob<lb/>bett's register-stove—I found the bones under the fuel, among the cinders and ashes underneath—I showed them to Mr. Allen the same night—</p>

               <p>they are now in the same state, except one piece of a very claimed bone fell asunder—I put a string round it to keep it together—I found about an ounce of tea in a <hi rend="italic">box,</hi> which was not locked—on the 8th, the day of the inquest, in sifting the cinders through two sieves, assisted by Dr. Ridge, among these at the bottom of the stove I found more bones—I examined the body that day after it was washed, having a very clear and good light, and on the neck, about half an inch below where the head had been taken off, I found a small mole, a very dark colour, on the right side—to make sure that it was a mole, I wetted my thumb, and rubbed it two or three times—I was quite convinced it was a mole—in the harness-room I found the two umbrellas, one hanging on a nail over the chimney-piece, the other standing in a corner, not far from the axe—I found this rent-book in searching No. 18, South-street, Manchester-square, and the landlord gave me this sign-board.</p>

I slept in the room over between the stable and harness-room—part of the room is over each—I get to it by the stair-case outside—I do not pass through the stable—the prisoner kept the key of the stable—it was always kept locked—I got up on Tuesday, the 5th of April, at half-past six o'clock, 0. and saw the prisoner when I came down—I smelt a very unpleasant smell, and asked him if he had been singeing—it smelt like the singeing of horses—he said he had been in liquor overnight, and had been toasting some cheese for refreshment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Shillito, a surgeon. I was called on Wednesday night, the 6th of April, to the stable of Mr. Shiell—the trunk of a woman was shown to me—Superintendent Bicknell, and several officers were there—I examined it—the head bad been severed from the body by a very clean cut through the integuments, and through the second and third vertebrae—I imagine that to hare been done all by one cut—both arms had been taken off above the shoulder joints by a clean cut through the flesh and muscles, and the bones were rather hacked as if with a knife or chopping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the appearances present such as would be produced by an axe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not so much as the thigh bones did—they appeared more like hacking—the legs and thighs bad a clean cut through the integument, and the bones divided just below the great <hi rend="italic">trochanthus</hi>—the flesh was cut, but I think the bones were chopped—this axe was the most likely instru<lb/>ment to produce the appearances—the bowels were all gone, the abdominal and pelvid viscera—there was a clean cut from the sternum to the pubes, and all the way round to the vertebrae.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to form any judgment whether the incision had been made before or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After death, I should say decdodly—we have the means of forming a judgment on that subject—the body was in a most healthy state—there was not the least appearance of disease whatever that I could observe in any part—I did not see the heart or lungs—Dr. Ridge had an order next day to make a post mortem examination, and I was not there—my examination terminated on the Wed<lb/>nesday—I saw the body again, but did not examine it—from the appear<lb/>ance of the blood vessels as the body lay, they appeared perfectly empty, both the blood vessels and arteries—the body appeared perfectly empty—from the general appearance of it she was not at all likely to have died of apoplexy or any sudden disease—I should say she could not have been dead longer than three or four days, or I would say five day at far<lb/>thest—there was not any appearance of decay—decomposition had not taken place at all—there was a very slight smell—I saw the axe that even<lb/>ing, but did not examine it till before the Coroner's inquest—I certainly think the marks on it are stains of blood—they have more the appearance of blood than anything else—I saw some of the bones on Wednesday, and also afterwards at the inquest—the large bone has the appearance of part of a thigh bone, and here are portions of the skull, and a portion of the knee joint—merely the top of one of the lower bones—these two pieces roost decidedly are portions of a human skull—the serrated edges of the sutures are quite visible—I am rather inclined to say the female was pregnant, but there was not sufficient to decide that—I merely come to the conclusion from a slight appearance on the nipple, and would not speak de<lb/>cidedly—I should be very sorry to say this is the thigh bone of a human being, in the highly calcined state of it—I did not examine the body in conjunction with Dr. Ridge—there must decidedly have been a most in<lb/>tense heat to make the bones so highly calcined—I merely looked at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184205090246"/>
               <p>knife that night—I saw very little appearance of blood on it—I did not observe any thing inside it myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you speak with any degree of positiveness as to the appearance on the axe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is decidedly blood, from the appearance it had then—it is not so bright now—it was much more plain—the appearance of blood on the knife was very slight—I should be sorry to swear it was blood—I saw the axe standing in the corner that night, but did not examine it—the inspector said he would put it on one side till daylight—I saw it at the inquest on Friday—it was then in the inspector's possession—I think he showed it to me before the Coroner—the marks are decidedly not so plain now as then—they have been rub<lb/>bed off, or gone off by carriage, or something, from both sides—it is cer<lb/>tainly not so bright as it was—the blood was redder, more distinct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you saw of it at the inquest do you think the appear<lb/>ances might be very visible on Wednesday by the aid of the policeman's lamp? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They would have been visible, but not so visible as by day<lb/>light—there was sufficient to enable a person to see the appearances on Wednesday, I think—this axe is a very likely instrument to have separated the thigh bones—there was a clean cut all the way round the neck—it has the appearance of having been done by one stroke—I think it is be<lb/>tween the second and third vertebrae, but without dissecting, I cannot be certain—the blood vessels were very empty—there must have been a very large quantity of blood effused—it was the trunk of a full grown female.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form an opinion of her age? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say she was upwards of thirty—there was very little to judge by—the skin had a very fair appearance—that might have been from the draining of blood—I should think she had been dead four or five days—the body was plump—I should think she was about a middle size, and rather a fine made woman—the bosom was rather plump and full—I should think she had not borne a child, from the appearance of the breast—I should think her rather of a medium complexion—the skin appeared fail by that light, and very clear—I think that she had been dead four days, from the general appearance of the remains—the rigidity of the skin was over, and its flexibility come back—I judge the incisions were made after death, from their clean ap<lb/>pearance—if made on a living person the skin retracts—I judge it had lost its elasticity at the time the cut was given.</p>

                  </hi>. I practise as a surgeon at Putney. I had the Co<lb/>Park-lane roner's warrant on the 7th to examine the body of a person in Putney—I examined it on Thursday and Friday—I examined it first in the stable, but did not make a very particular examination then, as the con<lb/>stable would not allow me, on account of the body being so dirty, being in the stall—on the Friday it was washed, and I made a particular examination—there were no marks of disease whatever about it—I should say that it had been dead from three to four days—I could not judge within twenty<lb/>four hours, but about four days from the time I first saw it, which was Thursday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Could you form a judgment whether the cutting off of the head and limbs had taken place before or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After death—I form a clear judgment of that—the heart was in a very healthy state indeed, but perfectly bloodless—there was not the least appearance of blood in either</p>

               <p>of the cavities of the heart—there was a small portion of blood in the large blood-vessel from the heart, the ascending aorta (but none in the descending aorta)—there was a small quantity of blood, which would fill perhaps a very small teaspoon, but not more—the lungs were very collapsed; indeed, at the first view, I thought there were no lungs at all—there was neither blood nor air in the lungs, they were per<lb/>fectly empty—the person had certainly not died of apoplexy, or I think we should have found blood in the heart—I am sure we should—the appearance of the body was not consistent with death from any mode of disease I am familiar with—the lungs and heart were perfectly healthy—should be inclined to say the person had died from violence, from the sud<lb/>den joss, while in health, and the muscular powers going on, that the Wood had emptied itself completely out of the body by the incision of some large.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after death does the blood cease to flow in the way it usually does in life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very soon indeed—the fluids soon separate—a person was knocked down, and life was extinct for about ten minutes, if you opened a vein, or cut an artery, you would not find blood-coagulation takes place immediately the vitality ceases—the bones produced are most decidedly those of a human body—I have not a doubt of it—here—is the lower portion of the joint of one of the thigh-bones, where it articulates with the knee-joint—here are portions of a human skull. I have no doubt whatever—they have got into the state they are now in by being burnt in a very strong fire—I saw the grate—there was a considerable quantity of fuel in it—I saw it before it was removed—I dare say there was a full bushel of fuel altogether—the stove was quite capable of producing heat to reduce the bones to the state they were found—it had a very great draught—it is my opinion the woman was pregnant—there was nothing to judge by but the breast—there was an indication there which made me form a notion of it—from the appearance of the breast I thought she might have been pregnant between four and five months—I saw the knife on the Friday, and examined the inside of it—I was attracted by the powerful smell of that part of the knife—a strong animal smell, very much like our dissecting knives—I put a small instrument into the handle, and found a very small piece of flannel at the bottom, and that had evidently been saturated with blood—it is here now, but the smell has gone off—it was saturated—it was moist that morning, and in my opinion it was human blood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any difficulty In discovering whether wounds or incision have been made before or after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very shortly after death there would be comparatively but little, but still there is a difference—in an hour or two after death there would certainly be a difference, and in a day or two after there would be a marked difference—(examining the bones)—no doubt this is a portion of a human skull, and this is a portion of the leg, the femur—I have no doubt—and here is a portion of the tibia, which is a bone of the leg—I should say this is a portion of the arm.</p>

               <p>opinion whether the person had died from disease or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it was quite clear—no disease empties the body of blood—it is not consistent with death from disease of the heart, apoplexy, or any com<lb/>plaint I am aware of—nor strangulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you find, after death, the body entirely deprived of blood, can you form an opinion whether a large quantity of blood must have flown before life was extinct? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think it very probable and possible, but can scarcely say for certain—the time which blood begins to stagnate after death, varies much, but in a very few minutes—in half-an-hour or an hour after death the body could not be emptied of blood, but in some rare cases the blood does not coagulate—in death from apoplexy, disease of the heart, nor any thing else, should we find the body so empty of blood.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that complaint attended with considerable pain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yet, very great pain—though they go about their work, they would complain to people about them—it is in a very advanced state of disease that it bursts out through the wound, and after some violent effort—a person in such a case would die in a very few minutes unless they called for assistance—death is so rapid, assistance seldom arrives in time—it is not a very painful death. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the cases in which blood does not coagulate after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Death from electricity, when struck by lightning, the blood is found to be fluid, and it never coagulates—it will remain, and cannot be let out by an incision; there would be no muscular action.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Brown, of No. 18, South-street, Manchester-square, and keep a greengrocer's-shop; I let part of the house in lodgings. I knew a person called Jane Jones—she took a lodging of me three years ago last October, in the name of Jane Jones—she afterwards went by the name of Jane Good within about six months of taking them—I saw her last on Sunday, the 3rd of April—she was rather a plump person, and ra<lb/>ther dark—I had no opportunity of knowing whether she was with child before the 3rd of April—the prisoner used to come to see her almost at soon as she came—be never said who he was, only a friend—when she changed her name to Good, he called her his wife—there was a little boy called Daniel Good—he was about eight years old when he first came—I have seen him, the prisoner, and Jane Good together—the prisoner called Jane. Good hit wife, and sometimes Jane—the boy called her "mother" in the prisoner's presence—the prisoner told me the mother had been dead a year and a half, and so the child called this woman mother—that was when he called Jane his wife—I saw Jane go out on Sunday, the 3rd of April, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon—she was dressed in a blue bonnet, black ground shawl, with flowers on it of different colours, and a mingled cotton dress—the little boy went to school about two o'clock—I did not see him again that day—I did not know that he did not sleep at my house that night, till the day after—I only heard it—I did not observe it by his bed or any thing—last October Jane Good had the front and back kitchens, and afterwards had but one kitchen—the sign-board produced was put up to denote her trade—she kept a mangle, and took washing—(<hi rend="italic">on the board was painted, "Mangling done by J, Good</hi>")—I did not see her after the 3rd of April—I think she slept out on Easter Sunday, but cannot be certain, but a padlock was on the door at eight o'clock on the morning of Easter Monday, and it was on when she went out the night before—I cannot say whether she slept out on any other night during the time she lodged in my house, but I believe she slept at her lodgings every night but Easter Sunday—the prisoner used to call to see her two or three times a week—on Monday morning, the 4th of April, I think about ten or eleven o'clock, he called to ask if he could have the room a fortnight or three weeks longer, because there was a mangle</p>

               <p>to be disposed of, and the bed she (Mrs. Good) would require for her use—he told me Mrs. Good was gone to her place, and would not return to her room again at all—the bed he was going to take to a gentleman's lodge where she was going to be—he had told me on the 21st of March, that she was to leave her room about the 4th of April, but he could not tell how soon she would have to leave, as she had got a situation to take care of a gentleman's lodge, about four miles from where he was then living as servant—he told me on the Monday he had come to take the little boy away to his mother, I mean Jane Good—I saw the boy that Monday evening, and the prisoner then took him away—on the Tuesday night, about ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner again—he went down into the kitchen—he brought the key with him—he said he had come to town with his family to a ball—I enquired how his wife was—he told me he had not seen her that day—I did not see him on the Wednesday night, but heard him come to the door and knock—my husband let him in—it was about twelve o'clock at night—I was in bed—I believe the kitchen-door opened.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barmaid at the Spotted Dog, in the Strand. On Thursday the 7th of April, the prisoner booked a quantity <hi rend="italic">of</hi> things there, and gave the name of Stanley—he said nothing more about them—he went away in a very few minutes, came back again about ten or half-past with a female, and went into the coffee-room with her—I cannot say how long they staid—they went away together and took all the things with them—I believe they went in a <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> but I did not see.</p>

                  </hi>. I was waiter at the Spotted Dog on Thursday, the 7th of April. I remember a man coming there in the morning—the pri<lb/>soner is that man—he had a female with him—they came into the tap-room—he had a beef steak in his hand, and asked me to cook it for him—I said I had a very bad fire and could not—he said, "I don't mind waiting, I am from Bristol"—I cooked the steak—they both sat down and ate it—they were very thick in conversation together—all the conversation I noticed was, he made a reply to the female, "That b—ch won't trouble you any more"—I am quite sure I heard the prisoner say that to the woman—I saw him go for a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—some things were put into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and some outside—they were all taken away—I did not see them start—he kept frequently going and outside the door—I suppose he went in and out seven or eight times while the steak was cooking, and while it was being eaten he went out twice—he was in the house about half-an-hour, and went out as much as eight times during that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Bromfield, a brush-maker, of 87, Bridge-house-place, Southwark. The prisoner was our porter for about eleven months. On the 15th of April, about a quarter after eight o'clock at night, I was in the warehouse, and in consequence of what Holi<lb/>day said to me I sent the prisoner out of the warehouse—he had a coat hanging on a nail in the warehouse—I saw this brush taken from the pocket by Ann Holiday when I had sent him out—I had desired him to leave and not return till Mr. Bromfield came back, but not coming back as soon as I expected, I gave him into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Mr. Bromfield was out of town. Mrs. Bromfield had some words with me on Friday; she did not charge me with taking the brush then, but on Friday night ordered me to come for my wages on Saturday night, which I did; but she would not give them to me; I did not leave till she did; she sent for two policeman to take me out of the premises; she said she discharged me because I took half-an-hour for breakfast in the morning. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not say so—up to two months ago we had the greatest confidence in him, but on Good Friday we went out to dinner, and the ser<lb/>vant told us he had taken some things out, a quantity of brushes—I men<lb/>tioned it to him, he said they had been gone out for orders; I looked at the day-book, and found it was not so—when he came on Saturday my husband had not returned, and I gave him in charge.</p>

On the 16th of April, about twelve o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner at Rose-villa, Well-street, Camberwell—he opened the front-gate, walked up the gravel-walk, went round into the back-yard, and shut the gate after him—I could not see him after that—he went round the end of the house—I waited about ten minutes, and then rung at the bell of the front-gate—Mrs. Philips opened the front-door—I told her what I had seen—I was taking a pint of beer to the house—she took the beer, and I went into the kitchen with her—I went out, and called Mr. Burrows to help me search the house—we searched the out-house, and bottom part of the house, and found nobody-Mrs. Philips and Mr. Burrows went up stairs together to look, and gave an alarm—Mr. Burrows and I and one Smith, went up stairs, and saw the prisoner in a bed-room, standing between the bed and the window—it was a quarter of an hour after I had seen him at the back-door—Mr. Philips was on the landing—we took the prisoner, and gave him into custody to Sergeant Dinn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and lodge at No. 6, Redcross-court, Borough—the prisoner's husband rents the house, and is my land<lb/>lord. On the night of the 26th of April he applied to my mother for a week's rent—she could not pay it—he went down to his room, and I heard the prisoner using very low language, and calling the old woman hard names—I said my mother did not look more like the names she called her than her mother did, and then she called me the names myself—I had a bit of potato in my hand eating, and I flung it at her—then she took the chopper from the side of her kitchen fire-place in her kitchen (I must go through the kitchen to get to my room) she said, the first one that came down the stairs that night she would chop their b——head off—my mother came and locked the door—about half-an-hour after I went down for some water, and saw her with the chopper in her hand—I said, "I think you are going to do what you said"—she said, "Yes, I intend to do it"—I said, "I will see whether my head will be chopped off or not," and then she gave me a violent blow on the forehead—I flinched back from it, and received it on the top of my head, and did not receive the violent blow she was going to give me, or it would have been straight down my face—it came lighter on me through my falling back—I fell to avoid the blow—I called my mother down, and said, "I am murdered by the chopper"—she came to my assistance, and I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Robert Goulding, a corn-merchant and warehouseman, carrying on business in Potter's Fields, St. John's, Southwark—I have lived with him thirty years—there is nobody but him in the firm—it is carried on as Robert Goulding and Son, but there is no<lb/>body but him in it. On the evening of the 12th of April, about seven o'clock, I was leaving the counting-house, and went round to the different doors to see that they were fast—on coming to the back-door of the warehouse, "B No. 1," I found the top part of the door open—I went up to the door and saw two men, each filling a bushel bag with beans—there was a balk of beans at the other end of the warehouse—I asked what they did there, and how they came there—one of them, not the prisoner, escaped almost immediately, so that I could not ascertain who he was—the prisoner came towards me and said it was all right—I said, "No, it is not all right," and asked what business they had there, and how they came in—he said it was all right, and endeavoured to make his escape—I was outside the door—the door was between us—I pushed him back and kept calling for the police—he attempted to come out at the top of the door—it is a divided door—the other man went to the other end of the warehouse, and I suppose must have dropped from the first-floor window—there was no other means of his get<lb/>ting away—before the policeman came the prisoner had made his escape into the other warehouse, and we went in search of him—I expect he knew the warehouse, and had been there before—the sack containing the beans was just outside the door where I saw him, ready to be carried away, besides the two sacks they were filling—the beans in the sack and bags corresponded in quality with those in the bulk—after securing the prisoner we went over the warehouse, and the following morning, about nine o'clock, I examined the back window and found one iron bar of the window standing in its proper position, but it was loose—anybody without could remove it to get in—the back-door of the warehouse was fastened from within—you could</p>

               <p>not get in at the back of the premises except by the window—the front part of the warehouse was fastened with a common lock, and the Queen's lock also—they were quite undisturbed—the back-window is about two yards from the ground—any body could get through the window and unfasten the back-door within—a man could not get out of the up stairs warehouse without dropping from the window, unless he had a ladder, and that was found—he could not get out at the lower window, because I stood there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher—the prisoner was my servant of all-work, and had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. On Sunday, the 24th of April I missed some things, which made me look to see if any thing else was gone, and I missed a sheet—I told her I would not be satisfied till I had got the sheet—in consequence of what she said to me I found the shirt, sheet, and two handkerchiefs at Mr. Turner's, a pawnbroker, in Walworth-road—I went there in consequence of seeing the duplicate in her hand—she said she had pawned the sheet—she was not willing for me to get it out, she wished to get it out herself—I said, "You have no money to get it out"—she said she would pawn some of her own things to get it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Austin's house. On the 5th of April, between three and four o'clock in the morning, before daybreak, I heard a knocking at the street-door—I knew Warren had got a key—Logden was stopping with her, I know, because I have seen her there—she was at home that night, because I heard her there—I did not see her—I could be positive it was her—I heard somebody in the room, and I bad' seen her on the stairs with Warren frequently—I cannot say she ever slept there—I saw her come down stairs next morning after ten, and spoke to her—after I heard the knocking at the door, I heard somebody get over the wall of the yard, and then heard somebody open the street-door within, and let somebody in—I could hear the footsteps of more than one person come in—I heard them go up stairs—I lodge in the parlour—Warren had the front room, over the parlour—I heard them walking about over my head—shortly after ten in the morning I saw the two male prisoners there—they came down stairs by themselves, and went out—I had never seen them before—the females were not with them—the shortest prisoner said, "Good morning"—I said, "Good morning"—they each bad a bundle, or ft coat, or jacket over their arm—my landlady called me up stairs about twenty minutes after that—I went up, and Logden was there—Mrs. Austin went to turn down the bed to see if the bed-clothes were right, and found these things there—I saw them found—next day we found a bag contain<lb/>ing some skeleton-keys, in a drawer, which the constable has—there was all sorts of keys.</p>
