The Gardener, upon his Defence, proved by Witnesses, that his Orchard had oftentimes been Robbed, and the Night before by three Soldiers, having sustained great Losses before; That the Gun was but a Birding-piece, and that he called out, Who is there? No body answering him, the Piece went off accidentally, and that he had been threatned to be kill'd by several Thieves before.

Upon that Indictment he hath been arraigned, and thereupon hath pleaded Not guilty; And for his Tryal hath put himself upon God and his Countrey, which Countrey you are. Your Charge is to enquire whether he be guilty of this Felony and Murther, whereof he stands indicted, or not guilty; If you find that he is guilty; you are to enquire what Goods and Chatels, Lands or Tenements he had at the time of the Felony and Murther committed, or at any time since. If you find him not guilty, you are to enquire whether he fled for it. If you find that he be fled for it, you are to enquire of his Goods and Chatels as if you found him guilty. If you find him not guilty, nor that he did fly for it, you are to say so, and no more, and hear your Evidence.</p>

But first let us begin with the occasion of this Misfortune; You must note, the Prisoner and the Deceased were of kin, and not only so, but very conversant together; Mr. Dodd had a Horse to sell, that the Prisoner had a mind to, so Mr. Dodd gave him leave to ride him; and if he liked the Horse, the price was to be 20 Guineas; having given the Groom a Guinea in earnest for the Horse. When he had so tried the Horse he complained to Mr. Dodd that the Horse stumbled; why, says Mr. Dodd, If it be so, Cousin Reppington, and you don't like him, I'll take him again; No, says the Prisoner, it may be the fault may be in the shoeing of him; I'll take him to my Farrier, and he shall look upon his Feet; Nay, repl'd Mr. Dodd, I wont agree to that; if you will be off of the Horse, let it be this Evening, or else tomorrow I shall expect you shall stand fast to the Bargain; to which Mr. Reppington seemed to yield; but after this he comes to the Groom, Mr. Dodd not being at home, and told him that the Horse, was not for his turn, and refused to pay Mr. Dodd for the Horse, upon which Mr. Dodd arrested him for the 20 Guineas, this relished so ill with the Prisoner, that he grew very angry, came to the Groom again at Mr Dodds House on the Friday before the Fact was done, and bid him tell his Master, That he was injured, and would have satisfaction, and that the Point of the Sword should decide the matter; and that he should be glad to meet him behind Montague House; and that he wore a Sword as well as he, &amp;c.</p>

                        targets="t16940830-51-off219 t16940830-51-cd224"/> last, the day that this unhappy Accident fell out, he came to the White Horse Inn in the Haymarket again, and there he was much indisposed, and lookt angry; and Mr. Dodd's Footman standing in the Inn Gate-way, waiting for his Master's calling him to go abroad, as also the Groom; Mr. Dodd immediately approached near them, and coming up towards Mr. Reppington, he very kindly saluted him with a How do you Cousin Reppington, I am your most humble Servant, putting his Hat off very low, with all the loving Respects imaginable; but Mr. Reppington made but little return of his Courtesie, only just mov'd his Hat, shewing a stern Countenance; thereupon Mr. Dodd came to him very mildly, took him by the Button in a friendly manner, desiring that the Quarrel might be friendly accommodated; Mr. Reppington replied, No, nothing but the point of the Sword shall decide the Controversie; immediately throwing off his Hat and Perriwig, giving a little back, and drew his Sword, with that Mr. Dodd drew his, and to't they went; Mr. Reppington making the first pass at Mr Dodd, which he put by, then Mr. Reppington came at him again, and he defending himself, Mr Reppington laid hold of his Sword with his hand, held it by, and so run him into the left Armhole in the mean time; Mr. Goodchild, and the Footboy and Groom, went to get a Dung-fork at the Stables, or elsewhere, or some such Instrument, to part them, and to beat down their Swords, but before they could come back, Mr. Dodd had received his mortal wound, and was dropt down dead the blood issuing out at his mouth; upon which Mr. Reppington immediately surrender'd himself to them, not offering to make the least flight, was carried before a Justice of Peace, and committed for the Fact, and was found guilty of murther upon the Coroner's Inquest. This was positively sworn by the groom and Footman, and by Mr. Goodchild.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner cross-examined the witness against him, and did all that in him lay to evade the proof; and called a poor Woman, who, he alledged, saw the whole matter; She declared, that she was accidentally going that way, and being weary, sat down upon the Bench at the Inn-Gate to rest her self, and turning her head into the Inn, she saw the Ingagement, and that Mr. Dodd gave the first Pass at Mr. Reppington, and drew his Sword first; But this was contradicted by Mr. Godchild, and the Footman and Groom; who further deposed, that they saw no such Woman there, and were very confident that there was no Woman at all there at that Juncture of time; The Prisoner, after he had been very much indulged, and very patiently heard by the Court, made his defence, declaring that the Deceased was his beloved Friend, and that he had no malice propense against him, Lamenting the loss, of so precious a Friend; then he called abundance of Witnesses, and those Persons of no mean Quality, to give a testimony of him, in the general, as to his Conversation heretofore, who all agreed in their declaration concerning him; how that he was a person of a very quiet, composed behaviour, and that they never saw any thing come from him, but what was like a Gentleman; and if he had at any time injured any person, he always begged their pardon, and made ample satisfaction. That they never found him to be quarrelsome. He pleaded very strenuously for himself, took up a great deal of time (viz.) the space of 6 or 7 hours; the Court very patiently hearing him all that he had to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16940830006"/> Then the Court summ'd up the Evidence on both sides to the Gentlemen of the Jury very distinctly, with all tenderness on behalf of the Prisoner, and told them (first) that it was certain that Mr. Dodd was kill'd by Mr. Reppington: But then the question was, what it would amount to in point of Law? Whether to Murther or Manslaughter, according to Evidence that had been given against Mr. Reppington? And that the Court were of the opinion, That if Mr. Reppington out of any precedent disgust or malice that he had against Mr. Dodd, did design to fight him, and in pursuance thereof draw'd his Sword with which he kill'd him, it was murther. But however, they were to be Judges of the Fact; So that if so be that they found that the Prisoner was guilty of the murther of Mr. Dodd, they would find a Verdict accordingly; but if not satisfied in their Consciences, that he did do it with any disgust or premeditated malice, then they should acquit him of the murther, and find him guilty only of Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>Then the Gentlemen of the Jury having considered of the matter for about two hours time, they returned this Verdict, That Mr. Reppington was <rs id="t16940830-51-verdict225" type="verdictDescription">

            </rs> of wilful Murther upon this Indictment, as also upon the Coroner's Inquest. Then the Prisoner was remanded to Newgate.</p>
