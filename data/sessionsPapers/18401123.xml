On the 7th of November, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner take a piece of cloth from a shelf within the doorway of the prosecutor's shop, and walk off about two yards with it—I laid hold of him, and asked what he was going to do with it—he said, "To look at it"—I took him inside, and an officer was sent for—he had got quite clear into the street, and had passed about three panes of the next shop—he was coming down the hill and met me—the cloth was nearly all folded up but about a yard—he had it in his left arm, and was Walking along.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at No. 4, Park-terrace, Islington, and am a member of the College of Surgeons—I am acquainted with the prisoner and Mrs. Pearse likewise—her Christian name is Elizabeth. On the 16th of October they lived at No. 23, Bedford-place, Kensington—I called on them there about one or two o'clock that day, and found them at home—I staid dinner with them—we sat down to dinner about two o'clock—the table was in the centre of the room—there is a conservatory behind the room, and opposite the conservatory at the other end of the room is a window—Mr. Pearse sat down at the bottom of the table with his back towards the conser<lb/>vatory—Mrs. Pearse sat opposite to him with her back to the window—I was sitting on Mrs. Pearse's left-hand with my back to the fire, and my right-hand to Mr. Pearse—there was a sofa on the other side opposite me—we sat down to dinner—I was helped to a mutton-chop, which I passed to Mrs. Pearse—I took the next plate that was offered, containing a mutton-chop—Mr. Pearse took a portion of a chop himself—he put two portions into his mouth at separate times, and spat each portion out of his mouth</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230021"/>
               <p>on to the plate—he then got up suddenly, and said it was sultry, that he was suffocating, and the window must be opened—he rushed to the win<lb/>dow, passing on the side opposite to me where the sofa was—when he get to the window he stood behind Mrs. Pearse, and I heard him exclaim, "you have been poisoning me for some time," or, "Some days, I shall be dead in three days"—I then heard the report of a pistol—he was at that time standing close behind her—I saw a flash behind Mrs. Pearse on her left side, and heard her cry out, "Save me," of "Protect me," or some such ex<lb/>pression—she then slipped from the chair on which she had been sitting—I immediately jumped up, and stood face to face with Mr. Pearse, and endea<lb/>voured to occupy his attention while Mrs. Pearse escaped—the crawled from her position on the ground to the conservatory behind—I did not see any pistol at the time—I asked the prisoner if it was real, or meant as a feint—he said, "No"—I said, "What, loaded?"—he said, "Yes, by G—d"—I then went into the conservatory after Mrs. Pearse, and saw her in the garden—she had descended the steps of the conservatory—I then went back into the room—I found Mr. Pearse still there—he was very much agitated, and struck his head with his band—he said he was poisoned, and should be dead in three days—I then looked out of the window, and saw Mrs. Pearse in the road—I went out to her, and found the cook with her—I observed her dress was smouldering like tinder—she cried out to extinguish the fire, which I did—she was then taken to a medical man—I returned to the house, went into the nursery, and saw the children—Mr. Pearse was not in the nursery—he was in the parlour—he asked where Mrs. Pearse was gone, and I told him—I asked to see the pistol—he ob<lb/>jected at first, but on my pressing he showed it to me—I found it had been discharged, and returned it to him—I then went to Mr. Taylor's—the pri<lb/>soner followed me—I found Mr. Taylor at' home, and had some conversa<lb/>tion with him and Mr. Pearse—Mr. Pearse then left Mr. Taylor's—I did not follow him—I think I remained at Mr. Taylor's with Mr. Pearse near half-an-hour—he left the house first—I followed Mr. Taylor's son, who went for a policeman—I did not return to Mr. Pearse's.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many children has this unfortunate gentleman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three—he has been married, I fancy, four years—I believe the youngest is a baby at the breast—Mr. Pearse was at home when I went there—he opened the door to me—the eldest little boy was present at the dinner-table—I believe he is turned three years of age—he was in the room at the time Mr. Pearse discharged the pistol, but was not at the table—he was on the opposite side of the table to me—it is a moderate sized parlour—he was at the right band side of his mother, close to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any thing about the apartment, or in the atmosphere, to warrant the supposition that he was in a state of suffocation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The day was certainly a very close one—I cannot explain his feelings—I knew Mrs. Pearse before her marriage, and have known her during the four years she has been married—I have never observed any thing in her con<lb/>duct to warrant any conclusion, but that she was a tender, affectionate, and kind-hearted mother and wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And the unfortunate gentleman himself, when collected, was he a kind father, and affectionate to his children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My visits were at such long intervals, and so short, I have not had the opportunity of judging, but I never saw the contrary—he never showed me his boots for the pur<lb/>pose</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230022"/>
               <p>of having my opinion whether they had been saturated with arsenic or not—I had no idea that there was any thing like poison in what we had for dinner—I had partaken of a portion—there was nothing to excite such a suspicion—the chops were well cooked, and in an ordinary manner—there appeared nothing in Mrs. Pearse's conduct to justify any excitement or violence in him—my visits there were at long intervals, twice this year—I have not seen Mrs. Pearse since this—I am decidedly of opinion that she is in every respect an irreproachable and well conducted person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> A view appears to be taken of my case by both parties, which I hope to prove to the Court is perfectly unfounded—I wish to put a few questions to the witness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> After Mrs. Pearse went into the conservatory, and you followed her, do you remember what she said? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think there was any exchange of words—when she got into the garden she said she was shot—she might have said, "He is mad—he is always mad, "but very indistinctly, if she did—I think it is not at all unlikely, but I am not very quick of hearing—I do not remember her passing through the par<lb/>lour from the garden—I know I saw her in the street when I returned from the back of the house to the front parlour, and I said to you, "There is Mrs. Pearse."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She went into the garden, and returned up the conservatory steps into the parlour, and in doing that she must of necessity have passed me—there was no means of her getting into the street except through the parlour, and if it was my intent to do her any serious injury, or any bodily harm, could I not have effected that purpose when she' passed within two feet of me? Just previous to my entering the room you were having a conversation with Mrs. Pearse, of a particular nature, will you be good enough to state what that conversation was; I heard the termination of it, which threw me into the state of excitement in which I was—I heard a few concluding words, which showed me what the nature of the conver<lb/>sation was; was not Mrs. Pearse putting questions to you as to the preg<lb/>nancy of her sister, Mrs. C——? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Not a word—I will swear it—I have heard reports of your jealousy of a person, but I do not know the Individual you allude to, without you point him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> May I be permitted to name the individual I suspect? my jealousy of him is notorious to my whole house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any reason from any thing you know, to place the slightest reliance on those reports? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None whatever—it appears that they have been circulated by Mr. Pearse himself—I do not believe there is the slightest foundation for any such supposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> But you do not believe, I presume, that I do not believe it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot answer that—no conversation took place between Mrs. Pearse and myself respecting what you have said—I most decidedly say it must be a delusion altogether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> My Lord, the name of this person must be produced, I have no hesitation in saying, because that is the main feature on which I ground my defence, and the unfortunate cause of this desperate assault; the gen<lb/>tleman I allude to, is Mr. R——B——C——he is the person who I have every reason to believe has been instrumental in seducing my wife's affections entirely from me, and leaving me in the wretched state in which you see me here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in Mr. Pearse's service. I received Mrs. Pearse's clothes, I observed marks of burning under one of the arms—I searched the dining-room that evening, to try if I could find any shot, but found none—next morning I trod on something, which turned out to be a bullet—I gave it to Mr. and Mrs. C——the policeman has it—I know where my mistress had been sitting—the bullet was near her place, near the window.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you recollect, a few nights before the unfortunate occurrence took place, my having a dispute with Mrs. Pearse, relative to some silver plate, which was not in the house, I begged of Mrs. Pearse, and importuned her to let me see into the box—if the plate was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You did desire her to let you see into the box, you said you thought it was her intention to run away in the morning, and take the plate with her—she would not suffer you to look into the box till the morning—she did not call you a nasty stinking old beggar—she said you were mad to ask her to open the box at that time of night, she bad no objection in the morning—that was between eleven and twelve o'clock, when they were going to bed—mistress had gone up to bed—she did not call you a pock<lb/>marked wretch, and an ugly old hound—Grace, the nursery-maid, did not say that when Mr. C——visited at the house he was mistress's friend, and not master's—you always kept your bed-room door locked, and would not permit any body but me to make the bed—your jealousy of Mr. C—was not notorious to my knowledge—I never beard it mentioned in the kitchen by the servants—I never heard it from the girl who left—I never heard that it was feared, three or four weeks before this happened, that your son John had swallowed a bullet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in High-street, Kensington. On Friday, the 16th of October, between two and three o'clock in the day, Mrs. Pearse was brought to ray house—I had her taken up-stairs and stripped, and found there was a pistol-shot on the left side, under the arm-pit—I do not mean that I found the actual shot there, but the explosion of gunpowder, and a great deal of coagulated blood—it was black for two inches round—the clothes were burnt—I attempted to probe the wound, but found nothing had entered it—it was quite super<lb/>ficial, and a slight wound—the prisoner came to my house soon after, and appeared very agitated indeed—he asked whether Mrs. Pearse was hurt—I said, "Yes" (this was not in her presence, but down stairs)—he was very anxious to go up, very importunate indeed—I refused to let him—he said she had been poisoning him, and they should both be dead in about three days, or that be should be dead in about three days—as he importuned so much to go up, I felt in his pocket, and found a pistol—I examined it, and it had been recently discharged—I returned it to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four years—I attended his wife with three children, and have seen a good deal of him—he was in a very ill state of health from about October last year, to January this year, and he was ill previous to that in 1838—he was attended on the last occasion by Dr. Marshall Hall, Sir Charles Scudamore, Dr. Kerrison, and myself—I cannot define what his illness was, more than general excitement, first on one subject, and then another, particularly about the state of his heart—he complained very much of his heart, and I consider it excited his mind—he was in a very disturbed state of mind—there certainly was fever, which I thought of the rheumatic order—in the course of my professional attendance on him I found he had occasional delusions on given subjects—in my opinion he was wrong in his opinion of his disease—he went to excess in the opinion of his complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was his delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He thought his disease more important than it was—he considered he should die, and he had sleepless nights—I thought there was no foundation for it—I considered that he was labouring under a great deal of nervous excitement—that state existed nearly the whole time I was attending him—he used to say he and Mrs. Pearse did not agree, but nothing else—of course I wished to keep his mind off those things, as I consider they add to the excitement—he did not seem under excitement as to his wife's conduct—he did not speak of her conduct in particular, but said, unfortunately they did not agree—I have had opportunities of observing Mrs. Pearse's conduct in many in<lb/>stances—her conduct was unexceptionable, as far as I know—I never saw any thing to justify any suspicion—I have seen him in bursts of crying—he would come to my house and talk of his indisposition, and suddenly burst out crying.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you remark on the unfeeling conduct of Mrs. Pearse in leaving me entirely to the servant, never coming into my room even to inquire Low I was, nor come to give me medicine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe the</p>

               <p>question was first put to me by you, and I replied, it Was unfeeling, but I was not privy to the fact—I think I once found Mrs. Pearse in your room when I called, but there was a servant in constant attendance on you—I was only there occasionally—I attended you for nearly six weeks the last time—Dr. Kerrison was there when 1 saw Mrs. Pearse in your room—I cannot tell whether she came in at his desire—you have told me Mrs. Pearse had independent property of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—you have com<lb/>plained of Mrs. Pearse persisting in dipping her children in cold water in the winter, and making them ill by it, but I did not know it for a fact—I think, as a medical man and a husband, what you said ought to have been attended to on such a point—the children are quite well now—I have not seen Mrs. Pearse for a fortnight—I believe she is at Kennington—the children are at home with the servants, except the infant—that is with Mrs. Pearse—you did not tell me of Mrs. Pearse cutting your cheek open with a stick at Boulogne, soon after your marriage—I have called you in to assist me with your advice, as a medical man, when Dr. Kerrison was attending a young man who had mortification in his arm—I have called you in to see three of my patients—one was a person who fell down sud<lb/>denly with cholera—I never heard the servants say that Mrs. Pearse had threatened to send you to die in a mad-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant Between eleven and twelve o'clock, on Friday the 16th of October, I was at the station-house—Mr. Pearse came to me, and said be wished to see me in private, as he had something to state of a painful nature—I heard him in private—he stated that he fancied Mrs. Pearse had been endeavouring to poison him by putting poison into his coffee, and also into his pudding, and he asked me to go and search her boxes—he laid although he had not any proof he felt so unwell for the last fortnight from palpitation of the heart—I told him I thought it was only fancy—he said he fancied his sheets bad been damped when he slept apart from Mrs. Pearse—he thought they had been sprinkled with water in the day-time, that he might catch cold by it—I told him it was a case I could not interfere in, and he must apply to a solicitor—between two and three o'clock the same day I received information, in</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in Mr. Pearse's service for four years, and left five months ago—I had opportunities of observing the manner in which Mr. Pearse conducted himself—he was sometimes quiet in his conduct—he was very irritable at times—I have seen him in a passion and violent, but that was very seldom—he was very often irritable—I have heard him say he thought the sheets of his bed were damped in the former part of the day, and that Mrs. Pearse had done it—he did not say why he thought so—he always kept his bed-room door locked, and did not permit persons to go in to clean it—on the Friday before I came out of the house he took his bed off the bedstead, and put it down on the floor—he did not say why he did that—he brought a bed out of the servant's room up stairs instead—he brought it down to his own room with my help—he said he wished to have it changed—I suppose he thought I had damped the bed on the Friday, because he would not suffer me in the bed-room after I had scrubbed the room that Friday—the room was in a filthy state through his not allowing any one to go in and clean it—I once heard him say he thought Mrs. Pearse had damped the bed—that was about two months before I left—I do not remember hearing him express any other suspicions against Mrs. Pearse—as far as I could judge she appeared to be attentive and affectionate—there was no foundation for supposing she had damped his bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Bell-yard, Carey-street. I have known the prisoner many yean—his first wife was my cousin—I have been on friendly terms with him and his wife—I remember his illness at the latter end of last year—I have observed a very consider<lb/>able change in him since then—I always thought him particularly mild in his conduct until after that illness, and since that he has appeared remark<lb/>ably irritable on very slight occasions—I never heard until very lately that he entertained any suspicions of his wife—very lately I heard him say he suspected she had put arsenic into his boots from the colour of his stock<lb/>ings—he said they were of a reddish brown—since this charge he has several times expressed a belief of his wife's infidelity to him, repeatedly within the last fortnight—he mentioned Mr. C——as the person to whom lie attributed the seduction of his wife—I think he said he suspected her with other persons also—I have observed the conduct of Mrs. Pearse to<lb/>wards him—she always appeared to me a kind affectionate mother—Mr. Pearse always appeared to be nervously anxious about his children—if they cried he always thought she did not pay sufficient attention to them, and appeared to be in a great state of excitement—his excitement did not appear at all warranted by the cause assigned—I told him the contrary—when he is self-possessed and collected, he is remarkably quiet—he was always fond of pistols from a youth—I believe he used to practise shoot<lb/>ing at a mark—I know he had pistols when he was a medical student—In ever observed him guilty of any violent acts towards persons, except towards Mrs. Pearse, he appeared violently irritable on slight occasions—in my judgment there has been no foundation for that irritability—the time I saw him most violently excited was when a child was crying, and he said, "I know you are not having that child attended to properly"—she maid, "Don't fidget about it, I have told the girl to attend to it"—he ap<lb/>peared dreadfully excited at being answered in that manner, and said Mrs. Pearse would not care if the children were dead—this was about the begin<lb/>ning of last year—he continued to fancy himself ill, but I thought he was well—that was after he bad been taken ill—I did not call there again for six months, I felt so much hurt at what I saw; and when 1 called again a few months ago I told him I was glad to see him in such good health—he said, "Yes, my health is better, but I am as I was when you saw me before, in dreadful excitement"—Mr. and Mrs. C——are very respectable people—I do not believe there is the slightest foundation for his suspicions of his wife's infidelity, or that she intended to poison or do him any injury.</p>

                  </hi>. M. D. I know Mr. Pearse. I have attended him professionally on two occasions. On the 18th of October, last year, I paid my first visit to him, and attended him, as well as I can remember, about a fortnight, regularly—I called to make inquiry occasionally after<lb/>wards—my last memorandum of a visit, is the 2nd of April this year—at the latter end of last year I found him labouring under much general fever, much heat of skin, a very loaded tongue, a full and quickened pulse, a countenance exhibiting considerable wildness of expression, and the eyes suffused, with considerable redness—he represented that his heart was the seat of disease, and complained of violent palpitation, which he said was sometimes so excessive that he thought it would burst—he was persuaded that he had a dangerous state of disease of the heart, and he thought he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230028"/>
               <p>might die suddenly—he described that he had been wholly deprived of sleep for several nights—I examined him carefully, both by queries and by my eye, to ascertain whether his representations were correct or not—I exercised my best judgment in the remedies I applied for the complaint, but the result of my opinion was, that there was not the disease he sus<lb/>pected, namely, an organic affection of the heart—the action of the heart, it is true, was very unnaturally increased, but I thought that the brain was the chief seat of morbid excitement—I had not been made acquainted with his delusion respecting his wife's infidelity, or attempts to destroy him; if I bad known it, it would certainly have strengthened my opinion that the brain was the seat of disease—I treated him regularly for a fortnight—after that my opinion was that there was a general and very marked disturbance of the whole nervous system, indicated by the remarkable absence of sleep on most nights, by the most gloomy state of spirits, by the most unreason<lb/>able ideas of the nature of his case, having still a fixed persuasion that his heart was incurably diseased, notwithstanding his acute fever had passed away in consequence of the treatment I had employed; in fact, he passed into the chronic state of the same malady—all that I saw wrong with regard to his mind, related to his own disease, of which he had the strongest misconception—I did not perceive any act of his denoting de<lb/>rangement, but from the state in which I left him, it was probable his mind would be affected.</p>

               <p>blood does not of necessity bring on a nervous disorder—I considered the indication of the brain, at my first visit, to be of an inflammatory nature, and with which I thought the heart sympathised—I judged it expedient and necessary to direct the removal of blood—although you never re<lb/>covered, you got into a better state of health—the medicines were admi<lb/>nistered on the same view of the disease as that on which I directed the abstraction of blood—it was not to be expected, that in the highly irritable and disturbed state in which you were, you should coincide in opinion with me—except as related to your disorder, I did not find any irregularity of mind—but on my visits the conversation was confined to your case—we did not discuss general subjects—you did not put me in possession of any opinion you entertained of the infidelity of Mrs. Pearse, nor of her doing you any harm.</p>

I have suspected him some time, and on the 28th of October I was in search of some pork, and found one piece secreted in the middle of a truss of hay in a loft over the stable—that part of the premises can only be entered through the house—I marked it in presence of my foreman, and replaced it—the prisoner asked to go home that day, and when he went out the policeman apprehended him in my presence—I saw the piece of pork taken from inside the waist<lb/>band of his trowsers—as he was going to the station-house be turned to me, and said, "Master, I hope you won't be hard with me."</p>

On the 26th of October, the prisoner came to ask the price of two figures in the window—my attention was taken to a person at the door, and as I turned I saw the prisoner drop his hand—I said, "You have taken something"—he denied it—I said, "You have, don't tell me a story"—I took hold of his hand, and saw a paper in his pocket—I took it, and it contained these twenty-four large glass drops, which are my brother-in-law's, and had been on the counter.</p>

The prisoner took a lodging of us on Tuesday, the 4th of October—she was out all night on the 22nd, and I let her in about ten minutes to seven o'clock in the morning of the 23rd, with a large bundle—I said it was a very wrong thing of a young woman to stay out all night, and mine was a respectable house, I should not allow it—she said she been to a labour all night with a cousin, and that these things belonged to her sister; and she took them from her cousin's, thinking they would not be safe there, as they had got a nurse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the G division of police. On the 9th of November I went to No. 11, Carrier-street, St. Giles's, with Fink and Farrell—I went into the yard of the house, up some wooden steps to a room detached from the house—I found the room-door with a padlock outside, which was locked—we broke into the room, and found the three prisoners sitting in front of a very clear fire on a small bench—Coates was in the centre—they immediately stood up—Coates had something in his hand which he dashed into a tub of water—he then stooped, and put his hand into the tub—he pulled it out again, and his hand was all white with plaster of Paris—I emptied the water out of the tub, and found a quantity of plaster of Paris at the bottom, which I put into a cup—I found these two pieces of metal in front of the fire-places-one was so hot I could scarcely hold it—</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Saffron-court, Safffron-hill; the prisoner and her husband live in Onslow-street. On the 8th of November I was there—there was a fight between me and her husband—we were both drunk—the prisoner came to his assistance, and scratched my face—I turned round and struck her in the eye, and gave her a black eye—the landlord came up and sent for a policeman; and when he came I put my hand to my face, and found it was bloody, and there was a wound in it—I do not know who gave me that wound—I saw the prisoner strike me in the face, then draw her band back and put it behind her, and the policeman took a knife out of her hand—it was two or three minutes after I gave her the black eye that I found I was wounded—I went to Greville-street Hospital—the surgeon told me to bathe my face in hot water and come to him next day at one o'clock, which I did—he exa<lb/>mined the cheek, and the cut was through it—it got well in four or five days—I did not call her any names.</p>

On Tuesday morning I was washing in the back-kitchen, and saw the pri<lb/>soner up and down stairs several times, and on Monday evening, the 2nd of November, as well—he was very tipsy—I had a great deal of linen about, and seeing the prisoner about I asked my husband for the key of the kitchen to lock it up, as I did not like his appearance—about half-past eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning he went up to the top of the house without any shoes on, and was gone about twenty minutes—Clifford lodges at the top of the house—he came down, put his shoes on, and went out of doors—I never saw him again till he was in custody—another man was taken to the station-house on suspicion, and I told them I had seen the prisoner go up without any shoes on.</p>

Last Monday I was passing the Angel inn, about nine o'clock, and saw a cart standing there loaded with linen—I saw two soldiers pass—one of the two made a stop at the cart—I walked on, looked back, and saw one of them take something out of the cart—I cannot say what it was—I met a boy, and told him, "These young men seem to be tipsy, and they have taken something out of the cart, I wish I could see the person belonging to it"—I went over, and told the prosecutor—he came out, looked under the basket in the cart, and said, "A loaf"—I went on when I heard it was only a loaf—they appeared tipsy, and were laughing and <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> at the time.</p>

I have one shop in Cow-cross-street, and another in Monmouth-street, which is attended to by my son and daughter—the prisoner has been in my service for three or four months—the shop in Monmouth-street communicates with the bakehouse, by two trap-doors, one of which is in constant use, and the other not in ordinary use—I was not aware that it could be opened—on the 3rd of November, in consequence of information, I marked some copper-money, in the presence of my son and daughter—I gave it into my daughter's hand, saw her put it on the mantel-piece, and told her to put it into the till the last thing at night—it was the prisoner's duty to work during the night in the bakehouse, and to call my son when the bread was ready—his usual time of coming was eleven o'clock at night.</p>

Weight of copper money in the till over-night, and 1lb. weight was missing—I did not ascertain what amount in value there was, but I weighed it, which is my invariable practice—the money was not marked on both sides—I know of no quarrel between my son and the prisoner, of any consequence—I never heard of any thing of the kind till since this occurrence—I have been told by the prisoner's friends that ray son has taken this <hi rend="italic">plea</hi> against him out of spite—persons who are working together will occasionally have words, but I never knew there was any serious dispute, or any fighting, nothing more than ordinary words.</p>

About nine o'clock on the morning of the 31st of October he came to me, and said there was a cart coming up loaded with wood, that he had got a pass for it, and, it was all right—he then went away—the cart came up, and Dawes presented the pass to me—I read it—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Allow the bearer of this to pass the gate with some old wood from the yacht <hi rend="italic">Zariffa.</hi>

On Friday, the 30th of October, I was going up Poplar, and met Wade—he said he had some old wood in the Dock, would I buy it—I said, "What does it consist of?"—he said, "Chiefly of fire wood"—I said, "Is there about as much as is now on the cart?"—he said, "No, about the body of the cart full"—I said it would not be worth more than 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to me—when I got home I found James standing at my door—he said he had some wood given to him in the Dock, would I buy it—I said, "What is it?"—he said, "Chiefly fire wood"—I said I had been spoken to by a person in Poplar—he said it was the same thing—I said I could give him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I went to the Docks the next morning at half-past eight o'clock—I saw James, and Wade a little distance from him—James said, "Hoy! go round to the other side of the Dock, I will come to you"—there was a pile of wood near the barque <hi rend="italic">Zariffa,</hi> and the way James sent me was away from that pile—I went round, and waited till James came—he unlocked the door of a shed, went through, and told me to back the cart up to the door at the other end of the shed—when I did so I saw Wade coming up the shed—there was some wood in the shed, and a truck with one or two lumps of iron cantlins on it—James took hold of the handle of the truck—I said, "Are they going in the cart?"—James said, "Yes, I have had them given me"—I got into the cart, and the iron was handed in to me by both the prisoners, and then they handed up the wood to me—I deal in iron as well as wood—the wood was taken from the shed, not from the <hi rend="italic">Zariffa</hi>—I did not notice the lifting-jack being put in the cart—Wade gave me this pass—I paid James 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the wood—Wade then said, "Now about the iron; these two pieces weigh 3cwt.;</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. Lewis Raphael, who lives at the late Mr. Mellish's place, at Bush-hill. The prisoner has been in his em<lb/>ploy since January—I had made a communication to the police before the 19th of October—the bulk of wheat which we had in the barn has been sold, but subsequent to the committal of the prisoner a man found a sack</p>

               <p>of wheat concealed under the sheaves in the barn—I have taken a sample of the wheat in that sack, and compared it with the wheat found in the prisoner's house—it tallies in every respect with that, and with the wheat we had—it is Talavera wheat, which is not much grown—there had been some barley sown in the ground, and there are a great many seeds in this, more than is usual in wheat—there are the same appearances in each of these samples, and I hare no doubt of its being Mr. Raphael's—this was not threshed in the barn which the prisoner was at work in, but in a barn on the other side of the yard, by the prisoner's brother, but he could go to that barn when he pleased—in gleaned wheat the seeds of barley would not appear—I can state certainly that this is not gleaned wheat—this sack with the name of Murray on it, and which contained the wheat found at the prisoner's, came to Mr. Raphael's from Spitalfields-market in exchange for one of his own—these other three sacks, found under the prisoner's bed, I have no doubt are Mr. Raphael's—they are of foreign manufacture—we purchased sixty of them in Smithfleld—they are not made of hemp, but of some foreign produce, and are much larger than the usual size—the prisoner knew that such sacks were on the farm—he has filled such sacks with torn very often—three sacks had been missed on the Thursday week before, out of six which had been taken to the potato-field to be filled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Sampson Low, a bookseller, in Lamb's Conduit-street. On the 12th of November, 1839, the prisoner came into the shop and gave me a note, which was fictitious, from a person in Ely-place, and asked for a prospectus—I went to ask my father what answer I should give, and was not absent half a minute, I returned and caught sight of the prisoner's coat going out of the door—I missed four volumes which had been under my eye while speaking to him—we have never recovered them—I had not seen him before, but about three months ago he brought in a note in the same handwriting as before—I did not serve him, but just caught sight of him as he was going out of the door—I went out, but was too late to catch him—he came again on the 10th of November with another note in the same handwriting—lean swear that he is the person who came in November last year.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow. I lately lived at No. 2, Hampshire Hog-yard, St. Giles's—the upper rooms and the kitchen are let out to men and their wives—I knew the deceased—she told me her name was Mary Nicholls, but that was not her real name, it was Rachel Selway—the prisoner and the deseased lived together, and slept in the same bed—I slept in the same room—the deceased was thirty-one years old—she was in perfect health the night this happened—on Sunday evening, the 18th of October, she came home at seven o'clock, and remained in the room a few minutes, and went out again—I saw her come up stairs again about twelve or one o'clock—she was rather in liquor—I saw her, but really did not notice whether she appeared beaten or bruised then—she did not complain of any thing of the kind to me—she came to bed to me—after she had been in bed some time, the pri<lb/>soner came in—I cannot recollect whether the door was open, or whether he had any difficulty in getting in—he came into the room, and commenced beating her with the broom-stick—he said nothing first that I heard—I had been in bed and asleep—she said, "James, don't beat me any more, I am innocent"—he said, "I will learn you to speak against me while I am in the country"—I said to him, "James, don't beat her any more, or else you will kill her"—he answered, "Mind your own business, what is it to you?" and then called her a b—w—, and told her she was a w—in her heart—with that he went and looked out of window for a few moments,</p>

               <p>and then returned back again towards the bed—he then went down stairs, and went out for about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, he came back again, wrenched the leg from the table, and commenced beating her with that again on her head, and arms, and shoulder—she groaned and seemed as if she was insensible with the pain—she did not utter many words, and was faint from the blood she had shed, and altogether—she laid on the floor—she had struggled out of bed to get out of his way, and the prisoner asked me to lift her into bed—I said I had not got strength to lift her in—he lifted her into bed himself and I covered her over with the bed-clothes—the prisoner laid himself down, and slept on the floor—the deceased went to sleep, and so did I for some time—in the morning I awoke, and got up about seven or eight o'clock, and he took off his shoes and jacket, and laid down by the side of her—he asked me to get up and light a fire, and get some water to wash the blood from her face—I got up immediately, and said to him, "I wish you would get up, I want to look for some money to get her something, for I think she must be very faint"—she said she was very bad, and very full of pain—the prisoner said, "It is not half bad enough for you"—he got up and went down stairs to a young woman named Sarah Bradbury, who came up—he did not come with her—she went down again and fetched up some warm water, and with my assistance, and Grace Cons, we washed the blood from her face—we then got her out of bed, and changed her shift, which bad a great deal of blood on it—we had a hard matter to get her out of bed, because she complained of her arm, and we told her that <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> was comings—the prisoner returned into the room while we had her out of bed—she would not let us change her shift or any thing without his being present—he desired it, and then she con<lb/>sented to it—after that, we got her into bed again—somebody went to see for a doctor, but none came, and then Bradbury said they would take her to the hospital—the prisoner was in the room when she was taken to the hospital—I went with her to the Middlesex hospital—I did not go and see her while she was there.</p>

I remember the deceased being brought in—I observed a severe con<lb/>tused wound on the scalp, and a wound on the right cheek, two wounds on the head, and one on the top of the left ear—they were all contused wounds—there was a hair pin stuck in between the scalp and bone, as if it had been driven in by force—I extracted it—it did not penetrate the bone—her face was very much bruised and swollen, and also her left eye, she could not see out of it—the wounds had, no doubt, bled—there was a slight quantity of blood trickled down the cheek—the left arm was very much bruised and swollen, and the upper part of the arm very black, and one of the bones of the left fore arm fractured—it was the larger of the two bones—the right arm was also much bruised and swollen, but not so much as the other, and there was a compound fracture of the right little finger—both sides of the chest were much bruised and black—the pulse could not be felt because the arm was so much swollen—they were such injuries as could be inflicted by blows from a stick or piece of wood—I at<lb/>tended her till her death, which was on Wednesday, the 21st—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on opening the skull there was no particular appearance, no effusion between the membrane and bone, but at the surface of the brain the vessels were very much congested with blood—the chest was next opened—the left lung was very much congested, and there was adhesion to the membrane lining of the chest—the right long was slightly congested, not so much as the left—the adhesion denoted old in<lb/>flammation, not recent—the heart was quite healthy—the liver was very much enlarged, and had a nutmeg appearance, which is peculiar to persons drinking ardent spirits—the other organs of the abdomen were all healthy—there was an effusion of coagulated blood on the muscles covering the outside of the chest—I attribute her death to the injuries received—she died from exhaustion of the vital powers.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230090"/>
               <p>wound in the scalp alone was quite sufficient to cause death—I do not mean to say it must have done it—that wound went on favourably to the last—there was a slight disposition to slough—there must have been more sloughing than I saw, to produce death—I am certain the wounds on the head alone were not the cause of death—the vessels of the brain are congested during intoxication—the fracture of the little finger and the breaking of the large bone of the arm would not of themselves cause death—the wounds on the cheek and left ear would not cause death primarily—they might produce erysipelas, but it was not produced in this case—it might in a bad patient—on the whole, with respect to the wounds, she was a good patient—she had one small dose of morphia on the first night—she had none on the second night, because it was not necessary to give it her, on account of the head—symptoms might have been made worse probably—the opium did not deaden the powers of life—it at first produces a stimulating effect, and afterwards a sedative—it caused her to sleep at first—on the following morning after the sleep she was better—a very large dose of opium will produce great prostration of strength, a small dose will not—the effect, of course, depends on whether the patient is accustomed to take it—one accustomed to it would not feel the effect of a slight dose—a slight dose to one not accustomed to take it would not deaden the powers of life—she had two drachm doses of liquid opium—she was much better on the Tuesday—she appeared better on Tuesday night—I thought every thing was going on favourably, but at half-past ten or eleven o'clock next morning I took off the dressing of the head, and observed the pupil of the eye very much dilated—she had been delirious during Tuesday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now the exhaustion of the vital powers of which she died might have been produced by a person of drunken habits falling down, and lying on the cold stones, might it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That depends according to what length of time she laid on the stones—when she was brought in she appeared a good deal exhausted and cold—lying on cold stones on a cold night would be very likely to produce death—but she recovered from the effect of cold three or four hours after she was admitted—it might paralyze although she rallied, but it did not in this case—I never saw a case where a person received such a shock, rallied and then sunk under it—the liver had the appearance of that of a person who drank very freely—the system of persons who drink very freely sinks much sooner—they cannot stand the shock which a healthy person can.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stay maker, living in High-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner was in ray service for two years and a half, and managed the busi<lb/>ness when Mrs. Moss was unable to attend—from what I heard in October last, I went to Mr. Aaron, a pawnbroker in Whitechapel, and found four<lb/>teen pairs of stays belonging to me—I said to the prisoner, "I have dis<lb/>covered fourteen pairs of stays pawned, you have done it?"—she said, "Me! how can you suppose I have done it, who have been so anxious to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230097"/>
               <p>do your business, and run about every where?"—I gave her in charge—she made no discoveries to me respecting the other stays—I heard about some other stays from the policeman, and the prisoner's mother said, in her presence, "Mary, do tell Mr. Moss all you have done"—I had then given her in charge, and her mother begged me on her knees to let her off, as she had been ill all day, and she did not know what would be the consequence—the mother said it should be all right, she had written to the uncle, and she would get the whole of them out—depending on her telling me the truth, we walked to the station, and I with-drew the charge—we went to a public-house, and the mother told me of some, to the amount of four dozen, and occasionally the prisoner put in a word—I believed that was the whole that had been taken—they told me where they had been pledged—I afterwards received of them 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and gave them a receipt for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to avoid the stamp—I afterwards found that more property had been taken than they told me of—I found stays pledged at upwards of thirty-five pawnbrokers (the stays which they had told me of had been redeemed before I discovered these)—I found some at Mr. Telfer's, in Ratcliff-highway, at Mr. Avila's, Mr. Tilly's, Mr. John-son's, Mr. Sowerby's, and many other places—they were all mine—I should not have prosecuted but for the discovery.</p>

About a month after he brought either a spoon or a fork, which I bought, believing his first statement. He came a third time, on a Saturday, about five weeks ago, with two or three spoons, which I bought—I had not seen him then for six weeks or two months—he described that they were what he and the other had found in the drain—I paid him about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for all the things I bought—there certainly was not any thing rubbed off the first spoon that I made so much inquiry about, or I must have seen it—I was busy at the time he brought the last articles, and quite alone in the shop—when the officer came and inquired whether</p>

The prisoner was our servant for six months—I missed the articles stated on Wednesday last—she had left on the Sunday previous, and left her box behind her—I had asked her about the pocket-handkerchief, pillow-cases, and gloves a long time ago, and she said she knew nothing about any things—the box was under her bed, locked and corded—I sent for a policeman, and forced it open—in it I found this petticoat, two towels, a pocket-handkerchief, a pillow-case, and snuff-box—this is the pocket-handkerchief I had mentioned to her, and which she said she did not know any thing about—the whole of the pro<lb/>perty is mine—they are marked—I never permitted her to take them, or gave them to her—I missed a great quantity besides—I have only found one of the two pillow-cases.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipwright, and work in the Black-wall-yard. I went with Cole and the others into the shed out of the rain—I was at work in front of the pit—there was no place nearer that we could go to—the prisoner was at work in the pit—he asked us to go and give him a lift with a log—Cole, I, and Rawlinson went down and helped him—Cole then got out, and began dancing—some dirt fell on the prisoner's head, and he said, "I will give you a slap in the mouth"—Cole jumped down into the pit, and pulled off his jacket—he did not appear to be angry—the prisoner got out of the pit, and Cole laid hold of his leg—the prisoner then swung over the log to kick him—the prisoner caught hold of the crow-bar, and was going to throw it down at Cole—I went round the log, and laid hold of it—Cole was then down in the pit—I did not see him come out of the pit—it was while I was turning round—I saw him lying on the log afterwards, and then saw the prisoner inflict one blow on his head as he laid on the log—I cannot say whether he was insensible—I cannot say whether he hit him with the crow-bar, or what it was, but I saw him hit him on the head while his head was lying on the log, and he put up his arm to strike him again—I believe it was with the dog—I saw Price come up and lay hold of the prisoner—I did not observe whether the prisoner had a black eye—I did not see Price do any thing when he took hold of him—I took Cole up—he was bleeding—both my hands were covered with blood from his head—I took him to the doctor's.</p>

I had notice of this rob<lb/>bery on the 11th of July, and took two men into custody, named Miles and Bennett, who were tried here at a former session—in consequence of infor<lb/>mation which I got after they were in custody I went about ten o'clock on the morning of the 27th of July, to the prisoner's lodging at No. 52, Whitcombe-street, St. James's, the back attic, on the third floor—he was not there—the door was unlocked, but was closed to—I found there these lace-sleeves, part of the brass of a writing-desk, four keys, and a small box for holding pencil-points—Mr. Blissett was with me, and claimed them as his property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Priestley, a master carman, and live in Grove-street, Commercial-road. On Monday, the 9th of Novem<lb/>ber, I was riding home in a cart, and went along Whitechapel, opposite Union-street, and saw Mr. Larkin's cart unloading cheese opposite Mr. Clark's door—I saw a man take two cheeses out of the cart, put them under the skirts of his coat, and run up Black Lion-yard with them—I followed him through four or five streets until he came to Pelham-street—he went into a barber's shop at the corner of Pelham-street with the cheeses—I was between four and five yards from him when he went in—I waited at the door two or three minutes looking for a policeman—I could not find one, and spoke to Hubbard, who was riding in his cart—he got out, and I went up, got one foot inside the barber's shop-door and one foot out, and Hubbard ran by, and got into the barber's shop—I could see into the shop a little—I saw the prisoner there, and a man in a fustian coat—he was merely standing by a chair—the prisoner was not shaving him—that was not the man I had seen take the cheeses—I could not see entirely through the room, the door only being partly open—I waited outside the door by the cart, and saw the man who had taken the cheeses come out with another man without the cheeses—he came out at the side door, not the same door he went in at—(a man had come up and given me a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> in Black Lion-yard, when I was running after the man)—when the man came out of the shop I think it was a man who had come and spoken to the man who stole the cheeses—they went away together down the street—I saw Hubbard come out of the shop, seven or eight minutes after he went in, and after him I saw two girls come out with apparently one cheese under each of their aprons—I went towards the cart with Hubbard—the girls followed, came to the cart, and delivered the cheeses to Hub<lb/>bard</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184011230125"/>
               <p>—I had seen one of the two girls in the barber's shop as I knocked at the door to tell the carman the man had come out who had taken the cheeses, and she slammed the door in my face—I went with Hubbard to Mr. Larkin's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Messrs. Merritt, and live in Castle-side, Whitechapel. On the 9th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I was in Brick-lane—Owen called out to me, and in con<lb/>sequence of what he told me, I jumped out of the cart, and went to the barber's shop at the corner of Pelham-street—I saw a young man in a fustian dress—whether it was a coat, or what, I do not know—I saw the prisoner there, and told him I wanted my cheeses—I collared the first man I came to in the shop, which was the one in fustian, and said, "Come, hand me my cheeses"—(I afterwards found the cheeses were not mine—which I thought they were)—the prisoner said, "We have not got any cheeses here," and the other man said, "I am going to get shaved"—I said I wanted my cheeses, and while I was waiting for them I should lose some other things—I said nothing about the number of cheeses, or where they had been lost from—I said, I wanted my cheeses, and I would have them before I went, if not I would charge the police with them—the pri<lb/>soner still said they had not got the cheeses, and that it was a barber's shop—I called to Owen outside, who had his foot on the step, and told him to call the police, which he did—I found no policeman came, and I said to the prisoner, "Give me my cheeses, I do not want any <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it"—there was such a mob about the door I thought my cart would be robbed, and I said, "Hand me over the cheeses, and I won't give charge of you, I will take no further notice of it"—the prisoner said, addressing the person I supposed to be his wife, "Oh dear, why there was a fellow <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> in here just now with two cheeses, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> them in at the back there, and he went out at the other door, and said he was coming back pre<lb/>sently to fetch them"—I said, "Let me have my cheeses, and be off"—he said, "Young man, I know you won't take further notice of it"—he said, "He is a right one, and a good fellow, and will you take a drop of any thing to drink, young man?"—I said, "Will I not?—you try me"—of course I took it—they fetched a stone bottle (I cannot say whether it was the old lady or one of the young ones,) from somewhere backwards, brought it into the shop, and gave me a glass of brandy—there were two girls in the shop—the prisoner said if I would go with him backwards, he would allow me to take the cheeses to my cart—I said, "I shan't take the trouble of taking them, after being robbed, I will make you take them or send them"—he said, so he would—I went out to Owen, and we went up Brick-lane some distance—a girl came on my left side, and said, "Young man, here are your cheeses"—I cannot say whether she was one of the girls who had been in the shop—I received the two cheeses at last—they were brought up singly—I believe one girl brought them, but I can<lb/>not say—I threw them into my cart, and on examining them was satisfied they were not mine—I had no such cheeses in my cart—mine were round Dutch cheeses—I afterwards took them to Mr. Clark's, in Whitechapel, and afterwards to Mr. Larkin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. In consequence of information which I received from the prosecutor's son, on the 5th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock, I went to the hay-stack, and saw two cuttings, and on each cutting was some hay cut and not taken away—I then went to the cart which was loaded, examined it, and saw there was a place left to put some loose hay. I went in doors, made eighteen tickets, and put twelve in the hay-stack where it was cut, and six in the cart. About three o'clock, I called on the prisoner—I saw him about four—after that I went to the back of the premises, and saw him go round to the stack two or three times—I then went and called my brother constable, while doing so, the pri<lb/>soner came on with the cart—we followed him as far as Shepherd's Bush, and there took him into custody—I took him back to Ealing, searched the cart, and found this 20 lbs. weight of hay, in which my brother constable found two of the tickets which I had put in the stack—I told the prisoner it was the hay I had marked in the stack—he said it was the usual quan<lb/>tity he generally had—he afterwards said he knew he had done wrong, but he must suffer for it the same as a good many more had done.</p>

In consequence of in<lb/>structions from Mr. Woods I watched his boiling-house in Bear-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields—there is no shop—between eight and nine o'clock on the morning of the 18th of November I saw the prisoner coming out with this can, with his hand covering the top—there was no lid to it—by fol<lb/>lowing him I saw a piece of tripe on the top—he was going in the direction of his own house—he keeps the Crooked Billet public-house—I stopped him just as he was about to enter his own door, and asked what he had got there, pointing to the contents of the can—he said, "Why?"—I told him I was an officer, and he must consider himself in custody—I took him to the station—on the way I asked several times who gave it to him—he did not give an answer—at the station he said some of them down at the boiling-house gave it to him—Mr. Woods afterwards came—I heard the prisoner tell him that <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Armstrong, as I understood him, gave it to him—the can contained a neat's foot and honeycomb tripe.</p>

I was at the boiling-house in Bear-yard on the 18th of November, where the tripe and cow<lb/>heels are prepared for the shop—it is not a place of sale—the prisoner came down to the boiling-house between eight and nine o'clock, as usual, for his pots—I did not give him any tripe or cow's-heel—we had a lot of tripe there, there were fifty-one honey-comb pieces, of about 1lb. each—I did not see him leave.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Parker; we live in Shoreditch; the prisoner was in our service. I left town on the 28th of October, and returned in a few days—she was then gone—I went into her bed-room the day after my return, and opened a box of mine which was there—I found it locked—I missed from it some Irish linen, some cam<lb/>bric, and some calico—I missed some petticoats from another part of the house—on the 17th of November, from information I received, I went to the prisoner's mother's, at Gillingham, in Kent—I found the prisoner there—I said to her, "I have come about those things I have lost"—she was very indignant, and said she had nothing belonging to me, not so much as a piece of rag to wrap round her finger—I said it was of no use her saying so; I had lost those things, and there was no one else in the house—I said she had made Mr. Smith, the foreman, some shirt-fronts, which I believed to be of my linen—she said they were not, and was very insolent—I said to our bailiff, who drove me down, "You hear how insolent she is, go and get a constable"—the prisoner then said, "I did take the linen to make the fronts, and about half a yard more to line a dress"—there was one of her boxes in the room—I looked into it, and saw some muslin, which I believe belonged to me—I asked her mother where her other things were—she said the chief of her things were left in town at her aunt's, in Elliott's-row—I went there, and saw a box which the prisoner had had at my house, and in it I found a towel with the name of Parker on it, and in another paper box of hers I found a black figured waistband of mine—I found a baby's lace cap in a box belonging to her aunt.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the general trade, but I am not in business at present—this article is not brass, but a mixed metal, which is called cock-metal—brass is made of copper, zinc, and some pewter—this metal is more brittle than brass—I have no doubt I could break this with a hammer, but I could not break brass—this has more zinc in it than brass has—it would not sell for brass in any marine store-shop—they do not give so much for it as for old brass—I should think this would not be called brass in the trade.</p>

I am seven years old—I go to school, and have been taught the Lord's Prayer—I know it is wicked to tell a lie—I live with my parents, in White Lion-street, Chelsea—I met the prisoner at the top of George-street, in Sloane-street, three weeks ago last Monday—she asked me how my father and mother, and sister were, and said she would give me some apples and pears, and a pair of green boots—she said her mother was just round the corner—I went a little way with her, and she gave me a farthing cake—she took me up and carried me—when we were next door but one to the Dispensary in Sloane-street, she unlaced my boots and took them off—she then went away, and said she would be back in a minute, and bring me a pair of green boots—I went home without any boots—while she was with me I met Maria Smith, and she asked the prisoner if she would let me go home with her—the prisoner said as she had brought me out she would take me home.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at the Red Cross, Newgate-market. I was in the service of Mr. Evans, a linen-draper, in Tottenham-court-road, in April last—the prisoner was my fellow-servant there in the business—we both left the employ at the same time—I went into the service of Hitch<lb/>cock and Rogers, in St. Paul's Church-yard—it is in the parish of St. Faith, City—they occupy the whole premises—the shopmen sleep on the premises—I left Hitchcock's on Friday, the 6th of November—I left my box be<lb/>hind—it was locked, but not corded—I slept there on the Friday night, and left the house the following morning, leaving my box locked in me bed-room—on the afternoon of the same Saturday I met the prisoner about one o'clock—I had seen him once or twice at Hitchcock and Rogers's visit<lb/>ing Mr. Talbot—I had shaken hands with him when I had seen him there, and spoke to him—when I met him on Saturday I told him I had quitted Hitchcock'a—he asked me if 1 had left altogether—I replied, "No"—that implied that my box was not brought away—it is customary for young men to leave their boxes behind, and any young man in the trade would know from that answer that the box was still there—it is left there for safety till we have another situation, for a week or so—he asked me where I was staying—I did not tell him—I had got a lodging then at the Red Cross, where I am now staying—I slept there on the Saturday, and on Sunday morning I went to Hitchcock's to dress myself, and found my box was gone—it contained the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the articles stated—this is the note—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it bears interest at 3 per cent.—it is on the North Wilts Banking Company—in consequence of missing my note, I obtained the address of the prisoner from Miss Smith, who lived at Hitchcock's—it was Greenland-grove, Cromer-street—I went with John Dear, a policeman,</p>

               <p>and found the prisoner there—we made but a slight search, and none of my property was found there—the prisoner said he was surprised I should come to search his house, and declared he knew nothing about the box—when we were about to leave he said he had a good mind to follow me, to see what had given me suspicion—this was on the 8th—on the 9th I went to Mr. Gill, a pawnbroker, in Wilmot-street, and saw six shirts and one silk handkerchief which had been in the box when I lost it—on the evening of the same day the prisoner was apprehended in Cromer-street, between four and five o'clock, close by his own home—I gave charge of him—he was taken to Mr. Gill's, who said directly he saw him, "That is the man"—the prisoner asked Grill if he was certain, and at the same time took off his hat, and moved his wig a little—(he has a wig on now)—Gill said, "Yes, you are the man"—I believe he said so more than once—before we got into the shop, I said to the prisoner, "You know this shop, do you not, Cameron?"—he said, "I do, I have been here"—next morning, the 10th, I went to Hitchcock's about twelve o'clock, and found my box was returned—it was down in a place called the Dock, where goods are de<lb/>livered—it was corded but not locked—I had left it locked but not corded—there was in it a few pain of stockings, night-caps, and small articles—the principal part of the contents were gone—a youth named Ray, who attends to the dock, pointed out my box to me—(I bad made a complaint at Hitchcock's of the loss of my box on Sunday morning as soon at I missed it)—there was a paper on the box which there was not when I lost it—I think it was stuck on—I am not acquainted with the prisoner's hand<lb/>writing—I have got a letter which I received—it has passed through the post, but I do not know the hand-writing—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note was enclosed in it—this was after I had apprehended the prisoner—I believe the letter was sealed when I received it—I opened it immediately without looking at the seal—I looked more at the note than the letter—there was no writ<lb/>ing inside the letter—it was directed "Mr. Waterman, at Hitchcock and Rogers's, St. Paul's Church-yard"—I should think the box and property, without the note, was worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am sure they exceeded 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the partners in the house are George Hitchcock and Frederick Rogers.</p>

W." with a needle, and the rest in ink—I did not look at the handkerchief, but I see it is marked "Waterman" at full length—I did not notice the person's features particu<lb/>larly—I had no further conversation with him—there was no mention of an Irishman or Scotchman—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my hand<lb/>writing—it was read over to me before I signed it—I noticed his voice—I saw him on the following Monday, and recognised his voice—he was brought into my shop, and it was said, "Is this the man?" or something—I cannot be sure whether any body spoke before I spoke, but they brought the man to me to recognise, because I had described previously his figure to them as near as I could—he had on a different coat when brought to me to what he had when he brought the articles—I told them I believed he was the man—he said he was not—I think I addressed myself to him, and said, "I think you are the man"—I said, "I believe you are the man"—I said to him, "You are dressed very differently to-day to what you were on Saturday," and I think I said, "But I know you by your voice more than by your features"—on the Saturday evening I had noticed that he spoke something like an Irishman—he said, "No, I am a Scotch<lb/>man"—on the Monday he had a coloured coat with gilt buttons—on the Saturday the person had a hat on, and on the Monday he took his hat off, drew his fingers through his hair, and said, "You will mind that I wear a wig"—I repeated my belief that he was the man—I told him I should be very sorry to say he was the man unless I had a belief of it.</p>

               <p>I cannot answer for the colour of his clothes, but this I can answer, he was much smarter dresssd on the 7th of October than the person was on the 7th of November—I remarked to him on Monday, the 9th of Novem<lb/>ber, about his being so much more smart than he was on the Saturday previous—I mean he was smarter on the 7th of October—he was then dressed very smartly—on the 7th of November he was not smart, for I remarked to him on Monday, the 9th, that he appeared on Saturday as though he had been in business the whole day, and I said to him, "Now you have been recently dressed, you are much smarter"—he said, "It is not long since I dressed"—I cannot recollect the colour of his clothes on the 7th of October, but I noticed to myself that he was a gentlemanly young man—I had no conversation with him on the 7th of October beyond what business required, only a few words.</p>

               <p>Angel, which I was almost opposite—I did so, and he said, "Wait a few minutes, I have got a box coming"—Larter came with a box on his knot—the box was put inside the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and the prisoner got in—he ordered me to stop at the corner of Hatton-garden, which I did, and another youngish man jumped into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> with the prisoner—the prisoner ordered me to Rathbone-place, and up Charlotte-street—I pulled up at the corner of the street, and both got out there—the prisoner paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I left them with the box on the pavement—I saw the prisoner at the office—he was dressed in a black coat when he took me off the rank—I saw the coat changed at the office—when I saw him in the other coat, I said I had rather see him in the one he was in when he took me off the rank, the black coat—a black coat was put on him, and I then had not the least doubt of him—I was quite certain of him before the coat was changed, but I wished to see his coat changed, I wished to see him the same as he was before—the person who got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Hatton-garden appeared to have on a gilt-buttoned coat—he was nearly the same size as the prisoner—I am now clear as to the prisoner having hired me—I heard of the loss of the box on the Wednesday.</p>

I have known the prisoner fourteen months, and have repaired jewellery for him—he represented himself as a traveller to a grocer.

I had a box in my room in King-street, in the parish of St. Nicholas, Deptford—I had in it five sovereigns, eight half-crowns, and one shilling in a bag—I saw it safe about eight days before I missed it, which was on Tuesday the 19th of October—my husband had not been into the room, but the female prisoner was there—she slept with me, and her husband slept in the barracks, but he had access to the room—my box was locked—I lent the prisoner my scis<lb/>sors at different times, and the key of my box was tied to them, and I lent</p>

On the 30th of Octo<lb/>ber I was on duty in Park-street, which is about 300 or 400 yards from Mr. Benbow's premises—I heard a rattle spring, and went to the spot—I went into the premises of Messrs. Winter and Rich, and found the door broken open, and the prisoner in the yard adjoining the place where the door was broken, squatting down in a truck—some of Messrs. Barclay's men who were there asked Mason where the other was—he pointed to the opposite side of the street, and said, there was another, but he was gone that way—I searched him on the spot, and found this ivory tablet, and a pair of gloves, which I did not take from him, not being aware of their import<lb/>ance.</p>
