            <p>Every Age, nay, every Sessions brings forth new Crimes, and many times more Prodigious then the former, of which I shall give you a Cursery: the first account of such as were try'd this Sessions in the Old-Bayly, was a Murther committed by a Boy, aged thirteen years and a Month: in Christmas time he unhappily quarrel'd with another Boy, being his Fellow-Apprentice, about their Aprons: the Prisoner cut the others Apron-strings, and the other attempting to cut his, the Prisoner took a Three-penny Knife, and stab'd him in the Belly: then he run out, and cryed, Lord Jesus Receive my Soul, Daniel has Kill'd me: The

             was committed to the Gate-house, he living neer Westminster, and from thence brought to Newgate, and Try'd at the Old-Bayly: he had been taught how to excuse the Fact, but his Memory was as much Corrupted as his mind, so that he made an imperfect excuse, pretending that he had the Knife in his hand, and the other came running towards him, and stumbled upon the point of his Knife, but it appeared to be otherwise to the Jury, and they brought him in, Guilty of Manslaughter.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>The next Fact appeared to be much more Barbarous then the former, a man living in White-chappel, was Arrested by a Marshal's-man, and as soon as the Officer told him of the Arrest, he with a bloody hand, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16760117003"/>barbarous mind, thrust a very strange Weapon into his Belly, that being done, with as much vigour and as little sence and grace, he thrust at another, but his nimble body escaped his malicious purpose, and an unexpected Multitude surprized him, and took him Prisoner: when the danger of his further mischief was over, they begun to parley with him, and asked why he would do so Barbarous an act? he replyed, That if he had not Kill'd the Bayliff, he should have gone to the Marshalsey on foot, but now he was to go to Newgate in a Coach: but though he seemed to be of a resolute mind, and of an undaunted courage, yet by a serious consideration, he pleaded eagerly to excuse the Fact, but all in vain, for he was found, Guilty of Murther.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>After these, another was brought to the Bar for Murther, it appeared that he was making a joynt-stool in Clarendon-house, and one that seem'd to have some interest there, told him that he should not do it there, the other replyed, he would: then the other struck him, and his stroaks were answered with a blow with a Miller, upon his arm: the other that was Killed challenged him to fight, which he refused to do, then he went to lock him in, but the other frustrated his designs: the slun struck at him three or four times, and he then smote him on the head with his Saw, and his Hat being off, he pierc'd his Scull, and the wound reached very neer his Brains, upon which, within less then two days he Dyed, the Provocations being considered by the Jury, he was onely found, Guilty of Manslaughter.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>There was like-wise an Irish-man Try'd, for Stealing two hundred pounds from his Master, but though several Circumstances seemed to stick as close to him as the Chain to his Leg; yet nothing could be fully proved against him, and therefore he was acquitted.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>There was likewise one in the Habit of a Gentlewoman, that took a Tryal for stealing a Silver Tankard, and a considerable parcel of Money from a Citizen; the manner was thus; she pretendly went to provide a Lodging for a person of Honour; Stewart and another Irish Gentleman; and when she had accomplished her Designs, the Gentlemen came, and were wellcomly entertained; and it being Christmas time, at night they went to Cards with the Landlord, the Landlady being gone a visitings; in a little time they wanted some Double beer, and there was none to fetch it but the Master of the house; he therefore went to the next door and ordered the Maid to bring them in a quart or two; afterwards they wanted some Wine, he went the same way to work to supply their wants, but not long after they desired him to fetch them some double bear himself; he readily obeyed the commands of his noble, and as he thought profitable guests, and was no sooner gone, but they marched up stairs to seek out his treasures, &amp; breaking open a closet they found a silver Tankard, &amp; a considerable parcel of mony, which they took, and left him to pay for the double ale, and not long after they met with this woman, and brought her to a Tryal, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16760117006"/>said that one of the Gentlemen was her Husband, and produc'd a Certifficate to affirm it, but the Jury then brought her in guilty of the fact.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>There was another woman tryed for high treason; the cause was this. She came to a shop at Ludgate-hill, and desired them to change her a shilling, they perceiving it clipt told her that she deserved to be questioned how she came by it, she thereupon run away, but they being too nimble overtook her, and suspecting her guilt, carryed her before a Magistrate, who committed her to prison, her lodging was searched, and Pots, shears, and clippings found in it, but the Iury presum'd to think it was her Husbands handy-work rather than hers, therefore acquitted her.</p>
      
   
   
      
         
            <p>There was a man that came to a Watch-maker, accompanied with a foot-man, who desired to see some Watches for his Master; after he had seen many, he made choice of two of the best, one gold, the other silver, and the Apprentice was sent with him to bring the Watch or money for them, but when he got into the Temple, he pretended to go up stairs to his master, and so gave the young man the slip, for which he was ordered to stand in the pillory.</p>
