             being set to the bar, Mr. Justice ASTON acquainted her with the Opinion of the Judges on the case referred to their consideration, in the following speech:</p>

            , At the last September session, upon your being brought to the bar, to plead to several indictments found against you for forgery, it was insisted upon by your counsel, that in point of law you ought not to have been put upon your trail at all, as you had confessed yourself to be an accomplice before the Justices of the Peace for the county of Middlesex, and had been by them admitted as an evidence for the Crown,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060004"/> against your companions in guilt, Robert and 
               <persName id="t17751206-1-person58">
                  Daniel
                   Perreau

            . The ground of that claim was founded upon the supposed merit of the discovery you had made: that being admitted to give evidence as an accomplice, and having performed your engagement to the public, by being examined before the Grand Jury, and being ready to have given evidence upon the trial, if called upon, you was intitled to pardon; or not to have been prosecuted, that you might have time to apply elsewhere: that the constant practice in regard to accomplices becoming the King's evidence was, that they should not be prosecuted for the offence they had confessed, or such like offences: that a contrary conduct would be a breach of faith with you, and would discourage the future discovery of criminals, if after such disclosures they were nevertheless to undergo prosecutions for their offences. To this it was answered, that the discovery meant by law or practice to intitle an accomplice to favour, must be a full, ample, and true discovery; and that it would never discourage the making such discoveries if criminals offering themselves as witnesses, were made to understand, that to intitle themselves to mercy or favour, they are to make a full discovery of all the offences about which they were questioned, and of all their accomplices in guilt. And it was farther insisted, that you had not made a fair disclosure, at the time of your examination, of all you knew relative to the forgeries which had been committed and published, but that you stood charged by the Grand Jury with several other forgeries which you had denied the knowledge of Upon the debate of this matter before the Bench of Gaol Delivery, the Judges present, not all concurring in one opinion, and it being judged a point of great weight and importance, in the criminal law, fit to be fully considered and finally settled, how far, under what circumstances, and in what manner, an accomplice, received as a witness, ought to be intitled to favour and mercy; the father consideration of the matter was then deferred, in order that the opinion of all the Judges might be taken upon the point of law.</p>
               <p>Eleven of the Judges have accordingly met, the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas being absent through indisposition; and have maturely and deliberately considered of the matter, under all the circumstances; and it falls to my share to deliver, in your presence, to the public, the substance of their reasons upon the occasion, that the ground of their resolves may be rightly understood. All the Judges were of opinion, that in cases not within any statute, an accomplice, who fully and truly discloses the joint guilt of himself and of his companions, and truly answers all questions that are put to him, and is admitted by Justices of the Peace as a witness against his companions, and who, when called upon, does give evidence accordingly, and appears under all the circumstances of the case to have acted a fair and an ingenuous part, and to have made a full and true information, ought not to be prosecuted for his own guilt so disclosed by him, nor perhaps for any other offence of the same kind, which he may accidentally, and without any bad design, have omitted in his confession; but he cannot by law plead this in bar to any indictment against him, nor avail himself of it upon his trial; for it is merely an equitable claim to the mercy of the crown, from the Magistrates express or implied promise of an indemnity, upon certain conditions that have been performed: it can only come before the Court by way of application to put off the trial, in order to give the prisoner time to apply elsewhere. Nine of the eleven Judges were of opinion, that all the circumstances relative to a prisoner's claim of indemnity, in such a case, not only may, but ought to be laid before the Court, to enable them to exercise their discretion, whether, upon the grounds before them, the trial should be put off, and consequently have intimation given that the prisoner ought not be prosecuted; for the discretionary power exercised by the Justices of Peace in admitting accomplices to be witnesses, founded in practice only, cannot controul the authority of the Court of Gaol Delivery, and exempt at all events the accomplice from being prosecuted. Upon every motion made, upon collateral equitable grounds, the Court will see and examine into the whole truth, and consequently ought to be informed of all the circumstances affecting the case.</p>
               <p>The affidavit of the Justices therefore must in this case be necessarily taken into consideration, to see upon what ground they admitted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060005"/> the prisoner as a witness. For if the Court looked no farther than the prisoner's own information, in the present case, they could not have learnt from thence that she had ever been considered as an accomplice at all; and as such had been admitted as a witness against the Perreaus in either of the prosecutions. Upon their affidavit it appears that the public faith was not engaged but conditionally, and that there was an express admonition given to the prisoner, not to conceal any part of the truth.</p>
               <p>The same nine Judges also were of opinion, that if the matter stood singly upon the two informations of the prisoner, compared with the indictments against her, that she ought to have been tried upon all or any of them; for from the prisoner's information, she is no accomplice; she has not confessed herself guilty of any offence at all. By their representation the share she has had in these transactions is perfectly innocent: but she exhibits a charge against Robert and

            , from a paper he produces; the other forcing her to do the fact of forgery, under the threat and fear of death. Her two informations are contradictory; and every indictment that is preferred against her proceeds upon a falsification of the account she has given; for she answers to the Justices interrogation, that she did not know of any other forgeries: so she does not confess, make any discovery, or become a witness concerning these offences; and if she has suppressed the truth, and not made a full and fair disclosure, she forfeits all equitable claim to favour and mercy. But if she has told the truth, and the whole truth, she cannot be convicted. On the other hand, taking the affidavit of the Justices, and all the case into consideration, if she is guilty of the charge contained in the indictments preferred by Sir

            , the Judges are of opinion, as her informations before the Justices have no relation to these charges, they can in no light be applied to mitigate her offences.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, whether the prisoner is guilty or not guilty is a fact still to be tried by a jury upon legal evidence only, without prejudice to the prisoner from any thing which has been insisted upon in point of law by her counsel to exempt her from any trial at all; for it would be hard indeed upon the subject, who has a right to advice and assistance of counsel in all matters and points of law that may arise upon his case, if the eventual decision of the Court against the points of law insisted upon in his behalf, should prejudice the subsequent trial of the facts, which is ultimately to be governed by the rule of evidence, and to be decided by the verdict of the Jury. I hope and trust, the facts will be tried without the least attention to, or even a remembrance of, any one matter or thing whatever, which has either made its appearance in print, or been the subject of common conversation. I shall only add, that an accomplice, who desires that his trial may be put off, that he may apply for mercy under all the most regular pretensions before laid down, confesses the guilt; but, under the circumstances of this case, if the prisoner confesses these indictments, she has no promise of mercy, and no claim to favour for the reasons aforesaid. The Judges therefore are of opinion that the trial ought to proceed; and I have authority to say, that the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas concurs in that opinion.</p>

             was a co-defendant in the present indictment with Mrs. Rudd, Mrs. Perreau could not be admitted to give evidence; that she could not be admitted a witness for or against either her husband or the co-defendant of her husband.</p>
               <p>Mr. COWPER (likewise of Counsel for the Prisoner) observed, the law requires that every witness in a cause shall be totally indifferent in the event of it. The counsel contended, that when a witness says he conceives he is interested in the matter, that the very imagination of the witness is as much an objection to the witness, as if he was really and truly concerned; because the law requires, that a witness shall have no bias upon his mind, but shall be totally indifferent and disinterested in the event of the prosecution. That the bias that may be upon the mind of a wife in favour of her husband, or a husband in favour of his wife, is undoubtedly the strongest that the law can take notice of. For Mrs. Perreau not to have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060007"/> that bias, not to be warped by that bias, not to come with more anxious wishes than any witness ought to come into a court of justice, would in her be almost criminal. That whether her imagination, that the conviction of Mrs. Rudd would obtain her husband's pardon was well or ill founded, would not alter the case an iota. She has said it is her opinion that

            's pardon will also be the consequence of that conviction: that if Mrs. Perreau's testimony is to contribute to her conviction, it is, to be sure, through the same medium her husband's life is to be saved; and if that is not a clear, a decisive, and a positive interest, it is impossible to define what a positive interest is. If upon the trial, when it was an equal chance, whether he would or not be in the unfortunate predicament of being under sentence of death, Mrs. Perreau could not be admitted a witness for him: is he, when under sentence of death, to be redeemed from that unfortunate situation by her testimony? Does the influence cease, and does it become an objection to her credit only and not to her competency? In civil cases, if an objection is taken to a witness, who only imagines he has an interest, though he has none - If a master, for instance, in defending his servant, imagines, that in point of honour he ought to pay his costs, though there is no bond to indemnify him; but he says, I think, as a man of generosity, in point of honour, I ought not to let my servant suffer, how small is that bias? The idea of obligation upon the man's mind makes him act like a man of honour, and under that bias he would not tell an untruth; and yet so careful is the law, that a person shall not be a witness who is under any temptation whatsoever when called upon to give evidence. That such a witness has in many instances upon that ground been rejected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper mentioned a case that happened the preceding day in the Court of King's Bench upon a patent: the patentee produced his journeyman, who stated to the Court, that he had entered into articles to work a number of years for the patentee, and receive a sum of money upon the patent: an objection was made to his evidence, a release of the articles was executed by the witness in Court, and it was then contended that the objection was removed. The question was then put to him, Sir, though you have discharged your master from all obligations he was under to you, don't you expect, when you go out of Court, to be restored to the situation you was in before? Why, replied he, I believe my master is an honest man; and I believe my master could not do the work without me, and therefore I am well convinced I shall be put in the situation from which I have released myself. My Lord Mansfield, upon the idea that the witnesses's imagination led him to suppose that he should certainly be restored to the situation he was in before, rejected his evidence; and very properly rejected the evidence, repeating what he had once before said in a solemn judgment from the bench, that it is not the office of courts of law to consider how far the minds of people may resist temptation, but to take care that they shall be exposed to none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS (of Counsel for the Crown) contended, that the observations that had been made by the counsel were proper as to the credit of the witness, but did not affect her competency. That if the doctrine was to be held in the latitude in which it was laid down by the gentlemen on the other side, it would be impossible ever to prosecute. When a man prosecutes for a felony or robbery, suppose he was to be asked, Sir, if the prisoner should be convicted, don't you expect the restitution of your goods? he would say he did; he is intitled to restitution: and yet that question was never asked in such a case. And in cases where the prosecutor is intitled to a reward, the reward is dependant upon conviction, and he is therefore interested in the conviction of the prisoner; and yet that objection was never taken. An accomplice is not sure of his pardon the moment he gives evidence in many cases; it is only from the favour of the Crown. Where a pardon is held forth by statute in case an accomplice convicts two persons, suppose he convicts but one, or suppose he convicts neither, he is not intitled to his pardon, unless he fulfills the conditions required of him by the act. It is only in the mercy and favour of the Crown. Mrs. Perreau has told the Court, that she hopes her husband's innocence may appear. She certainly wishes that he may obtain a pardon whether Mrs. Rudd is or is not convicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060008"/>The COURT, in deciding upon the objection, observed - That the reason the witness assigned for hoping the prisoner's conviction, would be a means of obtaining her husband's pardon, appeared in substance to be an apprehension, that such facts might appear upon the evidence now, which might induce the Crown to extend mercy to her husband; and that her expressing such an apprehension did not prove her to be so interested in the conviction of the prisoner, as to make her incompetent as a witness: nor did it follow, in case the prisoner should be so unfortunate as to be convicted, that the pardon of

             would be the consequence of that conviction. The Court farther observed, that the bond which

             was convicted for uttering, knowing it to be forged, was not the same the prisoner was indicted upon. That the observation was well founded, that if

             was a co-defendant with the prisoner, Mrs. Perreau's evidence would be inadmissible. That this was not like the case of an accomplice, who comes to give evidence in hopes of being pardoned if he speaks the truth; for in what had fallen from the Court, in delivering the opinion of the judges upon that point, it was certain that wherever an accomplice discloses all he knows, whatever may be the consequences of that disclosure, he himself stands in a situation to be intitled to the expectation of mercy; but that it was very like the case put by Mr. Lucas, where a person who prosecutes a thief is intitled to the restitution of his goods. And in prosecutions where there are rewards, the reward can only be the effect of a conviction; in such a case as that, every man that comes as a witness, under the idea of having a reward, supposing the criminal should be convicted, may be said to be interested in point of property. But the case that had been put of criminals that are admitted witnesses under the statutes of king William and queen Ann, came clearly within the objection now made, because they are not intitled to their pardon, unless their evidence is a means of conviction; and therefore, where the legislature has held out that, as a reward, by way of inducement for criminals to come in and make a discovery, the legislature would have acted contrary to the rules and principles of law, if by the consequence of their evidence they were to be considered as interested in the determination. That to go a little farther back, and enter into the doctrine of approvers, they likewise came most clearly within that idea; for there the approver, if he did not convict, was not intitled to a pardon: therefore in this case, whatever Mrs. Perreau's hopes might be, yet as it is not an interest that is necessarily to follow upon the conviction of the prisoner, the Court were of opinion, that it was not an objection that would go to her competency, though it would certainly go very strongly to affect her credit; and of that the counsel for the prisoner would have the advantage, by the observations they had made in the hearing of the Jury.</p>

               <p>After you had a notion that there might be something wrong in this transaction, when did you see Mrs. Rudd? - At my house, about seven or eight o'clock that evening, Wednesday, the 8th of March.</p>
               <p>What room were you in? - The parlour.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass about these transactions, whether they were right or wrong?</p>

               <p>You are a well-bred woman, and therefore, of course, you was attending to the conversation of your visitors, and you perfectly well remember their conversation: how came you, when you had not a thought that any thing was wrong in the transaction, to attend to the particular conversation that passed between your husband, Mr.

               <p>How long has she been gone? - She went there, I believe, last March: she was on board the ship when this affair broke out.</p>
               <p>What is become of Mr. Barker the clergyman? - He is in Wales.</p>
               <p>He might have been brought here? - I don't know that he attended to that conversation.</p>

               <p>And yet I observe you was very curious to look at this bond, supposed to have been of Mr. Adair's, for 5300 l. and also afterwards to make very particular observations upon the draught even to the blots that were upon it, and to the particulars of the bond, so as to be able to know it again at the distance of three months: how came you to be so particular in your observations upon a matter that did not strike you then to have any thing material in it? - My husband never restrained me from looking into his papers; when he was brushing his coat I read it. I looked at the bond as a mere matter of curiosity.</p>
               <p>There was nothing about it that should lead you to any particular attent ion to it? - No: I don't know that ever I saw a bond before, and I looked at it.</p>

               <p>I wish to know whether under this bill of sale, to which the prisoner is no party, you don't claim these goods that are hers? - Upon my word I believe that affair must come into a court of law, and then it will be proper to decide that question.</p>
               <p>I have as great an affection for a court of law as you have; but as we are in a court of law at present, I would wish to have this question answered, whether these goods of hers that you claim, you claim under a bill of sale to which she is no party? - Whether they had a right to sell them I am not a judge, but that will be settled I suppose in a court of law.</p>
               <p>But I ask you now, whether you don't believe that these are her property? - Her husband has sent over a power of attorney from Ireland to claim them.</p>
               <p>Then you claim the interest in them, do you? - They are sold to me by a bill of sale; and I think that bill of sale is a good bill of sale.</p>
               <p>I ask you, whether they have ever been demanded of you by the prisoner? - She has demanded all the household furniture and every thing in the world that was paid for with my money.</p>
               <p>Has she demanded these cloaths and jewels of you by her agent? - Yes; the tables and chairs, and the jewels, and all the things that are marked in the house of

               <p>Did you make any observations on the paper she wrote upon? - When she wrote in the feigned hand she wrote upon thick gilt paper that I bought for her. Mr.

               <p>How soon after you had been in the family, was it that Mrs. Rudd made you the confident of this imposition upon Mr. Perreau your master? - I never made any observations of the time.</p>
               <p>I don't mean the day or week; but you know it is a remarkable transaction, and you have a remarkable good memory and attention, for you have sworn to a hand-writing only from two letters? - Not from two letters only.</p>

               <p>Will you positively swear it was in September, October, or November? - I will swear neither.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it was in January or February? - Neither.</p>
               <p>Or in March, April, May, June, July, or August? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me how often you have delivered these letters? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you tell me within three times? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often upon your oath have you delivered them? - Five or six times; I believe it may be more.</p>

               <p>What space of time might there be between the delivery of each letter; a month, a fortnight, or a day? - I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Was it within two months after you came there? - Not to write a feigned hand in less than six months.</p>
               <p>When did you see her write a real hand? - Perhaps in two days after I came into the family.</p>
               <p>What did she write? - I don't know: she wrote that publicly.</p>
               <p>Where? - In the dining-room.</p>
               <p>Did you lean over her shoulder? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you examine what she wrote? - No.</p>
               <p>I want to know then how you could distinguish the feigned hand from the real hand? - Not to read it while she was writing it.</p>
               <p>My question is, how you could distinguish that you did not examine, or read, from what you call a feigned hand? - When she has wrote papers containing directions for me to get in errands, that I might not forget, that was her common hand.</p>

            . She described him. She said he was a little old man with grey hair, and that I might easily know him again. I told her, though I loved her as my life, I was afraid to meddle with such rich people, and I never was before a justice in all my life. She took up a paper and said, what she was going to tell me was as true as God was in heaven, and I was only to say it happened at my house, She said a great many had offered their service to her, but one in particular.</p>
               <p>Did she name any person? - No; but she said she could not put that confidence in them that she could in me. She promised to give me a sum of money; but I cannot be positive whether she mentioned 200 l. or 100 l. but I believe it was 200 l.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060021"/>For what? - As a reward for the lie I was to make about the papers. I said, I begged leave to know what were the contents of the papers, and then she read them.</p>
               <p>Should you know the papers again, if you were to see them? - I wrote my name upon the papers. These are them (pointing out the papers). Here is my name upon them. They were delivered to me by Mrs. Rudd on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whose hand-writing it is? - No.</p>
               <p>What did she desire you to do with those papers? - That I could never get out of her. I made so many objections to it. I asked what a bond was? She said, it was a piece of paper; and she described what it was. She said the first thing the Jury would ask me, would be what a bond was? She said, she had provided a counsellor and solicitor, and witnesses to back me, and my life was as precious to her as her own; and that my saying that, and that only, would save her life. She gave me the papers to shew my husband, and I was to bring them back to Newgate at four o'clock that afternoon.</p>
               <p>What was you to do with the papers in the mean time? - I was to consult my husband about the papers. I told her, my husband was an honest man. She said, if he would agree to it, and 200 l. would not do, it should be ten times more. After I had consulted my husband, I was to bring the papers back; but I never went back.</p>
               <p>Was any body present at this conversation? - Nobody but herself and me.</p>
               <p>If your husband had agreed to the papers, what were you to do with them? - Whether he agreed or not, I was to return them again at four o'clock.</p>
               <p>What use was you to make of these papers?</p>
               <p>What was you to have the 200 l. for? - I did not ask what for; I was to come back, and she was to direct me.</p>
               <p>You have mentioned something about a Jury that were to ask you questions; what was that about? - She said I was to go to her trial, and to take particular notice of Sir

I was to swear all that she had wrote down in these papers.</p>
               <p>Then you left Mrs. Rudd, and took the papers away with you? - Yes; I did.</p>

               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. Serjeant DAVY.</p>
               <p>When did you write your name to these papers? - That very day.</p>
               <p>When did you first mention this to your husband and consult him? - As I came down stairs, we went to a public house, my child dropp'd a guinea, my husband asked what that was, I told him it was a guinea my wicked mistress gave the child. My husband asked me for the papers; I said, my mistress wants to hang you and me and all the world; but I said she never shall be brought into trouble for me: my husband was in a great passion at the Horseshoe and Magpie; he struck me and abused me very much, and said he would go to Newgate and know what Mrs. Rudd meant; and he insisted upon having the papers.</p>
               <p>Did you give him the papers? - He insisted upon having the papers; and said, if Mrs. Rudd drew me in, he would appear against me, and hang us both; this frightened me a good deal, and I read the papers to him.</p>
               <p>How came you before the justice? - He took me there, and I made oath before the justice.</p>
               <p>You had been in Mrs. Rudd's service two months, and she had behaved so well to you, that you had a great liking to her? - I had.</p>
               <p>That led you to Newgate, and in Newgate passed the conversation you have given an account of between your mistress and you, in which your mistress said, she would give you 200 l. nay, ten times that sum, in order to swear to the particulars in those papers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was a great sum to offer for a witness, but that was because her life depended upon it: when you parted with your mistress, you had many objections; you was afraid of being found out; you asked what a bond was like: and then she explained to you what sort of man Sir

               <p>At last you agreed to do all this; but you must consult your husband first? - I did not intend to go to her again; I intended to have wrote a polite letter, and sent the papers back.</p>

               <p>The moment you saw your husband he was angry with you for staying so long; and by and by the child dropt a guinea, and your husband asking what that was, you said it was a guinea your wicked mistress had given the child? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Because I observe that very expression is in the written paper: was this paper produced to you in the manner in which you have represented it; or was it an offer that you made to this Mrs. Rudd, and asked to have what you said you would swear taken down in writing? - It was ready wrote when I came into the room.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about this upon the Tuesday? - She only spoke on Tuesday about my going with some messages for her.</p>
               <p>Then you did not offer your service in the lying way? - No.</p>
               <p>There was nothing said from you about giving evidence, or telling any lies? - No.</p>
               <p>Then the first talk of your telling lies was after the paper was wrote? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before she began to read she told you she wanted you to tell a lie for her? - Yes; and she said what she had wrote was as true as God was in heaven.</p>
               <p>Nothing had been said to you about this upon the Tuesday? - No.</p>
               <p>Then upon the Wednesday, the paper being ready wrote, she wanted to ask a favour of you; and then she told you that what she had wrote was as true as God was in heaven, and wanted you to say it happened at your house? - Yes; and she explained the papers as she went on.</p>
               <p>And then she told you what answers to make when you was cross-questioned? - She did.</p>
               <p>And after you had been with your husband you read over these papers? - I did twenty times.</p>
               <p>It is necessary one should read a paper very often in order to be-able to swear to it? - I was to remember the last word always: I told her I never was but once at Hicks's-Hall.</p>
               <p>Then you was to read and con it over so often as to remember perfectly the last words that were said, and the counsel and solicitor were to be just by in order to help you to go on with the story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Though you resolved from the moment you left Newgate never to do this wicked trick? - I did.</p>
               <p>Then why did you take the papers with you? - I was afraid to leave them behind.</p>
               <p>When did the justice take the papers from you? About four o'clock on the same day that I came from Newgate.</p>
               <p>When was the twenty times that you read these papers after you left Newgate? - While I was deliberating what to do with the papers for an hour, I read them over a great many times.</p>

            ? - I am.</p>
               <p>Did you go to Newgate with your wife; - I did not go with her; I went after her on the Tuesday. She told me her mistress had sent for her.</p>
               <p>Court. What she told you is not evidence: did you go to Newgate and find her? - I did: I sent up my name, and desired to speak to her: I went up; Mrs. Rudd and my wife were together: Mrs. Rudd asked me to sit down, which I did. Mrs. Rudd said, she desired I would not be angry with her for sending for my wife: she said she intended to send her children with her. I looked at my wife, and thought it very hard to be troubled with other people's children. Mrs. Rudd said, I need not think that her children-should be a burthen to me: that I might call next day, at nine o'clock, and her counsellor and solicitor would be there, and settle her children with me. She asked me what part of my house was to let: she said if the parlour was to let, that she would have the parlour for the children. My wife replied, the parlour and first floor were let to a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - At No 1, in Coombes-court, Well-street, Oxford-road. I said the second floor was to let, and that was more airy for children. She desired me to get iron-rails for the windows, to prevent the childrens falling out, which I did intend to do. We came home, and the next morning my wife and I went, at nine o'clock, to Newgate, and sent up our names. She sent for my wife up, and desired me to wait in the tap-room. I waited there from nine o'clock, I think, till near twelve. About twelve I sent up the man to desire my wife to come down: she came down soon after, and I was in a very great passion. I asked her where the children were? She said there were no children. I asked her what was the reason? she gave me little or no answer; and I saw she was all in a tremble. I said again to her, where are the children? she prayed me, for God's sake, to hold my tongue: she said, if you don't hold your tongue we shall be both taken up; which put me in a great confusion. I saw some papers in her hand: we went to the Horseshoe and Magpie, and there I saw these papers.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. DAVENPORT.</p>
               <p>How long had you been with Mrs. Rudd on the Tuesday? - About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>And she desired you to come with your wife next day? - She wrote down directions for my wife to go to several places for her.</p>
               <p>Your wife was not with you the first day? -</p>
               <p>Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>What directions were wrote down? - To go to some of the servants.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Rudd desire you to come? -</p>
               <p>Yes, with her own mouth.</p>
               <p>And yet you was not called up? - No, nor allowed to go up.</p>
               <p>Did you see any body else go to or from Mrs. Rudd on Wednesday? - I cannot tell; I saw none that I know of but my wife.</p>

Mrs. Rudd told me that Mrs. Hart had been with her, and told her a very strange incredible story, and she repeated what the woman had told her. I said I could not think there was any probability in such a scheme, and advised her to pay no kind of attention to it. Mrs. Rudd coincided with my opinion; and she said

Mrs. Rudd asked her to tell me the story that she had told yesterday; upon which Mrs. Hart said, I should be glad, Madam, if you would take it down in writing, for my husband and I are so scrupulously conscientious, that we would not for the world say any thing but what was really true, and therefore I should be glad to shew it to my husband, to know whether every thing in that writing is not precisely the fact; accordingly Mrs. Rudd did take down what she mentioned.</p>

               <p>You was present when all this passed? - Yes, I certainly was; and upon a consultation that was had the next evening at Mr. Davenport's chambers I shewed that paper, and said I did not place any reliance upon it, only I thought it my duty as counsel to point out every thing.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect coming the morning after to Guildhall, and shewing it to me? - Perfectly well.</p>

               <p>And you say you mentioned the circumstances at that time? - I did not read the paper in Mr. Davenport's chambers; but I mentioned my opinion of it then as a strange improbable romance, and the counsel were of the same opinion.</p>

               <p>Pray, do you recollect when it was that you first saw this woman? - The first time I ever saw Mrs. Hart was coming out of Mrs. Rudd's room.</p>
               <p>What time of day was that? - Between five and six in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Was any body with her? - Yes; a child in her arms, which I took for Mrs. Rudd's child; and not having seen her before, I took her to be Mrs. Rudd's servant.</p>
               <p>What time was you there on Wednesday? - At twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>You are sure it was twelve o'clock? - I think it was near that time. Mrs. Rudd always dined at two o'clock, and she did not dine till an hour after this conversation.</p>
               <p>Hart desired it might be put down in writing? - She did; and Mrs. Rudd wrote it from her dictation.</p>
               <p>Is the paper you have marked the original or the copy? - That is the original that has my name on it.</p>
               <p>How long did Mrs. Hart stay? - I imagine about an hour.</p>
               <p>When was she to return? - At five in the afternoon; and the reason why she appointed that time was because her husband would then have done work.</p>
               <p>Did she return at five o'clock? - No; she did not.</p>
               <p>Do you know where Mrs. Hart lives? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you ever at her house? - Yes, that evening.</p>
               <p>Did you see her? - No; I saw her husband at the street door smoaking his pipe; I asked him if he was master of the house? he said he was. I asked to see his wife? he said she was out. I asked why she did not come again to Mrs. Rudd? he swore violently that his wife should never go to Mrs. Rudd more.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - Near eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Did you ask him for the paper? - No, never.</p>
               <p>How came you to be so anxious about a story which nobody gave credit to, and want her to go again to Newgate? - She might want something else to speak to her about.</p>
               <p>Is it a true copy? - Yes, every line; I saw it copied.</p>

            . Do you remember Mr. Bailey coming in the evening? - Yes, that very day we were at Newgate; he came in the evening between eight and nine o'clock. He asked me, if Mrs. Hart was within? I told him she was not. Said he, Do you know where she is? I said no. What do you want with her? I want her to go down to her mistress immediately? I said, she shall not go out of my door; I would sooner break both her legs. He asked me, what was the matter? I said, why her cursed mistress has given her papers to hang herself and all the world, and I was in a great passion; I told him the papers were taken care of. The sweat ran down Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060028"/> Bailey's face very much. He asked me to go into the back-yard with him, which I did. He took me by a button of my waistcoat, and said, Pray, Mr. Hart, do not be in a passion; if you come to the bar, speak the truth, and nothing but the truth about these papers.</p>
               <p>Did any body apply to you for the papers? - Nobody applied to me for them. I told my wife, when I went from dinner to work, that if she was drawn into it, I would certainly swear against her. She said she was ready to do as I pleased.</p>
               <p>Were the papers given up at that time? - The papers were given up to the magistrate three hours before Mr. Bailey came.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about being given up to Mr. Bailey? - I told him I had taken care of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him you had carried them to a justice? - No.</p>
               <p>He said to you, do not be in a passion; and desired you, when it came to the trial to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth; what did you understand him to mean? - I did not know what he meant by it; he took me by the button.</p>
               <p>Speak the truth; about what? - About the papers?</p>
               <p>When what came to the trial? - The papers came to the trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper. Which came first; did he desire you to speak the truth before or after you told him you had taken care of the papers? - After I had told him that, he said, when you come to the trial speak the truth, and nothing but the truth; and I told him I would.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you carried the papers at this time to the justice. - Yes; three hours before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lucas. When you said the cursed woman wanted to hang your wife and you, and all the world, did Mr. Bailey then tell you, that your wife had dictated the paper?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bailey. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper. Mr. Bailey, have you heard what that man says? - I have.</p>
               <p>Is there any truth in it? - He was very violent about his wife; I never asked him about the papers.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you at that time, that his wife had got a paper to hang him, and all the world, or to that effect? - He blustered a great deal about the papers; I cannot tell whether he did say these words or no.</p>
               <p>He was very indignant about the papers? - He was angry to the last degree.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him at that time of his wife having dictated the papers? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he, during the conversation, call it a cursed paper, or give it any epithet that imported he was very angry at her having such a paper? - No; he said he was angry at her going to Mrs. Rudd, and she should never go to her again.</p>
               <p>Did he say the papers were taken care of? - Yes;</p>
               <p>"I have taken care of the papers."</p>
               <p>When you desired Hart, if it should come to a trial, that he would speak the truth about these papers, what did you mean by saying that to him? - What I told your lordship before; I thought it a very extraordinary transaction; and then, when I found that there was no person coming at five o'clock to tell the truth of the matter, I had some suspicions that these were persons sent to Mrs. Rudd in in order to get out of her as much as they could to turn against herself.</p>
               <p>But Hart had not told you at that time that Mrs. Rudd had given any paper to his wife? - No: I then had suspicions and doubts.</p>
               <p>What doubt could you have about it, if you was present and heard the woman deliver all that story to Mrs. Rudd? - I doubted very much that she had so much friendship to Mrs. Rudd as she prosessed: I thought rather she was a person sent with an intent to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Court. If she was ever so wicked a woman, and told this story, it could not affect Mrs. Rudd, if it was in the manner you represent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cowper. Did you impart these doubts to the counsel at the consultation? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you understand by the answer that he gave you, that he had taken care of the paper? - I did not know what he meant.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. You say you did not ask him for any papers? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury to Hart. Did he ask you for any papers? - He only asked me what I had done with them.</p>
               <p>You mentioned the papers first? - I did.</p>

               <p>Did you carry up the note? - No, one Lee carried it up. I believe Mrs. Rudd refused seeing her, and said she would see her another time. Mrs. Hart thought Mrs. Rudd must have made a mistake or she would have seen her, for she said she was an old servant.</p>

            ? - Yes: I have known her both before and since her connection with Mr. Perreau; I knew her as Mr. Rudd's wife, and afterwards as Mr. Perreau's.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of her fortune at the time of her connection with Mr. Perreau? - When her husband Rudd left her she was very much distressed: a gentleman allowed her 5 or 600 l. a year; she lived in a genteel manner; he gave her 16,000 l. In October 1770, she received 4000 l. in my presence; in March 1771, she received 3000 l. and some hundreds; I cannot charge my memory exactly, I believe about 700 l.</p>
               <p>Was that before her connection with Mr. Perreau, or since? - Since her connection with Mr. Perreau.</p>
               <p>This was part of the 16,000 l.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Was it given her by will? - No: it was left in a trustee's hand; she received 7700 l. at twice.</p>
               <p>How do you know that these are parts of the 16,000 l.? - Because I was present when the money was paid; it was left in the hands of a very near relation of mine that was the trustee.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know that he was a trustee of 16,000 l.? - I have heard him say so; I know perfectly well the gentleman who left it her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. MURPHY.</p>
               <p>I must beg the favour of knowing who the person was? - I will not tell.</p>
               <p>Was the money left by will? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Was there any writing about it? - It was left in the hands of a trustee.</p>
               <p>Then you can tell us the trustee perhaps? - I don't chuse that.</p>
               <p>Then we are not to know the trustee, nor the donor, nor when it was paid: in whose presence was it paid? - In my presence.</p>
               <p>Where was it paid? - At Mr. Perreau's house in Pall-mall. In October 1770, she received 4000 l.</p>
               <p>Who paid the money? - The trustee.</p>
               <p>In what manner? - He paid her 4000 l. down.</p>
               <p>Was a receipt given? - Yes.</p>

             produced a copy of the record<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060032"/> of the prisoner's sentence, which the witness said he had examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the person that was indicted by the name of Watson, otherwise Davis, some time ago? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is he in Court? - Yes; he is at the bar.</p>
               <p>Was you concerned in taking him up at that time? - No; but I am positive he is the man. I apprehended him this time near the Pantheon, Cold-Bath-Fields, in consequence of an information sent to Sir John Fielding's office. The prisoner was concealed in a house by the Pantheon; we got into the house, went up two pair of stairs, and found him under a bed.</p>
               <p>When was he transported? - In the year 1769.</p>
               <p>Was you particularly acquainted with him? - Yes, so well, that if I had seen him at large I would have taken him into custody.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you when he was apprehended? - He asked what we wanted.</p>
               <p>Did you know of his being at large before you had this information? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You say you had not seen him before this information? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not take him up upon your own knowledge? - I knew him as soon as I saw him.</p>
               <p>Was it in the beginning or latter end of the year 1769 when he was tried? - I believe it was the month of August of September.</p>
               <p>You take a great many men in the space of a year, do you not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you so positive to know one man from another among the crowd of prisoners you apprehend? - I know him as well as I do any person, and for some particular reason. If you want to know the reason I know him so well, I will tell you; I am positive to the man.</p>

               <p>Do you know where the rest of the sailors are? - No; I saw the chief mate about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing the man at the bar in America? (after looking about for some time, said) - I know him very well, and saw him in America; he came aboard the Grosvenor at New York to see some acquaintance, and drank pretty free: he asked leave to go on shore, but the captain had given orders that no man should go on shore, there being only eleven of us: he asked two or three times to go ashore, but the captain refused; he said no man should go on shore: they consulted together, but I cannot say what passed.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath is it truth that the captain is gone abroad? - Yes; I was only subpoenaed last night, and little thought of coming here.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner tell the captain the reason he wanted to be put on shore? - I did not hear; the captain gave that order the night before.</p>
               <p>Was the order given before he came on board? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did the rest tell him of that order before he got on board? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>When did you arrive in England? - We came to England four or five weeks before Christmas the year 1773; we came to Chatham. We sailed from America, September 1773; we were about six months from England. When the ship arrived at Chatham every man was discharged.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When the ship arrived at Chatham, the owner of the ship hired men to clear her out, and every hand was discharged; she was an old East-Indiaman. I never saw the last witness since that time till Monday afternoon: Mr. Nixon sent him to Newgate to me; my wife had heard of this man.</p>
               <p>[Tamis was again called, and said Mr. Nixon sent him to see the prisoner in Newgate.]</p>
               <p>During the voyage did you know that this man was in America on transportation? - No, I did not: I knew the man very well, he was my mess-mate: the cook was taken ill, and he was ordered to assist in cooking.</p>
               <p>Was the Captain aboard when the prisoner came? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner know before he came on board that such orders were given? - I don't know; it was the night before we sailed.</p>
               <p>Is it usual for the captain to let strangers come on board after giving such orders, as any person my be carried off in that way? - The captain said no man should go on shore: I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060033"/> would not say this if I was not sure: I have nothing for it, I lose my time.</p>

I opened the parlour cupboard, and all the cash I had in the house was gone.

On the 17th of October, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our house and asked half-a-guinea on that gold watch (pointing to one of the watches which Mr. Younker deposed belonged to him). I am sure this is the watch with a shagreen case. I asked him where he lived; he said in the Borough. He was not dressed as he is now: he had light-coloured cloaths; from his dress I took him for a baker. I asked him if the watch was his own; he said it was a family affair, and he would not lose it for never so much: he desired me to take great care of it: this was all that past. I am sure that is the watch he left with me.</p>

            . Some time ago Mr. Younker gave information at Sir John Fielding's office that he had been robbed, and his servant had absconded. Sunday was a week a letter was sent to our office that the prisoner was with his father on the other side of Westminster Bridge. I went with some other officers, and found the prisoner at the bar in his father's house. I asked his father if his son had brought any thing there; if he would not tell me I would search. The prisoner told me where that plain gold watch was in a cupboard by the side of the fire-place (after looking at one of the watches produced, said it was the watch he found by the prisoner's direction). We took him into custody that night; on Monday evening he was examined: the prosecutor was sent for, and the prisoner told him the whole matter, and where he pawned the other watch; that he robbed his master of two gold watches and three silver ones and money; that he went down to Staffordshire; that he hid the money in a field at Blackstone in Staffordshire, but somebody took it away.</p>

             the prosecutor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What do you know of your house being broke open? - I left the house about six in the evening, and left no body in the house: my husband was not at home; I returned between eight and nine o'clock, and found the outer door, and another door, part of which is glass, both laid open: when I went out they were both shut and fastened: I was much surprised when I saw them open, and would not go in till I had called all my neighbours. I found when I went in that the chest, full of my wearing apparel, was gone; which contained a black negligee, blue paduasoy nightgown, pompadour silk gown, white lutestring gown and coat, a white muslin night gown, two sets of car-rings, one of paste, the other garnets; a cotton counterpane; these were all in the chest: I saw it that night before I went out, and every thing in it.</p>
               <p>Did you find any of your goods again? - On Sunday the 4th of November one Mr. Jones told me I must go to a justice Durden: I went, where I saw the prisoners and some of the goods. The justice ordered me to come next day at ten o'clock: some of my goods were brought in a bag when I was at the justice's. (The goods produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix deposed they were part of the goods taken out of her house the night the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>What do you know against the prisoners? - They broke my house open.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I am very sure, for they threatened to do it before.</p>
               <p>Are you acquainted with the prisoners? - No: they broke my window, and before that threatened to break open the house.</p>

            . About eight o'clock, on a Saturday night, about a month ago, the prisoners at the bar brought me those goods now produced: I gave them a guinea for these gowns and petticoat.</p>
               <p>Did you ask how they came by them? - No: I took the goods to a neighbour's house that night.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoners brought those things? - Yes; I have seen them many times before; I had a light in the house: there was another young woman with me.</p>

            . I live in Petty France, Westminster. On a Sunday afternoon the prosecutrix came to my house, told me her house had been broke open and robbed. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060035"/> went and found the middle of the door, the glass-door and lock, and hinges, were broke. I heard the chest was found in a hog well: I found it empty, only some rags and papers in it. It had been dragged along the ground, by which we traced it to a public-house in Tothill Fields, where we found the three prisoners, and apprehended them. They all confessed: they said they sold the things to Mrs. Ross in the New Way. They likewise owned it before t he justice. I went down with another officer, and took Mrs. Ross to the justice. She denied it at first; she sent her servant with me to a house, six or seven doors from her own, where the goods were; they were in a coarse bag. These are the goods now produced.</p>
               <p>One of the prisoners asked if the witness could swear that they confessed before the justice? - She said, upon my oath, they did.</p>

They pressed me against the wall, and took the money out of my pocket, and the watch. I do not recollect either of the other prisoners, but one of my seals was found on one of them.

            , Constable. I think it was on a Thursday or Friday the 20th of November, I am not certain as to the day, one Dumon came to me and described the three prisoners at the bar, and said they were gone into the fields.</p>
               <p>How long is it since that man told you of the prisoners going out into the fields? - I think it was the 22d of November: he said they wanted him to go out with them and get some money. We went after them, and found the three prisoners sitting in a public-house, the sign of the Castle, in Red Lion-street. We brought them to the justice, and they were committed. He told them that they were to be examined on Monday. The gentleman swore to Camper. The seals were found on Hatch the prisoner, which Mr. Bentley swore to.</p>

I got more beer, and had my pocket picked of the money and my watch.</p>
               <p>How much had you to pay for the beer? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Did they sit by you? - I don't know: I fell asleep, and cannot well say when I awoke; but when I did, I missed my money and watch: I did not take notice of missing it when they first went out. Mr. Petro asked me, if I had not a watch? - I said, yes; but did not know what was become of it. He said the prisoner had taken it?</p>
               <p>What did you do when you awoke? - I was carried before a justice to prove the watch. I knew I had lost both money and watch before I went out. Jones and Wright took me before the justice, likewise the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Was there any body but the prisoner with you in the house? - Yes; there were three women. Next morning, when I was more sober, I was carried before the justice again to give an account of what I had lost.</p>
               <p>What do you labour in? - I attend a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>How came you to have all this money? - I was earning it this year and half, and sweated much for it.</p>
               <p>You did not perceive that your money and watch was gone till you awoke? - No.</p>
               <p>Was this woman in your company? - Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>When you awoke was she there or not? - No; when Petro found I had lost my watch, he sent for them back again. (The watch was produced and sworn to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Is Petro here? - I don't know: I gave him notice to come.</p>
               <p>What day in the week did it happen? - On a Tuesday.</p>

When on our way to the justice the prisoner took out three guineas, and gave to me to keep for her, in case she should be sent to Newgate. The prosecutor said, he had no money: as soon as Mr. Wright went in, he said, give me the watch. The prisoner gave it him, and said she had it of the prosecutor to keep for five shillings.

Justice Blackborow ordered them into custody: the justice told them the consequence if they did not confess where the skins were; we found them at a house on Saffron-hill, by direction of one Mr. Bulbridge.</p>

            . I keep a room at a house at Cow-Cross. The prisoner's wife came and brought a piece of linen, and asked my wife where she could pawn it, who directed her. The pawnbroker offered her 12 s. she wanted 16 s. for it: she consented to take 12 s. at last, but the pawnbroker would not give it till she brought some person that knew her. She came to me, and I went with her, and told the pawnbroker I believed she was a very honest woman, and that it was her own property; whereupon the pawnbroker gave her the 12 s. upon the linen.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the rabbit skins? - Yes; the prisoner sent for me next day, and told me he was like to be brought into a scrape. I don't know any thing further of them, only that he desired I would sell them for him.</p>

She was a single woman. I was apprehensive of the things being gone, so got a warrant and searched her lodgings, when all those things appeared to be missing. I went to one Finch, a pawnbroker in Berwick-street, Soho, found part of them there, the rest I found in John-street. She acknowledged before the justice that they were my property, and that she had pawned them herself. (The goods produced and sworn to by the prosecutor.)</p>

            . Can he challenge upon the issue of autre fois?</p>
               <p>Mr. RECORDER said he could.</p>
               <p>COURT. In pleas in abatement there are two issues, and they are always tried upon separate charges to the Jury. Besides, charging them with both issues at once would lead ot this absurdity, that being charged with both they would be obliged to find upon both; and yet, if the first finding was for the prisoner, they could not go to the second, that finding being a bar. They are distinct issues, and must be separate charges. The counsel for the prosecution was therefore ordered to put in a replication.</p>
               <p>The trial was then adjourned over to the Monday following, when Mr. LUCAS, counsel for the prisoner, moved to withdraw his plea, which was done accordingly; and the trial came on upon the second issue of not guilty.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. ELLIOT.</p>
               <p>You were surgeon on board the Vansittart upon her voyage? - I was: we left England at the latter end of May 1773. The prisoner and the deceased were both passengers in the Vansittart.</p>
               <p>Whether in the course of the voyage from England to the Cape of Good Hope, there was any difference between the passengers and the prisoner? - There was a dispute between <rs id="t17751206-25-viclabel109" type="occupation">Captain</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17751206-25-victim553 t17751206-25-viclabel109"/> Fergusson and Captain Roche while we were at Madeira.</p>
               <p>Was that the first dispute, or was there any former difference, in the course of that voyage, between the prisoner and the rest of the passengers? - I know of no particulars: I always understood the dispute to be between Captain Fergusson and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Where did the prisoner mess during the voyage? - Part of the time at the captain's table; but afterwards, by the general concurrence of the captain and the gentlemen passengers, the prisoner was dismissed from the captain's table: that was about a month after.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any thing particular passing between the prisoner and the deceased before they arrived at the Cape? - They did not speak to one another from the time of leaving Madeira.</p>
               <p>Did they avoid each other? - Captain Fergusson always avoided Captain Roche: I have seen Captain Roche make wry faces at Captain Fergusson as they were walking the quarter deck.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any particular expressions between Captain Roche and Captain Fergusson? - Captain Fergusson has told me often, he would not have any connection with captain Roche: the quarrel at the Madeira's was between the prisoner and Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>When did you land at the Cape? - We landed on the 4th of September 1773, and we left the Cape on the 3d of June.</p>
               <p>Can you relate to the Court any thing that you remember, with respect to the charge against the prisoner, upon the 4th of September? - Upon the 4th of September, the same day we landed, we were sitting in the common hall<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060050"/> at Mr. Charron's, with the other passengers, when there was a message brought in.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS of Counsel for the Prisoner. I submit to the Court, that no message ought to be given an account of that was delivered in the absence of Captain Roche?</p>
               <p>Was Captain Roche present? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Court. Then the message will not affect him.</p>
               <p>There were sitting in the room Mr. Grant, Mr. Grant's mother and sister, Captain Fergusson, Captain Fergusson's brother, Mr. Dun, Mr. Brodie, Mr. Charron, and myself; it was rather later than six, when a message came in, that one Captain Matthews wanted to speak with Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>Who delivered the message? - I believe Mr. Charron: the message was repeated twice, upon which Captain Fergusson went out of the room: I had not the smallest idea of what afterwards happened, and therefore paid little attention to it; in a very few minutes after that, Mr. Charron brought intelligence that somebody was fighting; upon which we all went out: when I had got a few yards from the door I met Captain Roche turning the corner of the street, sheathing his sword.</p>
               <p>How far was that from the house you came out of? - Not above three or four yards, I believe: I walked past him, and turned the corner of the wall, and went up to Captain Fergusson, whom I found supported by Mr. Grant; he was then about fourteen or fifteen yards from Mr. Charron's house. I found him entirely speechless, lying upon the ground, Grant had hold of him; his pulse was sunk; and he had, in short, every symptom of a dying man: I helped to carry him to Mr. Charron's house, where he died in a few minutes.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the body? - The next day: I don't think I shall be able to remember all the wounds; but the wound that was the cause of his death penetrated above the left pap, passing over the third rib in an oblique direction.</p>
               <p>Explain what you wean by an oblique direction? - Passing from the left to the right, rather inclining downwards; the sword had stuck against the third rib, which had made it slant a little, and passed through the intercostal muscles and the pleura.</p>
               <p>What is the pleura? - A thin membrane like a web, that lines the cavity of the breast; it penetrated the perecardium, and then wounded the aorta (which is a large artery that comes immediately from the heart) about half an inch from the left ventricle; which was the immediate cause of his death: there were several other wounds, all upon the left side, excepting one wound that extended from his forehead towards the crown of his head, which seemed as if struck with the sword.</p>
               <p>Do you remember any wounds except upon the left side? - None except that upon the forehead.</p>
               <p>Now describe the place in which you found Captain Fergusson lying? - It was about fifteen yards from Charron's house, behind a dead wall, round the corner.</p>
               <p>Which way must Captain Fergusson have turned? - Coming from Charron's house he must have turned to the left.</p>
               <p>Did you see Captain Roche after the commission of this fact? - No; not after I met him turning the corner, sheathing his sword.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Cape? - Till the 17th of the same month.</p>
               <p>Did you make any enquiry respecting Captain Roche? - I went with several of the gentlemen to the governor's house on the evening of Captain Fergusson's burial, which happened upon the 5th: we went to desire the governor would cause all diligent search to be made after Captain Roche.</p>
               <p>But you never saw Captain Roche after that day to the 17th? - No.</p>
               <p>Were any application made, to your knowledge, to the fiscal for the apprehension of Captain Roche? - Yes; and there was a reward offered for apprehending him, but I was not present at any applications made to the fiscal.</p>
               <p>What position must the body have been in to have received those wounds you have described? - I cannot possibly say; the wounds were upon the left side.</p>
               <p>But could wounds have been given in the parts you have mentioned, and the sword have had that direction which you have described, if Captain Fergusson had been in a state either of offence or defence? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Captain Fergusson left-handed? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060051"/>Cross Examination by Mr. LUCAS.</p>
               <p>Whether Captain Roche had applied to Captain Fergusson to make up the difference between them? - If any applications were made, they were made to the military: I was only surgeon of the ship; I never heard any thing but a report.</p>
               <p>But did Captain Roche make any application to you to accommodate the difference? - Captain Roche spoke to me after we left the Madeira's, and I spoke to Captain Fergusson; and Captain Fergusson said he did not know of any dispute subsisting between him and Captain Roche.</p>
               <p>What was Captain Roche's application? - I don't remember the particulars; only he wanted to know what was the reason that Captain Fergusson did not speak to him: I know of no other cause. Captain Fergusson told me he had settled every dispute with Captain Roche at Madeira; that he would have no further connection with him, and there was no fort of quarrel subsisting between them.</p>
               <p>Court. Was Captain Fergusson's sword drawn? - His sword was lying by his side; and it appeared to be twisted at the side, and a bit of it broke off about an inch or two.</p>
               <p>Had Captain Roche any wound? - I cannot say; I only saw him as he passed.</p>
               <p>Were there any appearances of blood upon Captain Fergusson's sword? - I don't think there were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. What was the disstance of time between Captain Fergusson's being called out by the message, as from Captain Matthews, and when you saw him lying under the wall? - I fancy not more than five minutes; it was exceedingly short indeed.</p>
               <p>Had Captain Fergusson any cane? - I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Was Captain Fergusson dim-sighted as well as short-sighted? - He was dim-sighted: he had a particular defect in one of his eyes, and the other eye was short-sighted; there was a defect that lessened the sight.</p>
               <p>Which was the eye that had the defect? - I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Did Captain Roche know that Captain Fergusson was dim-sighted? - I never heard that from Captain Roche.</p>
               <p>But must not every man have seen it on board the ship? - It was perfectly visible to every body.</p>
               <p>Was it dark or light when he went out? - Candles were lighted: I fancy it is dark there between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>At what distance was Captain Roche from you when you first perceived him? - He was not two yards from me, I believe.</p>
               <p>At what distance did you see Captain Fergusson? - About the same distance: Mr. Grant had just lifted Captain Fergusson up by the shoulders when I came up.</p>
               <p>Was it quite dark, or was it twilight? - It was past twilight.</p>
               <p>I believe you know, that at the line, or near it, it grows dark sooner than it does here? - It does.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for a man, who had no defect in his eyes, to see a sword's length? - I don't think it was; because it was exceeding dark indeed.</p>
               <p>Jury. When you first saw Captain Roche, did he appear in a hurry, as if making his escape? - He was walking fast, and was putting his sword in the scabbard.</p>
               <p>Do you know what hour Captain Roche came on shore? - Only from hearsay; when I came on shore, which was at two o'clock, I left him on board.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS. How long was it after you left the house before you saw Captain Roche? - He passed by the door almost directly.</p>
               <p>Consider you came out of a room lighted with candles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you never made the observation, that when a man comes out of a lighted room into the street, it appears much darker to him than it does to one that has been some time in the open air? - I am sensible of that; but it was some time before I entered the house again, and that convinced me of the darkness.</p>
               <p>How long was you out of the house in all? - I suppose not more than five minutes.</p>
               <p>- MOODY sworn. Examined by Mr. MACDONALD.</p>
               <p>You were the surgeon's mate, I believe, in this voyage in the Vansittart? - I was.</p>
               <p>Captain Fergusson and Captain Roche were two of the several passengers, I believe, on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060052"/> board the Vansittart, of which Captain Young was the commander? - Yes: we sailed from England in May 1773, and arrived at the Cape in the September following; we touched at the Madeira's in our way.</p>
               <p>How long were you between the Madeira's and the Cape? - I cannot be positive as to the time.</p>
               <p>Now after your departure from the island of Madeira, in your passage to the Cape, did you hear Captain Roche speak about any disputes or quarrels that had happened between him and Captain Fergusson? - Yes; I heard him mention the disputes, at different times, between him and the passengers of the Vansittart: I have heard him say there were disputes between him and Captain Fergusson; but he did not mention the nature of them.</p>
               <p>That there were, or that there had been? - That there were still subsisting between him and Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing of what he would do or intended to do upon it? - He said nothing in particular till the night we arrived at the Cape of Good Hope: I had heard him say several times before our arrival at the Cape, that he should with to shorten the race of the Fergussons.</p>
               <p>How many times have you heard him make use of that expression? - I cann ot be positive to the different times.</p>
               <p>How lately before your arrival at the Cape was it that you heard him say he wished to shorten the race of the Fergussons? - I cannot be positive how long it was before we arrived at the Cape; but I have heard him, at different times, make use of that expression.</p>
               <p>I would with to know of you, whether upon the quarter deck you observed any thing particular in Captain Roche's behaviour? - I never observed any thing in particular; I have heard other people speak of it.</p>
               <p>As you have heard him say several times that he wished to shorten the race of the Fergussons, did he give any reason why he wished that? - He said he believed Captain Fergusson to be the cause of the disputes between the passengers and him.</p>
               <p>Then there were disputes between the other passengers and him? - There were.</p>
               <p>And was that the reason he gave why he wished to shorten the race of the Fergussons? - Yes, that was the reason he assigned to me.</p>
               <p>Did you hear him before they landed at the Cape say any thing more? - I never heard any thing particular till the night we arrived at the Cape: Captain Roche sent a message to me after I was gone to bed, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, that he desired to speak with me directly, as Mrs. Roche, his wife, was indisposed in his cabin; I dressed myself and went up to Captain Roche's cabin; he desired me to walk in and drink a glass or two of wine with him, and said he had something particular to communicate to me: I told him I came to enquire for Mrs. Roche, as I understood she was indisposed; he said he had something particular to say that would not detain me, so I went in: he began recounting a great many of the particulars of the quarrels that were between him and the passengers on board, and particularly Captain Fergusson, whom he said he believed to be the principal instigator of the disturbances that subsisted between them. He afterwards asked me if I had heard whether Captain Fergusson would accept of a challenge in case he should send him one? I told him I was entirely ignorant as to the dispute that was subsisting between him and the passengers; that I had heard nothing whether he would or would not. He told me then that the next day he should go on shore, having agreed for a lodging for himself and his wife, and he was determined to call upon Captain Fergusson and chastise him, as he expressed it. He asked me at the same time, as he did before, whether or not I had heard that he would accept of a challenge? I told him I was entirely ignorant. He said he did not believe that Captain Fergusson was a coward: that he would accept of a challenge if it was given him; but he said, if he did not by G - d he would run him through the body. This was, I think, on the third of September.</p>
               <p>This was the night before your landing? - It was the night we arrived at the Cape: they went on shore the next morning.</p>
               <p>Was this before any body was gone on shore? Yes, I believe it was. Captain Fergusson was killed the next night. After Captain Roche had told me this he went out of the cabin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060053"/> about twenty minutes, and Mrs. Roche seemed to be much affected with what he had said.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I know what you are coming to; it is not proper to mention what Mrs. Roche said. - Captain Roche told me at the same time that he was going to borrow a sword from Mr. Edgeworth, one of the passengers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edgeworth is a military gentleman, is he not? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did he say that sword was for? - He said he got that sword with an intention to chastise Captain Fergusson. I saw Mr. Edgeworth give him a sword next morning.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass at that time between Captain Roche and any one? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>I believe you was on board the ship when Captain Fergusson was killed? - I was.</p>
               <p>What time did Captain Roche go on shore? - Between three and four in the afternoon, I believe.</p>
               <p>What time did Captain Fergusson go on shore? - I think about ten o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>When did you go on shore? - I did not go on shore till three, four, or five days afterwards.</p>
               <p>You never saw Captain Roche afterwards? - Never, till I saw him in England.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. HOWARTH.</p>
               <p>You, I understand, was surgeon on board this ship? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who recommended you to that employ; you know Mr. Cairncross? - I was taken out by Mr. Cairncross.</p>
               <p>Cairncross was the friend and countryman of Captain Fergusson I understand? - I don't know whether he was.</p>
               <p>Were they strangers to one another, or pretty intimate? - I was never with them: I messed differently; I was in a different company on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see them speak to one another? - It was very seldom that I had an opportunity of seeing them.</p>
               <p>Do you believe they were acquainted or not? - Mr. Cairncross must be acquainted with every one on board the ship.</p>
               <p>Were Cairncross and Fergusson both countrymen? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Are you a countryman to Cairncross and Fergusson? - Yes, I am a Scotchman.</p>
               <p>And their countryman? - I never heard any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now, were Captain Roche and you pretty intimate? - There never was any particular intimacy.</p>
               <p>Then you were pitched upon, not being the intimate friend of Captain Roche, to be sent for at this late hour of the night into his cabin, and there passed this long story you have told us: did you mention it to Cairncross your countryman? - I did not at that time.</p>
               <p>But did you not mention it to him the next morning? - I did not; Cairncross went on shore early next morning.</p>
               <p>Did you mention it to Captain Fergusson? - No; I never spoke three words to Captain Fergusson:</p>
               <p>Did you mention it to any body? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>How long after did you mention it? - I mentioned it to several people on board the ship after we failed from the Cape.</p>
               <p>Did you before Captain Fergusson's death mention it to any body? - They were all gone ashore next morning.</p>
               <p>What time did they go on shore? - In the forenoon, between ten and eleven, I believe.</p>
               <p>Had you no opportunity to tell it to Captain Fergusson before he went on shore, or to mention this to Captain Young or any body? - I might have had an opportunity, but I did not think it necessary; there were so many disputes subsisting between him and the passengers that I did not chuse to do that, as I thought it might be productive of bad consequences.</p>
               <p>You heard a gentleman talk of going next day to chastise Captain Fergusson, saw him borrow a sword for the purpose, and heard him say he would chastise him when he went on shore, and yet you never mentioned this? - More of the men saw him borrow the sword.</p>
               <p>Why did you not mention it to Cairncross or Captain Young, or some of the officers? - I had no opportunity; and I could not think it would be productive of any good if I had done it.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go even that night and desire Captain Roche might be put under an arrest?</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060054"/>
               <p>- I did not chuse to meddle with any of the disputes between them.</p>
               <p>Have you ever heard Captain Fergusson say any thing about Captain Roche? - I never heard him say a word about him.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear him talk of any memorial he intended to present against him? -</p>
               <p>No.</p>
               <p>Did you see Captain Fergusson go on shore? - No.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. I believe Mr. Cairncross was a total stranger to Captain Fergusson till he went on board the ship? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner Roche is a land officer in the East-India Company's service? - Yes, I heard he bore a captain's commission.</p>
               <p>What was Fergusson? - I heard he had the same commission of a captain.</p>
               <p>Who was the commanding officer of the land forces on board the ship? - Colonel Kay.</p>
               <p>I suppose there were soldiers on board? - Yes, there were.</p>
               <p>Then the senior officer I suppose had the command of the officers and soldiers that were on board? - I don't know how that was.</p>
               <p>I suppose you had heard orders given on board to the men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>From the senior officer to the junior officer, and the junior officer to the men, I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Colonel Kay was on board at this time? - He was.</p>
               <p>How came you not to acquaint Colonel Kay, or any other commanding officer, of these threats? - I never thought of acquainting Colonel Kay of it.</p>
               <p>Then you thought no harm would happen? - As it was well known so many disputes had subsisted during the voyage, I thought it unnecessary; if he had done it before there was any disputes, I should have thought it my duty.</p>
               <p>What did you understand when he said he would chastise him? - I understood, if he did not fight him he would run him through the body, as he told me.</p>
               <p>Did not you think the danger the man was in worth communicating to the commanding officer? - Yes; but as there had been disputes, I thought they were sufficiently prepared against any danger of that kind.</p>
               <p>How came you not to inform Captain Fergusson of it, that he might be prepared? or it might have been better to have informed the commanding officer that he might prevent it? - It was a neglect to be sure; but I did not think it at all necessary for me to do it; I thought it was the necessary consequence of malice he bore to Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Was any deposition taken from you at the Cape? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Why, after the death of Captain Fergusson, did you not immediately go on shore and make a full discovery after what you knew had happened to Captain Fergusson? - I was obliged to be on board the ship, the surgeon was then gone ashore.</p>
               <p>Was you ashore at all? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay on shore? - Two or three days.</p>
               <p>How came you not to make an information of what you had heard? - I was never called upon.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. After having heard Captain Roche declare the preceding night that he was determined to chastise Captain Fergusson, and for that purpose borrowed a sword of another officer, because he thought his own not good enough, why did not you, when you heard of Captain Fergusson's death, go on shore and make an information before some magistrate of what you had heard, or why did you not do it when you was on shore? - I had mentioned the circumstance to people on board; when I was ashore I never was called upon.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you the only person that heard him say this in the cabin? - I was.</p>
               <p>How should it be known that you could give any information at all, if you did not mention it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. You can tell us whether there were not other interrogatories put to the witnesses at the Cape? - I don't know any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Whether it was publickly known on board the ship that Captain Roche had made use of threatening expressions? - I heard it was publicly known all over the ship that he had long before that made use of threatening expressions.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. MACDONALD.</p>
               <p>I think you was the commander of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060055"/> Vansittart on her voyage outwards in the year 1773? - I was.</p>
               <p>Mr. MACDONALD. Please to tell any thing you know relative to Captain Roche and Captain Fergusson? - I received Captain Roche, by order of the Company, in the latter end of April 1773: I was to carry him to Bombay: we sailed a few days afterwards. There were many disputes before we arrived at Madeira between Captain Roche and the passengers, which I understood when we came to Madeira to be fully settled. After we had left Madeira some little time, I really cannot say how long, Captain Roche desired I would carry a letter to Captain Fergusson, containing a concession for some offence, and begging pardon for what had passed. Captain Fergusson said he had so often offended, and so often asked pardon, that he was determined to make a memorial to the governor and council at Bombay. Captain Fergusson said he could not, nor would he accept his concessions, unless Captain Roche would sign some paper which was drawn up. It was sent to Captain Roche: he did not sign it; what his reasons were for not signing it I cannot say, and no concession was accepted. The day before we got into the Cape, Captain Roche came to me upon the quarter-deck, and told me he had been addressing himself to Captain Fergusson to know whether he meant to give him satisfaction on shore as a gentleman or not, and that Captain Fergusson would make him no reply, but that he was determined to make him speak to him on shore. The next day about eight in the evening we came to an anchor at the <placeName id="t17751206-25-crimeloc110">Cape of Good Hope</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17751206-25-crimeloc110" type="placeName" value="Cape of Good Hope"/>

                        targets="t17751206-25-off107 t17751206-25-crimeloc110"/>: the wind blew strong, so that we did not dispatch a boat on shore; but Captain Fergusson asked me when a boat came, if I had any objection to his going on shore in that boat. He went on shore about ten or eleven o'clock with my third officer. About noon the wind rather moderated, and I chose to go on shore myself. Captain Roche applied to me for an order that he might have a boat whenever he chose to go on shore; I ordered my first officer to let him have a boat whenever he wanted it. About four o'clock I went down to the water-side to see if I had ever a boat on shore, and I saw my own boat coming on shore with Captain Roche and Mrs. Roche. Upon their landing I went on board in the boat, and Captain Roche and Mrs. Roche walked up the wharf towards the town with my purser, I went on shore again at near seven: just as I was entering the door of the house I lodged at, two of the passengers, Mr. Pemberton and Mr. Brodie, who are writers in the Company's service, came in great confusion and told me Captain Roche had assassinated Captain Fergusson in the street: I was a good deal struck, and made some enquiry, but they told me Captain Fergusson was then expiring.</p>
               <p>Were you present at any time when any applications were made to the governor? - I went that very evening to the governor, and told him one of my passengers had killed another in the streets of his town; he said he was sorry for it, but he would order diligent search to be made to bring the parties to account for what they had done.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay at the Cape? - From the 3d at night till the 17th in the morning.</p>
               <p>Did you at any other time during that period make the same applications to the governor or fiscal? - Yes; Colonel Kay and some more of the passengers told me they should be glad to accompany me to the fiscal, to desire that Captain Roche might be apprehended, if possible, and brought to justice for killing Captain Fergusson. Upon the evening Captain Fergusson was buried, which was a few days after his death, we went to the governor, and told him that we imagined that diligent search had not been made, or else in so small a town Captain Roche must have been apprehended and brought to justice. The fiscal assured us that it had, and that very diligent search should be made.</p>
               <p>Did you make the same applications at any considerable distance of time after that? - I believe not many days before I left the Cape; I believe four or five days: I made a morning visit to the governor, as I did frequently, and in conversation I told him I thought it very extraordinary; the governor said, we cannot hear any thing of Captain Roche: I said, I think it odd in your small place: the governor assured me, that if he apprehended him he would keep him till an English man of war came in, and send him over.</p>
               <p>Did you hear of any reward being offered? - I was told by the passengers that Mr. Fergusson his brother had offered a reward.</p>
               <p>Did you, in company with any one else, make any enquiry at the house of one Vanderpool,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060056"/> whether he was there? - I am not clear whether I was there with the fiscal or not; I do think I walked up to Mr. Vanderpool's door and left them there, when the fiscal commanded Vanderpool to come out.</p>
               <p>When you carried this letter from Captain Roche to Captain Fergusson, did Captain Fergusson make any observations what Captain Roche's behaviour ought to be? - Not as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Did Captain Fergusson say whether he would or not fight him? - He said he was tired of Captain Roche's behaviour, he had offended so often, and asked pardon so often, that he would accept of no concessions from him, but he would make a memorial to the Governor and Council at Bombay.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination by Mr. DAVENPORT.</p>
               <p>If I understand you right, Captain Roche made repeated concessions to Captain Fergusson, who as often resisted them? - On board the ship there was no offer of concession.</p>
               <p>From the conduct of both whether you understood that Captain Roche was ready to make all proper concession, and that Captain Fergusson would not accept of any? - I did not attend to any particular conversations upon it, nor did I know they had quarrelled, until Captain Roche informed me so.</p>
               <p>Then there were concessions as large, and as often repeated as the affronts were given, to your knowledge. - Not to my knowledge; I never heard of any.</p>
               <p>As far as you know? - As far as I know.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any fresh quarrels after Captain Roche offered to make concessions between him and Captain Fergusson? - I don't.</p>
               <p>I will ask you how Captain Fergusson went armed when he went on shore? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you see him with a cane? - I don't recollect seeing him with a cane, or having any thing else in his hand; I did not observe.</p>
               <p>He went on shore four or five hours before Captain Roche? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know from the governor or fiscal that Captain Roche had sent on shore to the governor or fiscal to desire that some steps might be taken to prevent any assault, or any thing happening between him and Captain Fergusson? - I never heard that.</p>
               <p>How many boats went on shore after Captain Fergusson went, and before Captain Roche went? - That I cannot tell, whether four, five, or six; my chief officers could answer that best.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was it after Captain Roche and his lady went on shore that you heard of the death of Captain Fergusson? - About four he went on shore, and it was near seven when I heard of it.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. COX.</p>
               <p>I believe you was a mate on board the Vansittart? - I was.</p>
               <p>Have you heard Captain Fergusson say any thing, and what in relation to his conduct with Captain Roche?</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS. What Captain Fergusson said is no evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. COX. What we mean to prove is, that Captain Fergusson declared before he went on shore that if Captain Roche should challenge him he would not fight him.</p>
               <p>Court. I don't see the relivancy of that evidence, if it was given. To be sure, nothing that Captain Fergusson said in conversation before the time of the wound being given, when the prisoner was not present, can affect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. I submit to your Lordship upon a question, whether the wound was given in consequence of a challenge or no, that it would be evidence; for the question would be, whether Captain Fergusson did or not to go out to fight this gentleman in a fair duel? Now we will shew that Captain Fergusson declared he would not fight him.</p>
               <p>You have not heard any thing said by Captain Roche upon the subject at any time, have you? - I don't recollect I have.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any applications made to the fiscal with regard to this affair? - Upon the evening that Captain Fergusson was buried I went with Captain Young, Colonel Kay, and several other gentlemen, passengers, and officers belonging to the ship, and waited upon the fiscal and governor.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS. I submit to your Lordship, that the conversation between the fiscal and governor is not evidence?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060057"/>Mr. COX. I only examine him as to the application to the fiscal.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the slight in such a country as that, where the judge never hears them, but hangs them up directly, right or wrong, the slight can be nothing: their manner of trial is surprizing; if the party is a low man, he is committed to prison, and they send and take examinations; if they are satisfied he is guilty, they give orders for him to be hanged: if he is a gentleman, they put officers over him, but they don't see him or hear him, and he is to wait till he knows whether the fiscal, who is an arbitrary judge, hangs him or not; that is what a gentleman swore who has been at the Cape.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. If they want evidence, then they examine the party accused.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. My Lord, we have gone through all our evidence, except the depositions taken at the Cape.</p>
               <p>Court. They cannot be admitted here,</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My Lord,</p>
               <p>I am very happy that I have now an opportunity of justifying my conduct before a jury of Englishmen. The governor and the judge at the Cape, the most arbitary country in the world, were perfectly satisfied of the propriety of my conduct, and they discharged me: I have witnesses to make that demonstrable before your Lordship. I have also evidence to be produced to shew the manner in which I was treated by Captain Fergusson. As an officer I was compelled to support my honor, and I did not draw my sword till after I was knocked down. I received a violent cut upon my head, and had my arm dislocated. My Lord, I will now call my witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. Call any witnesses you think proper to the fact; we cannot suffer any witnesses to to be called as to what passed before the fiscal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to the matter of fact, my attorney has got a list of witnesses, which I beg he will call in.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. LUCAS.</p>
               <p>Was you at the Cape of Good Hope in September 1773? - Yes; I went out from England in the Britannia; I went afterwards into the Dolphin man of war.</p>
               <p>How long have you been out of England? - About two years and a half: I went to the Cape in the Earl of Sandwich.</p>
               <p>What time did you leave the Earl of Sandwich? - The second of September, at False Bay, about eighteen miles from the Cape: I left the ship on the second, and went to the Cape the same day: I staid there four or five days.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any thing particular upon Saturday evening the 4th of September? - Yes; I was at a punch-house at the Cape, called the Naked Man. At about six o'clock in the evening I went through the Company's gardens, and I saw a tall man following a gentleman up who was dressed in red.</p>
               <p>How was that tall man dressed? - In light blue: I saw him knock the short gentleman down that was dressed in red.</p>
               <p>Who was that short gentleman that was dressed in red? - As far as I could hear afterwards it was a captain belonging to the Company's service; it is that gentleman (pointing to Captain Roche). I saw him knock him down with a cane or stick, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>What was the short gentleman doing there? - Walking along, and the tall man following him; the tall man came up with a pretty good step and knocked him down: I heard the short gentleman hollow out,</p>
               <p>"Don't use me so, but</p>
               <p>"let me have satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"The tall gentleman drew his sword directly.</p>
               <p>Did you see whether there was one blow or more with the cane? - I think two or three with the cane; he fought with his sword and cane.</p>
               <p>What hand was his cane in when he fought with his sword and cane? - In his left hand, and his sword in his right.</p>
               <p>How long did they fight? - Two or three seconds, or so.</p>
               <p>Had the short gentleman drawn his sword, or spoke to him before he received the blow with the cane? - No; he was walking along and saying nothing.</p>
               <p>Did you see the short gentleman's sword drawn? - Yes, after the tall gentleman had drawn his sword.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060058"/>Cross Examination by Mr. Serjeant DAVY.</p>
               <p>Who drew his sword first? - Captain Fergusson.</p>
               <p>When the short gentleman said to him,</p>
               <p>"Don't use me so, but let me have satisfaction," then the tall gentleman immediately drew his sword? - Yes, and the short gentleman got up.</p>
               <p>But did not draw his sword after he was knocked down till the tall gentleman, Captain Fergusson, drew his sword? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had you seen the prisoner before Captain Fergusson came up to him to knock him down? - Not a minute.</p>
               <p>Had you seen him a quarter of a minute? - Yes; he was walking, and a black boy with him.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps you saw him before he turned the corner? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>How near to the corner was it that he was knocked down? - About ten yards.</p>
               <p>But he had passed the corner before you saw him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How many yards? - About three yards.</p>
               <p>Then you suppose him to have walked seven yards after you saw him before the tall gentleman came up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then the tall gentleman came behind him softly and knocked him down? - He walked up a good pace.</p>
               <p>Without making a noise? - He made no noise, he never spoke.</p>
               <p>And knocked him down without speaking one word? - He did not say a word, that I am sure of.</p>
               <p>The other fell to the ground immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Quite flat upon the ground? - Yes, quite at length.</p>
               <p>How long did Captain Roche lie upon the ground before he got up again? - Not long: as soon as he was down he cried out, and desired the other gentleman to give him satisfaction, and not take his life away.</p>
               <p>Did the other strike him after he was down? - No.</p>
               <p>The first blow knocked him down? - He hit him two or three times before he fell.</p>
               <p>Then the first blow did not knock him down? - No.</p>
               <p>Did he turn about after he had received the first blow? - No.</p>
               <p>He tried to run away? - No, he kept going on till he tumbled.</p>
               <p>After he had received the first blow he did not turn back to see who struck him? - No.</p>
               <p>He received a second or third blow before he turned round, and still kept walking on till the third blow brought him to the ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And all that time he did not lock back, nor turned his head, nor said one word? - No.</p>
               <p>So when he was down upon the ground then he desired to have satisfaction? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was that before he got up again? - As he was getting up.</p>
               <p>And he did not draw his sword till after the tall gentleman drew his? - No.</p>
               <p>And when he had drawn his sword, what happened? - They pushed at one another with their swords till I saw the tall gentleman fall.</p>
               <p>The tall gentleman did not use his cane? - Yes, sending off with the cane.</p>
               <p>But of course he was pushing with the sword all the while? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Consequently he stood, I suppose, rather inclined to the right with his sword, and was only using the cane to fence off the other's sword; he kept the sword pointed towards the small gentleman, I suppose, - Yes.</p>
               <p>So the other stood towards him too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They were all pushes; the short gentleman struck no blows upon the tall gentleman, but all was by way of pushing? - I saw him strike no blows.</p>
               <p>So then all the wounds the small gentleman could be able to give must be with the point of the sword? - Whether it was pushing or striking I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you never saw so serious a transaction in your life between two gentleman; it was an interesting thing for you to take notice of: methinks you should be able to tell us whether it was pushing at one another, or striking as if they were cudgelling with their swords? - I cannot tell which way it was.</p>
               <p>May be you was never asked the question before now? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe so; then that makes no part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060059"/> tale: you don't know whether they were beating one another with their swords, or pushing at one another? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might they be set to one another before the tall one fell? - About three seconds.</p>
               <p>It was light enough for you to see? - It was the dusk of the evening, neither light nor dark.</p>
               <p>Do you think you was twelve yards from them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could see the cane as well as the glittering sword it was so light? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could see them perfectly distinct and clearly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You could have seen them if you had been twenty yards off, I suppose? - I don't know whether I could or not.</p>
               <p>Then it was not quite dark? - No.</p>
               <p>Only a little duskish? - Yes, only a little duskish.</p>
               <p>Did any words pass except what you have mentioned,</p>
               <p>"Don't use me so, let me have</p>
               <p>"satisfaction?</p>
               <p>"were there no names called, or was there not a word after that? - No, not as I heard; I went away as soon as the tall gentleman fell.</p>
               <p>Was any body so near to them besides yourself? - There was one gentleman close by them.</p>
               <p>Can you tell that gentleman's name? - No.</p>
               <p>Suppose I help you to the name: did you ever hear it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it Mr. Grant? - I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>How came you not to stay? - Because I had other business to do.</p>
               <p>It was no affair of yours? - No.</p>
               <p>A couple of gentlemen murdering one another was no affair of yours? - No.</p>
               <p>You never saw such an affair before, I dare say? - No.</p>
               <p>Where were you going? - To see whether I could get a vessel.</p>
               <p>You was not in employ at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Where did you lie that night? - At the punch-house, the Naked Man.</p>
               <p>But as it was no affair of yours you did not say a word about it that night to any body? - I did not trouble myself about it afterwards.</p>
               <p>You was right; what is a little blood to you: you did not mention it at the punch-house, did you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>And when other folks talked of it you did not say you had seen it? - No.</p>
               <p>You say you left the Sandwich upon the 2d? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was two days before you saw what passed between these two gentlemen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The day you left her was Thursday the 2d; this happened on Saturday the 4th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near is False Bay to Table Bay? - About sixteen or eighteen miles.</p>
               <p>When did the Sandwich come to Table Bay? - The very day I left her.</p>
               <p>When did you leave the Cape? - The Tuesday afterwards.</p>
               <p>In what ship? - I came back to my own ship.</p>
               <p>When did you run away from the Sandwich quite? - I never left her; I came home in her.</p>
               <p>Who was the commander of the Sandwich? - Captain Neal.</p>
               <p>When did you leave the Sandwich to go from her quite? - I left her twice in all.</p>
               <p>When was the first time? - The 2d of September.</p>

               <p>When was the second time? - The day after I came back was the 7th or 8th; I went again on board of her, and came home in her.</p>
               <p>Mr. LUCAS. How came you on board the ship again after you left her? - The first time I came of my own accord.</p>
               <p>The second time how came you on board? - I was apprehended and brought back.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY. Did the little black boy stay to see them fight? - No; he ran away.</p>
               <p>When? - After Captain Roche was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Before he got up again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After the tall gentleman fell, what did the short gentleman do? - He went away and left him, and I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Did you leave them the moment he fell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you left the short gentleman there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was not making off when you left them? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>How long had the Sandwich been at anchor before you left her? - I left her as she was dropping her anchor.</p>

               <p>Do you know the last witness, Goodwin? - Yes; he was a foremast-man on board that ship.</p>
               <p>Do you remember that ship coming to an anchor in False Bay? - Yes.</p>
               <p>About what time was that? - To the best of my memory, the 1st or 2d of September.</p>
               <p>I believe you kept the purser's accounts? - No; I wrote the chief and the second mate's journals there: I kept Captain Neal's accounts after that.</p>
               <p>Did Goodwin leave the ship at False Bay and go on shore? - Yes; they came to an anchor in the evening: when the boat went on shore for provisions, I believe he went in it, and did not return: he came back to the ship on Monday evening the 6th, I believe; he had been absent Saturday, Sunday, and Monday evening: he asked me to request Mr. Tilly to forgive him, and he would come on board again; and he came accordingly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant DAVY to GOODWIN. When did you come to England? - I came home directly from the Cape in the Sandwich, at about six weeks after last Christmas was twelve month: I have been two voyages since that; I went first in the Barbary Brig, a merchant ship, to the coast of Guinea.</p>
               <p>How long was you in England before you went out again? - About six weeks.</p>
               <p>During that six weeks did you hear any talk about this affair? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was it before you returned to England from Guinea? - Seven or eight months: I returned from the coast of Guinea pretty near twelve months ago; I staid here five weeks, and then I went to the Bay of Honduras in the Friendship, a merchant ship.</p>
               <p>During these five weeks had you not heard any thing of the murder at the Cape of Good Hope? - Not in England: I staid eight months at the Bay of Honduras, and returned from thence about five weeks ago.</p>
               <p>When you returned to England five weeks ago, where did you go? - To my lodgings in East-Smithfield.</p>
               <p>There you have lodged ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you first mention the particulars you have told to day? - As soon as I heard of the prisoner at the bar being confined for it, which was about three weeks ago, I came up to him.</p>
               <p>Who did you hear it from? - I heard a gentleman that sat in the house read it in the news paper.</p>
               <p>Who was that gentleman? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was any body present when the gentleman read the paper to you? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You did not speak to that gentleman or any body else about it? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you at Newgate more than once? - No.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what day you saw Captain Roche in Newgate? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it within three weeks ago or more? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>That is the first time that ever you mentioned to any body what you had seen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And then you went of your own accord to see him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What part of Newgate was he in? - In a room at the top of Newgate.</p>

            : I went there in company with Gossett, Lewin, and Manwaring, between the hours of two and four in the afternoon; Gossett went into the lower room first, Lewin followed him, and I followed Lewin into the passage. Mrs. White the prisoner came out of her apartment, on the bottom floor; she caught hold of me by the coat and said, who do you want up stairs? you shall not go up, which gave me suspicion there was somebody up stairs that did not wish to be seen; they had gone up stairs before she took hold of me I got from her, and went up to the garret; the door was fast; I forced the door open, and we went in: either Gossett or Lewin called me up, and said now they are getting out of the window. I ran up directly. Baker and Radcliffe had got out of the window, and Gossett was out and had hold of Radcliffe: he said the others could go no farther. Baker said, use me well, I will surrender myself. Then Gossett pulled Radcliffe in at the window again, and Baker came into the garret. Baker turned round immediately to his sand through; he made a sort of a stand at the flask which had sand in it, and there were shillings, half-crowns, and six-pences lying upon the sand: in the flasks are put the sand, and upon the sand is put the money to make the impression. He swept part of the sand off: I stopped him from so doing, and we handcuffed them. Then they begged to put on their cloaths; for when we first saw them, one was in his shirt sleeves, and the other in a flannel waistcoat and trowsers. The money we found upon the flasks was good money; they put that upon the sand in the flasks to make the impression. Then I went to the vice-bench, and there I found a quantity of counterfeit shillings filed, and some unfiled. They are cast rough, and they afterwards file them smooth, and polish and silver them.</p>
               <p>What quantity did you find? - I did not count the base metal; there were a great number of them: the good ones amount to between 3 and 4 l. There was in the same garret a furnace: I took this crucible (producing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060064"/> it) with the metal in it red hot out of the furnace; and all the implements that are here were in that garret.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you, Ryder? - I have attended justice Wilmot's office two or three months.</p>
               <p>And have on no other employment but that of catching and convicting people? -</p>
               <p>None else.</p>
               <p>And I suppose you expect when they are convicted to have a little bit of the reward? -</p>
               <p>I suppose I shall have no more than what the law allows me.</p>
               <p>What do you expect upon the conviction, should it so happen, of these three prisoners? - I came to speak the truth, I don't come to talk about rewards.</p>
               <p>You expect to have the reward, don't you? - I came to give my evidence.</p>
               <p>Do you expect to have the reward? - If there is any allowed, without doubt.</p>
               <p>But what that sum is you don't know? - I don't know what will be allowed to me.</p>
               <p>What is to be allowed for each? - Forty pounds.</p>
               <p>And you expect to have your share? - Without doubt.</p>
               <p>Which went up first into this house? - Gossett and Lewin.</p>
               <p>The woman did not stop them? - The door was open, and they went up before I saw her.</p>
               <p>Were these flasks set or not? - One was.</p>
               <p>What else did you find in the room besides shillings? - Half-crowns and sixpences and these implements.</p>
               <p>Was there nothing else there? - There was a vast quantity of rotten stone and sand, which is not produced here.</p>
               <p>Were there any buckles? - There were three rims, one pair, and an odd one.</p>
               <p>These might, I suppose, as well be cast in these flasks as any thing else? - I am not of that branch.</p>
               <p>I suppose these are common files? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose they are made use of by every smith in the kingdom? - I am not a smith.</p>
               <p>You say you are not at all of the business, and yet you have ventured to swear that this money was ready for silvering? - They polish them up after they are rough cast before they silver them.</p>
               <p>Was the flask set with them or not? - They lay upon the sand in the flask.</p>
               <p>Was that flask set or not? you know what I mean by that term; was it set ready for melting? - No, because they must be taken out first.</p>
               <p>Then the flask was not set? - They were all laid ready to make the impression.</p>
               <p>Was all that handful you have produced laid upon the sand in the flask? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Whether these three rims of buckles you speak of were silver or base metal? - They were base metal.</p>
               <p>What day was you there to search? - On a Saturday; I believe, the 15th day of the month.</p>
               <p>The 15th is not a Saturday? - It was however upon a Saturday.</p>

The garret door was bolted: we looked through a crevice in the door, and saw the two men at the bar in the room. The door was broke open by Gossett, I believe. Baker was dressed in a flannel waistcoat and a pair of trowsers, and without his coat. Radcliffe was in his shirt tucked up to his armpits, and his collar open, without any wig or any thing upon his head. The moment they heard the door breaking open, Baker put his foot upon the trough, jumped out at the window into the gutter, and from thence he got upon the house. Radcliffe followed him, but being a more bulky man could not get out so fast as Baker did. They were brought in by

               <p>I believe you know nothing of finding these instruments? - No.</p>
               <p>Describe the use of the several things produced? - These flasks are made use of to cast, the sand is put into it: here is what they call a get, a leader that makes a channel in the sand, through which the metal runs to the impressions; here is a mixture of silver and metal, copper, I suppose, and some filings; here is scouring paper that is used in coining; and here are a great many crucibles: these three half crowns are counterfeits; in a good half crown you will find the letters upon the edge, on the counterfeit you will find none in general.</p>
               <p>Are these counterfeits or not? (shewing the witness some of the shillings that were found in the trough) - I look upon these to be good ones, and I apprehend they were used for patterns.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You are very conversant with this sort of business: I understand that flask may be used for the purpose of casting any thing that may be enclosed in a flask? - Any small things.</p>
               <p>Crucibles are used in melting metals? -</p>
               <p>Yes.</p>
               <p>And files are used for many things? -</p>
               <p>These files are not used, I believe, in buckle-making,</p>
               <p>Nor no other business? - Other business they may; whoever has used these has filed counterfeit silver.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose there are none of these instruments now produced, but what may be used in some other business? - They may be used in small work of silver or gold, or any thing of that kind.</p>
               <p>Do you look upon these half crowns to be completely counterfeit, or is there any thing remaining to be done upon them in order to pass them off? - No: when I saw them they were finished ready to utter, lying by turns them of that colour.</p>
               <p>In the state they are at present, they don't appear to me to be likely to impose upon any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060066"/> body? - That is by lying by for some time; in a course of circulation they keep a better colour; in order to put a proper colour on them, they use aqua fortis and water, which purges the silver, and brings it to the outside. These are so bad at present nobody would take them; therefore it will be necessary to throw them into aqua fortis first, or rub them they will come to their proper colour directly.</p>
               <p>Were they of a better colour when you first saw them? - Yes; they would have passed then.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ryder. What quantity of counterfeit half crowns were there? - I did not count them.</p>
               <p>You have produced nothing now but what you found in the garret? - I have produced nothing but what I found in the garret; but I have not produced all I found in the garret.</p>

               <p>These things were brought to me the day before by three men, from one Mr. Welbank: they told me Welbank sent his compliments to me, and begged I would melt down some things they had got there; that they had found them a week or a fortnight ago. I told them I was very busy and could not do any thing for them then; there was a bag full of pieces of money. I did not know neither of those three men, but I know Welbank very well; Welbank told me on the 3d of October, that he should be in town soon, and would bring them to me; but as he did not come to town, he gave these men a direction and they brought them to me. I said I was very busy cleaning some buckles, but if they would leave them with me, I would melt them down and sell them to a refiner for them: the next morning when I came to my shop, I swept my board down and sorted them out: I shaked them in some saw dust, they were very dirty and nasty; I looked them over and found some good amongst them; then I weighed them off in different parcels, as much as my scales would hold, and put a pot full into the skillet upon the fire, and as I was doing them these men came in: I had been three or four hours sorting the good from the bad: I did not know there was one good one among them when I turned them out of the bag; they were to call again upon the Saturday afternoon; me and my men were at work about them when they came in.</p>

I said to Mr. Welbank, I think it will be very proper for us to keep this a while, to see whether it will be advertized, and if he had a mind I would take it home with me: I said tie the bag with a string, and then get a bit of wax and clap your own seal upon the knot: it was done; he said I shall be in town such a time, and if I am not, carry it to Baker, he is an honest man, and will give the worth of it: Welbank not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060067"/> coming, I went to Benfield (he keeps a cook's shop) Clarke was with him, I said I thought it would be proper to carry this bag to Welbank's acquaintance, and see if it was worth any thing: we three carried it there, and there I left it; Mr. Baker said come up into the shop, and I will see what it is; he looked at it, and said there is no other way that I can see for you to know the value of it, but by melting it down and making an assay of it, then I can be a judge of it: some were sticking together and some loose, some little and some big.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I think it was a Friday; I carried it about the 12th or 13th of October, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When was this first meeting with your friend Mr. Welbank? - I had not seen him before that day for I suppose a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - Number 1, Lane's Court, Cold-Bath-Fields.</p>
               <p>Have you been a long while acquainted with Mr. Welbank? - I have known him some years.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I deal in pens and quills; I was going to Mansfield-street for some quills.</p>
               <p>You was bail, I believe, some day last week, in the court of King's Bench? - I don't know whether I was or not; I might.</p>
               <p>You know whether you was or not? - I was.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Welbank? - Six or seven years.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He goes about the country with hard wares; he is a Somersetshire man.</p>
               <p>Has Welbank been much in town at the end of the year? - I cannot say, I met him promiscuously then.</p>
               <p>Welbank hit something with his foot, that was about the end of September? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was it opened? - Directly.</p>
               <p>What quantity of shillings and half crowns did you find? - A good many.</p>
               <p>Were there ten? - More than that.</p>
               <p>Were there seventy? - We did not count them.</p>
               <p>Were there as many as ninety? - I cannot tell; I did not number them.</p>
               <p>Have you seen Welbank at any time since he picked these up? - No; I have not.</p>
               <p>How came you to stay so long before you carried them to Baker? - To see if they would be advertised.</p>
               <p>You did not know Baker before? - I never saw him before, he was a stranger to me; I carried them there by Welbank's directions.</p>
               <p>Do not you think it would have been better to have carried them to that old friend of yours the Solicitor of the Mint? - My old friend! I don't know him.</p>
               <p>You have had some connections with him? - I am but a little judge of money; I tell you the pieces as near as I can, chapter and verse.</p>
               <p>Look upon that, and tell me whether you think that money coined at the Tower? here are, you see, five pieces joined together as cast. - I look upon it to be bad; but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Are you of opinion that it is good money? - No; but there was some silver in it, but not all.</p>
               <p>You looked at that before? - It was by candle light.</p>
               <p>And did not you look at it from the time you picked it up till the time you carried it to Mr. Baker? - We looked at it the very night we picked it up; and then it was tied up with a piece of string, a bit of wax put upon it, and Welbank's seal sealed it; no body saw it as we sealed it up.</p>
               <p>Do you know what is become of Welbank? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you attend here last sessions, when this trial was put off? - I was here, but not called in court.</p>
               <p>Counsel. No; because there was an affidavit made that Welbank was a material witness, and he was out of the way.</p>
               <p>Court. I thought you said, that when you looked at the things found in the bag, that you took it to be money? - We did look upon it to be money, and monies worth.</p>
               <p>Court. But did you look upon it to be all current money? - Yes, we did by candle light.</p>
               <p>But did you look upon these five or six pieces that were together to be current money? - We could not tell, what could we see by candle light.</p>
               <p>Did not this six-pence in the middle of these half-crowns strike you a little? - I am not a judge; if I had, it might have struck me.</p>

            . I am one of the patrol. As I was patroling Hatton-street between eleven and twelve at night, of the 4th of this month, I saw somebody fastening the window of Mr. Willermine's house, I saw the hand of the person that fastened it. Going my rounds between one and two, or near two in the morning, I looked down the prosecutor's area, and observed the sash of the kitchen window pushed up; the inside shutter was open, and I saw a man's legs on the outside of the window, the rest of his body being within the house: I made an alarm with my rattle, and two or three watchmen came, who guarded the area till the prisoner was taken: when I gave the alarm with my rattle, the man whose legs I had seen on the outside of the window, sprung from the window like a dart, and concealed himself in the area under the steps of the house till he was taken: the prisoner is the man that was taken in the area, he had then boots on, and spurs in his pocket, but there were no implements for house-breaking found about him, nor any weapons.</p>

            . I am a watchman: I heard an alarm of thieves; when I came up Sanders told me there were thieves in the area, upon that we called up the people: we were let into the house by Godfrey; we went through the house into the area, and there took the prisoner under the steps that lead into the house: there were no implements for housebreaking or weapons found upon him.</p>
               <p>GODFREY. There was nothing at all lost; the man was detected as he was getting into the house.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Sanders the patrol told the justice a different story at the time I was carried before him; for then he only said he saw the shadow of a man in the area; and did not say any thing of seeing the legs on the outside, or body of a man being below: Godfrey said before the justice that the bar was bent, and did not say any thing of the shutters being forced open. The reason of my being down the area was, I was going by at that time of the night, when some men came by and knocked my hat off into the area: I was a little in liquor; I went down into the area in order to recover my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Godfrey. Did you give a different account before the justice, to what you have given now? - I believe the bar was forced open by the force of a push, it was forced out about seven inches, and lodged by a bit of moulding; and the window shutters were open about a foot; the bar being bent, the shutters were forced as far as the bar would admit of; but the bar was not above a foot and half high from the bottom of the window. I did not give any different account before the justice.</p>
               <p>SANDERS. I did not give a different account before the justice. I not only saw the shadow of a man, but I saw the man himself.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether the legs you saw had boots on or not? - I did not.</p>

My box was just come out of the country; in my absence he took out of it two pair of corderoy breeches, a pair of leather breeches, a coat, four waistcoats, a great coat, three shirts, marked C. T. and a pair of buttons. About four in the afternoon I returned with the coach, and found the stable door about half open, my box opened, and every thing took out but one shirt and two pair of stockings.

About 10 o'clock in the evening, when I came home, I saw a sack in my room; I asked my man what it was? he said a man left it until called for; my curiosity led me to open it, when I found a great many things in it. Soon after the prisoner came into the tap-room, where the sack was, and said he wanted the sack he had left there a little time before, I asked him if the things contained in it were his own? he said they were his own cloaths, and if I would let him try them on, every one in the sack would fit him. I told him I would stop him till he had taken an oath before a magistrate that they were his, which he said he would do. We went to justice Whiteworth, who would not permit him to take the oath, but ordered him to go and bring some voucher to his character. He went away, and I sent a man to watch him; he went into the Black Horse in the Borough: among the things in the sack I found a letter directed to

               <p>I am a gunsmith, and live in the Fleet-Market, on the 19th of October, about ten or eleven in the morning, the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy some pistols, I asked where they were? - He took me to the sign of the George, near Holborn Bars; there came in a woman, the prisoner said if I would go along with her she would shew them to me. She took me up a court about fifty yards from the George, and there is a room up one pair of stairs, she shewed me the pistols. She desired I would take them away, for that if her husband came home and saw them, he would kick her out of doors. I went back to the prisoner, who was still at the George; he asked what I would give for them? I said they were worth a good deal of money, and I would give him twelve guineas for them; he asked if I would take them with me? I told him I would come next morning and settle with him. I knew the pistols belonged to Mr. Grice, having had dealings with him: I went to Mr. Grice and told him what had happened, and appointed to meet him at eleven o'clock at my house: about nine o'clock Smith came again, and asked if I would have the pistols? I told him I would: he said they were then at a house in Drury-lane, I went with him to a public house, and desired him to stay there about an hour; I then went to Sir John Fielding's office, and some of his people came with me and apprehended the prisoner.</p>

            . On the 6th of November, about seven at night, as I was coming from my work, just as I passed the Flower-Pot, alehouse, I saw two men carrying a trunk upon their shoulders from the cart then standing at the door; they crossed the street into a court, and I followed them; the prisoner then lifted it up on the other man's head; I thought it was not their property, so shook the man who carried it on his head by the shoulder: Miller walked as close as he could to the man, who threw it down from the right side of his head, with an intent, as I thought, to let it fall on me. I then cried out stop thief; the other man ran away, and a butcher pursued him. Miller turned back and walked behind the cart; I took him, but the other man is not yet taken.</p>
               <p>Did Miller make any resistance? - No; he said he was not guilty. I brought the prisoner in my hand, and a hackney coachman brought the box into the alehouse: I did not know what was in the box till next morning, when we went before alderman Wilkes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner had one end of the box on his shoulder? - Yes, I am sure he had.</p>

Certainly, if I had been the man who had taken it, I should have ran away. I <rs id="t17751206-37-deflabel157" type="occupation">sell apples and pears about the streets</rs>

            . On the 8th of November, at half after ten at night, I saw the prisoners Jones and Kitcherman go along Turnmill-street, with five bars of iron in their hands; they went to the prisoner Mealing's house: when they came to the house, I heard a talking at the window of something about a penny a pound, and heard some noise as if they were weighing iron: I called to Spencer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060074"/> the watchman; we went into Mealing's house together, and asked if any young men had been there with iron bars; Mealing said no: before that we saw the young men in the shop, and four bars of iron lying upon the ground, and one in the scale: Kitcherman said they came there to weigh the bars: the next day we took the bars to the parish workhouse, and upon trial found they fitted the area of the windows, from whence some bars had been stolen.</p>

               <p>A young fellow I was with went upon a dunghill, and trod upon something that jingled, which appeared to be iron bars under the dung: he called me directly, and said, Tom, I have found some iron bars; he gave them to me to sell in Turnmill-street.

               <p>Was it wet or dry? - Quite wet: then we went to the Ship at Stepney, where we breakfasted; we staid there two or three hours, after which we went to an alehouse in Stepney Church-yard, and staid there till pretty near dark: then Grant said he knew a person that would buy it, one Wagstaffe, in Angel-alley, Bishopsgate-street; he said he was a man that got his living by buying stolen silk: I asked Grant to go down to Wagstaffe and ask him if he would buy it; he said he did not like to go because the thief takers knew him, and if they saw him they would stop him: then I agreed to go, and they said they would go to the Black Dog, Mile-end Turnpike, and wait there while I went to Wagstaffe; we all came together to the Black Dog; it was dark when we came there: I bid them go in and wait till I came to them: I went to Whitechapel, and down Petticoat-lane, there I met Lamb Smith; I asked him where he had been, he said he had been to his sisters; I asked him to go with me to Angel-alley: when we came there, I desired Smith to go into the alehouse and ask for one Wagstaffe: Smith went in and enquired; Wagstaffe came out of the alehouse to me; I called him aside: I told him I came from Grant, who wanted to know whether he would buy this silk: Grant said he had sold him things several times; he said he had not money enough about him then to go with me, but any place I would appoint in two hours he would come to me; I appointed the Black Dog at Mile-end turnpike: then I called to Smith, who was about thirty yards off, and asked him to come along; he came with me to the corner of Bishopsgate-street: I then asked him to go with me to Whitechapel: as we were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060076"/> going along in Whitechapel, I asked him to go to the Rose and Crown, next door to the White Raven in Whitechapel road, and wait about an hour till I came to him: I told him before I left him, that a gentlewoman was to come there to ask for me, and if she came before me to keep her there till I came: I then left Smith; he crossed the way to the Rose and Crown, and I went to the Black Dog, and told Bean, Grant, and

             I had seen Wagstaffe, and he would come in about two hours: in about an hour and a half, as nigh as I can guess, he came: Grant seeing him, went out to speak to him; after which Grant called us out, and bid me and Wagstaffe take a coach: there was a coach standing over the way: Wagstaffe and I went into the coach, and bid him drive us to the White Horse down the road: between the turnpike and White Horse Grant came up to the side of the coach, and said he would have us get out; I asked him the reason why, he said he believed Wagstaffe had beset us, in order for the thieftakers to take us: I said I did not believe any such thing; the coachman drove on to the corner of the White Horse that leads up to Stepney Church: I asked the coachman to drive up the lane that led up to the church, but he refused; he said he did not like to go out of the road; we paid him a shilling: Wagstaffe and I got out; then we met with Bean, Davis, and Grant, and we all five went along the fields to go to the summer house: Grant and Bean got over a fence to go a back way to the summer house, they got within twenty yards of the garden; then they came over the fence again, and said they had been robb'd: we went the same way we had been in the morning; when we came to the place there stood a coach; says Grant, I wonder what this coach is standing here for, I am sure it is for no good: they made a stop, and said they would not go for the silk at all: going by a public house I said let us go in and drink; we went in to drink, and there set Smith: after we had drank about a pot of beer, Bean said we will go up and see if the coach is there still, which we agreed to; they went: Wagstaffe staid about a quarter of an hour, and then went away, and left Smith, Davis, and me in the box together: we had not sat there half an hour before justice Wilmot's men came and took us three.</p>
               <p>Lamb Smith was not at the house when the house was broke open, and the silk taken away? - No: I did not see him till the next day, when I met him in Petticoat-lane.</p>

               <p>Was it Smith that told you this? - It was Lamb Smith that told me: I left him and went into the public house again, and told the landlord what had happened: he advised me to make an information before a justice, and he went with me to Mr. Wilmot's office; where I laid an information against Lamb Smith: I did not know any others that were concerned at that time. Mr. Wilmot's men and I went to the Black Dog, at the corner of the Dog-row, Whitechapel; when I went into the house, Lamb Smith came to me and asked me what money I had brought with me? I told him I had not above four or five guineas; he said I might leave the money with them and take the silk, and they would call for the rest in the morning; that the silk was in a summer house, and they must have a coach to fetch it away; I told them I would go and get a coach: justice Wilmot's men were round the house; I let them know the silk was in a summer house at Stepney, and bid them follow the coach to find it out: Fryer and I got into the coach and the rest walked. Just before we came to the White Horse, Lamb Smith came up and said,</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I attend justice Wilmot's office. On Saturday night, the 11th of November, I went in company with Ryder and Wagstaffe to a place they call the World's-end, at Stepney; there I saw Ryder take a quantity of silk out of a summer house; we brought it away.</p>
               <p>Do you know Fryer? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him you would give him two or three guineas to swear Smith was in this robbery? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never say what Wagstaffe was to have? - No.</p>

               <p>DAVIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Somebody persuaded Fryer to swear against me to get the blood money of me, as they call it.</p>
               <p>SMITH's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did no more than what Fryer asked me to do: I went with him to Angel-alley, he called this man out, I did not know what he said to him: there was a dyer's coat left at my mother's all over dye; I having that coat, which was proved to belong to Fryer, Ryder and Lewin swore it was my coat, and committed me to prison.</p>
               <p>LEWIN. I never was in his house.</p>
               <p>RYDER. Manwaring and I were at his house; we took up a dyer's coat, and his wife said it was his, I did not swear it was his.</p>
               <p>Davis called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wagstaffe. When you went towards the summer house, was Smith in company with you? - Yes; we went to a public house to drink.</p>

               <p>"that was all;" I said yes, I had been shooting in the country, and could not be supposed to have much money: then he demanded my watch, and bid me make haste: I told him I had no watch, he replied, "you have;" I told him I had not, and if he would not be satisfied, he must come in and search; he then said,</p>

               <p>"a watch, I will blow your brains out," and cocked his pistol; upon this Mr. Cummings said, don't be violent, take away your pistol, here is my money, and gave him his purse; I believe, before that, the prisoner did not see Mr. Cummings, as I sat pretty forward in the chaise, wrapped up in my great coat: he then said,</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on Wednesday about two o'clock in the afternoon, at the Green Man and Bush, on Epping Forrest, adjoining to lord Tylney's park; M'Mahone was in company with him, he is discharged; I don't know his christian name; I never saw him before that day, to the best of my knowledge: M'Mahone was on a black horse, and the prisoner on a grey poney.</p>
               <p>Did you see the prisoner come into town on the Monday evening? - I saw him at the sign of the Union Arms, Piccadilly, about half after ten, or near eleven o'clock; I cannot speak to half an hour; there was a horse standing at the door, and a mob of people about it; I turned to see what was the matter, and the prisoner came out of the house; I took hold of his hand, and said, how do you do, Captain? he went to the corner of the house and made water, and then he said, "D - n my eyes, I</p>

He told me that he was a coachman out of place: that it was his first offence, and begged me to let him go: I said the coat was not my property, and sent for Mr. Henderson, who came in about ten minutes after: he sent for a constable and took him before a justice.</p>

Next morning I met a woman who asked me if I had got my money: I did not know the woman; she took me to the same house where I had been, and shewed me the prisoner at the bar, and said she saw him cut my pocket. I then went out and got a constable, who took him to the round-house; and on searching the prisoner found ten shillings in silver in his pocket: the constable then took him to justice Welsh, who sent for the woman, but she could not be found; the man of the public house said he would be answerable for her appearance.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of October I went into the Nag's Head, in Dean-street, for a pint of beer, and this man (meaning the prosecutor) was asleep on the top of the tables: the prisoner sat down by him, and I saw him cut his pocket; as soon as he had done it he went out.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you before he cut his pocket? - No; I was only in for a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Who was in the room besides? - A whole room full of people.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the company what was done? - Yes, and some of them ran out, but could not catch him.</p>
               <p>You did not awake the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No, never in my life. I was taken up on suspicion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060087"/> for the same affair, and carried before the justice, who admitted me as evidence against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am hostler at the Fighting Cocks, Portsmouth. The prisoners came to our house, about twelve o'clock, I don't remember the day, they lay at our house that night, and the next day went over to Gosport, where they were taken; after that the people came over to see the horses: the prisoners came with another gentleman on foot and led their horses, the tall man's horse was a dark brown with a star in his forehead, and one of the other two was on an iron grey: Mrs. Davidson came over to look at the horses; the prisoners were then in Gosport gaol; the horses she came to look at were brought to our house by the prisoners.</p>

               <p>When we were taken up, I asked if there was any body else in the coach where the lady was robbed? they said yes; three persons came and swore that we were not the men; a man that rode behind the coach came and swore we were not the men; the justice said we might be discharged, but the town clerk said we should be committed for further examination: the keeper of Bridewell went over with the prosecutrix to Portsmouth; and when he came back, he said she had swore to the horses, and must swear to us; and then the justice ordered us to be detained.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. What became of the prisoners while you went to look at the horses? - They were in Bridewell; when I returned to the justice's the prisoners were not at the justice's; they were never discharged.</p>

               <p>Do you remember hearing Mrs. Davidson say any thing of her being robbed? - Yes; about the 14th of May, I believe it was, she said that near Turnham Green some highwaymen, stopped the coach and robbed her of her money; that when they were robbing her, the child slipped out of her lap, and endeavouring to recover it, she laid hold of the man's hand that was robbing the coach, that it was very soft, and that he had a pistol in his hand; but as to any remarks, it was not light enough, and she was too frightened to make any.</p>
               <p>On his Cross Examination he said, He never saw the prisoners till the Friday night before, when he came to town; that he received a subpoena from one Conner, and a letter to take to the prisoners in Newgate.</p>

               <p>I am hostler at the Fighting Cocks at Portsmouth: there were three horses put up at our house, one a spotted mare, an iron grey, and a brown horse, with a star in his forehead; the horses were brought to us by the boatman.</p>

               <p>I was in the yard when my husband let the horses; he is sick, and cannot attend: we bought the brown horse on the 24th of May of one Mr. Hardwicke.</p>
               <p>Did he let out horses? - No; he had had it long before; my husband broke it when it was a poney.</p>
               <p>Whether it was let out to any body on the 12th of May? - No; it stood at livery at our stables; it was never let out while it was his: the spotted mare we bought of one Mr. Bishop in July; I know nothing of the grey horse.</p>
               <p>When did you let the grey horse? - The sixth of October, for a week or eight days; it was to go to Wey-hill Fair.</p>

I said I did not think I was hard done by; they insisted upon it I should fight, and provided me arms, and put on me a coat with Death or Liberty upon one side of it: as we were on a march I made my escape from them to a place called Norfolk, in Virginia; when I had settled there they insisted upon it I should fight: I made my escape from thence to a sea port town and took shipping and came to London: I had leave to come on shore, and as I was going to return from Darkhouse-lane I was taken.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of October, about half after eleven o'clock, as I was coming along the Old Bailey, at the top of Fleet-lane, Stevens and Davis spoke to me, I cannot tell what they said, I shoved them from me: I went down the lane to the Elephant and Castle to speak to a young man; Stevens and Davis came into the house; I called for a glass of gin: Stevens and Davis immediately said that they wanted a glass of gin, and Stevens blasted my eyes if she would not have a glass at my expence; I called for a glass; I condescended to pay for the three glasses; they went out before me: I came down the street slowly, and Stevens put her hand upon my collar and pulled me upon a door cell; the door was shut and a candle immediately produced at the stairs, and I was told that was the way: I condescended to go up stairs; I then said I would have nothing to do with them, and desired them to let me go; Stevens said she would be d - d if I should go out of the room without I gave her a shilling; I condescended to give her a shilling; some shrub was produced, and they wanted me to drink, I would not; they then said I should have connexion with them if I would not drink; I said I was a man that had a family, and desired to go about my business; Stevens said I should not go without I would give her another shilling; I went to the door, and Stevens put her hand immediately to my throat, and said,</p>
               <p>"blast your bloody eyes, if</p>
               <p>"you make a noise or stir, I will cut your</p>
               <p>"bloody soul out;" Davis then took me by the head and held it back, and said to Stevens,</p>
               <p>"D - n your eyes, go it then:" I saw Stevens pull my purse out of my pocket with the money in it; I laid hold of her wrist, and said</p>
               <p>"you have got my purse;" she blasted my bloody eyes, and said, "what purse?" I said, my purse, and I should be ruined; one of them called Jem! Jem! and the prisoner, Ingleston, came up, and the candle was put out; I saw the purse in Stevens' hand; I insisted upon having my purse again, and she pretended to faint upon the bed, and called for some water; I said that would not do for me, I had lost my property, and should be ruined: I got to the stairs, and then the candle was blown out again, and I received a blow upon my head, I thought with more than a fist; I got to the door and called the watch, and gave charge of the prisoners: I never found any of my money again.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor asked us if we would drink any thing; we went and called for a quartern of gin; he changed half a crown and paid for it; we wished him a good night, and went away; he came after us and came up stairs, and asked what we would drink; I said I did not want any thing, and then he sent me for a quartern of shrub; then he wanted to be free with Stevens; she resisted him, and went in sits on the bed; and when he found he could not get his ends of her, he said we had taken his money.</p>

               <p>I happened to be in the house at the same time; I went to see one Mr. Hill, who was bad in the house: I heard a noise in the house; he desired me to go and see what was the matter; I came to the door and saw them coming out of the room, and lighted them down stairs, and the wind blew the candle out.</p>

               <p>In your judgment was it a child at its full time? - Yes, a male child; it had a coloured linen handkerchief tied round its neck very tight: I put my finger between and found it so tight that it seemed to be choaked; it was swelled about the throat and mouth with a bluish cast, and the tongue was forced a little out of the mouth by the tightness of the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>According to your judgment did that appear to be the cause of the child's death? - Yes, it did.</p>
               <p>Was there no defect about the child besides? - It seemed besides to have a little bruise about the throat.</p>
               <p>But was there any defect in the child besides? - No.</p>
               <p>Is it your opinion or not, that this child was born alive and destroyed by this handkerchief being tied so tight about its neck? - It is my opinion that it was born alive, and that the tying this handkerchief about its neck was the cause of its death:
