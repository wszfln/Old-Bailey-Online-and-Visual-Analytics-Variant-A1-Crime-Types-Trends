About five or six weeks ago the prisoner Francis came to my works at Birmingham, and said he was the son of Mr. Cavender.

Cavender &amp; Son, Birmingham and Sheffield Warehousemen, Importers and Exporters of every description of Merchandise, and requesting to know if Mr. Overson intended to execute the order.</hi>) I wrote a reply to that letter, and on Saturday, the 9th instant, I forwarded a crate of goods to Cavender &amp; Son, Cannon Place, Whitechapel Road, the address Francis gave me; three days after I received the letter produced (marked B). (<hi rend="italic">This was from Cavender &amp; Son, and acknowledged the receipt of the crate, and requested the remainder to be sent as quickly as possible.</hi>) On that day I sent another crate of goods, and on the next day I forwarded two more crates of goods, all to the same address. On the 13th I received the letter C; and on the 18th instant I received the letter D. (<hi rend="italic">These requited duplicate invoices to be sent, and stated that a cheque for the amount should be forwarded on Tuesday next.</hi>) I also received a telegram (marked E). <hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> 'Both Mr. Cavenders are out of town; will telegraph them, and very likely send some to-morrow.'

I live at 23, Addle Street, City, and am a commis<lb/>sion agent—I was at Cavender &amp; Son's place one day, about a month or six weeks ago, talking to Solomons about some orders that had been given through me to manufacturers, and he said "Have you got any memo<lb/>randum papers?"—I said "No, I have not"—he turned to Francis, and said in a quiet manner, "It would be quite as well if he had some"—I received some memorandum papers in the course of the afternoon—some of them are in Court—three of them appear to be in Solomon's writing—(<hi rend="italic">These were dated March</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th and</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th, and April</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th, to Mr. D.

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of Littlehampton—I was em<lb/>ployed by the assignees under the bankruptcy—I went to the Norfolk Hotel, kept by Mr. Stedmun, and took possession of some goods, of which I have an inventory—there were two builder's trucks, four ladders, two empty cement casks, a galvanized pail, and a hogshead—they are still in my possession—they are worth from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some time afterwards I went to Mr. Grudg<lb/>field's and took possession of a thirty-six gallon copper, a cask containing twenty-eight gallons of tar, a wash tub, two sash doors, a deal frame for a door, and other articles, value about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I think the loft was unlocked—it was 4ft. 4 in. long, 10 or 14ft wide, and 12 or 14ft high—it had no ceiling—I think one of the cans was marked "Mander"—there was a label on it directed to Mr. Bransbury—one of those was shown to Mr. Stark—I went to the Beehive and found a mould for running lead casements, a box of books and papers, which Mr. Hardwick took possession of, a keg of Turkey umber, and some boards, and other small articles, worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but the box and the books I put no value upon—I afterwards went to a field with Mr. Hardwick, who took possession of a ladder of about forty rounds, value about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was about 200 yards from the premises in Surrey Street, lying under a wall in a field—the bankrupt had a horse, two carts, and two sets of harness before the bankruptcy, which I saw in his possession three or four weeks afterwards—I saw them when I was taking the inventory for the sale, under the bankruptcy, and he told me they did not belong to him—he had them I should think a year before the bankruptcy—I prepared the inventory of sale—the first sale was the 25th August, 1869—that was a sale of stock given up by the bankrupt—52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the gross amount of the sale—I don't think that included any of the property at the Norfolk or the Bee-hive, or in the field.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi>) I took possession in the second week in February of a wooden box, which was secreted in the cellar of the Beehive—a policeman came to my house—I had the box taken to my office and sealed up, and on the following day I opened it and found a quantity of books and two new ledgers containing accounts, and amongst them a number apparently unsettled, I think to the amount of about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are debts as to which liability was incurred—one is an account of Joseph Duffield, February 20th, 1869, and there are some previous to that—they continue down to 19th July—there is one of Mr. Wright, another of Mr. Staples, Mr. Cook, Mr. Snewing, and Mr. Charles Saunders—among the papers I found an estimate book—I could not state whether all the books are in the defendant's writing—here is one entry at the end for some work done at the police station—that is in his writing and signed by him—it is the estimate of work made for Captain Montgomery, and is signed "George Bransbury"—there is no date—the amount is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I also find Captain Montgomery men<lb/>tioned in the ledger account—it is not marked off as paid—it is one of the open accounts, but Captain Montgomery has paid it to the estate since the bankruptcy—here is an account which appears to be made out against Mr. Cook in the first part of the ledger; it begins December, 1868, and ends January, 1869, and the same account, with a trifling alteration, appears in July, 1869—it is almost identically copied but on a different date—the date has been altered in many places in the books, and some dates are altered by erasures—here is one account against Mr. Harmsbury, it is dated in July and the date has been scratched out and the 30th put in on an erasure, sub<lb/>sequent to the date of the bankruptcy—there are fifty-two accounts alto<lb/>gether subsequent to the date of the bankruptcy—there has been no information by the bankrupt with reference to those fifty-two accounts, they amount to 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I believe, originally, when the totals were taken out as they first stood, the debts entered in this ledger represented 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but when they came to analyze them, and the collector came to collect them, there was a set-off which reduced them to 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no informa<lb/>tion in the books about any of the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original estimate which I got from Captain Montgomery—it is a copy of the one in the estimate book—it is dated 12th June, 1869—his son claimed the amount, and brought an action in the County Court, and the Judge decided in the defendant's favour—I find no trace of any of those accounts in the bank<lb/>rupt's books—I found a number of invoices in the box, as if made out for delivery from the ledger, as due to George Bransbury.</p>

               <p>when he was on his knees, with his fist—the prisoner got up, and went across the road, to get out of his way, and my husband followed him, and hit him again; that was the third time—and on that I saw the prisoner strike my husband—he said he was stabbed, and went into the public-house—I don't know what became of the prisoner—I afterwards went into the public-house and saw my husband; he said he had been stabbed, and put his hand up to his chest—I did not see any blood—he was laid down, and afterwards taken off to the doctor's—shortly afterwards I saw him dead.</p>

I am a wood-chopper, and live at 3, York Road—about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of 12th March, I was with the prisoner—I came out of the yard with him—I work with him in Wharf Road—I went with him to his mother's house a little after 9 o'clock—I was with him from 4 till 9 o'clock—we had been drinking—there was a quarrel between him and his sister—I saw the prisoner go to the cupboard—I can't tell what he did there—after that we went out together to go to a public-house—we in<lb/>stended to go to the <hi rend="italic">lead</hi>—on our way we saw Joseph Rutter and his brother, and to avoid them we went into a shop—when we came out we saw them again in a fish shop, we went past them and missed them as they were going down Hoxton—we afterwards saw them in front of the bar of the Ship public-house, in Bacon Street—as soon as we got to the public-house, we stopped sudden, outside, we did not like to go in—Rutter came out and struck the prisoner a violent blow, he staggered across the road and Rutter struck him again, followed him up, he fell down, the second blow sent him down—when he was on the ground he said "Hold hard, Jim, let me have one word, hear reason"—Rutter replied "Get up and fight!"—the prisoner replied "No, Jim, you are too good a man for me"—he then got up and ran across the road—Rutter ran after him and hit him another blow, and knocked his head up against the wall—on that I saw the prisoner retaliate the blow, I mean, he struck him, I can't tell with what, I did not see any<lb/>thing—Rutter put his hand to his chest and said "I've been stabbed," and he staggered into the public-house—he remained there a short time and came out again and fell—the prisoner was standing in the middle of the road—he came up to me and got his cap and said "I must go, I think I have killed my brother-in-law," and he went away, walking rather sharp—before we met Rutter, the prisoner said "I wish I had a white-handled knife that is at home, I would stab him; I have frightened him before with a poker."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Rutter was a much stronger man than the prisoner, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and taller—when we first saw Rutter, the prisoner suggested we should get out of his way—the third blow Rutter struck knocked the prisoner's head against the wall, he could not get any further back—he struck him in the face with his clenched fist—it was immediately after that, that the prisoner struck him.</p>

I bought these of a man at the Tower Stairs, and have been using them ever since. The man come to me and said he had lost a pair of sculls, and he would have a pair, right or wrong, and he made a boast that he could get half a dozen people to say they were his. I told him they did not belong to him, and never did, and I told the policeman just the same. The maker only goes by the green paint, and nineteen boats out of twenty are painted green; it is a common colour. My boat is exactly the same colour as that green. There was no name on them when I had them. I painted these sculls with varnish to keep the water out, and they don't get so heavy. I did not conceal them at all, they were in my boat. I bad plenty of opportunity to make away with them, if they had been stolen—I worked with them all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, the last witness, and assisted him—on 10th December, 1866, I had a conversation with Mr. Pappa in relation to some of these shares—I made a memorandum of that conversation on 11th December, 1866—this is the original memorandum, signed by me at the time—I believe it correctly represents the conversation that occurred—this is the part that refers to the 20,000 shares (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I made some inquiries as to the allotment of shares to the Oriental and Com<lb/>mercial Bank Shareholders upon the formation of that company, by the amal<lb/>gamation of the Oriental Commercial Company, and the National Financial, and as to why sundry shares were placed in Mr. D. Kusthatiade's name, he having paid nothing for them; he, that is Pappa, informed me, that on the amalgamation 20,000 shares were set apart for the Oriental Commercial Shareholders by the Oriental Commercial Bank; but that some of those shares not being applied for he obtained the verbal consent of D. Eusthatiade to place the balance of shares in his name till an opportunity offered of disposing of them to genuine shareholders. He said the directors were aware that some of the shares were not applied for, and that they had been placed in a nominee's name, but did not think they knew in whose name they were placed. I had been previously given to understand that the shares in Eusthatiade's name belonged to the bank")—That was the memorandum I made at the time—(<hi rend="italic">At the request of</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">the re<lb/>mainder of the memorandum was subsequently read as follows:</hi> "Mr. Pappa then referred to the books and asked if there was not some little cause of un<lb/>easiness, and expressed his willingness and anxiety to give me any information as to anything which might not appear quite regular. He specially alluded to the commission taken by the Daily Finance Committee, which he said was not regular, and that he had protested when it was taken, stating the profits were not made, but that he was told he was only a manager, and to 'mind his own business' and attend to his directors' instructions. He wished me to bear in mind that he had previously mentioned this subject He also said he believed some of the committee knew they would have to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020043"/>
               <p>refund. He then said if there was anything in any of the accounts, or in his own account, which he was sure was quite straightforward, that wanted explanation, he should be most happy to give it. I told him we were looking into several matters, and if we found anything we did not think proper, we should certainly require an explanation from whomever it was, and give an opportunity for such explanation, which, if not satisfactory, the matter would then be taken up by the solicitors. He wished particularly to be in<lb/>formed if we had any reason to complain of his not giving information, and I informed him I had always found him willing to do so. He said be thought there was some little feeling against him, that he was sometimes hasty in his expressions, and feared he might have given Mr. Johnson offence at some time by remarks about the Chancery proceedings, but expressed himself anxious to give every facility to any enquiry by giving all the in<lb/>formation he could.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the solicitors for the prosecution—I produce a statement which I took down while Mr. Pappa was speaking—it was taken in a hurry, and the original is very difficult to read now—I have bad it fair copied and can say it is correct—in the month of December, 1866, I was requested by Messrs. Upton and Johnson, the solicitors of liquidation, to peruse certain papers which they handed to me, and I then suggested that Mr. Pappa should be called upon to give explanation upon the matters contained in those papers—I first saw Mr. Pappa at the office of the liqui<lb/>dator, on the 14th January, 1867—he had no solicitor, and I recommended he should have one—at that time he said he would prefer to be with<lb/>out, and certain matters were gone into at that meeting not relating to the matters now in question—the next meeting was held on 21st January, and then Mr. Pappa was attended by a solicitor, Mr. Lewis, and all that took place then took place in the presence of Mr. Lewis, as well as myself—sometimes Mr. Pappa spoke, and sometimes Mr. Lewis—Mr. Lewis frequently said what I have taken down as Mr. Pappa's state<lb/>ment, but Mr. Pappa assented to its being taken as his statement—I think I can read it—the heading of it is "800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Fraser—other matters were re<lb/>ferred to, but this relates only to Mr. Eraser's. "This money was remitted to myself by the above gentleman, who had no connection with the bank, but was recommended to me by a Mr. Langford. The sum in question was at his request invested in shares, bought by me for him; but, as upon the day of the settlement I could not see Mr. Fraser, I gave my name for the shares, so that the shares passed to my name, and afterwards I gave in<lb/>structions to the registrar to take 160 shares from my own name and pass them to that of Mr. Fraser. The funds and accounts of the bank hate no concern with this matter. As far as I recollect, I signed a letter to Mr. Fraser, acknowledging the receipt of the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I presume that the regis<lb/>trar followed my instructions, but please give me the books; share and transfer registrar produced, folio 292, account of Mr. Fraser"—That book is here—this is the entry that was read: "Debtor, William Fraser, Weston-Super-Mare, gentleman, 1866, March 20th, to accounts due on re-allotment of 160 shares at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per share, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—There was another entry made subse<lb/>quently—there is no entry on the other side crediting the account with the receipt of the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque—that is the only entry in that page—there is no credit—after reading the entry Mr. Pappa said: "I must here state that I was not the registrar, neither the book-keeper, so that I am not responsible for any mistake or omission in the book; I make this statement after seeing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020044"/>
               <p>the entry from which is omitted the transfer of 160 shares from my name to his, which transfer I had given directions to the registrar to make, and to him I refer you in confirmation of my statement The date of this entry is the 20th March, 1866; I presume the date of this entry to be a mistake, as I received the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 23rd May, 1865." Then the share and transfer register, vol. 2, account of D. Pappa, 421 was produced—(<hi rend="italic">The book was produced</hi>)—I don't know that any particular item of this account was men<lb/>tioned—it was laid open before him, and he went on to speak, but I have no note at present that any particular entry upon this page was read—"In May, 1865, I had more than 3000 shares of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each"—I think the object of that was to see how many shares he had at that time, but nothing more took place—then the register of shareholders was produced, the book that you have had some discussion about—he very likely said "I ask for the register of shareholders, which is now produced"—I have only got "Regis<lb/>ter of shareholders produced" in the original, and then "I request to be shown by the clerk of the liquidator Mr. Eraser's name as a shareholder allotted shares of the bank"—substantially Mr. Pappa sometimes said "I ask for this or that"—the 20,000 shares was the portion of the register re<lb/>ferred to—it was open at that part where the allotment of the shares is to Eusthatiade—18,000 shares appear to be allotted to different persons—then the book being opened Mr. Pappa said "I request to be shown by the clerk of the liquidator Mr. Eraser's name as a shareholder allotted shares of the bank. Mr. Cooper says he does not find Mr. Eraser's name;" Mr. Pappa said "I also do not find the name in the book, and I say that if the 180 shares given to Mr. Eraser were the property of the bank, there will be an entry in the minute-book, allotting 160 shares to Mr. Eraser; I ask for the minute-book, and beg Mr. Cooper to find such an entry. Mr. Cooper says he does not see any minutes of any allotment by the bank to Mr. Eraser." Then Mr. Pappa goes on: "This fact of non-allotment by the bank shows that Mr. Eraser never had any allotment of shares made to him by the bank, and that some error has arisen in not having entered in the transfer ledger the transfer of 160 shares from my name unto that of Mr. Eraser; that error is not of my making, and I received the money from Mr. Eraser, believing that the transfer had been made as ordered by me, and I say that the money belonged to me and not to the bank; and I am willing to contest that question in any court of law, and deposit the money for that purpose"—the words "I say that the money belonged to me, and not to the Bank," I have marked here that Mr. Pappa did not say every word of that, but Mr. Lewis—Mr. Lewis said, "I am willing to contest the question"—Mr. Pappa said afterwards, I don't know whether it was at that meeting or not, "I adopt every word that Mr. Lewis has said, "or some<lb/>thing to that effect—"Mr. Cooper now produces another register of share-holders; I see an entry of the name of Eraser"—This is Mr. Eraser's account—"I see an entry of the name of Eraser as holder of 160 shares, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid, 18859 to 19018, dated 20th March. I say that if these numbers be not the numbers of my shares, it is the mistake of the registrar; the whole mistake being that he has not given certificates of my shares to Mr. Eraser as I directed him. The bank is answerable for his mistake, and I hold the bank responsible for the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if by law I am compelled to pay over that amount by reason of the error of the registrar of the bank. I now ask for the dividend warrant book, and I ask Mr. Cooper if there be any divi<lb/>dent warrant made out by the bank in favour of Mr. Eraser. He produces</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020045"/>
               <p>a cheque on the Agra and Masterman's bank, dated 20th March, 1866, for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in favour of William Eraser, Esq., or order, signed by Mr. Clench and Mr. McKenna, two directors, and countersigned by me as managing director. The counterfoil is as follows: 'William Fraser, of Weaton-Super-Mare, for dividend from 28th May to 31st December, 1865, at 10 per cent, 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.' I say that the cheque so given to Mr. Fraser is-correctly paid to him as the holder of 160 shares, but owing to the error of the clerk, should have been paid in respect of 160 shares ordered by me to be transferred from my name to Mr. Fraser's. The apparent irregularity of this transaction arises solely from that error, and having thus been made the rest follows in the course of business, and was not discovered by me as I did not keep the books. If, therefore, my dividend was that amount in excess, I am responsible to pay it to the liquidator, as I told him some time since when this question was first mooted. I am now prepared to answer any questions which you, Mr. Mullens, wish to put on this item. Mr. Mullens replied that he does not wish to put any question now"—I did not do any business from August till the end of October, 1869—I was not out of town all that time.</p>

Olyn't—it was not paid, in the morning Glyn's clerk returned it to me as unpaid, I sent it across, by a clerk, to the Oriental Commercial Bank, and he came back with 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in notes, which he paid in in the afternoon of that day, with other cash; from whom he obtained it I can't say—with reference to the National Finance and Financial Corporation Shares, they were actually purchased and delivered—I can't tell you for whom they were purchased—I buy them in the market—they were delivered at the Oriental Bank—I had no personal communication with the directors; but my authorised clerk had—I did see some of the directors when I received the cheque for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a cheque for 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was returned to me, which made me cautious, and I went to the bank, to the head of the firm, and demanded a cheque imme<lb/>diately—I saw two directors and Mr. Pappa—I call them directors; they sat there, and looked like directors—I received a cheque for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in their presence—one of them signed it—I had said that I would have 378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote them a very stiff letter about it—I do not remember that I said any<lb/>thing about the cheque for 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was dishonoured.</p>

I am an umbrella-maker, living at 38, Sloane Square, and occupying a shop in Sloane Street—on the evening of the 2nd March, I locked up my shop as usual, from the outside, and proceeded to my residence for the night—about 7 o'clock the next morning I found that it had been broken into—the front door was open, two bolts had been burst off, and the place was in disorder—all my umbrellas and parasols had been taken from the windows—the drawers were open, and the umbrellas which had been brought to be repaired, were missing also—the thieves had sat in the parlour and out off the silver collars from about two and a half dozens of canes—they had spoiled about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of paragon ribs—there was a lantern with a light in it, and evidently they had had supper there, for there were fish bones and potatoe parings all over the place—the value of the stolen property was about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the umbrellas were of English manufacture, and some of them bore my name—about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of dog collars an missing now, as also other of the property—I have recovered about 860 umbrellas and parasols—the property which was sold to Mr. Theodoredi for 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was in value from 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., many of the umbrellas being of the very best quality—Mr. Theodoredi came to my place on the 9th, and after<lb/>wards I saw Mr. Nardaud, I believe—I had received an anonymous letter before then, and had been with the police to Mr. Theodoredi's place, in New Broad Street—the bulk of the stolen property was found in Mr. Theodoredi's private residence, at Battersea, and a portion at his shop in New Broad Street—I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you not say, when before the Magistrate, that the property was worth about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might be so—I can't speak positively as to the number of umbrellas stolen—I have had to guew it—umbrellas, sun shades, and dog collars, with silver mounts, were stolen—I only received umbrellas and parasols from Mr. Theodoredi—there were four or five dozen umbrellas stolen that had been left for repair—the thieves left the worst—ray name was not on all of the new ones—it was not put on, as a general rule.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter, living at 35, Wardour Street, Soho—on 4th March, as I was going to the City, by boat, from Hungerford Pier, about 3.30 in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner, who showed me two silk umbrellas, one a gentleman's and the other a lady's, and said that he</p>

               <p>had received a quantity from Paris, and wanted to sell some of them, so as to raise money, to send the same evening, in part payment of what had been sent—he said he was going into the City to meet somebody who was about to sell them for him—I said that I could introduce him to a gentleman, who, I hoped, would buy them—nothing was said as to quality or price—I believe he said he had 340 umbrellas altogether, namely, 200 gentlemen's and 140 ladies', all silk—I took him to Mr. Theodoredi's, in New Broad Street; but there was no bargain made at first between them—Mr. Theodoredi was out at the time—when he returned I told him I had brought him a party who had some umbrellas for sale—Mr. Theodoredi wanted to see the bulk when he made any arrangement as to purchase—prisoner said that he could bring the bulk, and then he left—I went out with Mr. Theodoredi to a place in Water Lane, and when we got back to his office, about 11.30, the umbrellas were there, and the prisoner and another man waiting (<hi rend="italic">looking at a prisoner named Edward</hi>) that is the man—I asked the prisoner who the man was, and he said that he was his landlord, and a friend of his—Mr. Theodoredi looked at the umbrellas, and found that some of them were not quite new, and he asked the prisoner how that was—the prisoner said it was a job lot, which had been purchased by his landlord, for whom he wanted to sell them—a price was named, and the prisoner agreed to accept a lump sum of 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the whole of the property—the money was to be paid that evening; but, as it was late, Mr. Theodoredi gave the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and he wrote out a receipt—there is only his sig<lb/>nature on the stamp—the body of the receipt is in the handwriting of some<lb/>one else; I think a friend of Mr. Theodoredi's wrote it—I was there the next morning, about 11.15, and the prisoner was there, too—a cheque for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner went away, but returned in about an hour and a half afterwards, and received another cheque for the balance, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he wanted to have some profit out of the trans<lb/>action; but, by arrangement, he was to give his friend the cheque for 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he himself had had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—I was to have a commission of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my trouble, and the prisoner gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Edwards 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., besides.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you had had some dealings with the pri<lb/>soner before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I met him on Hungerford Pier before we proceeded to Theodoredi's—a man named Berjeau was with him there—the prisoner spoke of having received the umbrellas from Paris—I had nothing to do with what the prisoner said to Mr. Theodoredi as to his landlord being the owner of the umbrellas—Mr. Theodoredi is a Greek, I believe—I am a Frenchman—the conversation with Theodoredi was mostly in French—Mr. Theodoredi speaks perfectly good English—I did not think it worth while to call the attention of Mr. Theodoredi to the account given by the prisoner that the umbrellas were his landlord's; I had nothing to do with that—I had not the money for nothing at all—the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given to me after the transaction was concluded—if I had suspected that the property had been stolen I should have had nothing to do with it—Mr. Theodoredi's nephew, his clerk, and two or three gentlemen were present—Mr. Berjeau was not present whilst the negotiation was going on—I did not see a man named Manning there—a man of that name was, I believe, waiting at a public-house—I cannot say whether the second cheque for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was payable to order—I first went to Mr. Theodoredi's about 4 o'clock on the Friday afternoon—it was about 7.30 when the umbrellas were taken there.</p>

I am a merchant, carrying on business at 23, New Broad Street—my private residence is at 13, Larkington Road, Battersea—I remember the last witness bringing the prisoner to my offices, and my purchasing a number of umbrellas from him—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first, and it was arranged that the remainder of the sum of 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be paid by cheques—the first cheque was of the value of 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a man named Edwards was with the prisoner—two cheques were drawn at the prisoner's request—there were 323 umbrellas and parasols, altogether, and part of the former were of alpaca—some of them were soiled goods—the prisoner told me he had had them from Paris—I saw there were different makers' names upon them—they were not all silk—they had the names of Toplin, Towns<lb/>end, Green, and others, and I thought they might be job lots coming from factories—some of them were soiled and torn, as if they had been left for mending; I pointed this out to Edwards and the prisoner—Edwards said nothing beyond the prisoner being the agent—he referred me to the prisoner, and said he had just come from the colonies—I told the prisoner, in French, that the umbrellas were not what he had represented them to be—he said they must be French, although they had English names upon them—he said they came from France.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 16, High Street, Bloomsbury—on the 4th March I was in a coffee-house in Rupert Street, and the prisoner and four or five foreigners were there—the prisoner told me he had about 300 silk umbrellas for sale—I said there were plenty of people in the City who would buy them—he asked me if I would accompany him there, and I did—at the boat pier we met with Nardaud—I did not go into Theodoredi's the first time, but waited outside the office—when the prisoner came out again, I went with him to the same coffee—shop I had seen him in in Rupert Street—I then went with him to Cranbourn Street, and waited for him about half an hour—when next I saw him he was inside a cab, No. 2332, with three men—there were boxes and things in the cab—then we went on to Theodoredi's—the prisoner and Edwards carried the umbrellas into the place—I saw Morieau the next day—he told me he had only 284 umbrellas, 180 silk, and 100 alpaca—I said they did not look like English goods, and he replied that his landlord had just received them from Paris.</p>

He asked me if I could sell some umbrellas for him. I said yes, I would sell them on commission; and he then gave me two as samples, one gentleman's and one lady's silk umbrella.

I received information of the robbery on Sunday morning, 9th January, and in the evening I went with Branch to the house of the Sullivans, 259, Cable Street, for the purpose of making inquiries—they were occupying a front room on the second floor—it was furnished very barely—I told them the circumstances of the robbery, and asked whether Branch had taken anything there—Daniel said they knew nothing whatever about it—I have had the case in my hands from the 9th January to the 9th April—I have seen Daniel Sullivan in the interval, per<lb/>haps four or five times—he has been employed as an extra man at the docks—I have seen the female, Mary Sullivan, four or five times in the company of Branch—they have been shopping at different places in the Commercial Road—I have seen them come out of shops with parcels—I have ascertained that Branch had lodgings at 3, Church Path, Stepney—on the 9th April, I was in company of Monger, and we saw Branch enter a jeweller's shop, whilst Mary Ann Sullivan remained waiting outside, it was Mr. Wood's shop, 5, Crombie's Kow, Commercial Road—Branch beckoned to Mary Ann to go in to her, and Monger then rushed into the shop and seized hold of Branch's hands whilst I held Mary Ann and took her into the shop—we asked the jeweller what they had been buying, and he said a lady's ring, and he produced a brooch which he said they had given him in exchange—I produced the brooch, and told Mary Ann we should charge her on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery at Mr. Lazarus's—she made no reply, and both women were taken to the police-station—on the prisoner Branch I found 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a pair of earrings, a wedding ring and keeper, all new articles; and a duplicate, torn into pieces, was picked up in the dock where the prisoner had been standing—upon Mary Ann we found a wedding ring and keeper, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to No. 3, Church Path, and in a room, the key of which I had from Branch, I found a quantity of new furniture, a lot of receipts for new goods, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a bed and bolster, Albert guard, gold rings, &amp;c., and two savings' bank books, there were eleven receipts altogether, and they were for goods purchased on the 19th January—we searched the lodgings of Sullivan in Fair Street, on Sunday the 10th April—he and his wife occupied two rooms on the first floor—I found there a new bed, new bedstead, new chairs and tables, considerably more furniture than what they had when living in Cable Street—there wore also a gold Albert and locket, and a gold signet ring, which we found in the pocket of a coat hanging up behind the door—they corresponded with one of the receipts of the 19th January, and which I found at Branch's place—I was not present when the silver coin was given up.</p>

               <p>April, I was called at 4.6 p.m., and searched Mr. Pardoe'e house, about six or eight minutes after that—I found a great many strangers in the house endeavouring to extinguish the fire, which was burning in the first-floor front room—the bed and bedding were well alight—after that was put out our attention was called to another fire in the first-floor front room—there was no communication with the other fire—it did not appear to be accidental—it was in the bed and bedstead—it was nearly out, some buckets of water had been put upon it, and then there were only a few sparks left—the flooring under the bed was nearly burnt through—it appeared as if the fire had originated in a bucket containing some clay pipes, the bottom of which only remained—I noticed on the ground floor that a piece of flooring, about 2ft from the fire-place, was burnt through—there had been a fire in the grate—the sideboard or dresser was slightly scorched—I do not think it possible that a coal or cinder could have six fire to the places I saw, because the fire appeared to be very low and to have burnt out—the fire down stairs could not have set fire to the place up stairs—the prisoner came there about 6 o'clock, and Miss Pardoe said to him in my presence, "O, Henry, you villain, you have done this"—he said "That's right, blame me; say I have done it, but it has to be proved yet."</p>

On Monday night, 11th April, I went to a lodging-house in Flower and Dean Street, with Burrows—as soon as I got in Monroe jumped off a sack, rushed to the fire, and commenced putting coals on—Thomas was sitting on a stool—I went to Monroe and said "Turn round"—after a second he turned round, and I said I should take him for being concerned in stealing some clothes from a lady in Com<lb/>mercial Street, on the 8th—he asked me what night it was—I said "Friday night"—he said "Very well," and I took him to the station—Thomas was taken by Burrows—we placed him with ten or eleven others, the nearest to their size that we could possibly find, and the prosecutrix went to a man very much like Monroe, and about his size, and said "I think this is some<lb/>thing like the man"—the inspector said "Right about"—the row turned their backs, and then she identified Monroe by putting her hand on him—on 17th April I saw Emeway in Old Nicholl Street, Shoreditch—I was with Burrows, in plain clothes—as soon as he saw us he got off the pavement and ran away, up a short street, which is no thoroughfare, but which has a public-house at the end, having a thoroughfare through it—this being 4 o'clock on Sunday afternoon the doors were closed, and I met him coming back, as he could not get in—I told him I should take him for being con<lb/>cerned, with two men in custody, in robbing a lady and stealing a bundle of linen—he said "Very well, if I am <hi rend="italic">buffed</hi> to, I will stand to it; but I don't know anything about it; I hope you will give me a fair chance; I am not the man that done it"—he said one man we had in custody, named Monroe, he believed was right; but that the other was wrong—I placed him in the station with several others; the prosecutrix looked at him, and was going to point to a man an inch or an inch and a half taller; but when she saw Emeway she said "That is the man who pushed me"—I know the prisoners—I have seen Monroe and Emeway in company frequently—I have seen Thomas before; but not in their company.</p>

They say that I snatched the bundle from her, and the other chap hit her in the mouth, and the others ran away. Tell my mother that if she can get my brother to say I was there all day on Friday up to 12 o'clock at night Tell her that I come up next Tuesday for my witnesses.

                  <hi rend="italic">Emeway's Defence.</hi> I was taken for stealing a watch, and the gentleman picked out a different man altogether. Since that, this policeman has had his eye on me, and when he sees me with a bundle he stops me if anything is lost; this is the second time he has taken me on suspicion. He would not take me himself, but sent his brother to do it. I never saw these men before. I don't suppose there was one honest person round the woman at the time. There are nothing but prostitutes and thieves in Keat Court.</p>

I live at 19, Riley Street, Bermondsey—on 29th December last, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Clerkenwell News</hi>, I went to 19, Havering Street, Commercial Road, and there saw Noakes—he said he had come from Mr. Belcher, as his foreman, to engage me, as he understood the business better; that Belcher wanted a person with 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash security, as the man would have a great deal of responsibility in collecting money, and he asked if I would put down ft half-Crown as a deposit that I would put 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down—I gave him a half-Crown and promised to bring 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the afternoon—he told me to go to 149, Back Church Lane—I did so, and there saw both prisoners—I put down the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Belcher said I was to make up the rest by next Monday morning—he gave me a piece of paper as a receipt for the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I afterwards gave it back upon paying him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, when he gave me a note of hand for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went again on Friday, 31st December, saw Belcher, and said I could not find 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he would not be hard upon me, he would give me the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back again if I would pay the expenses for some more advertisements—I said I would—I went again next day, and asked Beloher for my money—he said he would give it me as soon as he got another man—he afterwards said he had got a man, and he would pay me as soon as he could—afterwards, on 17th or 18th January, he came to my house, and said, if I would put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more I could come to work on Monday as storekeeper, at a salary of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I went to the Stores on the Monday following, and put down 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did no work, there was none to do; I had to walk about the cellars with my hands behind roe all day—it was a bottled ale store—there was about a cask and a half of ale there—there was no business of any kind going on—I was there a fortnight—he paid me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in that time, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at one time and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at another—I have never been paid back my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—i have applied for it—I signed this agreement on 17th January, after I had paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it must have been about the 10th that he came to my house—(<hi rend="italic">This was an agree<lb/>ment to engage the witness as storekeeper, at</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week</hi>)—Belcher signed it—no ale was sold while I was there—some persons came down and had a glass of ale, that was all; they did not pay for it—Belcher said they were going to bottle come ale—he gave me back the half-Crown which I had deposited with Noakes, when I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I witnessed this document and the pri<lb/>soners signed it—(<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of agreement between the prisoners, dated January</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1870, <hi rend="italic">by which they agreed to share the rent of the cellars between them, Belcher to carry on the ale business on his own account, and Noakes the bottle business</hi>)—After I had been there a fortnight and three days Belcher told me to leave; he did not say why—I asked for my wages or my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would pay me as soon as he got some—he never gave it me—this is the advertisement I answered—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "A young man wanted to manage bottled ale stores; no knowledge required.

I am a commercial traveller—I know the prisoners—their real names are John Joseph Solomon, and Charles Ward—in February, 1869, I was engaged by Solomon as managing clerk—he said he was doing a very extensive business and he wanted a person like myself to conduct it for him, and he would guarantee me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and perhaps it might be 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the office was at 90, Lower Thames Street, and consisted of two rooms on the third floor—the name of Dickson, Wilson &amp; Co., was painted on the tablets at the door, and also on the staircase—I understood Solomon to represent Dickson, Wilson &amp; Co.—I never saw anyone else to represent them—about the end of March, or the beginning of April, 1869, Solomon told me to engage a painter and have the name of Dickson, Wilson &amp; Co., painted out, and substitute D. McFarlane &amp; Co., which was done—"Donald McFarlane &amp; Co." was put on the door, and also on the staircase, and "D. McFarlane &amp; Co., Melbourne," on the tablets at the hall door—in May, 1869, Solomon told me he had given Mr. March an order for some wheels for shipping, and that Mr. March was the agent for the Wheel and Waggon and Coker Canvas Company, of Somerset—I recollect a letter coming from Mr. March, and subsequently I wrote this letter at Solomon's dictation—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>

Cubitt &amp; Colin, 36, Parliament Street, and Ward &amp; Co., 247, High Street, Borough. D. McFarlane &amp; Co.")—Properly speaking, there was no such firm as Cubitt &amp; Colin—Solomon was Cubitt, and Wilson was Colin—Colin was one of the Christian names of Wilson, his name was Robert Colin Wilson—this letter signed "Cubitt, Colin &amp; Co." purports to be written from 36, Parliament Street—I saw that letter written at Solomon's office, 90, Lower Thames Street, by a person named Flatteau—it was written in draft by Solomon, and copied by Flatteas—he was employed at 36, Parliament Street—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "18th May, 1869, Mr. March, Sir,—We must apologize for not replying to yours of the 12th instant, ere this, the same having been mislaid; in reply, we beg to say that the firm in question had been established for some years in the Austra<lb/>lian trade, and is generally considered to be respectable and of good standing.

We are, sir, yours respectfully, Ward &amp; Co.")—No trade was ever done between Ward &amp; Co. and McFarlane &amp; Co., while I was there—Mr. March called it 90, Lower Thames Street, about the latter part of July, after the wheels had been supplied—he said he had called for the settlement of his account—Solomon said that in consequence of the delay in the execution of the order he had missed shipping them in time, and asked him if he would draw a bill on the firm—Mr. March objected at first—Solomon said he ought not to object to draw a bill when the references had been so satisfactory, and he consented to do so—I recollect this bill coming to the office, drawn upon McFarlane &amp; Co., by the West of England Engineering and Coker Canvas Company, to whom Mr. March was the London agent—(<hi rend="italic">This was a bill of exchange for</hi> 217<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated July</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1869, <hi rend="italic">at four months' date, and accepted by D. McFarlane &amp; Co.</hi>)—I accepted the bill and wrote D. McFarlane &amp; Co., by the direction of Solomon—I objected to do it as I did not want to have anything to do with accepting the bill, but Solomon said it did not make any difference, he did not want his name to be seen, he would pay it when it became due, and he was the party that was liable and not me—I never saw Mr. D. McFarlane, there was no such person, and Solomon told me so—he tried to get advances on the bills of lading for the wheels in London, after they were shipped.</p>

On Sunday evening, 24th April, I was in Aldgate, watching, and at a few minutes past 8 o'clock I saw the prisoner, and two men not in custody, together—I watched them three quarters of an hour; they walked backwards and forwards, and at about 8.45 I saw the prisoner lay hold of the prosecutrix's watch chain—he had his right hand to her neck, and pressed his knuckles into it—her friend cried "Murder!" and "Police!" and they ran away—I caught the prisoner a few yards from the prosecutrix, and took him to the station—only an old knife was found on him—he gave his address 10, Dorset Street, Spitalfields, where I found his mother and step-father.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surveyor to the Trinity House—on 1st April, after the lighter was raised, I made a survey of her—she was then ashore for repairs—she had been afloat eleven years—she was in first-rate condition before the accident—the mast was broken in two pieces, and there was an opening of 7ft. on the starboard side aft—the whole of the planks outside were cut down to within 3ft. of the keel—the ship's bow had gone across her, cutting the deck asunder, breaking the beams and carlines, and breaking the sheer straight and gunwale, on the port side—a speed of seven or eight knots would cause that—the lighter was literally still—it would</p>

               <p>take more to knock her under, with all that ballast she would not fall away—I am supposing the steamer to be empty—if the men had been in the lighter cabin their bodies would have been literally smashed, because the cabin is so small, that the bow of the steamer went right into it, and like<lb/>wise the planks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Cooper, one of the messengers of the Court of Bankruptcy—on 18th July, last year, by Mr. Cooper's direction, I went to the bankrupt's premises, in Kennington Road, and took possession of them, and remained there until the 28th August—I slept on the premises—I remained after the adjudication, I was de<lb/>puted by the official assignee to keep possession on behalf of the trade assignee—I remained there till after the sale, which took place, I think, on Thursday, 26th August, and on the Saturday, two days after that, I left—</p>

               <p>Homewood, who is in the employment of Mr. Cutten, the auctioneer, lotted the goods—one of his clerks had previously made out the inventory—during the time I was there, I saw the bankrupt most days on the premises—his son was there as often, they generally came together in the morning, most days—the goods were to be delivered to the purchasers at the sale, on the Friday and Saturday—they were not all removed—I left the premises on the Satur<lb/>day, about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening; every person who was on the premises left with me, we all left together, Homewood was one of them—I locked the door and had the key, no one was left on the premises to my knowledge—a short time after I left, I remembered that I had left a coat behind me, I went back in about fifteen or twenty minutes; Mr. Barker, the prisoner's clerk, went bock with me; I unlocked the door and he went in with me—I found my coat there, and I found the bankrupt there with two men, who I did not know—I said I was very much surprised to find them on the pre<lb/>mises, but it was so suddenly done; in opening the door seven or eight other men came in within a minute or so, and that may account for my not recognizing the faces of each, but Mr. Weston had certainly two men with him; I know most of them, Homewood was one, and three others of Mr. Cutten's men—they were persons who had been engaged previously in con<lb/>nexion with the sale—some conversation took place with regard to these persons Inung there, Homewood ordered me, according to my instructions, to lock them out—Mr. Weston would not go, he said "No.! I have got pos<lb/>session here, and I will not go out"—I said I thought it would be prudent for him to do so—he said "No; I shall not"—I said "Do you object to leave the premises?"—he said "I do; I will not go out"—I said "As you will not go out, as I am in duty bound I must look you in, according to my instructions," and I did, and we all came out with the exception of the bank<lb/>rupt and hid two or three men—I locked the door and left them in—those men were none of our party—I went there again on the Monday but could not get in—I tried to unlock the door, Homewood was with me and Mr. Cutten's men—I unlocked the door, but it was bolted inside, and therefore we could not get admission—I did not see or hear anybody inside—I re<lb/>mained there till 6 o'clock in the afternoon, and just before I left I again tried to got in—I reported the circumstances, and on the Tuesday gave up the keys to Mr. Cutten—I did not go there afterwards.</p>

Evans &amp; Laing are the prosecutors in this case; they are the attorneys; I don't know for whom they are attorneys—I went in on the day of the adjudication—I did not take an inventory, Tindal, Mr. Cutton's clerk, did; I don't know on what day, I think it was about ten days after the abdication—I allowed things to be removed while I was there, because we were carrying on the trade for a few days, and the things that were purchased were delivered; I allowed nothing else to be taken away—Mr. Weston carried on the business, sanctioned by the official assignee—I slept there the whole of the time—Mr. Homewood prepared the catalogue—on the 28th, when I locked the door and went away, it was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I came back—we had boon to the Tankard public house, to have a glass of ale, with the bankrupt</p>

               <p>and others—when I opened the door, the others came in—I had been to the Tankard before—very likely I was there with young Weston on the morning of the sale—I have no doubt Homewood was there—I did not say to young Weston there "Now, if you want to do yourself and good, you must make it all right with Homewood, for he can put a good deal in your way;" I never made any such remark, nothing of the kind—I did not hear Homewood say "Yes, youngster, there are a lot of goods not down in the catalogue, and if you will make two or three of us right for about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., we will put about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into your pocket"—I have heard that there were things not in the catalogue, but I did not know it—young Weston did not say to me, or in my presence, "I should not like to do any such thing"—I don't recollect having any conversation with young Weston at the public-house—I did not afterwards go up to the defendant, on his own premises, and say "I can't talk to your son, he does not know enough of the world," nothing of the kind; nor did I add "Look here, if you want to do yourself any good, it is no use being obstinate, you shall have about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in stuff for a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I never knew there was any stuff at all, beyond that which was in the inventory—I did not say "There was not time to get it in the catalogue, so there is a chance for you"—I was told, about a week after I had left the premises, by Messrs. Cutten's people, that they had broken in and found about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property—the prisoner did not say to me "Don't speak to me like that, sir, I will not have one pennyworth;" nor did I say "You are a great fool"—a man named Curtis was in possession on behalf of the mortgagees—I don't know when he came into possession, I think about two or throe days before the sale—he was one of the persons that I locked out, and who I locked in afterwards; I was instructed to lock him out, and I acted upon those instructions; he walked out, like the rest, to get a glass of ale—I did not invite him to do so; I don't know who did, no doubt somebody did, because he had no money himself to drink with—I did not, before that, get Curtis to help me down stairs with a box and place it under the stairs; I had nothing to do with putting a box under the stairs; I did not give him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for helping me to do so—Homewood had two black bags there; I don't know the contents of them—I saw those bags, on the Saturday, in a small recess in the store-room, a sort of pigeon-hole—I did not see inside them, they were locked—I did not see Home<lb/>wood put anything into them—I had not the least idea they contained glass drops, or prisms, or anything of that sort—I do not always act with Homewood—I have been in the Court twenty years, and never met him above three times in any possession where I have been.</p>

I live at 8, Cross Street, Islington—I am occasion<lb/>ally employed by Mr. Cutten—he has auction rooms at 8, Cross Street, and the second sale took place there—I was instructed by Mr. Cutten to lot the goods—the first day I went to the premises, 113, Kennington Road, was on 23rd August, I found Newman there—I had to prepare the stock for sale; I did so; it took me two days and part of the next; I lotted the goods—amongst other things that I lotted for the first sale, there were glass chandeliers, some were perfect and some imperfect, some had no burners,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020086"/>
               <p>and some had only part drops on them, some had not half the quantity—some of those that were afterwards found concealed on the premises were of the same description as those on the imperfect chandeliers; there were so many chandeliers, some might have been of the same description, and some not; they would be used for the same purpose—I saw the bankrupt there every day, and sometimes two or three times a day—my attention was not called to the trough; of course I lotted it, it was named in the cata<lb/>logue—I did not notice the furnace baths, they were not in the catalogue, they were fixtures—I included in the catalogue all the stock that was drawn to my notice, it included some of the goods that I afterwards found con<lb/>cealed—the sale took place on the 26th, I was there every day from 23rd to 28th—after the sale the lots were delivered to the purchasers, according to the catalogue—some of the lots were unclaimed by the Saturday night, Mr. Cutten gave an extra day on account of the Jews, it being their Sabbath—I found out in the delivery that in some instances there were larger quantities of goods in the lots than were specified in the catalogue—in those cases I delivered according to catalogue, and kept the others back—I left about 7 o'clock, or 7.30, on the Saturday evening—I saw the messenger leave, he locked the premises and held the keys—I went back in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and found the messenger there, Mr. Weston, his son, and two or three other men—I asked them how they came in; they said they had been let in by the messenger—I said it was false, they must have got in the back way—they said they held possession, and we had no right there—I persuaded the messenger to obey his orders, and lock up the premises, and that was done—I went back on the Monday and found the premises all locked up, I could get no admittance; and again on Tuesday; I did not go again till I got authority from the trade assignee on 6th September; I then took four men with me, and directed them to break down one of the shutters, and so effected an entry—I found the iron bed of a lathe laid across the two inner doors, and a heavy upright of wood about 4 in. square stood against the bolts of the door to prevent their being forced—I then went on delivering the goods to the pur<lb/>chasers under the sale; that same morning one of my men drew my attention to some brass work in the trough; that was the first intimation I had that there was any property that had not been put in the catalogue; I went to the trough, and saw twenty-one ingots of brass, weighing 116lbs., covered over with sand; a large copper pan was found in the same place, full of brass work and glass work; the brass was finished work, about from 14lbs., to 19lbs.—there were glass drops loose in the sand, enough to make up five or six parcels—on finding these things, I gave orders for a general search; and on the Tuesday my attention was drawn to some solution found in the carpenter's shop, in the dung; I did not see it found, the men dug out three bottles of it, one they broke in digging it out—on the Wednesday my attention was drawn to a floor board being loose in the casting shop, one of the men trod on it and it flew up with him, we got a candle and found some parcels, of which I made a memorandum at the time—(<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>) I see this was on the same day that I found the solution, not on the Wednesday—this memorandum contains the particulars of all—on Monday I found under the sand fifty parcels of glass drops, and cut knobs—on the 7th, in the ash hole, I found eleven parcels of drops, chains, and cut knobs, nine ditto in furnace hole, and thirty-nine under the foundry floor; and on Wednesday the 8th I found in an iron stove four iron standards with brass</p>

               <p>Street, Bedford Row—I was employed in this bankruptcy—Mr. Philps, the creditor's assignee, is not a creditor—it was the desire of the creditors, at the choice of assignees, that some person should be employed who would give attention to this particular case—the largest creditors were Messrs. Cohen, clients of mine, and the elder of the firm being very unwell, could not give his attention to it; they were creditors for a judgment of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the costs of a Chancery suit—there were other creditors as well, and Mr. Philps was selected, being known as a respectable man, and living in the neighbourhood; and it is not necessary under the Act of Parliament that an assignee should be a creditor—I have been attending to the matter from that time up to the present—the only assets that have come to the estate have been received from Mr. Cutten, the sales that have been given in evi<lb/>dence to-day, roundly, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know all about the lease, the prisoner's son has it—at the very time the bankrupt filed the account, returning it as an asset at 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the son had bought it at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the mortgagees—it is on the proceedings, in the account filed under the Act of Parliament for the ten days' account—we have never had the chance of accepting the lease, became the son had purchased it by auction long before I had seen the accounts disclosing it—I was present when Blanchard was examined in the Bank<lb/>ruptcy Court, and when his examination was concluded the bankrupt said everything was perfectly true, and he afterwards added he should have to implicate six or seven other persons besides himself—Mr. Doyle, his counsel, advised him to hold his tongue—no questions were put to him after that—I know nothing of Curtis, except that he distrained for rent, and, by my advice, he was paid out instantly, as we could not clear the lots until the landlord was paid—I never heard of any demand of a right to go into the premises on 28th August—I got an order from the Court to enter them—it was under the original order which we obtained in July.</p>
               <p>

               <p>with the business—he used to come in occasionally, just in the morning and again in the evening—I recollect Mr. Tindal taking the inventory, and I Afterwards saw the catalogue—the sale took place on 26th August, about 1 o'clock—on that morning I was at the Tankard, with Homewood and Newman—Newman first met me outside; he often wanted treating, and I used to give him a glass of ale—he asked me to walk inside, which I did, and he said, "Now, if you are not foolish you can do some good for your<lb/>self," and he showed me Homewood, and then Homewood said, "Now, look here, youngster, if you want to do any good for yourself, if you make it right with us, this thing is quite usual, I can put about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into your pocket for about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he told me to look after my own interests, and a lot more which I could not repeat—Newman was standing in the public-house—I think he must have heard it—I did not give him any answer, because I knew that law had been going on for three or four years between the parties, and there was a deal of animosity between them—I went inside and told my father what he had offered—shortly afterwards I saw Newman go straight up to my father, in the passage from the carpenters' shop—I heard him say, "I can't talk to your son, he is only a youngster; he does not know any<lb/>thing of the world; look here, don't be a fool, I can put 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into your pocket for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—my father is a very excitable man, and he said, "If you talk to me again like that, I will knock your brains out"—before that, New<lb/>man said to me, in the public-house, that there were a lot of things not down in the catalogue—he did not say what he meant by that; he seemed to trust to my understanding him, which I did—Curtis was at first in possession on behalf of the landlord, for the rent; that was paid by Mr. Cutten's clerk, Mr. Robinson, and then he was put in possession for the mortgagees of the lease—Mr. Hetherington is the solicitor, of 5, Sergeant's Inn, Fleet Street—on Saturday evening, 28th August, about 5 o'clock, I was on the premises with Curtis and my father; we had been paying the wages of two or three men who were employed by my father to carry out an order, by permission of the official assignee—Newman and Homewood were also there, and three or four others—we went away about 6 o'clock; we all came out, and Newman took the keys and locked the place—he got Curtis out to have some beer; in fact, we all went out under the pretence of having something to drink—I went back again—the mortgagees had given me permission to stop in the place, as I had bought the fixtures—I got back, and Barker and my father and Curtis—we got in at the front door—Newman came back for something; in fact, Barker had asked Newman to open the door for him—we got in, and would not go out again—we took the lock off the door; the landlord told us to do so—we did not stop in the place, we left Curtis there and boarded up the door—in consequence of something Curtis said, we made a search of the premises on the Sunday morning, and in the cellar found a lot of property under the stairs, in loose parcels; there were forty or fifty parcels of drops and different things; they were not in a box; I afterwards found two black bags under an apron in a room behind the room; they were locked; we felt them, and they contained pans that are used on the arms of chandeliers, and a lot of drops, I should say 500 or 600—I did not see what was in the bags till about seven or eight days afterwards—I think that was all we found—on the Monday, I went to Mr. Cutten's office, and told him that from what I had heard and seen I thought his men had been carrying on a system of robbery in the place—he looked very hard at me, and said, "Be very careful what you are saying, young man; unless you</p>

I am a solicitor, of 3, Church Passage, Guildhall Yard—at the latter end of November or the beginning of December I was retained on the part of some of the creditors to attend to this matter—I attended an adjourned meeting on 9th or 10th—the bankrupt was there—I heard him ask the Commissioner to adjourn the meeting—all three par<lb/>ties asked it, and we protested against his examination going on until the matters I was directed to inquire into had been cleared up—the matters to be inquired into were the dealings of Cohen with the bankrupt, prior to the bankruptcy—I think there was an adjournment of three months, to the 10th March—I prepared the affidavit that has been mentioned, on 8th February—it was sworn on the morning of the 9th—that was in order to have a private examination of Cohen—I knew Abrahams was out of the way—I applied for a private meeting; but as the form in which the meeting was asked for was not regular, the Registrar gave me leave to turn it into an application to expunge Cohen's proof, so that the meeting was public, and was appointed for 1st or 2nd March—on the morning of 13th February, Mr. Evans called on me, and I told him I had obtained a private meeting to examine Cohen—he said "Yes, and I have obtained a warrant to apprehend the bankrupt; do you think he will surrender?"—I said, "I don't know; I suppose he will, but I shall be seeing him in a day or two, and I will tell him"—I saw him on the 17th, and I wrote a letter to Mr. Evans, by the bank<lb/>rupt's instructions, on that morning, stating that if he would inform me at which police court the warrant was issued, he would surrender—I received</p>

I am resident superintendent of schools at Wandsworth Reformatory—I heard a cry of "Fire" and found the workshops in flames—I tried to put them out—they were destroyed entirely—in consequence of something I heard, I called the prisoner to me that evening, and told him I was going to ask him one or two questions—I asked him if he was the boy who set fire to the hay-loft—he said "I did"—he also said that one of the other boys (who was charged with him before the Magistrate) supplied him with the matches, and a was lucifer to do it—I am sure he said "To do it"—I said so before the Magistrate—the servant maid, Elizabeth Cremer, supplies the matches—she is not here.</p>

I am manager of the Reformatory and Schools, at Wandsworth—the institution is built on my estate—on Wednesday, 6th April, I was sent for, and arrived there at 11 o'clock at night, when the in<lb/>mates had retired to rest—next morning, after breakfast and prayers, which I conducted for the boys, I sent for the prisoner, and said "How came you to be such a wicked boy as to set fire to the premises?"—he said "I was told to do it"—I had said nothing to him by way of caution—I said "Who told you to do it?"—he said "Ross told me to do it, and supplied me with the materials to do it with"—I asked him what he supplied him with—he said "A match and a taper"—I said "Were you under punishment?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187005020110"/>
               <p>—he said "Yes"—I said "Were you on bread and water?"—he said "No"—I said "Had you been flogged?"—he said "No"—I said "Then, what was your punishment?"—he said that he was put to sit on a form by himself—I said "If he had told you to jump into the river, would you have done it?"—I do not think he made any reply—I afterwards had the same conversation with him in Ross's presence—(<hi rend="italic">The Bill against Ross had been thrown out by the Grand Jury</hi>)—Roes said "I gave him the match and the taper, but I did not think he was going to do what he did do"—the prisoner made no reply to that—in consequence of Ross being afflicted he was put in the school, and employed to light the gas there, which no other boy was allowed to do—he gets matches one at a time from the kitchen, and keeps the taper in a drawer—he would not have the match before 7 o'clock that day—they only give him one; we are very careful about that—the servant, Elizabeth, gives out the matches—the prisoner had no right to be in the loft at all, nor had any of the other boys—a master has the charge of it—there is a lock and key, and if he had done his duty, this would not have happened—a range of buildings, two storeys high, value 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., were burned down—they were not insured, as there was no fear of fire, because then were no fires there—the whole of the stock, and the shops and stables were destroyed—they belonged to me—I feel a great interest in the work, and I have seventy-five out of every hundred boys turn out well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Queen Street, Webber Street, and am the wife of John Bishop—the prisoner lodges next door to me, with my sister and her husband—I was sent for next door, my sister was in bed, she had only been confined two days—the prisoner was breaking the things—I told her she ought to know better, and she put her hand across my mouth and tried to choke me—I got away and went up stairs to my sister—when I went down the prisoner rushed at me with the knife and cut me on the forehead, and said "Take that you b——cow"—I had not struck her before or called her names—I went to Mr. Blades, the surgeon, and he strapped the place up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and lire at Caledonian Street, King's Cross—there was a quarrel first between the landlord and the prisoner about a cup of tea—I put the landlord out of the room—Maria Bishop came in afterwards—she was afterwards put out of the room, and I put the latch of the door down—I tried to make the prisoner quiet—Mrs. Bishop called her names—I got between them, and the candle was put out as the prisoner struck Mrs. Bishop—I don't know what the effect of the blow was—I did not see a knife in her hand—I did not hear Mrs. Bishop call out—a policeman came afterwards—he brought Mrs. Bishop into the room, and I saw she was bleeding from the face.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landord at this house—the last witness and the prisoner had been for a walk on this afternoon—they had a game of cards—I afterwards made tea for the prisoner—she was rather cross, and began quarrelling about the tea—I said I never allowed a woman to dictate to me, and she struck me and gave me a black eye, and in the scuffle we knocked down the sideboard—I said I would give her in charge, I would not have my things broke, and while they were fetching the policeman there were cries of "Murder!"—we pushed the door open—before I went for the policeman there were three knives on the table—I did not see the blow—I was out of the house.</p>

She went out, and came back again and said "You b——cow, I will cut you down." I said I would not be cut about, and I did use the knife, more to frighten her than anything else. She came at me with the candiestick, and I did it in self-defence. I was very sorry for it, and went for a doctor, and did all I could. It was more a quarrel than anything else.</p>
