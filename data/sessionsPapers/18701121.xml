I am a tobacconist, of High Street, Epsom—in the beginning of October last I had occasion to leave a meerschaum pipe with Mr. Scott, on the 4th, to have a silver chased band put on it, as the amber was cracked—it was in a case—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I did not receive it back by post.</p>

After we left the steamboat I asked her to let me have the mantle to go and see my uncle, who was a superintendent of police at Brixton, as I did not like to go with the shawl I had got on.

                  </hi>. I live at Mrs. Clark's, 18, Williams Mews—on 25th October, about 5.30, I went home from my work about 5.50—the prisoner came and asked for his wife—Mrs. Clark told him she was gone across the market—he said "Will you allow me to search?"—she said "By all means"—he went into the room, and directly the woman came out screaming</p>

               <p>"Mrs. Clark, save my life, I am stabbed, he has got a knife"—I could not see into the room where they were—she rushed out of the room after being stabbed the first time, and came into my room—Mrs. Clark said to me "For God Almighty's sake, will you see the woman murdered?"—I jumped up, and caught hold of the prisoner, and said to him "Keaser, you rush into destruction if you murder your wife; you will be hung"—he swore an awful oath, and said "I will let you have it," and so he did—he struck at me twice, but the knife ran up the sleeve of my right arm, and did not take any effect upon me—I then got back from him, and got against the fire-place—he followed me up with the knife, and as I had nothing to protect myself with, I seized a small bit of a poker by the fireside, and laid "I will let you hare this"—he went back towards the window, and had the knife at me again—the witness Castle came up, and said "Keaser, let me have the knife, it will be all right"—when the prisoner first came in I heard him say to his wife "I will do for you this time"—that was after he had stabbed her first—I saw the blow on the temple inflicted in in room—I did not interfere till my landlady said "Mr. Brown, will you see the woman murdered."</p>

I am a cabman, and live on the same premises as the prisoner and his wife—on the afternoon of 25th October, about 4.15, I heard a disturbance, and heard the prisoner call his wife a whore, or a bad woman, or something of that sort—she said "I don't daserve such treat<lb/>ment"—he said "Well, out you go, you b—"—I then looked through the window, and saw him catch his wife by the shoulders, and turn her out of the door, and kick her after she was out—she said "Oh, my God, you have nearly killed me"—he then took her by the shoulders, and turned her out of the further gates—a little altercation took place between her and two women outside the gate—she said "I must go somewhere," and she then retired to Mrs. Clark's—I heard no more till I was putting my horse to, and the prisoner passed me, and almost momentarily afterwards I heard screams of "Murder!" and "Help!" from Mrs. Clark's house—I went there and saw Mrs. Keaser partly down the stain—she might have been three or four steps down, and the prisoner seemed to be behind her; whether he was shoving or striking her I could not say; it was dark, however; she fell into my arms—I took her into the mews, and then rushed up the stain, and saw the prisoner standing at the top of the stain with a knife in his hand, and Brown with a poker, standing in his defence—the prisoner said he would do for the b—lot—at that time, Castle passed me, and the prisoner said, "I will give you the knife, and no one else," and he gave it to him—I afterwards took Mr. Keaser to the hospital in my cab, she was bleeding from wounds in the head and back—I should say the prisoner was sober, and capable of undertaking any business he might be required to do.</p>

Polli's Hotel, where I meet gentlemen of whom I buy goods"—he said that in French to Mr. Hands; I understand French sufficient to understand that he said "I buy silk at Polli's Hotel, but I don't know the gentlemen of whom I buy it"—I asked if he could refer me to anyone else who also knew him; he then became very sullen, and would not answer—I told him I had reason to believe these notes were false, and I should take him into custody, which I did—on searching him I found two pawnbroker's duplicates, dated 6th September, 1870; one for a watch and chain for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other for a pair of solitaires and four studs 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of J. Metelli—found no money nor any scrap of paper of any description—he afterwards told me he was staying at the Charing Cross Hotel, at room No. 17 went there and assisted to search that room—his luggage consisted of three portmanteaus and a hat box—torn up in the grate I found pieces of paper which were afterwards pasted together, and proved to be a letter, dated Turin, from Metelli to Roco Metelli in London, and I see by the date of his passport, he was in Turin at that time—it is a receipt for a registered letter—I found very excellent wearing apparel in his portmanteau, but no papers of any sort, except a jeweller's bill, and no money whatever.</p>

These twenty-one notes which have been found to be forged were given to me as genuine, and I received them as genuine from the firm of Perelli and Polli, money-changers at Milan, at the beginning of April in the present year, in exchange for a certificate of Italian stock. Later I came to know that one of the partners was con<lb/>demned to ten years' hard labour for having attempted to put in circulation forged notes. My good faith is proved by being in the company of Mr. Beretta when I changed the notes, and by leaving my address in London. If I had known they were forged I should never have sought the company of Beretta to have them exchanged, especially as he knew me intimately. After two months I returned to London, and continued to frequent the hotel kept by Beretta, who never told me anything about the notes being forged; on the contrary, he received me well; therefore, he could not have suspected they were forged. When I obtained exchange for three of the notes in the City, the clerk went out and returned and said they were genuine; therefore, that confirmed me that they were genuine. I was astonished, when I went to the third money-changer to have two more changed, to be told they were forged. I then gave up all the remainder that I had, my passport, and everything. I had no idea of it before then. If I had been a forger I should have acted in a different way. I should have tried to obtain change of the whole lot in one day, of different money-changers, and I should not have travelled with a passport in my own name; consequently, I protest that I am innocent I had two witnesses I had requested to attend, one of the name of Duncan, and the waiter at an hotel, whose name I don't now recollect; but it appears they are not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Hey wood &amp; Co., Liverpool—on 19th August, some person applied to me for a draft for 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on our London agents, Barclay &amp; Co.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the draft we so granted—he also applied for a draft for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to William Gant, at the same time, on Barclay &amp; Co.—he gave me written particulars of the drafts in this small memorandum, in which he gives the name of Charles Rocher and W. Gant as the persons to whom the drafts were to be made payable—he gave me a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, 600,741, and I gave him the change—this is my original book—the large draft has been paid, and returned to us by Barclay's, but that for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is still outstanding—on 15th August, the same person came again fur a draft for 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Barclay's, in favour of Charles Rocher, and I issued to him this draft (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—part of the money be paid me, was two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, M. 3. 78822 and 78823—this other draft for 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is forged, it is crossed "Midland Banking Company, Sheffield," and dated 15th August—it purports to have been issued from our place at Liverpool, but we did not issue, on 15th August, two drafts payable to Charles Rocher—holding this draft to the light, I can see part</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I have been reading the dates from the notes—I only note the numbers—I can say positively, that this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note has passed through my hands, but whether more than once, I cannot say—it may occur on some days, that I do not give drafts on London—the number issued in a day varies, it is perhaps between 200 and 500 in a month—Mr. Anderton does not sign them all—this draft of 15th August, was the first piece of work I did that day—it is the first entry, and that enables me to say that it was shortly after 10 o'clock—this is the only book I used that day, and this is the original entry—the book also refers on the other side to cheques cashed over the counter—I am cashier—it is necessary that these entries should be made at the time, because there are not always vouchers for money received—it is very unlikely that I received no money before 12 o'clock—the very next entry convinces me that the first entry was made early in the morning; it refers to a bill which was due on the previous day, and which was handed by us to the notary, who brought back in the morning with the money—that would be done early—I will swear it was done before 10.30; and there is another reason, the next entry is a dividend warrant, which must have come to us by post, and it was intended to be sent out for collection—I have not got the dividend warrant here, or the envelope of it—dividend warrants are occasionally banded to us by our customers, but they generally come by post; this came by post, in all probability, as it is from a oust otter who is never in town, and who always sends it by letter—my attention bat never been called to this third entry till now, nor to the second entry—the person came on 12th August, about mid-day, I should say—it is rare for another cashier to take my place during dinner, and in both then cases I can swear I received the money myself—I say that it was in the middle of the day, from the position it occupies in my book—that it in reference both to the entries before and after it—I cannot tell to half an hour—the middle of the day is generally a slack time—the person would ant be there more them three or four minutes—this memorandum was left with me, it was not written in my presents, but handed to one—these figures on it are copied from my book—you cannot see the remains of these letters without a magnifying glass—I cannot say that the prisoner is the person I saw on either of those two occasions; there was nothing to call my attention to him—I think it was the tame person on both occasions.</p>

Arnold, Charing Cross Hotel—I particularly noticed him, because he was anxious to know if he could get the money at a moment's notice, which is a very unusual thing for depositors—I told him he could not have it till the expiration of fourteen days—he appeared to accede to the terms, and handed me 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and eighty sovereigns—I handed the notes to Mr. Ryan, a dark whose duty it was to enter them in a book—I issue the papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for the infor<lb/>mation of persons wanting to deposit—It is not a special form for one bank—I have no doubt this is one of our forms, but "Union Bank of London" has been torn off—I thought Charing Cross Hotel rather a vague address, and asked the prisoner whether he was employed there; he said no, he put up there when he came to London—I gave him the usual deposit receipt—we require no reference from depositors.</p>

On 10th August, a draft for 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was uttered at Sheffield, do you know anything at all about it?"—he said "No, I know nothing about it"—I said, "Perhaps you will give us your name?"—he said "Yes, my name is Spinelli, and I live in Norfolk Street, Strand"—I said "Did you, on 18th August, deposit in the Union Bank, Pall Mall, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said, "No, I have no money in any bank"—Haydon said "Perhaps you will have no objec<lb/>tion to go into the bank with us?—he said "Certainly not, I will go"—he and I walked together to Pall Mall, and on the road he said "How far is the Union Bank; I don't know it?"—when we arrived I saw Mr. Jones, and said "I have called with this gentleman respecting the deposit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 18th August"—Mr. Jones looked at him, and said to me, "Yes, I have a very strong belief that that is the man who deposited the money"—I then told the prisoner to consider himself in custody; he made no reply—Sergeant Haydon searched him—he asked his name; he said he should not give it till he saw the American Consul—I told him his name was Spinelli, but he would not have that name—I went on the same day to the Belle Vue Hotel, to a room which the head waiter showed me on the ground floor, and received this portmanteau and other things from the landlord—I opened it with a key, which Haydon took from the prisoner at the station, and found in it, among other things, two bottles, a brush, a sheet of glass, and between the leaves of a book was this draft on Rothschild's.</p>

I am in the service of James Howe, chemical apparatus maker, of 2, Foster Lane, City, I have a particular knowledge of chemistry—I have examined these two bottles, this one contains hyperchloride of lime and several other things, the other contains hydrochloric acid, and this is powdered resin; this brush has been used with these substances—either of these ingredients will remove ink marks from paper—It is best to use one first, and give a finishing touch with the other; it requires a little manoeuvring to do it well—a piece of glass would be useful to support the paper, which must be laid on something smooth—I have used it myself, and taken marks out of paper with it—I have seen this draft for 382<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and under the thick writing, I can trace some faint letters, which I have developed with gallic and tannic acid, which supposing it had been submitted to these solutions, would develope the parts where the iron from the ink remained—after I had done that, I saw the letters "W and "G" faintly appear, and part of the "E" in Esqre., and the "£" where the writing would be 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and part of the "d" in "pound, "and the "f" in "fourteen"—I could trace no letters on this plain form of Messrs.

I did not let him in; he gave me no name—he asked if Mr. Spinelli was in; I said "Yes, "and asked him to step into the little room—I have never seen him before or since—I did not hear who he was—my impression was that they were going to weigh the chain—they were not potatoe scales, nor letter scales—Mrs. Culverwell is not here; she is unwell—I cannot tell you how long the gentleman stayed; I did not see him go away—I cannot tell whether he brought anything—he was not a dark man, and I have not said that he was—a dark man came to dinner with Spinelli one night, but he was not like him—those were the only two visitors—no one came from the firm of Spinelli &amp; Co.—I do not know what the prisoner is—I never knew of his business transactions—he said that he came from America, but did not say when, or what for, or where he was going—I cannot give you any information about the person with the scales, except that he was like Mr. Spinelli—he had light hair and a full beard and moustache—I should know him directly if I saw him again, but I should not be likely to mistake him for the prisoner—by like, I mean the same complexion and hair—there was nothing wonderful about it—we charge 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day, and if a man does not dine we deduct 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the end of the bill—I simply put down how many times he did not dine—I have no independent memory; I cannot say without looking at the book—we do not charge a man with dinner if he comes in and has a bottle of Medoc; here is "14th, Spinelli returned after dinner"—he slept in the hotel that night, because we have charged his breakfast in the morning—we should not deduct breakfast if he did not have it—the chambermaid is here—I</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">BY MR. BESLEY</hi>. We put down the numbers of the rooms occupied in the book, and we put against than the articles which the person has in the day—this is the number of persons in the house, and we make a note of those who do not dine—the prisoner never had a bottle of Medoc with cold meat, from first to last—he dined there on the days that I find wine charged against him, and independent of that, his number is down among the people in my book—there is an absence of any memorandum that he did not dine—he dined on the days I find his number down and Medoc charged—a gentleman from the prosecution has been several times to look at the books, and has examined them carefully—there was nothing unusual about the prisoner's conduct at the hotel; some gentlemen have no visitors—I received plenty of letters addressed in the name of Spinelli, in due course of post, which I delivered to the prisoner—some of them were from Spain—Mrs. Culver well has been requited to attend to-day, but she is unwell—It would be very rude if I were to cross-examine gentlemen leaving the hotel as to where they are going—the prisoner did not converse with me on the subject of his movements—assuming for a moment that I had only seen the prisoner once and the other man once, I might make a mistake between them; but I was familiar with the prisoner from having seen him many times—they resembled one another closely.</p>

I am chambermaid at the Hotel Belle Vue, 21, Norfolk Street—I know the prisoner as a visitor there—on 25th August, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I went into his room to sweep it, and found him lying full length upon the bed, dressed—he spoke to me—I do not keep accounts if the right persons sleep there—he came at first with a portmanteau, a hat box, and a small satchel, a thing which is worn with a strap over the shoulders—I did not see that when he was taken in custody—I did not see that canvas bag when he came to the hotel—it was not with his luggage.</p>

               <p>chambermaid there from 30th July to 18th October—there was no night-porter while I was there, but the waiter sat up one night and the porter the next, to let people in—the prisoner generally used to be on the bed all day, dressed, but I remember it was the 25th August, because it was the day I done the room—I have often seen him on the bed, fully dressed—I do the room every week—I was not asked whether I could remember the 25th August; I was asked whether I saw Mr. Spinelli—after he returned he was removed from No. 16 to No. 33.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe on several occasions his bed was not slept in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, he used to lie on it, more than sleep in it—I used to make it every morning, and again at 5.30, while dinner was going on—I have seen six or seven times that the bed has not been slept in—he did not tell me when he left the hotel where he was going, he used to say that he was going away for two or three days, but he never said where—when he came back, he did not tell me where he had been, or what he had been doing—his portmanteau has always been locked when we have gone to move it—I never saw it open—I last saw his satchel about the middle of August—I do not book the times when people sleep at the hotel—I cannot recollect any particular night that persons slept there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">BY MR. BESLEY</hi>. I went there on 30th July, and the prisoner left for a day only, twice or three times after I went there—I had no conversation with him when he was going—when he returned on the 16th, I said that I did not expect him so soon, and his carpets were up—Saturday was, I think, the day for cleaning his room—it was about five days before he was taken in custody that I saw him on the bed, a Sunday had intervened, as he was taken on a Monday—his bed was not slept in six or seven times—he always used to lie on it, but he has slept in it—it used not to be in the same state in the morning as it was at 5.30, he had laid on it, which had altered its appearance—he was never absent at nights, to my knowledge—on no occasion when he has been charged for being at the hotel, have I found that his room had not been used, because there was always the appearance of his having washed and used the room.</p>

Coutta', and had a conversation with them, and on the 1st September I went to the defendant's office, at 8, Gracechurch Street—I found "Emigration Agency" up on the door—I went several times between the 1st and the 18th, and then I found that "Emigration Agency" had been painted out, and "Society for the Relief of the Sick and Wounded in the War" in its place—I saw the defendant on 1st September—I asked him if his name was Whellams, and he said "Yes"—I asked if he was the person whose name appeared on the boxes—he said "Yes"—I asked him what security the public had to know that the moneys that were put into those boxes were properly applied for the purposes of the charity—he said he himself was the security—I said "What security can you give yourself; would it not be better to have a committee of three gentlemen, say, an English gentleman, a French gentle-man, and a German gentleman, to come and attend the opening of the boxes at night, to see that all was right?"—he said I was exceedingly im<lb/>pertinent, to make these remarks, and that be acted under the authority of the Society, at 2, St. Martin's Place, and he showed me two papers in</p>

               <p>proof; one was a blank paper, marked with a red cross at the top, and was a subscription lift for the Society in aid of the Sick and Wounded, and the committee set out—he said I was very impertinent, and if I did not go out I should get a kick—that was all that passed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the boxes I referred to; but the first box I saw had not got the name of the collector on it—in other respects it was the same sort of her—I had seen the boxes carried about by boys—between the 24th August and 18th October I suppose I saw between 400 and 500, or 300 and 400—on 18th October I went and saw the prisoner again; he case out of his office, and spoke to me on the landing—I said I had come for the same purpose as before, I wanted information—he ceiled me a meddling, impertinent fellow, and he referred me to the National Society, and to Coutts bank, for information—I told him I had been there, and I was referred back to him—he said he had no information to give me, and if I did not leave the premises, he would order the porter to remove me by force—he called on a friend of his, who he said was Colonel Dowling, who also threatened to kick me—he introduced him to me as "My friend, Colonel Dowling"—he was down stairs, and he lifted his foot—he called on the porter to remove me, and I was kicked down three steps by the porter—I had subscribed to these boxes—I told the prisoner so on 1st September, and I subscribed afterwards, several times, and I mentioned that on 18th October.</p>

Rugby &amp; Co., brush makers—from a letter I saw in the <hi rend="italic">Standard,</hi> I went to the defendant's premises in Gracechurch Street, on 24th October, about 6 o'clock in the evening—I saw the prisoner and two other persons—I asked which was Mr. Whellams, and the prisoner nodded—I said I had come there, seeing an advertisement in the newspaper, and I wished to be present at the examination of the boxes—the prisoner said he was quite ready to assist the public in the ex<lb/>amination; he was only too glad for anyone to go; he only wished more would go—he opened his ledger and referred to the amounts, which was in pounds, shillings and pence, and then he produced some small books to correspond; and he gave me every facility for examining the books—ap<lb/>parently the ledger agreed with the books—I saw some boxes there—the prisoner regretted that I was not early enough to see the boxes opened—I said I had come expressly for that purpose, and I said "I turned round your doorway just as the clock struck 6; it is too bad; your clock is too fast"—he said he was very sorry, and if I went the next evening I should see it, but I did not go.</p>

               <p>if she had it, she said "No"—I said I should not loose her till she gave it up—the policeman came up, and she was given in charge.</p>

I am the prosecutor's wife—I heard my husband calling his brother Bill—I heard his brother open the street door, and saw him holding the prisoner with one hand, and trying to pull his brother up with the other—as I was helping my husband into the parlour, the watch fell into my hand out of his clothes—I can't tell where it fell from—it fell from the side where the watch-pocket was—there was no chain on the watch—that was gone.</p>
