                  </hi> (382<hi rend="italic">A</hi>). In consequence of a complaint on the early morning of December 19th, I went to a lodging-house in Monk Street—I saw the prisoner there in bed—Sanger was with me—he said in the prisoner's presence, "This is the man who stabbed my brother-in-law"—the prisoner said, "No, I had a fight with the man, but I did not stab him. I was standing at the lodging-house in Monk Street, when I was struck by a man. I got up, and I fought the man"—I have not got a note of the conversation—he said it was an old grievance, and that he had no knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—I made an examination of the prosecutor on the early morning of December 19th—I found two clean cut wounds on the side of his head and one punctured wound on the.side of his neck about 1 in. long and 1 in. deep in a slanting direction—I stitched up the wound in his neck and one of the wounds in his head, the other was merely a scratch—he got quite well in about a week—the wounds were probably caused by some sharp instrument; the one on his head might have been caused by his falling or being thrown against a wall; one of them must have been caused by a sharp instrument—no permanent injury has been caused—he was sober.</p>

               <p>—about 4.30 p.m. on August 30th I was driving my van along the Cale<lb/>donian Road in the direction of Albion Street—outside a public-house there I saw four men in deep conversation—I saw an old gentleman walking along the road—the four men followed him down—my van got close up to the old gentleman, and I saw Barrett (<hi rend="italic">See Sessions Paper, Vol. CXXX., page</hi> 923) separate from the others—he ran behind my van, then ran across the road in front of it, and came in front of the old gentleman—Grande made a signal with his left arm for Barrett to do something to the old gentleman—Barrett made a snatch at the old gentleman's chain, and hit him under the chin with his other hand; then the other three rushed upon him and hustled him, and threw him down, with his legs in the gutter and his head on the pavement—I shouted out, "Oh, you brutes!" and jumped off my van—one of the men said to the deceased, "Mind where you are going to"—then they all four ran round a public-house on the other side—I picked the old gentleman up—he had a wound on the back of his head—I tied my handkerchief round his head, and called for assistance—part of his watch-chain was in his pocket, and part not—I picked Thompson out at the Police-court, but at the Police-station I failed to identify him—I was examined here last October, when the other men, Barrett, Grande, and Jones, were tried, and convicted—I say now that the prisoner is the fourth man.</p>

I live at 11, Poland Street, Oxford Street—I am interpreter to the North and South London Sessions—I acted as interpreter at the trial of Isaac Benfield on November 24th—I administered the oath to the prisoner, who was a witness, and the prosecutor—Yanofsky and Goldsteen or Goldschmidt were witnesses for the defence—the prisoner was present during their evidence—I interpreted their evidence from the Yiddish, which the prisoner understood—in the prisoner's presence I heard Yanofsky say that on Sunday, November 12th, Pozner and Gold<lb/>schmidt were playing at cards with him in a room at 95, Jubilee Street; that a man named Harris came in, and the prisoner said, "How are you going on, Harris?" that Harris replied, "I have sold the wax, but I have not got the money for it yet"—after that evidence Pozner was recalled by the Judge's direction, and asked whether he had heard what the two witnesses had said—Goldschmidt spoke in English—I explained the evidence to the witness—he replied, "It is an absolute lie"—he said he did hear it—he took a cheque-book out of his pocket and said, "I will give £100 to anyone who ever saw me playing at cards in 95, Jubilee Street with them at any time"—the prisoner was asked whether he had given at any time authority to Harris to sell his wax, and he said, "No."</p>

The third asked Detective Gill to find Mr. Nathan, of whom he said he bought the goods; and a fourth letter, dated January 6th, 1900, asked Gill to let him have all his private papers, and to find the cabman who brought the goods to the station.</hi>) The cabman is here—the only watch which was found was a silver one, which Smaltzman has got.</p>

I live at 12, Downshall Road, Stratford New Town—I went through the form of marriage with the prisoner on March 10th, 1889, at St. James the Great, Bethnal Green—this is a copy of the certificate—he told me he was single, and I believed him—in 1893 he and I went to Colchester, where I saw a man named Thomas Hunt—the prisoner said that Hunt was his step-brother—Hunt told me that the prisoner's name was Hunt, not Hammond, and that he was his own brother, and that the prisoner had a wife living—he said that in the prisoner's presence, and he did not deny it—the brother asked whether I could alter my marriage lines, because he thought his brother's first wife was married again, and that they would both be brought up for bigamy—I lived with the prisoner 12 months before I married him—my child was not born till October 10th—we all thought I ought to marry him—he has treated me very kindly—he started the prosecution himself—the woman he was cohabiting with after he married me took the prosecution up.</p>

I was not the one who set fire to the place, so I am not going to say anything about that"—they were taken to the Police-station, where they were placed among some other lads, and Chessell, the little boy, picked out Lane, Wood, and and another man—Lane had some keys, and said, "I found them some time ago"—Wood, after being charged, said, "I want to speak the truth; you have got an innocent man here" (that was referring to the other man); "I shall make a confession altogether to-morrow before the Magistrate"—I was called into the waiting-room by the prisoners; they all said, "Alexander," the fourth man who was arrested, "is innocent; he was not there; he had nothing at all to do with it; we were the only ones there."</p>
