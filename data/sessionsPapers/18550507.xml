On 7th April, about 8 o'clock in the evening, Barnes was brought to the hospital—I found a small wound on the left cheek, just below the left lower eyelid—both the lids of the right eye were enormously swollen—there was no cut or wound there—there was no appearance of the injury to the right eye being inflicted with a sharp instrument—I could not then get a sight of</p>

               <p>the right eye, the lids being so intensely swollen—as far as I could ascer<lb/>tain, the eye was in the socket—she had lost the sight of that eye when she left the hospital—I believe she is not likely to recover her sight—the eye appeared to have sustained some internal rupture, which caused very intense inflammation—I do not attribute that to the wound on the left eye—that was a small, irregular, punctured wound—it appeared to hare been done by some pointed instrument—it might have been done by an instrument like this knife—the point may have been turned on the bone—the wound was close on the orbit—it was beyond the bone, into the orbit, for about half an inch, or rather more—the nose was not cut—it might so happen that the knife may have caught one eye while she was striking the other.</p>

It is my duty to make out these sheets—I did not write the names in these sheets of 31st March and 16th April, but I filled in the whole of the charges—I know that the prisoner went out with the pack<lb/>ages on those days—it appears by the paper that he was to receive 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for seven empty packages to be delivered to Mr. Myers, on the 31st—I think the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was in three sums, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on one sheets 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on another, and another amount of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

That he did not receive it; another clerk made some of these entries, he is not here, but I examined the whole of the entries—this "Not on," in blue ink, was written by the last witness—I wrote this "C 29, 323," on the same morning, or the following morning—I have been in the Company's service six months; the prisoner was there when I went.</p>

On Friday evening, 27th April, I saw the prisoner in a field near the line, minding birds—I saw him there for some time before the arrival of the train—I did not see him on the line at all—he was playing about in the field close to the line—I should say I did not see him nearer than a dozen yards to the line—I afterwards picked up the chair off the line—I had seen the prisoner a dozen yards or more from that place—Dixon beckoned to me, and told me to take the thing off the line, and I did so directly—it lay quite upon the line, with the broken part towards Windsor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and live at Weedon, in the county of Bucks. On Sunday evening, 29th April, I was at Hillingdon—I had a cart, and a hamper in it, containing ten dead ducks—about half past 10 o'clock the cart was standing in front of the Standard public house—I went to it, saw some straw littered about, and missed nine ducks out of the hamper—I had left the hamper secure, tied with a string—I found the string broken or cut—I gave information to the police—I was shown the ducks next day by the policeman—they were the same that had been safe in my cart the night before—they are not here.</p>

On Sunday evening, 1st April, Hart came into my parlour, and staid there about half an hour—he then went up stairs to his own room—about three minutes afterwards I heard the cries of "Murder! George, come up; I am being murdered"—I proceeded to the parlour door, and before I could open it Mr. Evans was partly up stairs—I saw the prisoner come down, with his nose bleeding—Evans came down for a light—before he could get the light Hart came down, and said to me, "George, see what the villain has done"—I said, "What is to be done with him?"—he said, "Lock him up"—I then fetched an officer—Hart had a large wound over his left eye—Dean said that Hart</p>

I first saw Hart on the night in question, about a quarter past 10 o'clock, in Mr. Watkins's shop—about 12 o'clock he came up to my room, and asked me to get him a light—I said I had no light, and had not the means of getting one—he said, "I will have a light," and told me to go to my b——fellow and get one—I said I would not do so—he said, "I will bring the fellow in front of your face"—he brought the prisoner to the door—the prisoner went back in<lb/>stantly—I was undressed—I followed them, and saw Hart strike Dean several times, making use of a bad word—Dean said, "Hart, do you mean it? do you mean it?" and with that they fought, not many moments—I returned back to my room, and put on some garments—they were then fighting—I saw the prisoner strike him with something; it was not the back of a chair—he had too good a light in the room for me not to see—it was something much smaller than the back of a chair—there was a very good fire in the room, so that I could see plainly—Hart then came out on the landing, and called to Mr. Watkins, "George, bring a light; here is a b—game"—no cries of murder were uttered at all—Hart stopped till the light was brought up—he then went down stairs—the prisoner had partly got down, and he was given in charge.</p>

I was house surgeon at King's College hospital on Monday morning, 2nd April, when the deceased was brought there about 1 o'clock—he had a lacerated wound over the left eye, about three inches in length, and he was in a confused, excited state—I dressed the wound, and I saw him two or three times during the week; the wound at first got on well—on the Saturday morning I saw that he had erysipelas, and I immediately admitted him into the hospital—the erysipelas got worse, and he died on the following Friday, the 13th—the cause of death was the erysipelas produced by the wound.</p>

On 10th April, I was at the Castle public house in the City-road, kept by Mr. Hill—there had previously been a fight between two of our men, but we did not know it—one of them had a cut under his eye as big as a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.-piece—it was in the tap room—the deceased, Joseph Towers, came in to serve beer, and when he saw the man that was cut, who was an Irishman, he said, "That is the way of you Irish lads, when you see your own blood you begin to cry; you should not do that; cheer up, it will be all right by-and-by"—it was said in a good-tempered manner; not in an insulting manner—the room was full, and there were plenty of Irishmen there—the prisoner said, "What did the old b——say?" and he followed Towers out—I remained in the room—the prisoner returned in about three minutes—I said to him, "You did not strike the old man, <hi rend="italic">Bill.</hi> I hope;" he made no answer—I said, "Because he is an old man, and old men will have their ways; if he comes in again do not say anything to him, and don't strike him"—the prisoner said, "I won't, sergeant," and I believe he said sideways, as he turned his head, "By Christ, it is done already"—I afterwards went out to dinner—I saw a quantity of blood on the pavement outside the side door in Castle-street, and some in the road—I did not see the deceased—the prisoner was sober—I was present when he was taken into custody by the police on the Saturday following, at our head quarters, in the City road—he wanted to know what he was taken for; I said, "It is for the old man, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—he said he knew nothing of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Broom, a farmer, at Hampton. On 27th March, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I put two of his horses under a shed in his meadow—one was a dark bay horse, with a long tail reaching near to the ground—it was three years old—it had a long mane, and it had a mark in the side where it had been rubbed with the shaft—the next morning, about 5 o'clock, I missed that horse—I went round the meadow, and could not find it—I went and told my master—I then went and tracked the horse along the lane up to the Swan Inn, at Hanworth, which is a distance of a mile and a half, or from that to two miles—I traced it along by the hedge in the grass in the lane, till I got opposite Mr. Sibley's—when I got to the end of the lane, I traced it along the high-road—the horse had been rough shod—the ground was hard on the gravel road—it was not hard from frost—there was not any snow—I saw the horse again on 5th April, in Mr. Western's stable, at the Duke of Clarence—it had been altered—his tail had been polled and his mane had been polled, and he was trimmed up about the head—his tail was shortened about one half—I did not notice anything else which had been done to it—I recognized the horse.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business with my father, Solomon Harris, at No. 195, St. George-street, St. George's, as outfitters—we keep a good many men—last Saturday week the prisoner purchased a pair of trowsers for 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a waistcoat for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was to pay for them when he was paid off at Green's home, in three or four days—that is one of the usual places to pay sailors—before the day on which he was to be paid off, we lent him sums of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time, amounting to 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave him a bill of the 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the price of the clothes—I saw him before he went to Green's home to receive his money, and he said, "I have not got any money," and he borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay his expenses down, it being at Blackwall, and about three miles off by railway—I saw him down to Green's home, but did not get my money—I was present, and saw him pay some money to a girl, and to Mr. Pike—I afterwards went with him to our shop, into the back room—I asked him to pay for my clothes—he said that he had no money—then he said he had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Wells-street Sailors' Home—I did not believe him, and persuaded him to pull off the trowsers and waistcoat—he said first that he would, then he said that he would not—I asked him whether he had any money—he said that he had none about him, and said, "You can search me, but I have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Wells-street Sailors' Home"—I then called the foreman, and saw him put his hands down him—he threw his arms up, and said, "You can search me if you like"—I persuaded him to pull off the trowsers, supplied him with an old pair of canvass ones, and then went out to attend to my horse in the street—when I came back the trowsers were off and the other ones were on—the waistcoat was on the table—I saw that taken off, but not the trowsers—I heard no money when the waistcoat was</p>

On Thursday night, May 3rd, the prisoner and three other men with a cart of luggage, came to my house just before 9 o'clock—the prisoner hired a lodging for himself and three more men—the luggage was taken into the kitchen; it was a bed, three chests, and two bags—one chest belonged to one of the other men, and there was one which the prisoner said was his—he was going to break it open that evening, and I asked him why he was going to do so; he said, "Because I want a clean shirt"—I lent him a hammer and a poker to break it open, but his shipmate said, "Harry, do not break it open now, let us go and get the key"—the carter said that if they did not pay him, he would get them into trouble—he said, "It is not your own chest, I will get you into trouble; if you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> me, I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you"—shortly after I told him not to break it open, they both went out of the house, the prisoner saying that he was gone for the key—he did not come back till next morning between 9 and 10 o'clock, when he asked me for a hammer, and went and got the poker, and broke it open—he gave me three shirts to wash, which I gave to the constable—he took a pair of boots out and said, "You shall have some more things to wash another day," and he took some more things out, and put them in again in my presence—my husband reported it at the police office; a constable came, and I showed the chest to him, and gave him the shirts—I did not see the prosecutor till the Friday morning; he then saw the chest, and owned the shirts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant, in the employment of Messrs. Swan and Edgar, the silk mercers, of Piccadilly; I have been in their em<lb/>ployment about ten years; I reside in the house. On 24th April I supped with the rest of the establishment, at my employer's house—I went out after supper, at about a quarter to 10 o'clock—I had been employed in the house the whole day—I had written a letter in the evening, which I went out to post—according to the rules of the house we are obliged to be in at 11 o'clock—I proceeded up Piccadilly, and posted my letter at De Castro's, the grocer's, nearly opposite St. James's-street—I then strolled on to Hyde<lb/>park; it was a fine night—I went in at the Hyde-park Corner gate, adjoin<lb/>ing Apsley House, and walked across the open part of the park towards Bayswater—I then turned round; I had then got about three parts across the park—I turned in the direction of Stanhope Gate—when I was about 400 yards from the gate the prisoner accosted me, by asking the way to the Duke of Wellington's statue—I directed him—I pointed, and told him that was the way—he left me soon after that, and a tall gentleman passed down the broad walk towards the Marble Arch, and the prisoner put the name question to him, and followed him a little way, and then turned round, came up to me again, and asked was I sure that was the way—I told him it was—he followed me on still, and he said it was much warmer—I said, yes, it was—he then came near me, and pushed up against me, and said the trees were budding out—I said, yes, they were—he still kept near me, and when we had gone some distance, twenty or thirty yards farther on, he asked me if I had any money—I made him no answer, and further on he asked me if I would give him something to drink—I made him no answer to that—we were then, perhaps, twenty yards from the sailing which sepa<lb/>rates the path from the rest of the park, and about forty yards from the outside railings of the park and the gate—when we got to the gate it was closed; the park keeper was there and opened it—on the oath I have taken nothing had taken place between the prisoner and myself down to the time of my leaving the park by that gate—when the gate was opened we both went out—about the middle of the road the prisoner seized my collar, and said he would serve me out—I pushed him from me, and he let go of my collar—he followed me across the road, and I said, "I will soon settle this; a policeman will be up;" or, "with a policeman"—I am not sure which were the words—I waited at the corner of Stanhope-street for about ten minutes, no policeman came, and I said, "I am going towards Piccadilly, no</p>

               <p>doubt we shall meet one"—we had gone about twenty or thirty yards when we met a policeman, and as soon as the prisoner saw the policeman he again seized my collar—I then said to the policeman, "I wish this case investi<lb/>gated," and the prisoner at once said, "I give this man in charge"—the policeman asked him for why, and he said it was something private, he would explain it—the policeman said he could not take me in charge unless he gave the reason, and the prisoner then stated that I had taken him round the waist and kissed him, and took hold of his person, and tried to put my hand in his breeches—we then went on to the station house, and he made a similar statement there—I attempted to speak several times—I said it was false, and began to explain it to the inspector, and he wished me not to say anything—he said he could not hear what I had to say, or I had better not say anything—he said he must detain me—I said, "Not on the word of a man like that"—he said, "Why a man in his habiliments, if he makes a charge like that, I am bound to detain you"—he said I must be locked up, and detained for the night—I wished him to send for my employer, Mr. Hope, of No. 45, Regent-street; that is his private house—I gave my own name and address, Robert Bendall, 51, Regent-street—I was detained at the station house that night, and taken before the Magistrate the following morning—the prisoner did not appear, and I was discharged—I heard Inspector Webb give him directions at the station house, over<lb/>night, as to where he was to come on the following day—it was given in writing—the prisoner was dressed in livery—I had never seen him before.</p>

               <p>detain me here all night," and asked me to send to Regent-street, to his employers, which I did—I told him that the matter would be investigated in the morning, and if the servant had done wrong, he would be punished—he was detained and taken to the police court in the morning, and kept in custody until a quarter to 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before we go to the next day, did Bendall wish to make a statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said that Richards had asked him for something to drink—I told him that he had better reserve what he had to say; I must detain him on the charge that was made—he said, "Very well"—he was quite sober, but excited—10 o'clock was the hour appointed—I wrote on a piece of paper as distinctly as I could, "Be at Great Marlborough-street police court, at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, Wednesday the 26th"—we waited until a quarter to 12 o'clock; the prisoner did not appear, and Bendall was dis<lb/>charged—Mr. Wontner was then in attendance on behalf of Bendall—about a quarter to 3 o'clock that afternoon, I went to Eaton-square—I found the prisoner standing at the steps of No, 52, Eaton-square; a car<lb/>riage was waiting at the door, and he was apparently in readiness to go away with the carriage—I was in private clothes—I asked him if he knew me—he said, "No; I don't remember you, but I know that fellow," looking at Bendall who was with me—I said, "You did not attend the police court this morning"—he said, "I know I did not"—I said, "This party, Ben<lb/>dall, now prefers a charge against you for having endeavoured to extort money from him last night, by your accusing him of having committed an indecent assault upon you"—he asked me to walk inside, and to be allowed to speak to his master—I went in, and when before his master, he said the reason he did not attend the police court was, because it would have either interfered with his master's business, or with his business: I will not be certain which; and he was anxious to avoid bringing his master's name in question—I then brought him away—he was in livery—I allowed him first to change his dress—on the way to the station he appeared anxious to have conversation with Bendall, which I prevented; he continued addressing himself to Bendall—when in Grosvenor-place he said he thought Bendall would have been satisfied with being locked up all night; that there the matter would have ended, and that he (Bendall) might have thought himself lucky to have got off so easily—I cannot say what it was he said to Bendall, he wished to have some conversation, but I kept one on my left, and the other on the right, and would not allow it; he kept muttering to himself—whenever I found he was about to speak I prevented it, I would not allow any conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he mention where his wife lived, at the station, on the night when he made the charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I understood him No. 2—I did not go or send there—I have made inquiries, and was satisfied that his wife lived at No. 12—I would not say for a certainty that he said No. 2, or 12; but I understood him to say 2—I was under the impression that he had been drinking, but not until he appeared confused; at first I was not—he made his statement to me in the most positive and direct manner, without any hesitation, and I was very particular with him—I would not say positively that he was in liquor, I was under that impression from his face being red, and altogether.</p>

               <p>the butler, and that the butler had advised him not to have anything more to do with it; that the man would be discharged, and he would hear nothing more about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he did say something with reference to the butler, but I prevented him, and I also prevented Bendall when he came in—I did not want them to get into an argument, in case something should ooze out—he did say something about the butler, it might have been what you suggest; I do not exactly recollect what it was, I cannot carry it in my mind—if any conversation took place, it must have been when he was changing his clothes in the pantry—I should think it was said with refer<lb/>ence to his not appearing at the police court, but I could not say with certainty.</p>

I was on duty on the night of 24th April—the gate is closed at 10 o'clock—we do not let any in after that, we allow persons to leave, up to half past 10 o'clock—I open the gate for them—I remember two persons leaving the park by that gate on the night in question, from 10 minutes to a quarter after 10 o'clock—I opened the gate for them to go out—one of them was in livery—I should not have recognised Mr. Bendall as one of the persons if he had not come to me—neither of them spoke to me as they went out—after they had gone through the gate, I saw the servant lay his hand upon the gentleman's shoulder, and walk on the opposite side of the road; there was a carriage passing at the time—it was in the centre of the road that he first put his hand upon him—they were nearer to the park than the car<lb/>riage was—when the carriage passed, they went on the opposite side of Park-lane—I saw them there for five or ten minutes, and then lost sight of them.</p>

On 21st April, my father was not in town; he had been away from home about a month—I left the house about half-past 8 o'clock that evening; the shop was then shut up—I had been in the parlour; the front room, first floor—there was no fire in the grate when I left that room, nor any candle burning; the room is lighted by two jets of gas—before leaving the room, I screwed them down very low, but still alight—after putting on my coat and hat, I called up stairs for the servant, and receiving no answer, I rang the parlour bell; I got no answer, and again called up the stairs loudly, and getting no answer, I again rang the bell very loudly; I got no reply—I then proceeded to walk up stairs, to see why it was I got no answer—when I got to the second floor, I heard footsteps above, which I supposed to be the footstep of the prisoner—I did not see her—I called her by name, and she replied, "Yes, Sir"—I informed her that I was going to the railway, and to tell my father so if he called in my absence—there were three children in the house at the time I left it; two nieces of mine and a nephew—their names were, Alexander, about seven years of age, Ellen, about five, and Elizabeth, about two; their surname is Lapsley—I did not return until after 10 o'clock—when I left, there were no clothes scattered about the front room—there was a large chest of drawers, between the two windows in front; some of the things in those drawers belonged to me—in one drawer my father kept a number of his keys, and one of them was the key of his bed room—there was a chest on the right hand side of the door, on entering the room opposite one of the windows; it was an unusually large chest, two feet deep, and, perhaps, nearly five feet long, and two feet broad—on the Monday, I made, with my father, an examination of a bundle of linen that was produced; they were muslins and other kinds of goods; some shawl borders—partly wearing apparel, and partly what may be termed goods—some portion of them I noticed had candle grease upon them; a few drops such as would be made by the droppings from a candle—one portion seemed very like the remains of a candle; the bottom of a candle, with a portion of a wick in it—the clothes were stained; I could not form an opinion what with—we did not keep chemicals in that room—there was the remains of a burnt newspaper lying flat on the floor—I noticed the floor in front of the chest, when the bundle was removed; it was burnt in two or three different places.</p>

               <p>day after the General Fast—before I left, I locked up every place that had lock and key, in my bed room, and deposited the keys in a little drawer in my secretaire there—I then locked my bed room, and locked the key of my bed room in the upper drawer of a chest of drawers, standing in my sitting room—I locked that drawer, and put the key of it into the pocket of my portmanteau, where it still remains—the chest was full—it contained a great many pairs of blankets, from a dozen to twenty; more than one, and fewer than the other—sheets in proportion, a great number; I do not know how many—it was a very large chest—there were pillow slips, bolster slips in proportion; a very great number—counterpanes of a variety of kinds—a variety of damask table cloths and napkins, and all connected with bed and table, household linen of all kinds—the chest was full; it was locked, and the key was locked in my bed room with the other keys—I returned home on Saturday, 21st April—I think the train arrived at Euston-square precisely at half-past 8 o'clock, and I took a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> and came direct to my house; it was, as near as possible, 9 o'clock, when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped at the door—after getting out the luggage, and paying the <hi rend="italic">cabman.</hi> I rang the bell; I rang it again, and rang three or four times; no answer was made—I then asked the next door neighbour, Mrs. Davis, to receive my luggage, and I went to a coffee house, and had a cup of coffee—I went back again between twenty minutes and half an hour, and I scarcely knew my own premises—I found a policeman at the door, who refused me admittance—he said there had been a fire in the house, and until I was identified, I was not admitted—when I was admitted, I went up stairs to the sitting room, on the first floor; I found a crowd of persons surrounding a parcel, which was lying on the floor, and which showed evidence of burning; it had been extinguished—my look at them was but slight at first; I examined them fully afterwards—I saw sufficient to show that they came from lock fast places, from my own drawers; it was my property which had been taken from lock fast places—I immediately inquired for my servant; I was told that she was next door—I ultimately found her coming back again to my house, just by the door; I pushed her in, and told the policeman not to let her escape—I told her to go up stairs with me into the sitting room, and pointing to the bundle on the floor, I desired her to explain it; she professed inability to explain it—I said she must explain it, as she knew well those things were out of the place, and I must have an explanation of how they came to be there; she still professed inability to explain it—the bundle was close to the chest—in the course of the evening, the inspector and I went over the house, and examined it—at the back of the drawers near the wall, we found a fracture—when the drawers were pulled away, the boards at the back were found to be loose; they were in such a state as would enable a person to take put the property that was in them—I saw some things found in the prisoner's bed room, in different places—the policeman brought from under the bed a sort of basket, containing a considerable portion of plate, consisting of silver sugar tongs, butter knives, fish slice, and so on; some German silver, but a number of them massive silver articles—I had left those things locked in one of my drawers, in my bed room—I should say I have lost altogether upwards of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property; a portion of it will be recoverable, but a large portion of it was consumed—the chest which I had left full, I found quite—after one of the examinations before the police, the prisoner sent for me—I went to her, and she professed to make an explanation, but told thing that we did not know before—she told me that she had pawned all the goods, which were at Grant's and Russell's.</p>

On Saturday night, 21st April, Mr. Smith came to my house, and left his luggage there—between ten minutes and a quarter of an hour after<lb/>wards, the prisoner opened the shop door, merely put her head in, and asked if I had heard any one at their door; I said, "Yes, Mr. Smith has come home from the country"—she asked if I could tell her where he was gone to—she was speaking in great confusion—I said I could not, but he had left his luggage at our house—I did not go and see where she went to—I sat down for a little time longer in my room—the prisoner had no bonnet on when she came to me—in about ten minutes, or quarter of an hour at the outside, I heard the ring of the bell and a cry of "Fire"—I jumped up, and ran out into the street, and saw the policeman ringing Mr. Smith's bell—I saw a great light in the first-floor window, and smoke coming out of the second floor—I said something to the policeman, and he broke open the door, as I wished him.</p>

"I said, "They are all right; they have been taken away"—at that time there was no fire in the grate of that room—I went down stairs to the first floor where the fire was—when we first west into the room, the things that had been on fire appeared like the contents of a drawer that had been shot out, and when we came to look, we found they had been placed on a wrapper, or something on the floor—it appeared like a piece of glazed calico—while we were turning the things over, Mr. Smith came in—a policeman came up stairs and said there were sparks coming from the top of the house—I went to the top of the house, and I think Mr. Smith followed me—I found the prisoner in the top room; I did not see any one else—I saw a fire in the grate, and went into the back bed room, fetched a jug of water, and put it out—there were things burning in the grate, and on the hearthstone; they were remnants of socks and stockings, and I took off the fire two sets of false teeth, and a silver butter knife—the prisoner said they were some old rags, and she was going to light a fire—I took off the remains of a pair of stockings, dipped them in the water, and saw the letters E.

Williams was not one—I should think they went at ten miles an hour; as fast as they could—I saw nothing at all of Hooker—that is all I can tell you—I was anxious to get to my employ—Mr. Packman, one of the police, came to my place, and I told him what I had seen—it must have been about three weeks after when I first told about it—when the cart went away, it must have been about ten minutes before 6 o'clock—the chimes were going.</p>

Gosling's, in Fleet-street"—I asked him if he knew what the letter contained; he replied, "I knew it was for money"—he said he then took it to the bankers—I asked him if he ever read the newspapers—he said, "Yes;"—I asked him if ever he had read the canes where gentlemen's ser<lb/>vants had been sent with cheques; he said, "Yes"—I said, "There was Mr. Wrangham's servant, who was sent with a cheque a few day's back"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "That ought to have roused your suspicions, I think"—he said, "I did not think anything was wrong till I saw the bankers examining their books"—that was all that passed—I was at Mr. Mullens's chambers on 2nd April, when the prisoner was there—he was not in custody, he was liberated on bail—I was present when he made a statement to Mr. Mullens—I heard him describe the route by which he went from Onslow-square to the bankers—I have since that gone over that ground which he described—I was not present when it was measured—I asked the prisoner what he was to have for carrying that letter—he said he was not aware, he had made no agreement.</p>

               <p>when I received the money; I wanted to go to Capper and Waters, No. 26, Waterloo-place, and told him it was to order some skirts for myself; no one knew of my going there; I had never had my shirts made there before; he said, 'No, you had better not, the bank will be closed,' and he required the gold that evening to meet a large demand; I cannot tell the exact spot this conversation took place; it was oh the right hand side of the Circus, on the same side as the Haymarket, near the Spread Eagle; I left him there in the Circus; I cannot say which way he went; I recollect that he said he could not take the cheque himself, as he had a very particular appointment, which he must keep; he seemed to be in a very calm and collected way; I went from thence to the bank; I went along Coventry-street, and turned down and came to Trafalgar-square, and kept the left hand side up the Strand, through Temple-bar, then I crossed to No. 16, and found it was a hosier's shop; I then asked an old gentleman which was Messrs. Gosling's and Sharpe; ho told me it was a little further up, and pointed to the door; it happened to be three doors from where I inquired; the letter was directed to Messrs. Gosling's and Sharpe, No. 16, Fleet-street, City; the real number being 19 led me to inquire of the gentleman in the street; I got to Messrs. Gosling's and Sharpe about a quarter to 4 o'clock; I took it to the counter and presented it; I was told to take it in to an inner room; the letter was opened in my presence; my suspicions were aroused by the gentleman who opened the letter questioning me on two or three points; when Messrs. Gosling's and Co. asked me where I got the cheque, I told them it was given me by a person named Burguess, who said he was well-known to Mr. Borrow, No. 21, Onslow-square; I think that was all that passed, as near as I can recollect; when the party gave me the letter in the Circus he said, 'It is all right,' and mentioned, 'I am well known to Mr. Borrow, of Onslow-square;' I have a knowledge of Mr. Borrow, he dines with Mr. Burgess occasionally on his birthday; it was on the evening of the birthday party that Mr. Burgess was robbed; from the time of my leaving Mr. Vaughan till I got to Onslow-square I did not call anywhere, nor did I call anywhere from the time of my seeing the gentleman till he left me in the Circus; we walked as quick as we could, side by side, between the Circus and Messrs. Gosling's; I did not call anywhere; I decline to say what became of the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of the change I received from Mr. Vaughan; it is a private matter, and has nothing to do with this case.—Burguess: well look<lb/>ing, rather thin, genteel appearance; aged thirty, forty by appearance; height, five feet eight or nine, tall and upright in his carriage; complexion, lightish, no colour in his cheek, pale looking, but natural colour; hair did not observe, never saw him with his hat off; whiskers not at all bushy, dark (trimmed close) brown; moustache full, quite black, had all appearance of dye being used, as it did not correspond with his whiskers; features, regular, open countenance; dress—one of the evenings in question I met him with a frock coat; on the last occasion be had a sack over coat, very loose; always dark clothes, and buttoned up.—I have had conversation with the man on three occasions; besides this I have observed him in and about Cadogan-place, of an afternoon generally, between 3 and 5 o'clock; the time I am up in the dining room he has always been walking in Cadogan-place; I knew him by sight before the evening of 16th March, perhaps for a fortnight before we spoke; I suppose he had a slight knowledge of me by seeing me at the windows and door of Mr. Burgess' house, as when I met him on the first occasion I had on my livery hat; I recollect when he came up to me in the Brompton-road, he said, 'Adieu,' just the compliments of the day, and I</p>

               <p>recognised him as being the person who passed in and about Cadogan-place, but the conversation occurred about that."</p>

On 18th April, I saw the two prisoners at the back of the Warren, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—they walked up towards Mr. Fenton's, who is a farmer at Chingford—his house is close by the Warren—I saw the prisoners run after the fowls—one flew away; the other they chased, and Field knocked it down with a stick, and one of them, I think it was Field, picked it up, and carried it away in a handkerchief—they went away together up the road towards Chingford-green—I was about a quarter of a mile off.</p>

On the morning of 21st April I was sent for—I am employed on Mr. Mare's premises—the prisoner came, with a foreman, to the police office in the yard—I said to him, "How do you account for the gutta percha on your boots, there has been some lost?"—he said, "I took it from the shop"—I asked him if he had taken any more—he said he had taken one or two pieces, which were at home—I asked him, "From one shop?"—he said, "From the workshop"—I went to his house, and while I was searching a box in the corner of the room, containing some shoemaker's tools, I saw his wife standing close to another woman outside the door, in the act of passing something towards her in a bundle—I laid hold of the bundle, and found it to contain these pieces of gutta percha and four leather laces—I showed them to the store keeper, who said he believed them to be Mr. Mare's property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Goody, of No. 5, Ann-street, Plumstead, a turner. On Monday, 23rd April, about half past 6 o'clock in the evening, I went to the shop of Mr. Munday, a butcher, in Woolwich—my little boy, between five and six years old, was with me—I bought some meat outside the shop, and then went in to have it weighed—there was no<lb/>body in the shop then but Mr. Munday, but the prisoner followed in after me—I took out my purse, which contained half a sovereign, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, half a crown, one shilling, sixpence, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and a watch key, and laid it on the bench—the prisoner was then close to my left elbow, close to my purse—I had given Mr. Munday the money, and had the purse by the side of my basket—I did not keep my eye on the purse while I was giving Mr. Munday the money—he gave me a penny change, which I put into my pocket, took up my basket, and went out—when I got outside the door I missed my purse; I returned, and said, in the prisoner's presence, "Mr. Munday, you saw that I gave you the money out of my purse?—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have at this moment missed it"—he said, "Look about, and see if you have dropped it"—I turned to the prisoner and said, "Please, Ma'am, have you seen anything of it?"—she said, "No, Ma'am"—I said, "I have lost my purse"—she said, "I will swear Mr. Munday has never been from the scale"—I said, "Have you seen any one pass in or out of the shop?"—she said, "No; and I will swear Mr. Munday has never been from the drawer?"—she then went out. and I followed her, and found her on the kerb, by the side of Mr. Munday's window—she had a basket, which I believe had a lid to it—I said, "I mean no offence; did You see my purse?"—she said, "No, my good woman; I pity you"—I said, "It must rest between you and the butcher"—she said, did I accuse her of it—I said, "No; I do not say you took it, but I must see further into it"—she said, "If you come near me I will <hi rend="italic">smack</hi> your <hi rend="italic">chops</hi>; I will <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> you"—she eventually turned out her pocket, on my asking her, and there was nothing in it—nothing passed about her basket—a policeman came up, and I gave her into custody—as we went to the station my little boy gave me my purse—I did not examine it; I gave it to the policeman immediately—I afterwards saw it, and it contained the money I have stated—I can undertake to say that I did not take up the purse from the bench.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Marquis of Granby, in High-street, Woolwich. On Saturday, 7th April, the two prisoners came to my place together—Osmond called for a pot of beer—he tendered a shilling, my wife took it up and turned round, and handed it to me—it was bad—I bit a piece out of it—Osmond then pulled out a lot of halfpence, and was going to pay me, but a witness said, "There is a bad half crown amongst those coppers"—he took it out and handed it to me; I bit a piece out of that—I do not know that Osmond said anything, but some one who was there, said, "Here is another bad shilling"—I turned and saw another bad shilling, and I took and bit a piece out of that—I threw these pieces on the table, and when I found there were three pieces bad, I threw the whole of them into the fire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a groom, employed at the Crystal Palace stables. On 2nd Dec. I was in the service of Mr. Hugh Worthington Statham, of No. 16, Belmont-place, Wandsworth-road—on that evening I was at the Queen's Arms, in Nine Elms-lane—the prisoner came to me there about 10 o'clock—I knew him before—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, will you lend me the key of your stable for a minute? I have got a saddle and bridle at your stable door, and I want to leave it there"—I lent it to him, and he went out with it directly—he said he would bring it back in about five minutes—he did not come back—I waited for about a quarter of an hour, and then went round to the stable, which is in Lawn-lane, South Lambeth—I found the stable door pulled to—I pushed it open—it was dark—I felt in the stall, and the horse was gone—I struck a light, looked round, and found the key thrown just inside the door—the horse was my master's, and was worth about forty guineas—there was no saddle and bridle left in the stable—I went and made inquiries at the toll gate, and then informed my master about three quarters of an hour afterwards—I lost my situation in consequence of this, and left about a month afterwards, when my master was suited—I then worked on the South Western Railway, and then went to the Crystal Palace, and while I was there, on 20th April, I saw the prisoner there—he was employed with a great many more men that were taken on that day—I said nothing to him, but was turning round to go for a policeman, and the prisoner said, "For God's sake, don't go and get a policeman!"—I had not said a word to him about a policeman before that—I said I should go and fetch a policeman—he said, "For God's sake, don't! for I have seen Mr.</p>

               <p>Frail, and he has forgiven me, and I hope you will do the same; if you get a policeman they will send me to prison, and it will be the ruin of me"—Mr. Frail was the prisoner's master at that time—I did not know then that he was in Mr. Frail's service—I had not seen him for three months—I did not give him in charge, because he said he had seen Mr. Frail, and Mr. Frail had forgiven him, and he hoped I should forgive him; that he was sorry he had done it, and he could not think how he could be such a fool as to do it—my master got back the horse on the Tuesday evening following.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Merton-bridge, Wimbledon, Surrey, and am a linendraper. I have known the prisoner for many years as a person living in the neighbourhood—on 13th Sept. I had a gelding for sale—the prisoner called at my shop that morning, and asked me if I had sold my nag or cob—I said No, I had not, I did not care much about selling it, but I had had many applications about it, it was a horse that was very much admired—(the prisoner had been to me about three months before, and spoke about a gentleman wanting a horse)—he said, "Do you mean selling it?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "What will you take for it?"—I said, "30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said, "Will you?"—I said, "Yes"—I had been wanting 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he went away, came back, and said, "I have been down to Gibson, and there has been a gentleman's groom inquiring if I knew of a horse for sale answering the description of yours, and I think it will suit him"—I know Mr. Gibson; he is a veterinary surgeon, and has attended my hone—I asked the prisoner if he thought the horse would suit, because it was out at grass—he said, according to the statement the man gave, he thought it</p>

               <p>would suit to run in a four wheeled chaise—I said I could hardly spare the time to go for him, he was in the field—he said, "Send the boy for him"—I said, "He wants grooming"—he said, "I will give him a rub"—I sent my son for the horse, and it was groomed by the prisoner—he said, "I think the horse will do; the boy may as well put a stamp in his pocket, and then if the gentleman buys it, he can give him a receipt and bring you the money"—I said, "Do you think it is likely he will buy it?"—he said, "Yes, I think there is very little doubt about it"—I got a stamp, and the boy put it in his waistcoat pocket—I put the boy on the horse—I told him to take it to next to Lady Foster's, according to what the prisoner said, and not to part with it to any one but the gentleman—the prisoner said, when he got there the gentleman might very likely want to have him shown off a little in a dog cart, so the boy could give him a ride in the cart—the prisoner was to show him off in the dog cart, if required, but the boy was not to leave it at all—they came round to the front of the shop—I heard the boy say to the prisoner, "Where shall I meet you?"—he was going to <hi rend="italic">cut off</hi> in a hurry, boy like—what answer the prisoner made I do not know—he said the gentleman lived at the next house to Lady Foster's, where the horse had previously been for sale—they then went away—in two or three hours the boy returned without the horse or the money—I was vexed with him, and sent him back again—I afterwards gave information to the police—it was near upon three months before I saw the horse again—it was then in the possession of Mr. Charlton, of Brentford—it was given up to me in the presence of Mr. Barber—I never saw the prisoner again until he was brought before the Magistrate, one day last week.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Newington. On Saturday night, 15th April, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was going along Waterloo-road, near Granby-street, and saw the prisoner—she came up to me alone, but in three or four minutes, three men came up and knocked me down; they were all three upon me, and when I was down they kicked me on the jaw—while they were on me, I had the prisoner's hand in mine, with my watch in it, which had been in my waistcoat pocket, fastened by a metal chain, which I found broken—the men kept <hi rend="italic">firing away</hi> at me as hard as they could—I had to fight very hard—I hallooed, "Police"—a policeman came, and the men ran away—I kept hold of the prisoner's hand, and gave her in charge, with the watch in her hand—I took it from her hand, and gave it to the constable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; the chain remained with me.</p>
