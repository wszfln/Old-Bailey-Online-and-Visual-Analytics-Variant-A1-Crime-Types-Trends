            When had you last seen it? - A. A man had called me to Mr. Burton's door, and asked me to lend him a shilling or two; I put my hand into my pocket, and pulled my pocket-book out with my right-hand and put it into my left, and held it there till I put my right-hand into my pocket again, and I pulled out four half-crown pieces, and two or three shillings; I told the man there were five shillings for him, as I owed him some money; I then put my pocket-book into my right-hand pocket again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not possible you might drop the pocket-book near the door? - A. No; to the best of my knowledge, I am sensible I put it in my pocket at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, the next day, represent it as having lost your pocket-book either at the door or the bench? - A. No, they misunderstood me; I said, the last time I had it was at the bench, outside the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you bring him any fortune? - A. I had respectability, and some money, when I married him; but he has blasted my character, and he has done me every public and private injury; he has put a knife to my throat, and threatened to murder me.</p>

He solemnly swore to me, that he had been a widower sixteen years. The second day, he took an inventory of my things, and put a pen-knife to my throat.</p>

            Therefore you do not mean absolutely to swear to their being your property, but that they are like your's? - A. I mean to swear that they are mine.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many others of the same quality come from India? - A. Yes; they were made under my inspection.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050010"/>Q. What is there about this pen-case that makes you suppose it to be your's? - A. I bought it at Madras, and I never saw any like it besides.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a black servant, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. She was employed by the prisoner to wash? - A. Yes, she was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was the prisoner? - A. As my cook, and to wash my morning gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that black girl might give her these things to wash without your knowledge, you cannot say? - A. I cannot swear that, but I should think it impossible.</p>
               <p>- HAYMAN sworn. - I live in Golden-square, Mrs. Fancourt lodges at my house, I was present at the opening of the prisoner's box, when these things were found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that box under lock and key of the prisoner? - A. Yes, I saw her open it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been, previous to that, charged with taking any property of Mrs. Fancourt's? - A. No. On the 9th of November my servant complained that she had lost several articles of her own wearing-apparel, and upon hearing that, with Mrs. Fancourt's leave, I called all the servants together, and the prisoner's box was the first thing that was opened, and upon its being opened, Mrs. Fancourt found these things belonging to her; the watchman was called in, and we gave charge of her, with the property, to the watchman; some of my servant's things were found in the room, but not in the box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. There were other persons in the house who had access to that room besides her? - A. I understood it always to be kept locked.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till after you had challenged all the servants in the house, that you went up and found these things in the box? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was acquainted that her box was to be searched? - A. Yes, with the other servants.</p>
               <p>Q. And she then gave you the key, and opened the box? - A. She hesitated very much before she did it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not at that time say, that she had received them from the black girl? - A. She did not acknowledge to have received all of them from the black girl; the petticoat was the first thing taken out; she said she had that from the black girl to wash; with respect to the handkerchiefs, she said they were things not fit to be looked at, implying that they were foul linen, but they were not.</p>

No, I did not; some person that was in the house was speaking to me, and he took that opportunity to go away with the watch; I did not see him again till the Friday about half past two o'clock, I got intelligence of him then at Worship-street office; I took an officer with me, and found him in his room in Cake-street, Spitalfields; the officer went into the room, and I followed him, and said, that is the man that had my watch; he denied having it several times, and then he said he would give it me again; I said, I would not stand any nonsense, that is the man that took my watch, I give you charge of him; and after the officer had examined him a little while, he took the duplicate of the watch out of his jacket pocket upon the bed, he had pledged it for twenty-five shillings; then he asked me, if I would be content with having my watch again, he said, he would get it for me; I told him, I would have no more to do with-it, justice should take place. The watch was produced at Worship-street, by the pawnbroker. (Produces the duplicate).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have not got your watch again, but if you convict this man, you expect to have it again? - A. I hope so.</p>

            This public-house was in the city of London, I believe? - A. No, it is not; part of Long-alley is, but this part is not.</p>
               <p>Q. That was half past one o'clock in the day -I take it for granted, you were perfectly sober? - A. I had had some liquor, but not so much, as not to know what I was about.</p>

               <p>Q. He had been drinking with you in the public-house? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, you struggled to keep it? - A. No; I should have broke the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the prisoner ask you to lend him a little money, when you were about half seas over, and you said, you had none, but you would let him have your watch to raise some, if he would pay you again? - A. No such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. There being a number of people there, you might have prevented his taking it, if you pleased? - A. I suppose I might.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street office: The prosecutor applied to me, on Friday, the 23d of November, to apprehend the prisoner; we found him in his apartments in Cake-court, Cake-street, Spital-fields; I went up stairs, his wife was in his room; the prosecutor said that was the young man that had his watch; I asked him what he had done with the man's watch, he said, he never saw it, nor ever had it; I asked him what he had done with the duplicate, if he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050012"/>made away with it; he said, he knew nothing at all about it, and he then turned to where the soldier's jacket lay on the bed, and he gave me the duplicate, and I gave it to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You went to apprehend him as a selon, and seeing you he denied it? - A. Yes.(The pawnbroker's servant produced the watch, and deposed, that he took it in of the prisoner on Wednesday, the 21st of November in the evening; that the prisoner said it was his own property. The watch was deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not intend to defraud him of it; I was going upon duty the next day, and pledged it for fear I should lose it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant, and four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

Last Sunday se'nnight I missed five spoons out of the knife-cases, which I supposed he had neglected to clean; I asked him for these spoons just before dinner; I went into the dining-room, and still found that the spoons were not there; I then told him to bring up the silver argyle, and put some hot water into it; he told me had broke the handle of this argyle in cleaning it; I told him to bring it up as it was; he then told me that he had taken it to a silversmith to be mended; I asked him if he had taken it to Mr. Wirgman, who is my silversmith, and he said, no, he had taken them to a silversmith in Bond-street; I asked him the name of that silversmith in Bond street; he told me he did not recollect his name, but it was on the left hand side of the way; thinking this rather a mysterious kind of answer, I told him to bring up the spoons; he went out of the room, and shortly after returned, telling me that he had lent them for a pattern; this convinced me in my own mind that he had made away with these things; I then sent for another servant, and gave him a note to take to the Public-office, in Bow-street; my servant shortly after returned with two officers of the name of Carpmeal and Dowsett.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner lived with you some years ago, before he went to live with the Bishop of Landaff? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live with you then? - A. I think three or four years, it might be more.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe he is not an Englishman, he is a German? - A. He is.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you whether he had not, up to this time, managed every thing to your satisfaction? - A. Yes, he was always a very good servant.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, from a very foolish bashfulness, he did not ask you for his wages? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They amounted up to this time, I believe, to 21l.? - A. Yes, 21l. 1s. 1d.; his wages were fifteen guineas, and money that he had laid out made that sum.</p>

               <p>Q. Would not that sum, if he had received it, have taken all these things out of pawn, and left several pounds in his pocket? - A. It would.</p>

            These spoons that you first missed, ought to have been in the knife-case in the dining-room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course when you were at home, it was impossible for them to have been long absent without your observation? - A. I should think not, but I had been absent ten weeks from town, and the prisoner with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the distance of time between your first speaking to the prisoner about this argyle, and the officers arriving? - A. It might be about an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. You had dined in the interval? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner had not left your house? - A. No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. When had you spoke to him about the spoons? - A. Three or four days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he received his wages? - </p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. - On Saturday, the 3d of November, I went to the prisoner's house, in Church-street, St. Giles's, with the two Griffiths's, Nowlan, and Coombe; before I went into the house,

             searched me, to see if I had any halfpence about me; he then gave me two half-crown pieces and two shillings, which John Griffiths had marked before I had them; I went into the prisoner's shop, she keeps a chandler's shop, she was in the back room; I went into the room to her, and asked her if she would sell me any halfpence; she made answer, yes; I then came into the shop again, and she told Mr. Davis, who was her servant, to bring some into the back room to her, which he did, and after he had brought them, she told them out by six penny-worths with him; after she had told one guinea's-worth out, I told her I did not want any more at present; I then gave her the two half-crown pieces and two shillings that Griffiths had given me, I had made the bargain for them before; she gave

             the money, and desired him to put it in the till; the halfpence were taken out of a firkin, and she told me I might have all that were in the firkin if I pleased, there were a great many more in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appear pleased with your bargain? - A. Yes; then the officers came in; I had the halfpence in my coat pocket, and they laid hold of me and Mr. Davis, and took the halfpence out of my pocket, and the silver from Davis's hand; they then went into the back room, where the prisoner at the bar was, and there they found the rest of the halfpence in the butter firkin; Davis said, the prisoner had given him orders to sell bad halfpence, three for one, and she acknowledged that she had sold me a guinea's worth, three for one.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What business are you? - A. A collector of metals.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it part of the business of a collector of metals to go about the streets with this cry, "any bad shillings?" - A. No, it is not, I don't know what you talk of.</p>

            Perhaps you were accused falsely of it, when you were taken up for it? - A. I never was taken up for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never taken up on any account? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never called before a Justice of the Peace? - A. I have been called by warrants for an assault, or any thing of that kind; I had a warrant once for striking a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. And only that once? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to say warrants? - A. I did not mean more than one.</p>

               <p>Q. This shop was a chandler's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A shop in which it is extremely likely to take a great quantity of bad halfpence? - A. I don't say any thing against that, but I know she buys them the same as I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, and I wish to have your answer taken down, that you never were committed by any Magistrate as a vagrant? - A. I never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not tell Davis, that as they must have taken a great number of bad halfpence, you knew a person, who, for half-a-guinea, would give them cloth at the fair value, as halfpenny for halfpenny? - A. I never mentioned such a word, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire to be entrusted with a sample of them, and leave seven shillings as a security? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, how many halfpence did you receive for this seven shillings? - A. A guinea's-worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not 386 halfpence? - A. They were counted out, and there was a guinea's-worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were there not above 300? - A. I cannot say what number in tail, there was a guinea's-worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear there were not more than 300? - I know there were three for one.</p>
               <p>Q. The money was found upon Davis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that Davis was living with her as her husband, and was as much master of the house as her? - A. No, I do not, I always thought he was her servant.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so pleased with your bargain? - A. I thought it was right to go to Lambeth-street, for the good of the public, that every body should have their eyes open.</p>
               <p>Q. And you collect metals for the good of the public? - A. I collect iron, pewter, brass, and all kinds of things.</p>
               <p>Q. For the good of the public? - A. I do this for the good of the public.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that the reason why you were pleased with your bargain was, because it was for the good of the public? - A. I did it so the good of the public.</p>
               <p>Q. And that was the reason why you were pleased? - A. I was pleased because I had got myself clear through it.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a Jew, or not? - A. My mother is a Jewess, but I don't know what my father is.</p>
               <p>Q. What religion are you of? - A. I am a Jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not one of the tenets of your religion, that it is a crime to touch money on the sabbath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not so taught by your priests? - A. No, it is only a parcel of fools that say so; I will touch money at any time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. I believe it is the custom of a great number of Jews to be sworn with their hats on, and some without, so as they are under cover? - A. Yes, I am under cover now.</p>
               <p>Q. And some Jews are so strict, that they will not handle money on the sabbath day, and others will? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The only person you saw in the shop was Davis? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. On saturday, the 3d of November, I went with Samuels and my brother, and two other officers, to the house of the prisoner, in Church-street, St. Giles's; we went to a public-house, and waited there about half an hour, then we went to the house of the prisoner, Samuels had gone first; as soon as I went into the shop, I laid hold of Samuels, the Jew, I searched him, and in his coat pocket I found these halfpence, (producing them); there were 503 pieces of copper coin, amongst which we picked out 386 pieces of coin called halfpence, and 117 other pieces, not halfpence; I then went into the back room, and saw Mrs. Grout sitting up in bed; Nowlan and I desired her to get up and dress herself; I searched that room, but found no money there; I asked the prisoner whether Davis was her servant, or not; she said, he was a person that assisted her in the shop while she was ill; I saw the halfpence taken out of the firkin; they correspond exactly with the halfpence that were found upon Samuels.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they counterfeits? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. No doubt of it, we admit it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Do you know any persons in life more exposed to take bad halfpence, than those who keep chandler's shops? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And you could not well select a more likely neighbourhood for that purpose than St. Giles's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the prisoner was, you found no halfpence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Those that you did find were in the shop, where halfpence are received in trade? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any man living, who saw that poor woman in bed, doubt that she was ill? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear what the Jew said? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you think, that no man living could see her, without knowing she was ill? - A. Certainly not, but she was much worse afterwards when she was taken from the office.</p>
               <p>Q. These halfpence had certainly been in circulation? - A. They had.</p>
               <p>Q. You attend at the Whitechapel-office? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am an officer; I went with Griffiths into the back room where the prisoner was searched; I asked who that man was that was behind the counter; she said, he was not her husband, neither did he sleep with her, but was a man that assisted her while she was ill; I asked her how she came by such a quantity of bad halfpence; she said, she took them in the course of her business; I asked her how she came to sell them three for one, and if she had ever seen the Jew before; she said, he had been in her shop several times before, and she had dealt with him, but I did not ask her in what.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the weight of the halfpence found in the firkin? - A. About three quarters of a hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You agree with your brother officers as to the woman's health? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner keeps a chandler's shop? - A. yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A shop of all others the most exposed to take bad halfpence? - A. It is a very low-life neighbourhood certainly, and she said she had a right to dispose of them as well as she could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the Friday the Jew came to me, and asked me if I had any old metals; I told him I had not; then he said, had not I got some bad halfpence; I said, yes, the worse luck; then he said, he had a friend in Whitechapel that for the value of half-a-guinea would let me have goods, and take them at the full value, and the next day, when the officers came, I never spoke to him at all; I had been very ill all night, and I was waked by the officers searching a poor woman that was a servant of mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it likely that she should have taken in the way of her trade as many bad halfpence as you see there? - A. Yes; I have as many myself now by me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you take it to be the conduct of an honest trades-person to sell bad halfpence three for one? - A. I must think it was not an honest thing; I do not think the woman understood the law.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three other witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On Saturday the 27th of October, I was sent for by Messrs. Cox and Merle; I went there, and after I had been there a quarter of an hour, the prisoner was introduced into the parlour, I did not know that he was charged with the robbery; when the prisoner had been in about three minutes, Mr. Merle came in, and said nothing; but presently Mr. Hallifax came in, and gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of a Bank bill; I then searched him, but found nothing, except a few trifles, and a little cash that he had in his pocket; I then asked him where he lodged; and he told me at No. 15, Princes-street, Barbican; I then asked him in what manner I could get admittance to his apartments; and he told me then where the key of his room was to be found, and likewise, when I had got into his room, where I might find the key of his drawers; I left him in charge of the Wardbeadle while I went to his lodgings, No. 6, Princes-street, and I found the key according to his directions, hanging up under a boot-jack; and in the first drawer I opened, in a single chest of drawers, I found this pocket-book, containing two 20l. Bank-notes, one of 1l and a seven-shilling-piece, and likewise a foreign Bank-bill for 35l. upon Masterman's house, of which I took possession, in the presence of Mr. Hallifax, and another gentleman; and in a book, when I lifted up the corner, I found three guineas and a half, and eight penny-pieces; I produced them before the Lord-Mayor, I received them again, after he was committed, from Mr. Newman, the clerk of the Lord-Mayor; this bill,(producing it), was delivered to me by Mr. Newman, the Lord-Mayor's clerk.(The bill in question).</p>
               <p>Q. This was not found in the pocket-book? - A. No; I heard the prisoner say, when I had the charge of him first, that he was very sorry for what he had done, and he hoped Mr. Merle would shew him mercy; there was one of the clerks charged with the theft, and Mr. Merle said, if he had then stepped forward at the time that the other clerk was charged with it, and said he was guilty, he would have done something for him.</p>

               <p>Q. And that passed without any thing said by Mr. Merle to induce him to confess? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the first examination? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that examination? - A. No; he was all the while crying, we could hardly get a word out of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were sent for to Mr. Merle's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that, at his lodgings, you would find a pocket-book, and you would find some Bank-notes there? - A. He told me where the key was.</p>

            Look at that bill, and tell me if you know it? - A. Yes, I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you deliver that bill to Mr. Newman, at the Mansion-house? - A. I do not think I did, I believe it was Mr. Hallifax.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was delivered in your presence? - A. I believe it might.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he was a clerk in our house to take care of bills for acceptance, and numbering bills for acceptance; this bill has the acceptance of Mr. Cox upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore must have been in your house? - A. Of course.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you whether you had any conversation with the prisoner at the bar relative to this bill, and when? - A. I do not know exactly when, but it was on a Saturday that he was taken into custody; I had another clerk in custody at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This young man had been entrusted with some hundreds of pounds property of your's? - A. Yes, millions.</p>
               <p>Q. When this charge was made against him, did you not tell him you would do all you could to shew him favour? - A. I did; I had another clerk in custody, and there has been a person that said they thought they would know him, and they had fixed upon him, and he seemed, during the whole time of his being in custody, without fear, and appeared with perfect innocence; and it being a matter of importance to me to know who the man was, as they had such opportunities of taking property to a very large amount, I took him into the accompting-house, and told him, if he would confess whether he was the man or not, I would shew him all the favour I possibly could.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before he was taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe, that in consequence of expecting favour from you, he ingenuously confessed it? - A. It gave me a great satisfaction upon this confession, when he assured me that he had never injured me but in this particular; he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050018"/>thirty thousand pounds of property out with him that day; I had lent him ninety pounds that very morning to pay for furniture; he might have put his hand into the drawer and taken out thirty thousand pounds without my missing it for a fortnight; since that time, I have had all my bills marked off, and I do not find one missing besides this.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you perceive that? - A. The tun was left in a level state about two o'clock in the afternoon, and this was about eight or nine; when I saw it, it appeared as if six or seven bushels had been removed; I asked two men who were loading the carts with grains, whether they had seen any thing of the malt; they said, no; the value is about twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the practice of your brewhouse to sell ground malt? - A. Never.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live with James Weldon, a grocer, at Barnet; I know the prisoner at the bar; I know Sharman very well, he has come to our house to buy grocery of us several times for these three years past, he was a labourer in the neighbourhood. On Wednesday, the 10th day of October, I went from Barnet in a one-horse chaise to St. Alban's, with a young man of my acquaintance, but he did not return with me; about six o'clock I returned from St. Alban's; when I came to <placeName id="t17981205-13-crimeloc62">Mimms Wash-bridge</placeName>

               <p>Q. At the time he said if you did not immediately give it him, the worse should be the consequence, did he strike you? - A. He did not strike me. When I found he was obstinate, I gave him a leather pocket-book, containing sundry papers, and then immediately came up a man on the other side, who I believe to be Brown, though he is not in the dress he was then; then Sharman asked me again for the watch, still I told him I had not any, and he made use of the words again, that worse should be the consequence if I did not. I then gave my watch to Sharman, I think; then after they had got my watch, they beat me, they struck me three or four times; I cannot swear who struck me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they strike you with? -

            They had short sticks, as long as my arm, and as thick as my wrist, they beat me down in the bottom of the chaise; when they went away I got up, but was not able to lay hold of the reins or whip; I spoke to the horse, and I got home about half after eight that night.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew Sharman before? - A. I knew Sharman for three years past, I had seen Brown before; I knew Sharman well, by coming to our house twice a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the person of Sharman? - A. I have not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to Brown, do you know Brown? - A. I have seen his person before, but I cannot positively swear to him, he is not in the same dress he was then, I believe it to be him, he was in a smock frock when he was at the chaise. I went the next morning with John Lloyd, a peace officer, in search of these persons, and we met a Mr. Herridge. I related the circumstance to Mr. Herridge, and described the persons: then we were coming round another way, and I met Mr. Herridge and Chidwell with the prisoners, and two other men, Turner and Fentom. When I saw the prisoners, I said, that was the person that robbed me, that was Sharman; we were in a one-horse cart, and we took the prisoner, Thomas Sharman, and brought him to Barnet, I and

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. He told you that he had found those fowls? - A. He said that they were his wife's, and his own property.</p>

               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence. One witness was called to the prisoner's character, who said, he had known him but a very little while, but during that time, he never heard any thing against him.</p>

Mr. Kington, who lodged at the New Hummums; I then said to the constable, it would be the most prudent thing to go to the New Hummums, to see if he lived there; I went up stairs, and found Mr. Kington; I carried the watch, and that was the way Mr. Kington came to know about it.

             sworn. - I live in Pye-street, almost facing the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I have seen him by coming to my house, I keep a little shop, he came for victuals, or such things as he wanted. On the 12th of October, about half past twelve, I saw him come out of a door with a bag upon his right shoulder, there were but two doors between that and the prosecutor's; I really thought he had got some fire-irons; he passed me and another young woman, and went towards Duck-lane, there was a saw I could see out of the bag, about thus far; the house he came out of adjoins the back yard of the prosecutor's: hearing the next morning that these people had been robbed, I told them they might see such a person at Duck-lane, but what house I did not know, because I did not follow him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MESSENGER sworn. - I am an officer belonging to the Police-office, Queen-square, I was informed of the robbery, I went in search after the things; I was told the property was carried by the prisoner to his lodgings, in Duck-lane; I found the room where he lodged, but the prisoner was not there; we found the bag much as it is now, with the saw, saucepan, two hammers, and a double iron jack plane.</p>

             sworn. - I am a lighterman: As I was going down Norfolk-street, between five and seven in the morning, I saw a barge belonging to the prosecutors; there were two men on board moving the sacks about, and taking goods out of the sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were those two men? - A. It was not quite day-light, and it was a goodish distance, but I think it was the prisoners; they laid down the sacks again in their places as they were before, and covered the tarpaulins over them; I went away round to a public-house in Milford-lane, and had half a pint of purl, and came back again, and about half past seven Mr. Whitbread's miller, Mr. Garner, came down and Messenger fetched him on board the lighter in a skiff; Mr. Garner took some malt out of several sacks to carry to the brewhouse for a sample, and then Messenger brought him on shore again; then I overtook the miller in the Strand, and I told him I thought there was something on board of that barge that was not right; then I went down as far as Queenhithe to the Meter's-office with him; from there I went back again over-right the barge; I saw the two prisoners go ashore with a dish under their arms with some victuals to have their breakfast; then I went to Bow-street, and gave information, that there was something not right, and an officer was set to watch where it went to; two officers were sent down, Ruthven was one, and, I think, Jones; they looked to see if any thing was gone out of the barge, while I went to the Corn-market; I told Mr. Toosley, the malster, that the malt belonged to, what had happened, and he told me I had better go and see whether they carried any on shore any where, and then the miller and another gentleman came to have it measured, and they found a deficiency.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You were in Norfolk-street at the time you saw this? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you think these barges were off? - A. They laid off the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not beyond the middle of the Thames? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not 300 yards from you? - A. No, nor 200 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. And this was on the 26th of November? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was dark? - A. It was moon-light.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not distinguish the features of the people? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not light enough to see their faces? - A. No, I saw the two men at day-light.</p>

            There were a good many other barges between you and this barge? - A. There were two failing barges and another barge.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark could you see by which you could tell which was Mr. Earl's barge? - A. Mr. Earl's barge was as long as two of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear, that with those barges between, you could distinguish which was Mr. Earl's barge at that time in the morning? - A. Yes, I say it was Mr. Earl's barge, but I cannot swear positively to the men's faces.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you could distinguish that to be Mr. Earl's barge at that time in the morning? - A. I could see a good way, it was moon-light; there was no other barge there with malt in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could see at that distance that it was malt? - A. No, I do not pretend to say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were not the other barges loaded? - A. They might have something in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they not loaded? - A. I did not take particular notice whether they were or not.</p>
               <p>Q. They were all covered with tarpaulins, were they not? - A. No, all of them were not, because one of them was a London barge, that had nothing in her.</p>
               <p>Q. One of these prisoners is your own brother-in-law, is he not? - A. No, he is brother-in-law to my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been some disputes, I believe, between you and him? - A. Yes, but I did not come here to argue about that.</p>
               <p>Q. How many days before this was it that he summoned you to Waterman's-hall? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not summoned you there? - A. Yes, a good many times; every time he saw me at work I had to pay twenty shillings, because I am not a free waterman.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is no good will between you? - A. No, I do not think there is much.</p>
               <p>Q. In case this man had appeared against you, when was he to have appeared against you? - A. On the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. And when was he taken up? - A. On the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. He had summoned you, how often? - A. A dozen times, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have arrested him, I believe? - A. Yes, and a good right I had so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Faulkner Carpenter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not you say to him that you had received a summons from Horwood, and you would have a runner and take him to Bow-street? - A. I told Carpenter, if ever I caught<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050027"/>him at any thing, I would do what I could, for he was punishing me every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell Carpenter that he had summoned you, and you would have a runner and take him to Bow-street? - A. I do not know that I did this time, I may have mentioned it to him often.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have mentioned often to him, that you would get a runner and take him to Bow-street? - A. Yes, I have.</p>

             sworn. - I am a miller at Messrs. Whirbread and Co's. On sunday, the 25th of November, the prisoner, Messenger, came to me for a bill of assignment of four hundred quarters of malt that were on board Rose and Galley's barge; two hundred quarters belonged to Mr. Toosley, and two hundred to Mr. Harris; I went on Monday morning on board the barge to take a sample; I took the samples, and, in returning, just before I came to Temple-bar, John Gillet overtook me, and, from the information he gave me on the Monday, I ordered the malt up to the brewhouse on Wednesday morning; Gillet came on the Tuesday evening, and in consequence of what he said, I stopped the proceeding of the malt. I attended on Wednesday morning, sent for a meter, and had it measured; the sacks that laid at the top we found to be very deficient; in the six quarters of Mr. Harris's there were wanting thirty quarts; we then measured one quarter of Mr. Toosley's, and that wanted five quarts, and one sack of Mr. Toosley's was measure.</p>
               <p>Q. How much should the sack contain? - A. Four bushels.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. How these sacks were filled by Toosley, the proprietor, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe six quarters contain seven hundred and sixty-eight quarts? - A. I cannot say, I have not calculated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. There are one hundred and twenty-eight quarts in a quarter.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many bushels are there in six quarters? - A. Forty-eight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Does not malt suffer a great deal of deficiency on account of weather? - A. The weather was in favour of the measure, it was wet weather.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you measure it? - A. On Wednesday morning I saw it measured.</p>

             sworn. - I am the meter; the first quarter I measured on board the barge was measure; the second quarter wanted four quarts; the third quarter wanted eleven quarts; then, by Garner's desire, I measured two sacks underneath the top tier, and they were measured; the 4th quarter was measure, and the 5th wanted four quarts, and the sixth quarter wanted eleven quarts; we only measured the top sacks; if they had gone through, upon the average, it would have made four thousand quarts deficient.</p>

               <p>Garner. The meter meant to state, that if I had received these two hundred quarters at the brewhouse, wanting five quarts upon what he measured, I must have received the whole bulk as wanting five quarts upon each quarter.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Would that measure have been made by the meter, if it had not been for the information you received? - A. Yes, it is always measured by the meter before it is unloaded.</p>

               <p>CHRISTOPHER JONES sworn. - I am a conductor of the patrole belonging to Bow-street: we had an information on the 26th of last month of some people plundering some sacks in a Kingston barge; we went with the person that gave information to watch the barge that same evening till about nine; we quitted then, and came about six in the morning; the barge laid in the same place at that time, and in the evening dropped down to Brown and Boville's wharf, Milford-lane; we continued there till about the same time as we did the night before; we came again the next morning about eight o'clock; the barge was then close in under the wharf; about ten o'clock we went into Brown and Boville's accompting-house, we then saw the meter and miller coming to re-measure the malt, and after that we had an information from the same person to apprehend the two prisoners; I went under the tilt, and Messenger was eating; I then took Messenger into custody, and delivered him to one of the other officers, and then, in consequence of an information, I went and looked under the tilt again, and there found a sack covered with some of their bedding and some empty sacks; they were both bargemen on board the barge.</p>

            : I was at work in the front shop, I did not see the prisoner take any thing, but I was alarmed that we had been robbed, and I ran as hard as I could after hin; I saw him with two collars in a bag, I saw them sticking out upon his shoulder as he was going along, I pursued him about a quarter of a mile, and then stopped him; I took the bag from him, and took him to St. Giles's watch-house, I gave the bag to Mr. Morgan at the watch-house; we found all the things mentioned in the indictment about him.</p>
               <p>- MORGAN sworn. - I am round-house-keeper at St. Giles's, the prisoner was brought to me on the 15th of November; the last witness brought the collars with him, and I found a bag under his arm. (producing it).(The collars produced, and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

I saw my servant-maid with a gentleman's servant in pursait of her, I went with them and brought her back; the beadle of the parish was upon the spot, I brought her back and had her searched, but could not find the property; she was taken to Marlborough-street and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your handkerchiefs? - A. Yes, I found three of them since at a pawnbroker's; the officer belonging to the office found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them again? - A. I know them no further than they were like them; the ten were all in one piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose, that at the time you saw her move her arm from the window, was the time when she took these handkerchiefs? - A. Yes.(The prosecutor produced three handkerchiefs).</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen them last? - A. About a quarter of an hour before the prisoner and the other woman came in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. This gentleman called me in to know how I sold my fruit; his wife came into the shop, and said she did not want any; then I asked him to shew me some stockings, and we could not agree, and this woman, that he speaks of, came in while I was there for sixpence and six-pennyworth of halfpence, I never saw the woman before; I know nothing at all of the handkerchiefs.</p>

             sworn. - I was with the last witness at the apprehending the prisoners: They were brought up to Ball's-pond Toll-house, and searched; I took from Phillips; a tomahawk and a knife he had with him, (producing them); and that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You do not mean to call that a tomahawk, it is a sugar-breaker? - A. I do not know what it is.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you know there is a reward in this case, if there is a conviction? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the sheep with legs on? - A. Yes; the entrails were not in.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many thousand sheep with the letter W upon them? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended, that as the indictment charged them to be wether sheep, the witnesses not being able to say whether they were sheep or lambs, and the declaration of the Prisoners at the time being that it was lamb, the prisoners ought not to be put upon their defence.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon this point of law I shall leave it to the Jury, upon the evidence, to say whether they were wether sheep or not. - You may make any observations you think proper, in arrest of judgment, but I think the justice of the country would be totally defeated if such an objection was to be admitted.</p>
               <p>Gee's defence. When Mr. Black apprehended me, he took me to the Toll-house, and said, what have you got in your sack; I made answer, it is as we picked it up; that is all we know about it.</p>
               <p>The other prisoners did not say any thing in their defence. The prisoner, Jones, called three, Gee, eight, and Phillips, two witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Queen-square: I know nothing of it, further than apprehending the prisoners; I found nothing upon either of them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended, that as to the woman prisoner, if she was the wife of the man, she being under coverture, of course must be acquitted; and that, if she was not the wife, she ought to have been indicted for a common law larceny, and not upon the statute upon which this indictment is framed, the contract for the lodging being made with him. The learned Counsel also contended, that there was no evidence to she what the property was taken with the privity or consent of the man prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. I am of opinion with you, that if the woman did this without the knowledge of the man, he ought to be acquitted; but, on the other hand, I think there is a case to go to the Jury, from the circumstances under which this property was pledged, upon the subject of privity, they both living together.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the prisoner at the bar the man? - A. I cannot recollect the man; the woman prisoner brought the parcel first, and I asked her if they were her's; she said, she would fetch the person they belonged to; she went and fetched a man in, I cannot say whether that is the man or not; I asked him if the property was his, and he said, they belonged to a brother-in-law of his that was deceased; there were opened in her presence; there was one handkerchief marked with a name at length.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. About five o'clock, about this time of year, or a quarter before five.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I should think it must be pretty near dark? - A. I do not exactly say it was that time, but it was light enough for me to see them.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you mark it? - A. The day before it was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell all the soap in your shop by yourself, or by the servants under you? - A. I mostly sell it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the time that you marked the soap, and the time that you lost it, had you yourself sold any? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Of course you would not undertake to swear that your servants had not? - A. I do not know that they had, I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Then a you do not always sell yourself, but your servants sell at times, will you venture to swear that your servants might not have sold this soap, and so gone out among the public? - A. To my knowledge I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you receive the copper from? - A. From Mr. Saville's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes, he was employed by Mr. Mesteares; he was at work outside the ship, but had nothing to do with the copper at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him do any thing whatever particularly? - A. I missed him three or four times a day from his work, between two and three in the afternoon; I went round the ship to look for him; I saw a labourer,

            , standing at the door of a shed that he has for putting his tools in; I called Eddis away to his work, and I saw Pointer there; I asked him what he was doing there; he said, he was looking for his tools; I told him his tools were not there, for I saw him put them in another place a quarter of an hour before, I asked him what he was doing there, he was feeling down among some old rope that laid there; I called him out to go to his work, and, in coming round the ship, the mate met him; I said, that he had been in the shed; the mate went to the place, and brought the copper to us, the mate's name is Taylor; the mate said to Pointer, here is the copper you have taken; upon that he was very angry, and struck the mate two or three times; I told him he had better go along about his business, and leave me and the mate alone; he kept treating me very ill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This copper was in Mr. Mesteares's yard? - A. It was on board the ship, under the care of the mate, and the people belonging to the ship.</p>
               <p>Q. The mate's name is Taylor? - A. Yes; it belonged to the captain and owners of the ship.</p>

               <p>JOHN DUNNAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a carpenter on board the ship Two Friends, I was employed by the captain, Mr. Macneal; I saw the prisoner go over the side on the Friday afternoon, the 23d of November, with a piece of copper under his jacket, I watched him, but before I could give the mate notice of it, the foreman, Mr. Hickes, called him away from the shed that I saw him go into.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you been acquainted with the prisoner before? - A. No, I came on board on the 22d, and this was on the 23d.</p>

            . On the 23d of November, in consequence of a suspicion of the prisoner, I saw him in the carpenter's shed, I observed that, he had nothing about him; I then went into the shed, and found a piece of copper concealed behind an empty barrel in one corner; I brought the copper out, and walked round the ship with it till I saw the prisoner; I presented it to him, and told him he had stole it out of the ship; he called me ad-d rascal, abused me very much, and struck me several times; I immediately went to the Police-office, and took out a warrant to apprehend him; the steward of the ship took it to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You found the copper in the shed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner, when you taxed him with it, abused and beat you? - A. I dare say he would have battered my face.</p>
               <p>Q. And perhaps have taken your life? - A. I do not know but he might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Hickes.) Q. How large is the shed? - A. About eight feet square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him near that part of the shed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Other persons might have access to that shed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And might have put the copper there? - A. I saw him in the shed.</p>

             sworn. - I am a serjeant-major; I saw all the prisoners at the Thistle and Crown, Charing-cross, on or about the 3d. of October, I cannot exactly speak to the day; I went there with a recruit; Jeffreys was taking with a man there, and the other two came in afterwards; I saw that outside man, Dempster, take the bag, and go out of the room with it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the bag was taken away, did they all go? - A. No; the next man, in the middle, Draper, went out directly after him; and Jeffreys went out in about five or six minutes after the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pursue them? - A. I did not; about four o'clock, the same days, as I was going into Backingham-street, I saw Jeffreys along with the other two prisoners, and the other two had got the three bundles in their possession; I had got a comrade along with me, and I said, I suspected these men had got the Jew's property, and we would take them if we could; I immediately cried out, stop thief; and, in turning Denmark-street, they threw the three bundles into an area; I still pursued them, I could not overtake them; but Jeffreys stood still, and the other two men made their escape; when I found I could not overtake the other two. I laid hold of Jeffreys, and told him he should go back to where the property was, as he was in the room when it was taken out; he said, he would knock my b-y eyes out, and he would do me; but I was determined not to let him go till I had got him to where the property was; it was brought out of the area, and the gentlemen of the house sent his servant with me to the Thistle and Crown; Jeffreys was wrested from me by another guardsmen, and I was obliged to let him go, or else I was going with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them before? -

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You did not promise him any favour? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>JAMES SEYS sworn. - I am a cooper: I took this property from the prisoner; I have had it from that time to this. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You cannot undertake to swear to these rivets? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. Three shillings; there are six pounds of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any rivets of that sort in your shop? - A. Yes; here is a sample that I took out of the bag afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you missed any? - A. Yes; I can positively swear to a quantity being missing out of the bag, because it was a fresh bag.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you believe them to be your's? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Farnsworth.) Q. Where was the prisoner when you detected him? - A. I saw him come out of the shop, when I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To White.) Q. The prisoner is a cooper himself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, therefore, if he was doing a job for himself, these things were necessary for him to use? - A. No, it was impossible.</p>

             sworn. - On the 5th of November, in the evening, about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, passing along, I met three men, one of them carrying a trunk, bearing up a gate way, and the other two following him, I do not know the name of the place, there are brewer's store-houses up the gateway; I suspected they had stolen it, and made the observation to a person passing, whom I did not know; I passed farther on in Broad-street, and saw the cart belonging to the Blossom's-inn, and gave information of what I had seen to the two porters that were with the cart, and then to Pearce; then one of the porters and I set off to follow the men; when we had got past the gateway, we thought our pursuing them would be endless, and we went back to Mr. Robinson's, the linen-draper, where the cart was delivering a truss, and then we went to the Police-office, in Bow-street; I gave information of the men so far as this, that one was taller than the other, and that the tall one and the short one followed the man that bore the trunk; then we proceeded to Church-lane, St. Giles's, we went into several houses, but could not find them, and then we proceeded to Lewkner's-lane; we went to a public-house there that the officers were acquainted with; we took two men upon suspicion there; we were coming away from there, and near the top of the lane, met three men; Jones, one of the constables, seeing them, called out grab, meaning, I suppose, by that, to take hold of them; one of the officers seized the man, and Mumsord called out to me to pick up a bundle that lay under a cart, about six paces from where they were taking hold of the man; I gave the bundle to Mumford.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not lee it drop from either of the men? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other men besides the officers and the men that were near this bundle? - A. I saw nobody else near; I did not see the three men at that time; I only saw two of them; they told me there were three; some people coming out of a house, hearing a scaffle, called out, young man, here is another bundle; I picked it up from under the horse's head, and carried it to Crocker.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a cart and one horse standing? - A. Yes, I do not know who belonged to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no driver to it? - A. I did not see any driver till after the scuffle; when we had got the bundles, and two of the men, who were the two prisoners, we proceeded to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these two men the nearest to the bundles? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the two prisoners, and tell me if you think they were either of the men that you you saw running number the gateway with the trunk? - A. I had not sight enough of them to identify their persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Word. Q. Were not some persons that you had taken up on suspicion, in company with you when you look us? - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CROCKER sworn. - I am an officer,(produces the bundle); On the 5th of November, I received this from Day; I delivered the bundle to Mr. Crocker.</p>
               <p>Crocker. This is the bundle he delivered to me in Lewkner's-lane. Between seven and eight o'clock, or very near eight, Day, in company with Pearce, came down to the Brown Bear, and said they had lost a trunk; I, in company with Mumford and Jones, went to a house in Dyot-street, where we knew these sort of people resort, to see for a man that I suspected by their saying one was a tall man. From that we went to a house in Lewkner's-lane, where, in the tap-room, was this man that I suspected, and another that was wanted for another offence; Jones called him out, and going down Lewkner's-lane, about half way from the public-house to Drury-lane, there stood a cart; there were some people in the cart with a light; Mr. Jones was on forward with his prisoner; he called out to Mumford and me who were behind, grab, for here is the swag, that is, lay hold, for here is property; I then saw the prisoner Gray with a bundle in his hand, I did not see him throw it down in the scuffle, I immediately secured him, and taking him down the lane, Mumford, who was behind, saw the bundle lay under the cart, and he did Day pick it up; I said to Day, go back and see if there is another bundle; somebody in the cart cried out, here is another, I do not know who it was; it was; then Day brought me the bundle, which I produce now; I don't know which of the two bundles it was that Gray had, for I did not see him throw it away after I had seen it in his hand, I saw it in his hand just before I secured him.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Crocker.) Q. Did you ever see this man before? - A. I cannot say, I never did to take notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized the tall man-Did it appear afterwards whether that tall man was at all known or acquainted with this man? - A. No, it did not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MUMFORD sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Bow-street; I was with Crocker and Jones: On the 5th of November, a person came and gave information that there had been a box lost; we went to Dyot-street, and from there to the White-hart in Lweknet's-lane; we took two people from there; Jones was first, and Crocker next, and I was behind him; just as we came up to a cart, Jones said to us, bone them, meaning to lay hold of them; I then saw the two prisoners, I did not see any thing in their hands; but in the same place where they were taken into custody, I saw this bundle lie.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it lie so near the place, that it was possible either of them might have dropped it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other person near, who could have dropped it? - A. There was another man who escaped, and there was a third bundle found three days after in a house in Lewkner's lane, and I carried it home to the lady.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found the trunk? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Miss Bentinck. That bundle contained part of the things that I packed up in the trunk.</p>

               <p>JOHN JONES sworn. - I was at the apprehending of the prisoners in Lewkner's-lane; I saw the prisoner, Gray, with a bundle under his arm, as he passed me; I then called out to the other two officers with me to lay hold of them; ward was close behind him, I did not see whether he had the bundle or not; I laid hold of Ward, and brought him up to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you? - A. No, he asked me if I had seen a bundle with him; I told him, no, I did not.</p>
               <p>Gray's defence. I am a butcher; I work for Mr. Hall, in St. James's-market; Mr. Brookes, who keeps a slaughter-house at the bottom of Lewkner's-lane, recommended me to Mr. Hall, I was going to thank him for his recommendation, when they laid hold of me; I know nothing of the bundle.</p>
               <p>Ward's defence. I had been at the west end of the town; in coming through Lewkner's-lane, I was run against violently by a man, that almost knocked me down, and then one of the witnesses laid hold of me, and took me to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you in partnership with him? - A. No: On Wednesday, the 21st of November last, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner at the bar came into my brother's shop, with a boy and a girl, somewhere about five or six years old; she asked to look at some cloth, I shewed her some; I asked her how much the wanted; she told me the only wanted a small quantity; I told her a remnant might suit her as well, and I sold her a remnant; she then said she wanted a child's great-coat frock; in course quence of having some suspicion of the prisoner, I counted the quantity of prints that I took down to shew her, I shewed her eight preces; I sold her two yards of one; I asked her then if she did not want a frock; she said, no; she put down a seven-shilling piece, and I put up the two yards of print and remnant of cloath in a paper; I took up the seven-shilling piece, and desired her to step further up the shop, and I would give her change; I then went and counted the prints as she was going out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050048"/>at the door, and found there was one missing; I then went and stopped the prisoner, who had got about a yard from the door, she denied it; I told her, that she had been stealing a piece of print; I was then coming out of the shop just before her, and I saw the print lying just behind her in the shop on the ground, about half a yard or three quarters from her, it was a piece of cotton, containing twenty-eight yards.</p>

             sworn. - I am an apprentice to Mr. Feather. On Friday last my mistress called up stairs, that somebody had robbed her; I ran down Red-lion-street and Lamb's-conduit-street; I turned up East-street, leading to Harper-street; I got Information that they were gone into Harpur's-'s-mews; I pursued, and took Bertles into custody, he had no property upon him; he got from me, and ran into the George, in Boswell-court; I saw the prisoner Cole run out of the Mews. When I came back, he was in my master's shop, that was about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards, the box was then upon the counter.</p>
               <p>JAMES HOUNSON sworn. - I am servant to Mrs. Lewis, in Devonshire-street, Queen-square; I saw the prisoner Cole take a japan box off the counter of Mr. Feather's shop, in Red-lion-passage; I was going into the shop at the time; he ran across the square with the box in his hand; I did not pursue him, because I am a little lame; I did not see Bertles till he was brought back to the shop; there was nobody in the shop at the time I first saw him; Mrs. Feather was sitting in the back room; the box was brought back by Frederick Jones.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of the production of that certificate, supposing it was good, would he be entitled to receive wages? - A. There may have been instances in which seamen may have received them upon such a certificate, but it is usual always to have an unserviceable ticket, which he stated he had lost; I looked at the certificate, and he immediately, of his own accord, produced another certificate, saying, that he had wages due, likewise, from the Medusa; I read the certificate.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the certificate that he produced when he said that? - A. It is; I read the certificate, and observed, therein stated, that his name was Henry Grote; I asked him, why he was called Henry Grote in the Medusa, and Henry Smith in the Mars; the reason which he assigned was, that when he went into the Medusa, that was his first ship, and at that time he spoke very bad English, and he supposed the clerk had made a mistake, and put him down Henry Grote, when he meant to say Henry Smith; I examined the books, and found that there was a Henry Grote in the Medusa, and that he was discharged to the Mars; his name then stood, in the muster-book of the Mars, entered from the Medusa, in a very regular manner; and there was, likewise, a man of the name of Henry Smith, regularly entered as a sailor there.</p>
               <p>Q. Open your book, and see whether you are correct in what you say? -

Plymouth Hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the number, in this certificate, agree with the number in the book as attached to Henry Smith? - A. Yes; I paid Henry Smith his wages on the 22d of June last.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this, what did you do? - A. I clearly perceived that he was personating Henry Smith; I took him to one of the superior clerks, who told me to let him go about his business, as a vagaboud and deserer, and telling him that it was a capital offence, however, the chief<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050053"/>clerk happened to come in, and was of opinion that it was necessary he should be apprehended, and he was apprehended.

            (To Taylor.) When you bought it, had you made such observation of the property as to be able to swear to it? - A. I can swear this is the soap I purchased; it was not packed up, for I was rather later than usual, and I desired them not to mind how they packed it, and they just put a piece of paper round the sides, and tried it up, I suppose there never was a quarter of a hundred of soap went out of a shop packed up so; I can swear further, that it was in the cart when I got to my own door, for I put my elbow upon It when I got out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You leaned upon the soap with your elbow? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But there is no impression of your elbow upon it? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a labourer in the East-India warehouses. On Monday, the 19th of November, I was upon the upper floor of the building when I saw the prisoner go down one of the alleys of the warehouse, he went up to a chest, took some tea out of the chest, and put it into his pocket, I believe it was either in his breeches pocket, or some place made for the purpose in his apron; I acquainted one of the elders with it, and that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. I believe it is not by such small quantities as this man is accused of, that the India Company in general have a complaint? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have seen you, as well as you see him? - A. He saw me when he went down.</p>

            Therefore if he had supposed he had been guilty of a felony, he would have continued it about him? - A. I cannot say as to that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. If he did not observe you, he might have taken a great deal more? - A. Yes, he might, he had an opportunity of taking more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it that he was taken up? - A. I believe two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he continued upon this floor for two or three hours? - A. Yes, he was generally employed upon that floor.</p>

             sworn. - I am the King's locker at the India-house: I searched the prisoner, and found upon him a packet of tea, concealed in his breeches pocket, after searching him for ten minutes or more; it contained about two ounces. (The tea produced).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You attend for the purpose of searching people as they come out of the warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it a man is not likely to get off without being detected, or you must neglect your duty? - A. If we were to search every man as I searched him, it would take us from eight o'clock in the morning till night; we search them as quick as we can.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you search their pockets? - A. No; we search their breeches sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is worth about four-pence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner has been some years in the Company's service? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This tea was folded up in a paper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find it in his waistcoat pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find it in his apron? -

            No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find any loose in his pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not search men when they come into the warehouse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore if a man means to go to see a sick friend before he goes home, after he has done work, and takes a little tea in his pocket for that sick friend, there is nothing wonderful in that? - A. No; but there is a rule against any body taking tea in.</p>
               <p>- BARBER sworn. - I am an elder belonging to the India Company's warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that tea - is that like the tea that you had in the warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have every kind of tea in the warehouse, and therefore you know it must be like the tea in the warehouses? - A. This is congou tea.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>There were upwards of twenty more attending, but the Court thought it unnecessary to examine them. <rs id="t17981205-52-verdict281" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street, (produces a saddle and bridle): On Friday, the 3d of November, about eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner knocking at the door of a sadler's, in Worship-street; there was nobody answered from the house; I asked the prisoner who he wanted; he said, Mr. Watson; I told him I would shew him Mr. Watson if he would go with me to a public-house; he said, no; then says I, I will see what you have in your bag; he said, it was a saddle he wanted to get stuffed; I took it to the office, and found it was a saddle and bridle; I asked him where he lived, and he told me; I went, and found it was true.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050058"/>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This was a place, natural enough, to take a saddle to that wanted mending? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He made no scruple of telling you where he lived? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Butler. This is the saddle that I missed, I know it by frequently riding upon it, five or six times a day; I have had it under my care a long time, it is very rough; and the bridle has got a cut about the middle of the rein, which one of my fellow-servants did, in whetting his razor when it was new.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you never see another bridle with a cut in it in your life? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. The saddle you say is rough, was that roughness from wear? - A. No; that would make it smoother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see so rough a one before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is nothing wonderful in that? -

            No.</p>
               <p>White. I believe it is my saddle, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does that saddle want repairing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Be so good as look at the stuffing; does not it want stuffing? - A. No, it does not; and I had given him no orders to get it stuffed.</p>
               <p>Q. It has happened, perhaps, where a man has a friend, a sadler, that he can get it done a little cheaper, it is a common thing for them to take it to their own friend? - A. I do not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Butler.) Q. Had you given him any orders to get this done? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I intended to repair the saddle myself, for fear of anger from my master, and pay for it myself out of my own pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a maaried man? - A. No. The prisoner asked me to give her a glass of something, she had another person with her, and I gave her a glass at the corner of Beech-lane; she had another person with her; she went with us to a house to drink; we came out again, and she asked me if I would walk home with her; I went home with her; there was a man in the room seemed very much in liquor; the man gave some halfpence, and I gave, I believe, five-pence halfpenny to send for two pots of beer, and while the person that I met her with, whom she called her servant, went for it, I fell asleep, and I might sleep about an hour; I did not feel my money go; but when my watch went, I waked, and missed my money; I then saw Mrs. Merritt.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter: On the 11th of November, I was sitting at dinner with my wife and children, somebody knocked at the door, my wife went, and it was the prisoner; says he, will you buy a shirt; he pulled one from under his coat, and she took it up to look at it; and he pulled out a pair of blue pantaloons, and put them on the counter with the shirt; my wife deals in these things to help maintain my family, I work for squire Perry, in the Dock-yard; she asked him if they were his own property, and he said, yes; says she, what shall I give you for them; four shillings, says he; he said he was very poor, and wanted a little money to have a spree with his shipmates; she told him she would give him three shillings for them; on the Friday, when I came home, she told me a man had been and claimed them, that they had got his name upon them; and on the Monday, I was coming down a ladder and saw the prisoner behind me, I was sure it was him; I met a headborough, and we laid hold of him, and took him to Mr. Green's, 'squire Perry's nephew; we had much ado to get him along; we did get him there, but he was not at home; then I took him to the watch-house; I am positive the prisoner is the man that sold them to my wife.

               <p>Q. Are you sure you gave him four guineas? - Yes, I am sure of it; the prisoner was with him, they had got some punch before them; the prisoner wrapped it in a piece of paper, and gave it to the prosecutor, and he put it into his waistcoat-pocket.</p>

            Therefore, if any body has said the prisoner put it in his pocket, and not the prosecutor, that is not true? - A. He did not, to my knowledge, the prisoner wrapped it up in paper, and put it down on the table; the prosecutor then took it up and put it in his pocket, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner had put it in his pocket you must have seen him? - A. Yes; I saw the prosecutor put it in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Williams drunk or sober? - A. I think he was in liquor; the prisoner said, if the young woman cannot get change, I will pay you; they were at the bar first, and had five or six glasses of liquor; then they went into the back room, and the prisoner ordered half-a-crown's-worth of punch; I told him I had no warm water; he said, never mind, make it like sailor's grog.</p>

            Another man, I do not know who he was; I parted from them, and coming through Middle-row again, I met with a shopmate of mine that I had worked with for years; she said to me, we will go and have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050064"/>something to drink, and we went into the Black Dog, and the two prisoners came in, and said, I should not stay there, because it was a bad house; I had two bundles in my hand, and the man prisoner said, he would take care of me; we went into the Black Dog with this woman, and we had a quartern of gin, or a quartern and a half, I cannot say which, and they would not let me part from them before I went up into their apartments, in a court in Broad-street, St. Giles's, I do not know the name of the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at that time? - A. I was not rightly sober; I went up stairs, and staid in their apartments an hour by myself.</p>

               <p>Q. You took a nap, I suppose? - A. Yes; then the woman prisoner came up and said, d-n you, what have you come up to be a w-e to my husband? I said, did you bring me up in this place to use me ill? she then took up her sist, and struck me in the face; I ran out of the room down stairs as hard as I could; the gentlewoman of the house said, I did not think you would bring up a woman to use her so ill; I went into her room, and the prisoner followed me into her room, and beat me there.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Hatton-garden. On Thursday, the 21st of November, the prosecutor came to me, and said, he was robbed in a house in Portpool-lane, and that he had left Jones in custody of the landlord of the house while he came down; when I went there, a man who looked like a coal-heaver, said, Jones was gone to market along with his wife to buy some pigs' heads; I waited about an hour, and then I went and found them apparently both very much in liquor; I searched them both, but could find nothing on them; I brought them to the Magistrate, and they were examined; upon that examination it came out, that they had been having purl and gin at a public-house in Portpool-lane, where they changed a half-guinea: the next day I received the half-guinea from Mary Simpson.(Produces it).</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same half-guinea that I had in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? - A. By the date of it, and particular marks upon the head side; besides, there are two black spots; I had had it in my pocket a month, and been turned away with it I suppose a hundred times.</p>

               <p>Q. What coloured bag was it? - A. It was yellow when it was new; it contained half-a-guinea, a seven shilling piece, and a French half-crown; I never saw it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. And yet, after the Grand Jury had thrown out the first bill upon the very same charge, you went before the Grand Jury again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The first charge was for privately stealing, and it turned out that there was a person saw it, and he preferred another bill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Who told you to go again to the Grand Jury? - A. The Solicitor, I believe, or Sansum, or some other person.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the constable advise you? - A. Yes, and the Solicitor.</p>
               <p>Q. What, the Soicitor for the City of London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your other bill was found - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body else give you any advice upon the subject? - A. We had nobody else with us to give us any advice.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw any body else on the subject? A. I saw a great many people, but not to advise with them.</p>

            Did you know him before the 3d of September? - A. Yes, in the pick-pocket way.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known his person? - A. Three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cork, the prosecutor, on that day? - A. I did, about one o'clock, as near as I can tell; it was at the time that the late Lord-Mayor was going to proclaim Bartholomew-fair; when I saw him first, he was standing behind a coach, I believe a hackney-coach; I saw the prisoner in company with several more.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the names of any of them? - A. Yes, Taylor, Anderson, and himself, were all three together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time see him near Cork? - A. I did; I saw a man who I knew to be a pickpocket, tell the coachman there was a whole lot of people behind; the coachman then desired them to get down; then Anderson went right before Cork, and the prisoner at the bar went between Cork and another man, a countryman; just at that time the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050070"/>state coach went by, and for a minute or two I lost sight of him; then I went on the same side of the way that they were on, when the coach was gone by; then I stood along-side the horses of another coach, next to that coach where Cork stood; the horses heads were to the hind wheels of the other coach; the prosecutor's arm was upon the handle behind the coach; he was very much pressed, though he need not have been pressed, he was pressed sideways; I saw Coleman shoving him in that way, keeping him down, so as to keep him in that posture, bending upon his elbows; I then saw Taylor stoop down; I called out, "butcher, take care of your pockets;" the prosecutor had a blue apron on, like a butcher; I then stooped down, and looked underneath the horse bellies that I was standing along-side; I saw Taylor draw his hand from Cork's right-hand pocket, and give a canvas bag into Coleman's hand; it looked like a dirty canvas bag; then they both ran away one way, and Anderson went another way; there were so many coaches going by, I could not immediately, but as soon as I could, I went to the prosecutor, I told him what I had seen, and who they were.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not apprehend them immediately? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe Coleman was not taken till November last? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was brought up from Hull, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. As you knew Colman's person before, are you sure he is the person that received this dirty canvas bag from Taylor? - A. Yes, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Coleman appear to be dressed? - A. He had on a mixed coat, like the coat he has on now, but it had not a black velvet collar to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have been before the Grand Jury twice this Sessions upon this same business? - A. Yes.</p>

            Being under the horses bellies, you must have stooped? - A. Yes, and so was Taylor upon his knees; I made it my business to look.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Anderson apprehended? - A. Yes, I apprehended him within five minutes afterwards, and he was discharged by order of Mr. Alderman Staines.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he was discharged, had you any conversation with him? - A. I never had; I ordered him to be locked up after he had beat me.</p>
               <p>Q. You drank with him? - A. Yes, I had a glass of gin with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the colour of his money? - A. I have seen the colour of his fathers's money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any money from his father? - A. Yes; when I took Anderson, he having beat me, as there was not susfficient evidence upon this charge, I told the Alderman he had assaulted me in my duty, and I did not mean to let him go, I should charge him with an assault; upon that his father went with me to a public-house, and offered a guinea between Backrow and I, for he had assaulted him too, and kicked his shins; I went back to the Alderman, and told him of the proposal, and he said, if I chose to settle it in that way, I might, and I received a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Anderson was sent to sea, I believe? - A. Yes, I could not swear particularly against him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have known Coleman two or three years? - A. I cannot say whether he has been home from Botany Bay so long; I have seen him in Fleet-street and Newgate-street, among a gang of thieves, and turned him out of different mobs many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Hastings? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And you know Backrow, he is a brother constable of your's? - A. No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. He has been a constable of the City? - A. Yes, till he was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are a City constable? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, if I should call a dozen people, who know Coleman as well as you, to say, that, upon your calling for assistance, Coleman was not there, what should you think of that? - A. They will false swear themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it by your advice that a hand-bill was published? - A. Not by my request, I do not know that I ever mentioned it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that at your desire to the Magistrate, or of the Magistrate's own accord? - A. I recollect now perfectly well, that Sir William Staines mentioned it first.</p>

               <p>Q. Of course you knew him to be pock-freeten? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him not to be pock-fretten? - A. I cannot say whether he is or not, but I know his face perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had seen the advertisement that described Coleman to be a pock-fretten man, would that have answered his description? - A. Yes, to any body that knew him as well as I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear whether he was a pock-fretten man or not? - A. I do not call him a pock-fretten man, I did not draw the bill up; the person that

             the bill up knew nothing at all about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the person who drew the bill up, before it was drawn up? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been such an advertisement as described the prisoner to be a pock-fretten man, should you have supposed that that answered the character of the countenance of that man? - A. If it had been advertised as it was, I should have taken him for the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill - did you not give this sort of account to the Magistrate, in order for its publication? - A. I did not.</p>

            What was the colour of his coat? - A.

            None in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp contended, that the Grand Jury, being a competent jurisdiction, having thrown out a bill for the same offence, the prisoner ought not again to be put in jeopardy. - The objection was over-ruled by the Court.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence I have been an unfortunate man it is true, but I have not been home eighteen months, though Sansum says I have been three or four years; I was not near the place, I am entirely innocent of it, as the witnesses will prove that are about to be called, who are entirely strangers to me.</p>

             sworn - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a cork-cutter, I work at Mr. Hardy's in Little Eastcheap: I was present when the Lord-Mayor went to proclaim Bartholomew-fair, I was standing about four yards and a half from the place where the robbery was done; I saw a man, not the prisoner at the bar, clinging round Mr. Cork, with his arms round his waist; I had seen the same man do the same sort of acts before, I took particular notice of him; I saw him run across the way, and a man that is described by the name of Taylor, which I gave part of his description to Mr. Alderman Staines; one was of a light complexion, and the other of a dark complexion, they both ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known the person with the dark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050073"/>complexion before? - A. Yes, I have seen him go past our shop many times, in the same sort of acts, when I worked in Watling-street, two doors from Bow-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was his name? - A. William Saggers.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not the prisoner at the bar? - A. No, I can swear it was not the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the name of the light complexion man? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what is become of Saggers? - A. He is now in Newgate, under sentence of transportation. The first time I was called up, I said, that I could tell the persons that committed the robbery, but I did not see the prisoner at the bar. I was summoned one day when another Alderman was sitting, and Sansum would not let me be heard before that Alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Samsum say so? - A. Yes. And afterwards I had another summons to come up, and then I said, that the prisoner at the bar was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you assist in apprehending Anderson? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give information to Sansum, by which he might lay hold of Anderson? - A. With respect to Anderson, I did not say any thing about it, but with respect to Saggers, I did; and I gave the description of Taylor too.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there? - A. I may say, nearly half an hour in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when Sansum came up, and Anderson was laid hold of? - A. No, I went to work at that time; I never saw the prisoner with my eyes, till he was brought before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. What are their names? - A. William Newman, Esq. John Newman, and Henry Newman, On Tuesday, the 6th of November, I had some information that our premises had been robbed; I then missed two pieces of leather, which the prisoner had to dress, marked S2; I immediately gave information to Mr. Newman, that I had missed them; I then had orders, when he came to work, to apprehend him, which I should have done, but he did not come to work. (Looks at the leather), Here is the prisoner's mark, with copperas water, S No. 2, and here is Mr. Newman's mark, with ink, a V and a strait stroke, in the hand-writing of Mr. Newman.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050075"/>Q. Had you examined them during the time your apprentice was at work upon them? - A. Yes, I have, they had gone through my hands once.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, from that observation, swear to them? - A. I can.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are employed by Messrs. Newmans, as a person to manufacture their leather? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is leather sold in Giltspur-street by any body? - A. No; but when a customer comes to Mr. Newman's shop, and they have not an article that suits them, they come to me, and pick out what they want, and they are sent to the shop, but then those are always manufactured, and this is not.</p>
               <p>Q. What does it want? - A. To be scowered and rubbed with a stone, then it is hung up in a shed like a tanner's shed to dry, and then oil is put upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a great deal of process before it becomes leather? - A. Yes, it is the middle of the hide.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you do not call it leather till the hide has gone through the process, and becomes fit for sale? - A. Yes, it is leather now, but not curried leather.</p>
               <p>Q. It has had a very little part of the process that is to be applied to it? - A. Only about one-fourth part of it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. These men are certainly mistaken in the person; I had plenty of opportunity to have got off if I had wished it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Colton). Q. Did you leave word what you wanted? - A. Yes; we told his wife and her mother that he was suspected of having stolen some leather from Messrs. Newmans.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you went again, and found him in bed? - A. Yes, about five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Pym). Q. Did the prisoner come to your house after the leather was missing? - A. Never.</p>

On Tuesday, the 4th of December, I missed some Bank-notes, and a suspicion fell upon the prisoner, who had lived with me but ten days; I took some means on the Wednesday to discover it, without effect; on the Thursday I was determined to search his box, and while he was at dinner, I went up stairs with Mrs. Mangnall, I took a bunch of keys up with me, and unlocked his box; he had two boxes in his bed-room, one in which all his clothes were, and the other was concealed from view in a dark corner of the room, covered over with some papers, and in that box I found all the articles mentioned in the indictment; I immediately desired Mrs. Mangnall to go down stairs, and fetch up one of the clerks, Mr. Green, and, in his presence, I locked up the box again, and put it in the same position as where I found it; I immediately sent for a constable, and while I had sent out for a constable, the prisoner asked me leave to go out to see about some shirts, I believe, or something of that sort; I told him he might go out as soon as he had taken up the tea-kettle; when the constable came, I said to him, now you may go out; he then went up stairs into his bed-room; myself, and the constable, and the clerk, followed him up stairs into his bed-room, and, by the time we had got there, he had removed the box from the dark corner, and placed it upon the open box, and his handkerchief was spread upon his bed; I then desired the constable to seize him and search him; the box was then unlocked, but whether he unlocked it, or whether he gave the constable the key to unlock it, I cannot say; the constable then, in the presence of the prisoner, and of Green and myself, took out of the box all the articles mentioned in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179812050076"/>the indictment; I asked the prisoner, article by article, whose they were; says I, whose shirt is that; he said, it was his own, that he had bought it in Field-lane; I asked him whose the small clothes were; he said, they were his own, he had bought them both in Field-lane; the waistcoat I do not know that he did say so; he was then searched and taken to the Compter; I saw him afterwards in the Compter, and asked him where he had got the shirts; he told me he had taken them either out of the drawers, or from the drawers in my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you not tell him it would be better or worse for him if he confessed, or did not confess? - A. I was aware of the consequence of that, and, to the best of my belief, I said no such thing; the small clothes, which were very old, and I had left off, he said he had taken from the laundry-room, adjoining his bedroom, and he was very sorry he had done so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You received a very good character with him? - A. It was that character which induced me to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been the character of an honest laid, or else I am sure you would not have been induced to take him? - A. No doubt of it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a hatter in Fenchurch-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you dealings with Messrs. Maitlands in Basinghall-street? - A. Yes; they are merchants.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the person of the prisoner? - A. Yes; about the 8th or 9th of October, the prisoner came to our warehouse, in Fenchurch-street, he was directed into the accompting-house to me; he said, he would be much obliged to me to let him have one pound nine shillings and sixpence, to give change for a bill of Exchange which he had to receive of Mr. Fourdrinier, on account of Messrs. Maitlands, and that the money would be returned either by himself or a Mr. Bates, whom I knew, at that time, to be in the house of Messrs. Maitlands; I then desired my clerk to let him have it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever after receive that one pound nine shillings and sixpence, either from the prisoner or Bates? - A. No, I did not; the moment he was gone out at the door I had some suspicion of him; he was taken up, I think, in the same month.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I ask you for it on the account of Messrs. Maitlands, upon your oath? - A. You did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. If this man had applied to you on his own account, would you have let him have it? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>JAMES WILSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am servant to Mr. Townend, in Fenchurch-street: On the 9th of October, the prisoner came to our house, and I paid him one pound nine shillings and sixpence by direction of Mr. Townend, a guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and eighteen-pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him to have been in the employ of Messrs Maitlands? - A. Yes; my master asked me that question, and I told him I believed he did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. Did I tell you I lived with Messrs. Maitlands then? - A. You told me you did not want your gentlemen to know it, it was a mistake of your's; but I understood it was on account of Messrs. Maitlands; you told me, it was one pound nine shillings and four-pence you wanted, to take up a bill, and I gave you one pound nine shillings and sixpence; nothing further occurred.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you that I should refund it again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make any communication of that to your master? - A. No; he took the money, and went away.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BATES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a clerk in the house of Messrs. Maitlands: The prisoner was formerly porter, he was discharged, I think, in the month of April, or thereabouts.</p>

            Not to my knowledge; Mr. Sterry takes upon him that department; I have never seen the prisoner from the time he was discharged till I saw him at the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>JOHN NETTLESHIP sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a partner in the house of Messrs. Maitlands; I discharged the prisoner from our service because I detected him in a fallacious answer.</p>

            Certainly not; he once called upon me to intercede to get him into the house again, and I told him I certainly could not; I advised him to get a place as soon as he could, and behave better than he had done with us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I lived in Mr. Maitland's service three years, and having been in the habit of going to Mr. Townend's, I went there, and asked for this money; I told the young man I did not wish the house of Maitlands to know it, because it was for a purpose of my own; I intended to refund it again, and in about nine days after, I was taken to the Mansion-house. They wanted me to go for an East India soldier, which I refused, I was willing to go to sea; and I did not know till yesterday morning that there was a bill found against me. <rs id="t17981205-77-verdict407" type="verdictDescription">

            , as follows:</p>
               <p>John Collins - You were indicted at the last September Sessions, for forging and counterfeiting stamps, denoting a stamp duty of 2s. imposed upon hats, and upon that indictment you were tried and convicted. Your sentence was then respited, upon an objection that was taken by the learned Gentleman who was of Counsel for you; he desired that that objection should be referred to the Twelve Judges for their opinion, and I am now to give the sense of the Judges upon that question so referred.</p>
               <p>The doubt arose upon two Acts of Parliament. By the 24th of his present Majesty, chap. 5l. fect. 1, this duty of 2s. among many others, is imposed, By the 8th section of that Act, a stamp, such as the Commissioners should direct, was to be put upon hats in the lining of the crown, and, by the 25th section, counterfeiting such stamp was made a capital offence.</p>
               <p>Afterwards it was thought proper by athe Legistature to repeal that Act, and imposed the same duty upon hats to be stamped in a different manner than they had been under the former Act. That was an Act of the 36th of his present Majesty, chap. 125, fect. 1. So much of the Act of the 24th as related to stamped papers being placed in hats was repealed. By the 36th, a new mode of stamping hats is directed, by stamping the lining itself, instead of affixing a stamp ticket to the crown of the hat; and, by the 19th section, counterfeiting this new stamp is made a capital offence.</p>
               <p>The objection taken by the learned Counsel for the prisoner was, that as the duty was imposed by the 24th, as the stamp that has been counterfeited is directed to be used by the Act of the 36th, and as the counterfeiting such stamp is by that Act made capital, the indictment ought to have concluded "against the form of the statutes," in the plural number; whereas this indictment concluded, "against the form of the statute." Now, it is very clear, that the whole of the Act of the 24th is repealed; there is no part of it adopted in the subsequeat Act, but only that the same duty of 2s. shall be imposed. So that it seems the whole of the provisions of that Act are entirely done away.</p>
               <p>This case was referred upon the first day of the last Term to all the Judges, when they were all assembled together, and, upon the fullest consideration and discussion of the point, all of them were very clearly of opinion, that the conclusion of the indictment, "against the form of the statute," was quite sufficient for the purpose. There is a case to that effect in 1 Sider in, 348. The Judges are therefore unanimously of opinion, that the prisoner at the bar was properly convicted.</p>
