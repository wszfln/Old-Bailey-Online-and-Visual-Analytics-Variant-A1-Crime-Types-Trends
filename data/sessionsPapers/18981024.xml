                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant</hi> 36 <hi rend="italic">G R</hi>). On Saturday, the 1st of this month. I was on duty at Wilmer Gardens, Kingsland Road—James Baldwin, police-constable, was on fixed point duty about nine o'clock at night—it was his duty to remain on duty there till one o'clock on the 3rd—if there was any disturbance in the neighbourhood near Ware Street it would be his duty to leave the fixed point and go towards it—I was on duty in Kingsland Road about ten minutes past twelve—I saw Baldwin there, at the corner of Wilmer Gardens—there were a number of people in Kingsland Road, about four yards from the corner of Wilmer Gardens—there is a public-house at the corner—the people were standing on this side of Wilmer Gardens, near the street lamp at the corner—there were about six or seven of them—Baldwin was about four yards from me, at the corner of Wilmer Gardens—I saw the prisoner there wrangling with Baldwin—I went up to where they were, and said to the prisoner, "Old chap, we don't want no trouble with you, get out of it"—he turned and went down Wilmer Gardens—he was alone at that time—Baldwin and I followed him down about sixty or seventy yards—the prisoner then said, "All right, governor, I will go"—I turned to Baldwin and said, "We will get back to the road," and we turned back</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189810240015"/>
               <p>towards Kingsland Road—I saw Baldwin follow me two or three yards—I went on to the corner of Kingsland Road, I thought Baldwin was following me—I saw a crowd in Kingsland Road—I then missed Baldwin, and I rushed back to the corner of Wilmer Gardens, and saw Baldwin struggling with the prisoner, about thirty yards down Wilmer Gardens—I have found out since that it was opposite 99—I ran down immediately to the assistance of Baldwin—I saw the prisoner with this knife in his right-hand—previous to that Baldwin shouted out to me, "Look out; he has got a knife"—Baldwin had hold of the pri<lb/>soner by the back of his neck and by his left-hand—when I got up I seized the prisoner's right-hand where the knife was, and I closed the blade with my right-hand, and it cut the prisoner's thumb and across the finger—I wrenched the knife away from him—while this was going on Baldwin kept his hold of the prisoner until the arrival of Constable Bendall and another constable—Bendall took hold of the prisoner by his left-hand and left-arm—the prisoner tried to slip his coat off and escape, and Bendall drew his truncheon and struck him across the head—I told Bendall I had got the knife, and the two of us took him—Baldwin followed us into Kingsland Road—I did not see him get into a cab, but I believe he did and went in it to the Hoxton Station—two constables came to our assistance and we took the prisoner to the station—he was very violent on the way—we took him into the charge room—later on I took him to the North Metropolitan Hospital, where Baldwin had been taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My attention was first called to this matter by a large number of persons wrangling—when I asked the prisoner to go away he seemed quite willing to go—he went towards the lodging-house—I did not see whether he entered or not—there was a rough lot in Kingsland Road, and I hurried back, thinking Baldwin was following me—the last time I saw him he was about three yards behind—there was nobody else there except three women—they were all four or five yards behind him—directly after I blew my whistle a great crowd came round, and we were pelted with flower-pots and water.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Hollington, a chair carver, of 58, Cambridge Heath Road—on the evening of September 19th the prisoner came to my shop and asked me to have a drink; he sent for drink, which we had in my shop with two more friends—he is my daughter's young man—he asked if he should shut the shop up for me, and asked me to go to the Northampton to have a drink with the two friends, and we went and had it—my daughter was not there—we came out, and when I got to the top of Northampton Street I received a blow, and fell to the ground—I do not remember anything more until I was picked up by a constable—the prisoner struck the blow, and I saw him knocked to the ground by some lad in the street—I did not see anything in his hand—I was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 76, James Street, Bethnal Green, and am a widow—I was with the prosecutrix—as we came out of the Northampton, and got to the corner of Northampton Street the prisoner took a knife from up his sleeve—my daughter said, "Mother, Jack has got a knife! "and before I could call to Mrs. Hollington he plunged it into her breast—he made two stabs at the back that cut her bodice, but did not penetrate the flesh—they both fell—there had been no angry words of any description—her stays saved her life, no doubt—she was not the worse for drink, but the prisoner was—2 1/2 pints were had in the shop between five people, and I think two pots of ale were called for in the public-house.</p>

                  </hi> (416 <hi rend="italic">J</hi>). I heard some cries about 11.5 p.m., on Sep<lb/>tember 19th—I saw prisoner in Cambridge Heath Road running towards Whitechapel Road pursued by some people—they shouted, "Stop him, governor, stop him! he has stabbed a woman two or three times; he is an Italian; be careful of him, he has got a knife"—I pursued him and caught hold of him with my right hand by the back of his neck and held his arm with my left hand—he turned round with the knife and made a plunge at my breast, and said "Take that, you b—"—the knife was 3 or 3 1/2 inches long; I jumped back to avoid being stabbed, and as I did so he got away from me, and started to run again—I took my truncheon out, got up to him, and hit him on his left shoulder, and ran him up against the shutters of a shop—another constable came up to my assistance; I said "Be careful, he has got a knife"—the prisoner turned</p>

               <p>round and said, "I have not got a knife by me; you must see I have not got a knife by me"—we took him into custody; after going a few yards towards the station the prosecutrix came up with another constable and said "That is the man who <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it; I shall charge him"—I said, "What has he done!"—she said "Look here, he has stabbed me in the breast"—she appeared sober, but very much excited—she was taken to the London Hospital—I afterwards found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the gutter where he was arrested, but I do not believe this is the knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 409, Bethnal Green Road, and am assistant divisional surgeon—the prosecutrix was brought to the Police-station bleeding freely from a wound in her right breast a little over an inch wide and over two inches deep—it was downwards and upwards, into the substance of the breast—if it had gone directly backwards probably it would have been fatal; but as it was, it would prove serious from the amount of hemorrhage if attention had not been given to it at the time—it was produced by a sharp-cutting instrument—I do not think that the knife produced would cause it—it is an old, rusty, blunt knife—I should expect the blade to be much wider, longer, and much sharper—everything was saturated with blood.</p>

On September 15 I saw Corsi in the hospital—he made a statement to me, and I went the same afternoon with Sabatino to 83, Goswell Road, and found Lorenzo—Sabatino said "That is the man who shot Corsi"—I told Lorenzo that I was a con<lb/>stable and should take him for shooting Corsi—he said in English, "Not me, my brother"—I took him to the station and he was charged and placed with eight others, and one of the Annicellis picked him out, and on the day of the remand he was picked out in one of the rooms at the back of the Police-court by Corsi and young Annicelli—the brothers are alike.</p>

I keep a school at 3, Paul Street, and have sometimes acted as an interpreter—on the morning of September 13th a policeman came and asked me to go to Hoxton Police-station—I found these people there—I knew nearly all of them by sight—Pasquale was charged with shooting at Corsi, and wounding him on his shoulder—I interpreted it—he said that he did not intend to shoot Corsi; he intended to shoot Sabatino, because he had assaulted his brother—I afterwards went when Lorenzo was charged; he said that he did not know anything about it.</p>

I was house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on the morning of the 13th Corsi was brought there with a large wound on his left lower rib, and another on his shoulder—he has the bullet in him now—the wounds were not dangerous—he was in the hospital ten days—he has consumption—there is a tiny hole in the shoulder of his shirt, from which I draw the inference that it must have been a much smaller bullet than this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but the graze on his side might have been caused by a bigger bullet by one of this size, and it must have been oblique.</p>

I was watching in Fairing<lb/>don Street on September 28th at midday—Moore left his employer's stores and joined Girling—they went to Ludgate Circus when Moore left him and went to Ludgate Hill—Girling previously handed him a brown paper parcel—Moore then met Whittal—they walked through the Old Bailey to Smithfield, Moore handing the parcel to Whittal, who went away—Moore returned to work at 2 o'clock—I was in Stonecutter Street on October 4th about 1 o'clock and saw Moore leave the works and go to St. Bride Street and Ludgate Hill and then to the Old Bailey, where Whittal was standing some distance up; Moore made a motion with his right hand, Whittal came opposite the entrance to the Sessions House and they walked together down the Old Bailey and went into the private bar of the Old London Tavern, they called for a drink—after a time Moore took from his jacket pockets these parcels (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and handed them to Whittal—they are inner tubes—they remained in the public-house about twenty minutes—they then walked to Ludgate Circus and separated—I followed Whittal to the Park Cycle Works, Park Road, Battersea, where he showed the proprietor some of the tubes—I went to him and said, "I am a police-officer. Where did you get those tubes from?"—he said. "I bought them in the City"—I said "Where?"—he said "I bought them honestly; that's good enough for you"—I said, "You will have to come back to the City with me"—he said, "All right"—I took him to the detective office, Old Jewry, searched him and found two memoranda.</p>

I first met with Moore in Battersea Park one Sunday, riding round—he had an accident with his pedal—I had a spanner with me and tightened it and we rode round the park—he said, "Are you in the line?"—I said, "Yes," and gave him one of my cards—he said, "I can do business with you, and will give you a call someday"—Just before Whitsun he brought me a repair; a party had run into someone—I charged him 11s.</p>

"He said, "To the Detective Office "and I went with him—I told him before I got ten yards away who I bought them "of—he said, "You bought them of a man with <hi rend="italic">specs</hi>"—I said "Yes; Mr. Moore"—I cannot account for Abbott saying I understand you refuse to give the name—I examined the bicycle before I bought it, I have examined it several times—I did not know where the number was—I have been in the trade three years—I have not taken out the figure 2 and do not know anything about it—it looks as if newly done—I do not suggest it has been done since it has been in the possession of the police—it is bright—it has been ridden scores of times—I never cleaned it—it used to be kept on the floor of the shop—this is the first time I have seen that the number has been tarn<lb/>pered</p>

                  </hi>. I am an interpreter, of 11, Poland Street—on Septem<lb/>ber 13th I was called to Marlborough Street Police-station to assist in taking the charge against the prisoners, and their answers—the charge was obtaining £3 from Mr. Jacobs—in answer to the charge Todt said, "I have only come to England about a week or ten days. I came from America; I have been living in a town called Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. On leaving there I met a man whom I knew. I bad 240 dollars in gold. He knew I was going abroad. He said tome, 'What do you want to carry all this gold with you for? I shall change it for you, and give you paper, being about to go on board a ship you do not want to carry it in your pocket.' He handed me twenty-four of those 10 dollar bills. On arrival in Liverpool I went to a clothier and bought the suit of clothes I am wearing now; I paid one 10-dollar bill and they were good enough, so I changed another in order that I could have my fare from Liverpool to London; when I came to London I met Singer and asked him where to change the money"—Singer made no reply—Todt said Singer went about with him and told him where to change the money—he said the prosecutor had cheated him out of £3 because he ought to have given him £6 for the thirty dollars and that Singer cheated him of one dollar—he was charged before the Magistrate on September 13th, 20th, and 27th, and then made answers—these are the correct statements before the Magistrate (<hi rend="italic">produced and read), Todt says</hi>: "On my arrival in London from Liverpool I met a constable and asked him to show me a place where I could exchange American money; he directed me down a street, I went to a Jew there and other places, and they said they did not know what money it was. I came to the West End and met Singer, I asked if he knew where I could change the money; he asked for some and I gave him some; he went away and brought it back; he showed me a sovereign and said that was the value of ten dollars and I be<lb/>lieved him; he said, 'Give that to me and I will find some one to change it,' we met Konovsky, who took us to Jacobs, where we got the money "</p>

I live at 6, Wilson Street, Crescent Road—on Monday night, October 3rd, I was walking past the White Swan—I met Mr. Hawkins, who asked me how I was getting on—I said, "All right, is there any chance of a drink?"—he gave me 7d.—I got a pot of ale with two friends—I heard a cry of "Murder!"—an Italian, was striking his wife—I went up and said, "What do you want to do that for?"—he struggled with me and drew a knife—Bartle stopped him—then he ran in the public-house—he had another plunge at me, but Bartle caught his arm—his wife came—she threw a glass, and said, "Take that, you dirty <hi rend="italic">tyke</hi>" and "That is supposed to be my hus<lb/>band, but I have not lived with him for twelve months, had it not been for you and the gentleman, I should have been murdered"—the prose<lb/>cutor came back with a constable—a sergeant came—the wife said, "He tried to stab me, I give him in charge for trying to stab me three times"—at the station there was no Italian interpreter, and the prosecutor spoke for ten minutes, and I only know a word or two—the inspector asked what it was all about—the sergeant said, "Assault and attempt to rob"—then the wife was asked—she said, "Those two men attempted to rob my husband"—I said, "It is a d—lie"—the inspector said, "You sit down; you are drunk"—I said, "What about the prosecutor? you have no business to take drunken people's evidence"—the inspector said, "How much was in your pocket?"—the prosecutor said, "3s. 11d.," "What have you lost?" "6s. 8d,"—do you think I could have all that without some flying all over the floor? or that I would not have it in my possession if I took it.</p>

E. Fenton, a solicitor, who, I understood at the time, was acting for Mrs. Cath<lb/>cart; that was the representation to me—I accounted for it to Mr. Wilkins in the ordinary course and left him to deal with or account for it—the next I heard about the matter was when Mr. Deakins's clerk applied to me about June this year—I knew nothing of any proceedings in January connected with this judgment under with a writ of sequestra<lb/>tion was issued: my attention was not in any way called to it.</p>

I am managing clerk to Hammond and Richards, solicitors, of 26, Lincoln's Inn Fields—in the early part of 1895 Mr. Fenton, a solicitor, whom I knew very well, made a request of me about a judgment debt against Mrs. Cathcart—this document, dated February 27th, 1895, was then brought into existence—it is in Mr. Fenton's writing, and purports to be signed by Mr. Walker, and to be an assign<lb/>ment to me of a judgment debt for £17 15s. 6d., for which I was to pay exactly that amount, under an order which is cited in it. the judgment debt being dated January 21st, 1895, in the action of "Cathcart <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Walker"—I paid Mr. Fenton the precise amount—I have not got my cheque-books for that period with me—I have been convinced from the date of the transaction that I paid him the exact amount, whatever the</p>

               <p>amount was—I said before the Magistrate I paid the £17 odd—it was no benefit to me to buy the judgment debt for the full value; I did it as a kindness to Fenton and to oblige him—he was not acting for Mrs. Cathcart; he said he wanted to acquire the debt to assist him in re<lb/>covering certain claims he had got against Mrs. Cathcart; that she owed him a large sum for costs which he could not get paid—he was to see me right out of the matter; that was the expression—I ultimately sold the debt, and so recovered my money—Fenton effected the Bale for me to Perry on January 4th, 1898—I was then repaid what I had paid for it, I cannot say that I received the exact amount—I received a cheque from Fonton in February this year for £200, which I understood included this item; Fenton acted for me in many matters—I am not able to individu<lb/>alise the repayment of the £20—he owed me more than £200, but he had certain costs against me—I do not know of any document showing that the £20 6s. 6d. was part of the £200 paid on account of a larger debt—beyond the assignment there is no document to show the amount I paid—I said when I was examined in July, "I have not had the £20 odd named in the document; I understand Fenton received it; I have not had it"—I also said I had had this cheque for £200 on account—Fenton had been Mrs. Cathcart's solicitor, and he asked me to buy a debt due from her to enable him to have a hand over her and to use it in some shape legiti<lb/>mate I suppose—I never applied to Mrs. Cathcart for the money, I left it in Fenton's hand—I let the thing be dormant for three years, and finally I assigned it to Perry—I executed the assignment to Perry on whatever date it bears in Fenton's presence and gave it to Fenton to complete—I knew Rodwell as Mr. Hood Barr's clerk—I knew him after he left Mr. Hood Barr's—I understood he transferred his articles to Mr. Cudby—I was introduced to Mr. F. W. Lewis by Rodwell some time last year—I know Rodwell's writing fairly well—the attesting clause to Exhibit 18 A is in Fenton's writing, and the document itself in Rodwell's.</p>

               <p>debt for over £1,000 due to me from Mrs. Cathcart—I had disbursed for Mrs. Cathcart over £1,000—I knew she was a woman of property, and I knew also it was practically impossible to recover the debt; she con<lb/>tended that no part of her property was available for the purposes of execution, and I was so advised by eminent counsel—the order by the Court of Appeal in January, 1895, dismissing the appeal and allowing the costs was mentioned to me by Mr. Tickner, who was the solicitor on the other side, as being in existence—I asked a client of mine, Mr. Walter Lewis, if he would pay the amount and buy the debt—he agreed—I told him I had not Mrs. Catrtcart's authority to pay the debt, and therefore if I paid it, it would be necessary to take some steps to keep the debt alive, so that it could be recoverable against Mrs. Cathcart, and I proposed that he should buy it, because it was the one particular debt I knew of which was recoverable, and because the order was made under Mr. Cozens Hardy's Act of the previous year—Lewis gave me the money in cash. I think—probab'y he would give me a cheque or something of that kind—I should think, I had a record of the payment of that sum; I don't know if there is one—I knew of the reas ignment of the debt in January, 1898—I attested the signature—between February, 1895, and January, 1898, the debt was mentioned, but nothing definite was said—Mr. Lewis had been out of his money for some years, and he wanted to get it—it was a judgment debt, that was only bearing interest at four per cent., and was not being enforced—I know Rodwell—I know Lewis as a solicitor—I know Cudby as a practising solicitor—document 18A is in Rodwell's writing, and I attested it—the £20 6s. 6d. was paid in relation to that assignment on the day that it was executed by F. W. Lewis, who was the solicitor in the matter to me—I have not brought any record of the pay<lb/>ment; probably it would be shown in my accounts—if it was paid to me it was paid to me on behalf of Lewis only, and accounted for to him about that time, or shortly afterwards—I do not think there was any specific payment, because I have a large number of transactions with Lewis.

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Deakin &amp; Co., solicitors, of Stepney, who acted for Mrs. Cathcart in January, 1898—her affairs went through my hands and I have taken much part in the conduct of them since they have been left to Messrs, Deakin—I am per<lb/>fectly conversant with her affairs—the assignment purporting to be dated January 8th, 1898, did not come to my notice nor to Mr. Deakin's notice—I did not know of the proceedings taken at Chambers or of the issue of a writ of sequestration till May 27th when I searched and found it at the Law Courts—my principal directed me to search because he heard that Perry and Lewis had gone down to Wootton and collected rents on May 18th—the affairs of Mrs. Cathcart were in the hands of Messrs. Deakin on more than one occasion before the Court of Appeal in the spring months of this year, and daring those months an investi<lb/>gation was conducted for the Court of Appeal by Master Wilberforce one of the Masters of the Supreme Court—that, among other things, was in relation to this writ of sequestration of Mrs. Cathcart's property—I was present in Court on May 19th, 1898, when the Court of Apped made an order, of which this is an office copy. (<hi rend="italic">This order, addressed to Lewis and Rodwell as sequestrators and receivers, appointed under the order to file accounts of all moneys received by them, referred to Master Wilber-force to enquire and report what moneys had been received by Lewis and Rodwell, ordered them to pay over such moneys as the Master considered they were accountable for, and restrained them from taking any further pro<lb/>ceedings under the writ of sequestration against Mrs. Cathcart or her properly pending the appointment of another receiver</hi>)—Lewis, Ratcliffe, and Rodwell were present in the Court of Appeal when that order was made—the matter was argued from the bar—it only came to my knowledge, through my principal, on May 27th that on May 18th, 19th, and 20th Perry, Rodwell, and Lewis were at Wootton collecting Mrs. Cathcart's rents—I did not know it when it was being done—neither my principal nor I knew anything of Perry, or of the assignment of Lewis's debt to Perry—I searched for the first time on May 27th to see if any such order had gone out for the issue of a sequestration writ, and my principal and I then became aware for the first time of the</p>

               <p>summons of January 12th, followed by the writ of January 26th—at the beginning of January when we were acting for Mrs. Cathcart no one told us that Ratcliff had given his consent to a writ of sequestration—in the course of my search I found filed this office copy of the summons of January 12th, 1898, and this consent of January 19th; this is the original signed by E. T. Ratcliff for the plaintiff—Master Wilberforce was continuing his inquiry at the end of May and into June—I was present on June 5th when Ratcliff attended before the Master—he was asked why he had con<lb/>sented to the summons and counsel handed him the original summons; he said it was immaterial, as it was more a matter of course—the Master had not then before him, so far as I am aware, any evidence of Ratcliff having got a garnishee order on the money obtained by the sequestration—the Master made a note of Ratcliff's answers on that occasion—I knew in the searing of this year that Ratcliff was making claims against Mrs. Cathcart in relation to costs—I am not aware that this bill came into my hands or those of my principal or of Mrs. Cathcart—I became aware of the fact that on May 10th Ratcliff signed judgment for the amount of his bill of costs—I became aware of the effort made by him to garnishee the money in Perry's hand—I cannot say when I became aware of it—I correct what I said on Saturday that it was May 27th, 1898; it was June 17th when I made search in relation to these matters—on the 21st I discovered proceedings were taken under a writ of sequestration—my watch was after the arrest of Ratcliff—these documents were found upon him in relation to proceedings for costs against Mrs. Cathcart—on June 20th, 1890, I issued a summons to set aside the judgment Ratcliff had obtained on May 10th—on July 16th, an order was obtained to set aside the judgment—an affidavit was made by my principal and by Mrs. Cath<lb/>cart denying that proceedings had been brought and another affidavit by Ratcliff denying that—on August 11th, an order was made for Ratcliffe to pay £270 into Court within seven days, the difference between £30 and £300 collected on May 18th—this affidavit was made in support of it by Mr. Deakin, my principal. (<hi rend="italic">That in batch of faith the plaintiff signed judg<lb/>ment in default of defence, and that Mrs. Cathcart received no notice that he had signed, and he was not aware till June</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th, when he was at Bow Street, that Perry admitted collecting rents for Mrs. Cathcart and had received</hi> £200 <hi rend="italic">under a garnishee order</hi>)—Mr. Cudby represented the defendants at Bow Street—no affidavit was made in reply by Ratcliff—on August 18th Ratcliff appealed against the order and filed this affidavit. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had acted for Mrs. Cathcart for a year from January</hi>, 1897)—Mr. Justice Phillimore dismissed the appeal with costs—Ratcliff was present when the summons was made before the Master on June 15th—I heard him say he consented to the writ of sequestration, and there is a note in Master Wilberforce's book—when asked whether he consented, he said it was immaterial whether he had or not; it was all a matter of course—I know Ratcliff's writing—the letter of December 16th, 1897, to Mr. Alfred Vincent who assists Master Wilberforce is Ratcliffe's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This was in answer to a letter form Mr. Vincent in "Hood Barrs v.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD COLERIDGE</hi>. I swore the information, which was the foundation of this charge: that Ratcliff had consented collusively on behalf of Mrs. Cathcart to an order dated January 21st, 1895; that I had searched at the Royal Courts of Justice, and could find no such order; that Perry was not a creditor of Mrs. Cathcart, and was not entitled to issue a writ of sequestration against her; that the order was fraudulently drawn up by Frederick William Lewis; and that the writ of sequestra<lb/>tion was obtained by Lewis to enable him, Rodwell and Perry to defraud Mrs. Cathcart—I believed that Ratcliff had consented to an order, which he knew to be non-existent—I now find there was an order—Mr. Deakin commenced acting for Mrs. Cathcart in December last—I knew she had employed other solicitors—usually a notice of change is served upon the solicitor previously employed—I believe a notice was served on Mr. Rat<lb/>cliff in writing—that would not be in Mr. Deakin's letter-book, because it would be on a form, and signed by Mrs. Cathcart—I imagine I saw her sign it, but I would not swear positively; she signed so many things—the document should be filed—I cannot say whether it was—that is the practice—I think Mr. Nutt applied to me about it—I think this year—I am not answering from surmise, but from what I heard from Mr. Stringer, there have been so many solicitors employed—I cannot give you the date—I have not searched the file for such a document—I can produce no copy entry or letter to verify my assertion—I cannot give the date when Mr. Deakin issued a summons against Ratcliff to produce his bill of costs—there was a summons taken out—I have not my papers, and cannot tell you from memory—I have no doubt we can produce the order—Mr. Deakin's office is at Stepney—it would be about January 18th, 1898—there were two bills to costs—the amount of that delivered was £448 3s. 9d.—I have never seen a bill of June 8th, 1897, and Mrs. Cathcarb denied having received it—the action is brought against Mrs. Cathcart for that bill—our summons on January 19th, 1898, was for a bill of costs in the whole matter, and there was no suggestion at that time that Ratcliff had ever delivered such a bill—a writ was issued for the bill of costs on March 10th, and the not proceeding was an attachment, so far as I can recollect without the papers—I cannot say whether a bill was de<lb/>livered on March 10th—I believe there was a bill showing a sum of £734 7s. 2d.—I never saw the bill Mrs. Cathcart swears she never re<lb/>ceived—the bill produced is the only one I saw—Mrs. Cathcart has letters addressed to the District Messengers' Office, 27, Chancery Lane, but not all documents—since Mr. Deakin has been acting, I have never been for any documents there—I have seen documents which have been addressed there—she has stayed at Horrex's Hotel for some time—she objected to documents being sent to her hotel—both judgments on the bills of costs were set aside.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I cannot fix the date from memory, but the attachment against Ratcliff for non<lb/>delivery of his costs was about March of this year—on March 10th the writ was issued by Ratcliffe for £448, having relation to the bill alleged to have been delivered previous to June, 1897—there was no mention of any other bill, even when the attachment came on—subsequently another writ was issued in relation to another bill of costs, but I cannot give the date without the papers—I will pro<lb/>duce all the documents having relation to the bills of costs-both appeals by Ratcliff were dismissed—an order was made on August 6th to set aside judgment of August 4th; Ratcliff appealed on August 11th; that was dismissed with costs by Mr. Justice Lawrence—then the other appeal was in the same form—these proceedings were taken on behalf of Mrs. Cathcart by Mr. Deakin—afterwards the case came into the hands of the Treasury solicitor—then it was ascertained there had been an order of January, 1895.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">LORD COLERIDGE</hi>. Mr. Quick, of 11.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Defendant) sworn.</hi> I have been a solicitor of the High Court since Michaelmas, 1869—I first spoke to Mrs. Cathcart on August Bank Holiday, 1896—she came to my office to swear some affidavits—I had a long conversation with her—on January 28th, 1897, I was retained by her in all matters then in progress—she was then engaged in litigation very heavily—in one action in the House of Lords, though judgment has not been given, it is in her favour—I have no doubt of it—in "Hood Barrs "I obtained an order which was approved by the highest authority, Lord Justice Rigby—that was after discussion with Hood Barrs—it was approved by my counsel, Mr. Montague Lush, and put an end to that litigation, the chief point being that all accounts were to be taken by Master Wilberforce and 4 percent, was to be paid on any balance found due to Hood-Barrs, at Mrs. Cathcart's death, and that neither should bring any action against the other—the inquiry before Master Wilberforce was in the beginning of 1897—about the end of October she was annoyed at finding out this agreement and sent a notice to the effect "How can you act against Mr. Hood Barrs after that agreement?"—so I considered my retainer cancelled as regards Mr. Hood Barrs—I never had any other withdrawal of the retainer from her or Mr. Deakin—it is usual to give notice of the change of solicitor, and when I was appointed I wrote to her solicitor, saying "I am now acting for Mrs. Cathcart in all her matter'—I never received any notice of such change and did not consider my retainer at an end until I had a summons to deliver my bill of casts and to give up my papers about the end of February</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189810240066"/>
               <p>—I remember the letter of January 19th, 1896, from Mr. Deakin [<hi rend="italic">asking for papers and staling Mr. Ratcliffe had been seen with Lewis and Rodwell in a wine shop in Chancery Lane</hi>]—I considered then I ceased to act—it was untrue that I was with Lewis and Rodwell in a wine shop and I contra<lb/>dicted it in a letter—I was often with Rodwell—I may have seen Lewis and Rodwell at the office that morning—I was introduced to Rodwell by Mrs. Cathcart, who paid him so much a week to assist her and me in her litigation against Hood Barrs—he drew my papers for the House of Lords appeal—Lewis then was a clerk to Mr. Cudby, a solicitor in Chancery Lane—I did no work for and made no charge against Mrs. Cathcart since that date—I communicated with her through the District Messengers in Chancery Lane, at her desire, as she did not want her ad<lb/>dress known—in 1897 I made out her bill and handed it to her in my office on June 8th, 1897, when it is dated—it was drawn up and endorsed in the ordinary way and engrossed by my law stationer, Mr. Noad, of Carey Street—I have not the receipt—I could get it this afternoon—I swear I delivered it—she promised to give me money on account, but I got very little of it—cash payments were made with which I credited her and brought into the account when I delivered it on March 10th, 1898—I took no proceedings upon it till March—she had forty to fifty writs of sequestrations against her extending over years—she introduced Bod<lb/>well as her special sequestrator—in "Grey <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Cathcart" it was held there could be no objection to sequestration in the face of a judgment—with a narrow writ you can only collect the debts due and payable at the date of the judgment—that was decided in "Hood Barrs <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Elliott"—with a wide writ you can seize for a debt when it is due at the time of judgment or not, but a wide writ is only applicable where a married woman com<lb/>mences proceedings, and not where proceedings are commenced against her—it was idle to resist a writ of sequestration—in "Cathcart <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Walker" the writ was in respect of the costs of appeal—the summons was served upon me, returnable on January 17th—I did not know Perry by sight when the summons for the writ was issued—I attended as I thought on behalf of Mrs. Cathcart—I knew most of the details of the litigation—I asked for adjournment—the Master said there was no answer and made the order—I did not consent, but I did not see my way to oppose—subse<lb/>quently I received Mr. Deakin's summons and delivered my bill after a time—I was unwell—I had no object in delay—it included the earlier bill and gave the total sum—I received no communication to the effect that I had not delivered my former bill—I issued a writ with regard to the bill delivered in 1897—Mr. Deakin entered an appearance—then a month after delivery of the second bill I issued a writ for that—Mr. Deakin entered appearance, and after the time for defence had expired I signed judgment on both bills—if the bill had not been delivered that would have been a good defence—I first heard of Perry having collected Mrs. Cathcart's rent when his solicitor, Mr. Turner, told me he had collected £300, and that he had a sum on which I could get a garnishee—I immediately took out a garnishee—I was astonished, because Rodwell had told me although he was not restrained by the Court of Appeal in that matter, he did not intend to collect any more rents—I had no com<lb/>munication with Perry before he collected the rents—Perry when I was</p>

               <p>introduced asked what he had better do, and I recommended him to get another sequestration, and appoint F. P. Moore, a man of substance and a client of Mr. Turner, and I understood they applied to appoint him, but were advised no to collect-from what Mr. Turner told me I thought the £270 would be far better in my hands than in the hands of Lewis or Terry—I wished to get it in as quickly as possible, and if it was to be repaid I could repay it; Lewis might have <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> with it—the writ commands the person who holds it to collect all and to account, and he has to carry his accounts before the Master, who has to sanction what is being done—on the occasion that the Court of Appeal delivering judgment restraining Lewis and Rodwell from acting as sequestrators I reached the Court, when Mr. Kent told me it was all over—Rodwell told me they had been restrained from collecting Mrs. Cathcart's rent in certain specified actions—considering I had a just debt against Mrs. Cathcart I served a garnishee summons upon Perry under which he handed me £270—I I was not present when he filed his accounts before the Master—I learned that the Master refused to confirm Perry's accounts—a summons was taken out under Order 30—the judgments were upset—I paid the £270 into Court—I asked the Master to give me his reason, and after some trouble he agreed, and my solicitor has the endorsement on the summons—the reason was purely technical—my claim against Mrs. Cathcart till exists, and I should go to the Court of Appeal on the question—the sequestra<lb/>tions were made necessary because Mrs. Cathcart would not pay, she has nearly £6,000 a year, nobody gets a shilling without a sequestration, and while I was acting for her she has been sued by nearly every hotel-keeper in London, I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MATHEWS</hi>. My retainer is dated January 27th, 1897—during that year I had no serious difference with Mrs. Cathcart till the question arose with regard to the agreement with Hood Barre—that was some time in October; because I was at a rent audit—otherwise we remained good friends—she did not tell me I no longer acted for her—she did not think the agreement was as beneficial to her as I did—she did not accuse me of having betrayed her interest in having signed it—she said I ought not to have done it without her express instructions—she thought it was better for the litigation to go on—she simply cancelled my acting in Hood Barrs—I had known F. W. Lewis about ten years—he is the man who absconded—he was never a friend—I knew Mr. Cudby when I began to act for Mrs. Carthcart—Mrs. Cathcart intro<lb/>duced me to Rodwell within a day of my being retained by her—I was very often with Rodwell, and occasionally with Cudby, in 1897—I re<lb/>member Mr. Vincent, Master Wilberforce's clerk's letter of December 11th, 1897, containing the phrase, "If you have ceased to be the defend<lb/>ant' solicitor, the Master would be glad if you would kindly forward this letter on," and I answered that on December 16th, 1897, heading the letter, "Hood-Barrs," when I stated, "I am not now acting as the solicitor of Mrs. Cathcart. I have sent a copy of your letter on to her as requested"—I thought that was clear, without putting "in the above matter"—I sent the letter to the District Messenger's Office—in Decem<lb/>ber I knew that Mr. Deakin was acting in Hood-Barrs—I understood in nothing else—Mrs. Cathcart very often divides her favours.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">other letters were handed to witness</hi>). I may be a bad letter<lb/>writer but I still say I believed I was acting for Mrs. Cathcart in other matters than Hood Barrs—I have never had the withdrawal of her re<lb/>tainer—she often sent letters in express envelopes—I got them—in Janu<lb/>ary, I have heard since, Mrs. Cathcart was laid up, but I did not know it then—I wrote the consent on January 19th, but I had not read the sum<lb/>mons, and after that I did nothing—I do not charge for writing the con<lb/>sent of January 16th; no taxing master would allow it and no solicitor would charge it—I do not think any writ of attachment was issued against me—I had not the slightest idea the rents were being collected on May 18th—the first I knew of it was when Perry came back—that was before the garnishee affidavit—I believe Mr. Charles Turner told me—he was solicitor for Perry—that was after Lewis and Rodwell said they would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had no understanding with Lewis or Rodwell with re<lb/>ference to the collection of rents—I have never paid them any money, nor promised it—they had not told me prior to May 18th they were going to collect—they said they would not—I knew my debt to be just—I saw no reason why it should not be paid—I believe Perry had no occupation but was in receipt of £4 or £5 a week—I had no reason for not deliver<lb/>ing my bills of costs—from first to last I have not appropriated a penny of Mrs. Cathcart's to which I did not consider I was justly entitled by law—the judgments were set aside on the grounds stated in my affidavit—(<hi rend="italic">the Law Stationers' book containing an entry on May 5th against Mr. Ratcliff for engrossing bill of costs was here read</hi>).</p>

A. Lewis, a solicitor—I knew him as a solicitor, not before—I also knew Rodwell better than I knew Lewis, I Knew him to be connected with the law—I had met Rateliff before January—I did not know him intimately—I think I met him at the Bodega in Chancery Lane, I am not sure who introduced him to me—it was in January this year—I might have seen him some time before January—I think I knew him as a solicitor, he might have been pointed out to me aa a solicitor—I did not see Mrs. Cathcart on a private matter of my own—I consulted Rodwell, I went out with him, I saw him in Mr. Cudby's office, I ex<lb/>plained my business to Rodwell in the presence of Lewis—I think they said they would do what I wanted and write letters for me and oblige me—I was not going to pay for it—Rodwell said to me "I want you to do something for me, Perry. We have had our names sufficiently in this matter, we just want you to put your name to the matter"—I don't know whether that was the exact statement—"and we may be able to put some business in your way"—they did not say what the matter was—I put my name to a letter and gave it to Rodwell and I have never seen it again, I wrote it at Rodwell's dictation, it was something like this: "I hereby instruct you to act for me in this matter," it was not headed "in</p>

Here is the receipt book, we can buy stamps there and you will give receipts and take the money"—I had never heard of Mrs. Cathcart—I did not ask why, I simply thought I was being em<lb/>ployed, and that they were entitled to collect the rents—I was told after<lb/>wards to tell them I was the proper person to receive the rents—I read the writ directed to myself, Rodwell, and Lewis, I read the part which says "We command you to take," &amp;c.—now I come to remember I think the writ was read out to me by Rodwell or Lewis, and they showed me that part before we started—I thought I was dealing with a solicitor, and I saw the signature at the bottom "High Court," but I did not think enough of it at the time—the evidence is correct that I went round with Lewis and Rodwell—I collected about £300—I gave receipts—when I first went down Rodwell and Lewis went with me—I had never been before—after we collected</p>

I went to the Law Courts on two occasions, once with Mr. Turner, and on the second occasion I think Ratcliff was present and Turner—I think the last occasion was when I came back from Staffordshire—I did not see Ratcliff between January and May—I might have seen him in the Bodega, but not to speak to—I was not in the company of Lewis or Rodwell—I used to go to the Bodega and I used to see them—I saw they knew each other—I did not ask anything about the matter—I think I was told I was going to collect rents, perhaps, in the train—I might have told the tenants I was authorised to collect the rents—Lewis made the deductions, sometimes in my presence, sometimes not—I did not understand the form of receipt, and made mistakes, and they had to be altered, and then they made out the form of receipt and put down, less the deductions, the amount—I signed the receipts—I knew deductions were being made—when I went down I saw the writ and was told it was perfectly correct—I first found out I was collecting Mrs. Cathcart's rents when I got there, not before—I did not ask to see the list on the way down—I did not ask whose rents—I saw the writ before I went down, but I did not thoroughly make myself acquainted with it—I saw Mrs. Cathcart's name on it—probably I knew I was going to collect her rents—I think I received two or three cheques—leashed them—I handed them to Lewis in the first place, and he gave them back to me—he told me to go to Uctoxeter and cash them, and then go on to Stour<lb/>bridge and collect rents, it was on my way—I brought them up to London to Lewis—I handed a cheque to Lewis at Wootton—he told me to take them to Uttoxeter, because there was a branch of the bank there—there was some talk about Lewis cashing the cheque, but he said, "Well, you have collected my rents, you had better take those cheques on to cash them"—I was asked for my address when I cashed the cheques—I gave it as 103, New Road, Battersea Park—I had just left that address, but I did not think of it, because it was on the writ of sequestration—it was an accident—I had no right to address it there—it did not occur to me—at that address they refused to take more letters after I left; we had some quarrels—I did not know the landlady would not take them in, we did not part on very friendly terms—I had lived there about a month before—on the previous days when I had come to town I had been to Ratcliff's office—if I remember correctly, Rodwell gave me instructions to collect the rents—his office was 14, Gray's Inn Square—I showed them the counterfoil receipts, and on one occasion I gave Lewis some of the money—I went to Ratcliff's office to meet Rodwell and Lewis—I saw Ratcliff there once—I only went there twice—my only purpose was to account for the money—I think it had to do with the note—when I came up to London I felt there was some<lb/>thing wrong—that first occurred to me when I left Wootton—that might be the first day—I thought, "I suppose it is all right, this man Lewis being a solicitor"—I trusted to his advice—not exactly, advice, but—after what he said I did not tell him I thought it was not all right, because I was not positive, not because I waft anxious to get the reward I ex<lb/>pected—it never occurred to me—there are only two receipts not in my writing—the deductions are in my writing—Lewis and Rodwell told</p>

I am managing clerk to Nashfield and Co., late Nash field and Withers, solicitors, of 12, Queen Street, Cheapside, a member of that firm was a Mr. Withers, who died in September, 1891—Staples, the defendant, was acting for Mr. Withers in some financial mat<lb/>ters—I produce here a three months' bill of exchange, dated April 20th, 1891, for £500 drawn by Louisa Staples, accepted by J. E. L. Staples, and endorsed "Louisa Staples" and "George A. Cook"—it was dis<lb/>honoured on July 23rd—I also produce the original statutory declaration purporting to have been made by Louisa Staples, of Combmartin, before Mr. C. G. Barnett, of Ilfracombe, April 20th, 1891—I do not know how it has same date as the bill in Bray's possession, it comes from the custody of the firm now.

Proceedings were taken against Staples, and judgment was obtained against him—I did not know that he had a petition against him when those proceedings were taken—I afterwards learnt of his bank<lb/>ruptcy—I do not know the date of the judgment; it was after July, 1891—I attended the first meeting of creditors as representing Mr. Withers, and on behalf of the firm—Staples was there—I put some questions to him—I made memoranda there as to his answers—I asked him his father's name and address; his mother's name; whether he had any brothers or sisters; and who was the trustee's solicitor—he did not answer that—then a question arose whether there was a settlement—he said that no settlement was in existence; that Mrs. Staples had signed one, but she knew nothing about it, it was made at the instance of G. A. Cook—I asked him if he knew anything about the Alliance Bank, and he said, "Yes, the shares are in my father's name, father</p>

"If you will see my solicitor I will lend you £500, or anything more you may want"—Staples asked me who my solicitor was, and I said, "Arthur Newton and Co."—he said, "Oh, no, I won't go there"—he gave no reason why he would not go; I then asked him if he would go to Mr. Lea, 13, Old Jewry—he said they would consider whether they would go or not—they went away, and I started making inquiries about them—next day Jellicoe called at my office alone—I told him I had made inquiries, and I had heard that Staples was a bankrupt and that his saying that he came into a reversion was a simple fraud—Jellicoe</p>

               <p>said, "I am sure the reversion is all right, but I am surprised at what you say about the bankruptcy"—he still protested that the security was good, and I said, "If you will go and see Mr. Lea, and he approves, I am still prepared to let you have the money"—he went to Mr. Lea, and did not satisfy him, and I did not lend him the money—I don't think I saw them after that—this letter, dated April 15th, is from Mr. Williams, and it was in consequence of that that I had this conversation.</p>

We have seen the letters you have written to Messrs. Jellicoe and Co. thereon.

I lied on June 17th, saying that I could hardly make such a declaration, but I would see what I could do—I knew nothing to the contrary about the document being in existence—I did not think Staples was trying to get a document which did not exist—I simply acted as a commission in taking the declaration—I went to Mr. Prince's own office—Jellicoe called on me to see what pro<lb/>gress I had made as to the marriage settlement, he did not want to know about the taking of it—I have a son, he not in practice with me.</p>

The writ was accompanied by a note—I did not expect Mr. Seldon to have anything to do with the action—I did not expect to get the costs if the copies of the documents were not supplied—the guinea represented the letters that passed—he was there about an hour—I did not see any impropriety whatever—I did not under<lb/>stand why he should come to me instead of writing to Mr. Seldon—the inquiry ultimately reached Mr. Seldon—the case struck me as a little peculiar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coffee-house keeper, of 4, Wharf dale Road, King's Cross, and I have been in business there some time—I once knew a Mr. Glenister, a solicitor's clerk—in December, 1896, I had £600 or £700 which I had saved lying idle at my bank—on December 22nd Glenister and the defendant Staples called on me; Staples handed me his card—Glenister introduced him as Captain Lansfield Staples, and said he wanted to borrow some money; I said that I did not mind lending some as long as I knew it was all right—Staples said he expected about £40,000 from his father, Joseph Staples, of Come Martin, on a marriage settlement; that his father was ninety-two and very ill then, and that his mother was dead—he said his father had lead and silver mines, and that when he came into the estate he should start them in working order, and he wanted to get a loan from the North British Mercantile or the British Equitable of about £10,000—he showed me this copy of a statutory declaration—he said it was a copy made out between his father and mother for him, and it was his mother's declaration—I think I read it right through—I saw a sum of £40,000 under the marriage settlement mentioned in it—I lent him</p>

               <p>about £16 that day on this promissory note for £20—after fourteen days I was to get back £20 for lending £16—a few days after they came again, and I lent him more money and got an I. O. U. for £7 10s. from Staples—a few days later they again came, and I lent some more money and got an I. O. U. for £12—next I lent them £5, taking an I. O. U. for £6—then they came and said that a cousin of Staples was coming up from Reading, and he did not want him to know that he had had the money in small sums; so he gave me a bill to cover everything—Staples told me to show him that, but not to let him have it till he had given me a cheque for the amount—he added the note up, I did not—it was for £85 10s. 9d.—the note was dated February 5th, 1897, and signed by J. E. L. Staples—at no time did he say he was an undischarged bankrupt, I never heard it until after I bad consulted with my solicitors and proceedings were taken—after taking the bill I had some conversation with Glenister, and a few days after that Jellicoe, Staples and Glenister called at my shop; that was the first time I had seen Jellicoe, it was about a fortnight after the date of the bill; he was introduced as a solicitor, and trying to get a loan from the North British Mercantile—he said he had been to Parr's Bank and had seen the papers relating to Staples' father's estates and knew they were correct, he told me I could go and see the papers at Parr's bank for my<lb/>self if I was not satisfied—Staples said he wanted some money to go on with until he got the loan—I lent him some and took an I.O.U. for £19—about the 3rd week in April I had advanced nearly £200 to Staples—I said I had not had any of my money back and Staples, said he expected to settle it up every day—Jellicoe proposed trying to get a mortgage of £450 on Staples' father's estates in Devonshire, I agreed—it was to be for £450, because I had to pay some down when the mortgage was executed—Glenister was married on April 19th, and this was about that time—an arrangement was made for Glenister, Staples, Jellicoe and myself to meet at Moorgate Street, and on April 20th I got this telegram, "Moorgate Street, 12.30 to-morrow, Staples"—I went there and saw Staples, Jellicoe and Glenister there, they said we were going to a loan office so as to make an arrangement to pay me back—we went, and Jellicoe went in, and we waited outside; Jellicoe came back, and said the gentleman was not in—it was then arranged that we should meet next day at London Bridge—we met, and Jellicoe went in to see Mr. Hurst; we waited out<lb/>side, and he returned and said he was not in—Jellicoe spoke to me about lending Staples more money so that he could have the mortgage papers brought to me—I said I would not lend him any more money, as I did not think it satisfactory—before we parted Jellicoe said he had another client named Knight who wanted about £400 for about three weeks to finish some buildings at Ramsgate—I said I could not do more than £150, and he said that would do—next day we went to my bank, and I drew out £150, which I paid to Jellicoe—Glenister and Staples were pre<lb/>sent—he did not give me any receipt—he said he would bring both mort<lb/>gages up on April 26th—I took no security for the £150—when they first spoke to me about Staples' father's property I said I would go to another solicitor, but Jellicoe said, "No, don't go to anybody, I will act for you both"—I agreed—I never did any thing unless Glenister was present; I left it to him—on the Monday they produced two mortgages—this is the</p>

               <p>one by Alexander Knight, signed by him and attested by J. A. Jellicoe, and dated April 26th, 1897—this is Staples' mortgage, in which the only security is the reversion of £40,000 on the marriage settlement, signed by Staples and attested by J. A. Jellicoe—the interest was 6 per cent.—next day I drew £190 from the bank, and handed over £150 to Staples—it was in notes—I had given him about £350—I kept the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> mortgage deeds—a few days after that Staples came down again, and I made him a further advance of £50—he said he wanted it to pay his expenses of living, and also to pay Mr. Jellicoe—I took an I.O.U for it—I had to borrow it from a friend, whom I have had to pay back—sub<lb/>sequently I lent him different sums—early in July I spoke to Glenister, and on July 10th I received this letter: "3, John Street, Bedford Row. Dear Sir, We are obtaining very favourable news, and hope shortly to get the matter completed.—Yours truly, <hi rend="smallCaps">JELLICOE AND</hi> Co."—this I.O.U. for £6 is dated the same day; I gave the money to Staples—on July 22nd I got this letter.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor of 9, Fleet Street—on July 1st or 2nd, 1897, the two prisoners came to my office with a man named Kent, who introduced them to me—Jellicoe explained that Captain Staples was a client of his, that he had known him many years, and that he was in<lb/>terested in or entitled to large sums of money under his parents' settlement, and produced a letter written by Mr. Cockburn with reference to £10,000</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189810240096"/>
               <p>—Jellicoe explained that the North British had agreed to make an ad<lb/>vance, and I think the letter was addressed to Mr. Jellicoe—he also said that Staples did not want so much as £10,000, but the insurance com<lb/>pany would not advance less—he wanted me to advance £2,000 or £3,000—this is the letter from Mr. Cockburn, the manager of the North British—he went on to say that he had been expecting a temporary advance from a Mr. Cleaver, and his client had been placed in an awkward position on account of the money not being sent, and in the meantime he wanted me to advance a small sum to fill up the Cleaver disappointment—I said it was news to me that the North British, if the security was satisfactory, would not advance less than £10,000—he stuck to it, and said, "I know that Captain Staples had relied on that money from Mr. Cleaver, and I know how much embarrassed he is at its not arriving"—I knew Jellicoe professionally for ten years; I had not met him—Staples said that the marriage settlement was in an iron safe built into the wall at his father's house at Combmartin—I asked Jeli<lb/>coe, "How does it happen it that settlement relates to the large sum you have told me of, it is not in the possession of the trustees?—Staples said, "Both the trustees are dead; my father has got possession of it, and he sticks to it"—he told me his father was over eighty—Jellicoe produced a copy of the declaration supposed to have been made by Mrs. Staples, the prisoner's mother, which I was told had been prepared in connection with the difficulties which Staples had had in raising money—they were both there—I asked Jellicoe if he knew where the securities were; he said at Parr's Bank, and also at Deacon Williams and Co.'s—he said that he had been to Parr's, and ascertained that the statement was correct that there were securities there—they pressed me to make advances, and said, "What you tell me no doubt is all right, but I know nothing about it, and you are practically asking me to do something on faith; are you quite certain that it is all right?"—Jellicoe said, "Yes, you can take it from me it is all right; I should not come to till you a bogus story, as I fully investigated the matter in relation to the Cleaver security, which I myself prepared"—I said if the North British would advance £10,000 I would get a client of mine to advance £2,000 or £3,000, but I should want to know of the existence of the settlement—Staples said he was in urgent need of some money, owing to the failure of Mr. Cleaver's advance, and I was asked to advance £50—I refused, but said I would give him a cheque for £25—I gave them this cheque, dated July 2nd, 1897, on my faith in the assurance which they had given me—I should not have given it unless I believed it—at their request I left it open—I absolutely believed Jellicoe; if he had not been there I should not have parted with a penny—I turned to Jellicoe and said, "If this is not all right the blood will be on your head, if we cannot rely on one another in a matter of this kind, professional life is impossible"—they then went away—about a week later they called again—I had suggested that inquiries should be made, and that it should be ascertained who the solicitors were who had prepared the settlement, and I said I should like the original or a draft, and they came to tell me of some solicitors in Bath—I could not find such a firm, and Staples said he thought they were both dead—then one of them stated that Mr. Cleaver had not sent his money, and could I let</p>

               <p>them have £15—I gave them this cheque, dated July 9th; that was followed on July 16th by a further visit by Captain Staples alone, to give me some information I had asked him for—I then advanced him £10 by open cheque, he saying that he was still disappointed by Cleaver—on July 20th both the prisoners came, and in the mean-time I had mentioned the matter to a client of mine, who, subject to my being satisfied, was prepared to advance £3,000—I let Staples have another £10 then, and made a short charge for £50, which he signed in my favour—I had not at that time heard anything from the defendants about Mr. Charles Lucas, a solicitor, of Newbury, but from another source I heard that he might be able to throw some light upon the matter—I wrote to him on July 23rd, and I received a letter from him dated July 24th—on July 26th Jellicoe called, and I told him the effect of the letter from Mr. Lucas—I told him it was a letter which called for a very grave ex<lb/>planation from him and Captain Staples, but particularly from himself—a few days later they both called, and I said what a very serious aspect had been put upon the matter—Staples suggested that I had got the information from Mr. Lucas, and I said I had—I said I would read them the letter, but before doing so I said, "In effect Mr. Lucas says that you are a swindling thief, and unless you can explain it away I shall treat you like it"—I then handed the letter to Jellicoe to read (<hi rend="italic">This stated that</hi> "<hi rend="italic"> Captain" Staples was the son of James Staples, who was very old and very ill; that he (the writer) had acted for the father; that there never was a marriage settlement and that the son would not benefit under the father's will that the mother narrowly escaped a prosecution for signing the declaration which far son induced her to do, and that he (the writer) would not be surprised if the son had forged the will and documents as he was capable of anything.</hi>)—Staples assured me that he never had been a bankrupt, a petition had been presented against him, but no order had ever been made—I should not have made any advance if he had told me he was an undischarged bankrupt—Staples denied the letter, Jellicoe said nothing—I had advanced £40 before reference was made to the bankruptcy—Staples went into some family matters about Mr. Lticas, and said it was through that that he had written this unfriendly letter, I thought I had done them injustice—on August 24th I made a further advance to Staples of £5; he made a pathetic appeal to me—I gave Jellicoe £5, because there was some talk of Staples and Jellicoe going to Comb<lb/>martin for information, and I gave him the £5 for expenses—I never saw him again—I wrote many letters asking for the result of his journey; I got no reply—I, amongst others, received a writ in reference to some Chancery proceedings dated October 9th, 1897—it is a writ to bring the settlement into Court; I had suggested months before that that step should be taken—I was one defendant; I have never heard any more of it—all the advances I made up to July 24th were made on the faith of the statements made by the two prisoners.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Asking that as the matter of Staples was first mentioned by Mr. Kent, if it had not better be arranged through him.</hi>)—I will not swear that Kent had not shown me the declaration—I did not wish Staples to be my client—all the explanations about his family history were very sad-most of the questions I asked about the trustees were answered by Staples—Mr. Barnett's name was mentioned, as it was before him the declaration was made—Jellicoe said he had written to Barnett, and I saw his replies—I wanted to know all I could about the declaration; I was endeavouring to ferret out all that had taken place—I knew a large portion of the securities were invested in Parr's Bank—I was shown the declaration—Kent is a solicitor—after I had a letter from him I sent process to Uckfield; he used to have an office there—I never met him personally—I have known Kent the last few years; he was a friend of another client of mine—the date of the first advance was July 2nd, the next the 9th, and the next the 15th or 16th—I believed at this time that business was going on—I had no intimation that they declined to pro<lb/>ceed—the letter from Bircham's was never brought to my notice—I was endeavouring to find out what the position was; I was making inquiry—I wanted to clear up the whereabouts of the settlement and the identity of Captain Staples—I read the letter of July 23rd in the presence of the prisoners, and Jellicoe had it for a quarter of an hour—the serious matter was the non-existence of settlement—I received no letter from Dr. Foquet; I never wrote to him—I have my notes of the names given: Foquet is not mentioned—I have four names—the only question was whether Staples was the son mentioned in the settlement; legitimacy was never men<lb/>tioned—I wrote to Barnett on the 14th, and he replied on the 17th—I told Jellicoe later in the afternoon Barnett had called to see him—I am not conscious of Jellicoe having sent me letters; he showed me one or two—when the prisoners called, Kent was not present more than three times—Kent may have called on the same day; I only recollect Kent being present twice—after receiving letters I sent to Mr. Wyndham, of the Primrose Club—he said he was a friend of the family; he was well acquainted with the family generally, and I was favourably impressed with what he did—he satisfied me that he was the son of Staples, of Combmartin—he told me he never knew about the marriage settlement; I asked him that—after Lucas' letter I made one advance—I showed the letter to Jellicoe—I advanced the £5 because he came to me as I was going for a holiday and explained that unless the money was paid that afternoon he should be taken to Holloway, and I said, "I do not want you to go to a place like that after what has happened, and I will give you £5," and I gave it—there was £5 paid to Jellicoe subsequently at Combmartin—the correspondence with the solicitor was very unsatisfactory, and I put it to Jellicoe that he ought to go down; he gave me a reason why he round not go, and I gave him £5; I parted with two cheques—what I complained of in Jellicoe was he said he had inquired and found it was <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>; I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector</hi>). In October and November last the papers produced were put before me to make inquiries, and I went to see Mr. James Staples at Combmartin, from whom I took a detailed statement, which was read over to him—he thoroughly understood it—his mind was quite clear—I had also seen a number of other persons in reference to the case—on June 8th I received a summons from Bow Street Police-court, which it was my duty to serve upon Jellicoe—I served it on him on June 9th at his office, I, Wardrobe Place, St. Paul's Churchyard, where he had moved from 3, John Street—it was for unlawfully conspiring and agreeing to obtain from Thomas Cleaver, with intent to defraud, and that he did obtain £10 in February, 1896, and £2 in March, 1897, etc.—he made this state<lb/>ment, after I had cautioned him that it might be used against him: "It is a tissue of falsehoods from beginning to end. Staples came to me and said he was entitled to a lot of money, and showed me a decla<lb/>ration made by his mother, and said he wanted to raise money, and I arranged to obtain a loan of £10,000 from the North British Mercantile Company, and then he afterwards came to me and told me to prepare him a mortgage to Cleaver, whom I did not know any more than a new bora babe, and I did so. He told me that Cleaver had lent him money from time to time, and he wanted to secure him. I never had a single fraction from Cleaver, and only had just my costs from Staples. I made inquiries of the solicitor who took the declaration, and found it was correct; I afterwards instituted proceedings in the Chancery Court to bring the marriage settlement into Court. I made out from the declaration that the trust funds were at Parr's Bank, and I went there and made inquiries of the manager, who told me that it was so. The Chancery proceedings are still pending, and Counsel has been instructed in the case"—then Jellicoe read a copy of instructions to Counsel, and went on to say: "I wrote to Mr. Barnett, at Ilfracombe, the solicitor who took the declara<lb/>tion, before I drew the mortgage to Cleaver for Staples, and I was satis<lb/>fied that Mr. Barnett took the declaration"—I said if he wished to show me any papers or books I would see them—he said: "I have no papers, relating to the matter except the declaration and letters that have passed between Mr. Barnett and the defendant, at Combmartin, and myself: Everything is perfectly in order, and I am still acting for Staples;</p>

               <p>that is, he has never revoked his instructions; even supposing I have been acting as solicitor for Mr. Cleaver he could not say that I had been guilty of any negligence, as I have taken every precaution, the money was granted to Staplen before I know anything about it; I have never had an account with Staples, he agreed to pay me a lump sum on the comple<lb/>tion of the loan by the North British"—on June 11th I read the warrant to Staples—it had been granted at Bow Street on the same day as the summons, and it charged him with conspiracy—he said: "It is true I borrowed money from Mr. Cleaver on mortgage, and Jellicoe acted as my solicitor"—he asked me who was prosecuting, and I told him the Public Prosecutor—Cleaver was arrested on a warrant against Staples and the other man.</p>

I had a gentle<lb/>man with me who waited for me outside the bank. That was the only statement I made to Cleaver. I investigated the matter, as any other solicitor would have done, and when I found out Mr. James Staples' soli<lb/>citors I wrote and asked them for copies of the marriage settlement and of the certificates of the defendant Staples' birth and of his father's birth, and they wrote that they would make me out copies. I did not know of defendant Staples bankruptcy. He called on me and in<lb/>strucced me to draw the mortgage as he wanted to secure Cleaver for money he had lent him from time to time before I knew him. Staples was introduced to me on or about April 12th, 1897. The sum advanced to Knight's £150; those notes have been traced to me. They came through Knight's mortgage. So far as Mr. Prince is concerned he himself wrote privately to the solicitors who investigated the matter. I made no state<lb/>ment whatever except that I had been to Parr's Bank."</p>

               <p>there would have been a large commission received on the policy—I heard Bireham's objection that we showed no title, and that if a title were shown perhaps an advance might be made—I got the epitome back at the end of August, and I promised to complete the abstract—it is true that Mr. Bradley, of Bircham's, told me it was worthless, and "we must have the names and statements of the funds"—I am willing to complete the transaction and carry the matter out—on July 8th I received their letter that they were still willing to advance—the matter was still open between me and the insurance company; in fact, I never withdrew from them—wequestioned Staples about the trustees—we thought his uncle Joseph was a trustee, and I went to Somerset House and found "Josephs" were solicitors—it was known the old man had a secret document, or had destroyed it—Prince gave me that impression—we held that opinion during the whole of the interviews, and that we ought to force the old man to bring the document into Court, when we ultimately served him with a writ to make him a co<lb/>defendant—he wrote back—he first advised an originating summons—that was just before the vacation, and it was too late, and we tried afterwards to effect a reconciliation of the old man with his son, and I adopted the initiative—there was no com<lb/>plaint in his letter—Prince never said we had deceived him as—to these securities—I showed him the letters, and some I left with him—the only question in his mind was whether he was the person referred to in the statutory declaration, as he thought the defendant was personating Captain Staples—the only report I made to Prince was that I had been to Parr's Bank, and found shares standing in the old man's name, and he said the settlement was in the iron safe—if the loan had been carried out there would have been a considerable appropriation fee, and, perhaps, a life insurance—I saw Barnett at the Constitutional Club on July 26th—Princetold me Barnett had been to London, and gave me an address where I could see him, and I went to the bank and had a long interview—I went to his club, Barnett came in, and after shaking hands, I said: "About this declaration?"—he said: "I recollect it quite well Mr. Jellicoe, Mrs. Staples was staying on your visit to my office at the Clarendon, I think it was, and I went over there for a declaration from the old man; a man there had sent for him"—I said, "Do you know anything about the family?"—he said, "I knew the old man many years, and I understand he was either a bankrupt or had lost a consider<lb/>able fortune"—then he said he traced him to another place, and said, "If I were to go to the old man he would slam the door in my face"—heunderstood the old man had made a will, and that the son had been met with—he promised to prosecute all inquiries he could, with a view to get an assignment, and let me know—after that I reported what I had done to Mr. Prince—I saw the charge taken by Prince from Staples—he said he would take it for what it was worth for professional services, and if he lost money it would not break him; he could well afford that—he said the letter which he refused to show me was a privileged communica<lb/>tion, but he said, "The gist of it is about his legitimacy, which I wane to clear up; I believe he has personated Captain Staples"—I went to Somerset House and searched for his birth certificate, but could not find it; then I wrote to Dr, Foquet to prove the point, I also threatened the old man with</p>

Wisdom, of the Primrose Club, and promised the following day to bring him a batch of letters from his mother—a batch of letters was handed to Prince—on August 18th I wrote to the father's own solicitors, making inquiries, also to the family banker, a retird publican, for the declaration—I got the address from Nashfield and Co.—that was the first time the declaration was produced—I wrote to Mr. H. Biggs, of Bristol, for the original settlement, or a copy of it—I did all I could—I showed Prince the result and the correspondence—I wrote Mr. Seldon for the marriage settlement—I have had experience of getting copies of documents, £10 would be little enough to pay—I do not remember the date, but Prince said to me, "I am getting tired of this matter; you had better take this charge over, and give me £50"—I think £85 had then been advanced—I had no opportunity of making any charge—previous to that he said to the Captain, "I think you have bagged to the extent of £80; you ought to get Jellicoe to help you"—I was served with a notice of change of solicitors, and I did not think I ought to disclose any infor<lb/>mation; it was not my duty to attend to the Chancery action, and my name was taken off the record.</p>

               <p>mother, keeping a lodging-house, called Glenloye, at Westgate-on-Sea—she is seventy years of age, and a good deal of the business arrangements are left to me—Marie Cahagne came on June 16th, 1893—I had received this letter from her: "C/o H. Bamford, 201, Great Portland Street." (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the party would arrive on Friday, and ordering a seven o'clock dinner</hi>)—she engaged one sitting-room and four bedrooms, at five guineas a week, and paid £2 deposit—she gave her solicitor's address, 201, Great Portland Street, and said that she was staying at an hotel in Craven Street—she arrived with Miss Josephine on the 19th, with another son Joseph, a Mr. Smith, and a Mr. Tyler—the rent was paid up to July 22nd—their style led one to believe they had plenty of money, and were used to it, having the best of everything, and plenty of it, dealing with the best tradesmen for the best meat, poultry, oysters, and that kind of thing, and wines from a wine merchant, with white wine with their oysters—they engaged from livery stables a carriage, one horse, and one man at so much a week—the accounts were paid the first three weeks—they lived on most friendly terms with my mother and me—she said she had been divorced from her husband five years ago, she had money in Chancery, and a quarterly allowance paid through trustees of £1,250, and that her daughter was engaged to be married in the early part of the year to the young gentleman who was with the party—she said her estate in France was left by her or her daughter's grandfather—about the end of July she said she had run very short of cash, and asked mother to pay the tradesmen for the week, she was going to London to see her trustee, and on her return she would settle all up—my mother paid the tradesmen the sixth week—she went to London and came back, and said she had not seen her trustee—she went to London again in August to see her trustee—she returned, and said her trustee was ill, and on the following morning he had gone on a Cook's tour, so that she would have to manage the best she could for two or three weeks—mother said, "What about the tradesmen?"—she said, "Oh, it won't hurt them to wait a week or two"—about August 14th she said, "I hope I am not putting your mother to inconvenience in not settling the account"—I said, "No, if we have ft by the end of the month"—she said, "Oh, you shall have it long before that; the trustee is away, when he returns I shall be able to settle up"—on August 16th she said that they would have to go to Paris at the end of September, would I like to go with them; they were going to their castle at Orleans—that was the first I heard of Orleans—that there were a lot of pictures, tapestry, and valuable things that she wanted to get to London, to her daughter's house, before she married; she thought I should be handy, and I was delighted with the idea—I had never been to Orleans or Paris—I was to have stayed at the old castle—I was most anxious to go—I consulted mother at once, and madam being a very nice lady she thought I could be trusted with her, and it would give me an opportunity of seeing a little Continental life—about August 25th madam called me into the back-room, and asked if I thought mother would lend her £5 as she was short of cash, and wanted to go to London to see her trustee the next day; I asked mother, who gave it me—she did not go the next day—on the 30th she had another £5—I did not ask for a receipt, because of her tales about going to see her</p>

               <p>trustee, and she seemed so straightforward; we hardly treated it as a business transaction, but did it out of kindness to her—I made notes at the time on an old almanack that used to be in the kitchen, and I hare compiled these notes from it—on September 1st Madam borrowed £12 for the purpose of going to Somerset House, and on the following Monday she was going to London, and some of it was for her invalid son Charlie who was about to be sent to Long Milford—I wired myself to him—on Septem<lb/>ber 6th we advanced £5, 9th £5, 11th £10, 16th £3, 17th £10, which I took to Craven Street myself—on September 16th there was a telegram for me to send, addressed "Ayres, Bremen, Germany. Send £500 this week without fail," to the best of my recollection—the next day she asked for £10—an answer came to the telegram, and madam told me it said, "I am writing. Letter follows"—she had a letter, which she said enclosed an authority to draw money, and she went to London and had £3 to go with on the 16th—on the 17th we received a letter, in consequence of which I went to her in London with another £10, for stamping fees—she told me to go from Victoria to her hotel in Craven Street; she there told me she had been to the lawyers; the elder one was away, and the younger one said it was more than he dare do to let her have the money without the other's signature—that day I had lunch with her at the hotel—she said she was expecting a gentleman to see her about a house she was about to purchase at Streatham Hill; that they wanted £5,000, which the trustee thought too much, but she was going to pay £4,500 for it—I went back to Westgate; she did not return for two days afterwards—some of the tradesmen continued to serve till the end of the month; some would serve no longer—madam gave me Mr. Bamford's address to take to some of them as a reference, because they asked me for a reference, and I took it to them—Jackson called with the carriage; she used to write from London and order it—on September 21st she borrowed £7, and on the 27th she went to London, borrowing another £4 or £5—then I received this telegram, "Ask your mother to let you come up by Gran<lb/>ville. Very important. Don't mention it to Mignon. Come in hansom to hotel from Victoria"—Mignon is the daughter—I went up to the hotel—she said a Mrs. Warple in the hotel had suggested that she should go to some solicitors and raise money on the fixtures she had at Mr. Bamford's office, and that she had been to see a solicitor, who thought one of his clients at Tonbridge would advance money, and she expected a telegram, to say he was coming up to see her about it—they were valuable pictures for her daughter's house from the Castle—I next re<lb/>ceived a letter from the Alexandra Hotel, Craven Street (<hi rend="italic">of September 29th, for another</hi> £5)—I sent £5 on the morrow—when she came back on the 30th she borrowed another £5; on October 1st, £5; October 2nd, £7 10s.; and on October 4th, £2—she asked for £5, but mother said she could not, she had other accounts, but would send the other later on—she went to London that day—on October 6th she wrote for more money—we sent her 30s. in two postal orders—she returned on 9th and went to London on 12th—on 8th we got a telegram, "Too ill to travel till to<lb/>morrow"—we thought she had settled her business and got her money—she said her trustee had sent her a cheque for £2,000, which was going through the bank, and she would not have it till the following Tuesday—</p>

               <p>I had asked her if it was possible to pay the tradesman that evening and she said, would I tell them all they would be paid by Thursday evening and thank them for having served her so long, and whatever interest was due they could put on the bill—she asked for more money and said her son Joe was going yachting—this was Saturday, on the Monday she took mother for a drive—Mr. Jackson supplied the trap—on October 20th she borrowed another £5—she was unwell in her room—on October 22nd she was still in her room—she wrote in pencil to mother this letter for £10 (<hi rend="italic">Stating that she was so grieved at not receiving her money and asking</hi> £10 <hi rend="italic">to pay a debt of her son Joe to a young fellow who leaves to<lb/>night.</hi>)—mother lent her another £10—on October 27th madam borrowed £3 to go to London—she went to London on the 28th—I saw Miss Cahagne from time to time—she said they had plenty of money, a quarterly allow-ance through her trustee, but her father was always putting obstacles in the way to prevent them having the money and that the trustee was annoyed at her engagement—she said she and her mother had £2,000 a year each—before her mother went to London she called me into the back room and said, "She is going to take you as a witness with Mr. Ramford and his clerk to the bank to sign her name in the ledger and then she would have her money handed over"—she came of age twice that year; in the spring, and she had another birthday in November—believing these statements I got a cab and went with madam to London—we went in a cab to Mr. Bamford's office—I paid—she asked me to pay for everything—she said, "You shall have your money at four o'clock"—we went into Mr. Bamford's office and waited a long time, the clerk told us Mr. Bam<lb/>ford had gone out, and would not be back till four o'clock—Madam said, "It is no use waiting here till Mr. Bamford comes back, it will be too late for the bank to-day"—we went to Uxbridge and stayed at my sister's, going back<lb/>wards and for wards for five weeks—on 29th we went again to Mr. Bamford's office—madam discharged the cab, and went inside—she came out and said, "Well, they are not coming"—she told the cabman to drive to Portugal Buildings, Lincoln's-Inn-Fields—that was the bank she said—she went in—I remained in the cab—when she came out she said, "Oh, it is all right; I shall be able to get it before 4 o'clock"—it was about 11 a.m.—we went to Mr. Bamford's office—she went in—she asked me to go to Charing Cross Hotel, and get her a wash for Mignon—on coming back to the office I heard Mr. Bamford speaking French—some time after Mr. Bamford came out and put his overcoat on in the outer office, where I was sitting—madam came out looking angry, and said, "It is a great nuisance; I cannot get the money to-day"—I said, "Why not?"—she said, "Because I cannot give them my three certificates of birth, marriage and divorce; I can get two, the other one is in Paris; I cannot get that till Tuesday"—she said Mr. Bamford had drawn an affidavit, which she had signed saying the pictures were hers, and that they were trying to get money till the following Tuesday, and she was going to the lawyers to get the orders—I was to go home, and she would wait till the following Tuesday—if she got £100 by Saturday morning she was going to wire it home—she arranged to go back to Uxbridge to my sister, who did not expect her—Madam Cahagne never returned to Westgate—some of the party left at the end of the week—Miss Tyler went a few days before madam, Joe a few</p>

I live at 8, Belvedere Crescent, Lambeth—I know the elder prisoner—I was originally a servant at 124, New Bond Street, at a business which was first carried on by the prisoner's husband, Harry Cahagne—the daughter was four years old in 1869—the shop was carried on till 1883 and was then closed, and then the elder prisoner and the children came to 8, Belvedere Crescent, where I was letting apartments—in 1887 the daughter was then grown up—they used to get letters there—I have seen them with money frequently—the husband was not there then—they had one room at 5s. a week—the sons used to come and have meals there—I do not know how they got their money at that time—I last saw the elder prisoner in 1896; she borrowed £2 of me, and paid back 30s.—they occupied the room six weeks.</p>

               <p>two, and it was in connection with that she was hoping for good luck—she said she was rich, and had a very large house in London, and that she mixed with the largest and highest people in England—later on I was introduced to the daughter and son when they came over from. England, and I asked them to my chateau in the country, the two ladies and the two sons—that pleased her very much, and she took the place furnished for two years—the first year's rent was paid with difficulty; I never got any more—they lived therein very high style—at last I issued a writ of ejectment, and got her out in that way—I produce photos of the chateau—I produce a number of telegrams and letters which they received about money matters—here is one addressed to Miss Mignon de la Mar, and others asking for money, and some saying "I cannot lend you any more till you repay me."</p>

I am a carman living at 6 Eleanor Road, Finsbury Park—I work for Nolan, a carter's contractor—on Tuesday, October 4th, I was in the Crown and Sceptre with Ashton—Sear came in, and came up and asked if we knew a man named King—Ashton asked him what he was—he said "A professional boxer"—Ashton said "I don't know him"—Sear said "I have just come from America; I should like to see him, because I see a challenge in the <hi rend="italic">Sporting Life</hi> concerning him; I am <hi rend="italic">Toff</hi> Wall's brother and train in the name of <hi rend="italic">Tod Beech</hi>"—he asked me to have a drink—I had a glass of ale with him—he told me to show him the best place to hit a man—a lot more men, strangers, came in and he went over to join them, and I did not see him again till I saw him in the City Road when I was going home—he caught hold of me and said, "I have been robbed; you are one of them"—I said "It was not me; let me go."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Ashton was with me in the Crown and Sceptre—no one was with me in the City Road—if the potman says he saw other men running away with me it would be a lie—I left the public-house a little after 4 p.m. in daylight—it was not 5.10—the potman did not know me—I left by myself—the prosecutor was a quarter of an hour in my company—while I was in the house he went out; I don't know where to—three or four <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> went out with him—that was at 3.30 or 3.45—when he caught hold of me I was filling my pipe and waiting for a tram-car to go home; I was not picking anything off the ground—he seized me in Britannia Street, outside the Britannia—I do not know if that is a quiet street; I am a stranger to it—there were a lot of people about—there is no tram in that street, but there is in the City Road—I had been out for a walk that afternoon—I have been about there on Sunday nights with Ash ten's father, but not in the Crown and Sceptre; this was the first time I had been in there—I did not know any of the other prisoners before.</p>

The Britannia Road is a narrow road, leading into the City Road at one end and the Nile Road at the other—I came on duty at 5.15; it was daylight then—there were not a great many people about, but there were some passing and repassing—I saw nothing of any actual robbery of the prosecutor—when I arrived Sear was holding Brophy—I asked him if he was perfectly sure he was one; he said he was—there were several people there; no one volunteered any assistance, or said they had seen any robbery or anything of the kind—I cannot find anyone who saw the robbery—I saw Davey when I looked round about five minutes after I got along the City Road—he was on point duty in the street leading to the City Road—when I got up to the Britannia I could have seen that point man, but I did not see him till after I got away from the City Road about five minutes—Sear and Brophy were on the pavement—the road is up for the sewage—standing at that spot you could not see the point man if he had been in his right place, but he came up very shortly afterwards.</p>

In consequence of instructions I went to the Police-station with the last witness, and from there to Savage's coffee tavern, where I saw Olive, O'Connell and Inglis—I arrested Clive—he said, "I have done nothing"—I searched him there—I found in different pockets 10s. in gold, 30s. in silver, three half-crowns, seven 2s. pieces, seven shillings, two sixpences, two threepenny pieces, and 2s. and 1/2 d, bronze—I took him to the Station—we crossed the road—Wythes' stores are some distance further down—the men were charged at the station—in answer Olive said, "I know nothing of these other men, but I admit being in the public-house a short time previously"—I think he said, "To wait for a train."</p>

On June 28th I was called to the Epsom Police-station about 4.30 p.m.—I made this note at the time—I said to Clive, "You say you were not with the other men; if you wish inquiries to be made in your favour I will make them"—previously I had cautioned him—he replied, "My name is John Clive. I am a general dealer. I came from Brighton to Horsham, where I sold a pony for £3. I took the train at Horsham at 12.20. Here I went on the Downs, where I usually go when I am in Epsom"—he was asked his address—he gave it after some delay and prevarication—the three men were identified, O'Connell by Miss Pratt, from about nine men, and all three by Turner—these four coins were handed to me by Galloway, and seven others by Horn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Coroner's clerk to Mr. Braxton Hicks, and was present at the inquest on the body of Ethel Grace Cook on August 23rd—the prisoners both gave evidence—they were cautioned by the Coroner—their evidence was taken down in writing—it was read over to them, and they both signed it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: Grace Cook says: "I live at 67, Lambeth Palace Road, Lambeth. I am the wife of James Cook, a carman. I identify the body seen by the jurors as that of my child, Ethel Grace Cook, aged one year and eight months She has always been delicate. She was born at full birth and at that time healthy. She always suffered from colds and teeth. I did not think of getting medical advice as I trusted in the Lord; we refuse to have medical advice. Deceased often suffered from colds. About six weeks ago the child had cough which turned to whooping cough. We gave her nourishment, beef tea, eggs, and brandy. I gave her no medicine. The child got better; she remained about the same until about a fortnight ago. She had a difficulty in breathing and spat up phlegm, About a fortnight ago I kept her in bed. She did not get better, Sometimes she was better and sometimes worse. A day or two after<lb/>wards the child had diarrhoea. I gave her arrowroot and brandy but she did not get better. A week ago she had convulsions. On Sunday, August 14th, the child had twitchings. During the week they continued, and she died on August 21st at 7 o'clock. To relieve all this illness I had hands laid on her by the elder of the Peculiar People. We had her prayed for in the chapels that she might be relieved of her pain and get well. I never gave the child any medicine. I applied no dressing to the child, and object to obtaining medical advice; if it had been offered I should have refused it. This is my first child. "James Cook said: "I am a carman, of Lambeth Palace Road, Lambeth. I am the father of the deceased child. She was in the care and custody of myself and wife. I knew six weeks ago that the child was ill with whooping cough. I did not get medical attendance after that. I recognised the child was seriously ill. I had the means to pay for medical attendance. I decided in my own mind not to obtain it. I have no faith in medical men, and on that ground I decline to have medical advice. To relieve her I had her anointed and hands laid on her. I noticed she was getting thinner They anointed her twice with oil, and we prayed for her. She had several changes, and sometimes she got a bit better and sometimes worse. About a fortnight before her death I noticed her illness was serious. I was present at the death. After she died I informed the Coroner's officer. There was no other reason than my faith which led me not to obtain medical advice. I have been a member of the Peculiar People about ten years. If some medical man had prescribed for the child, I should not have given her medicine. When the child has had colds before and has been prayed for she has recovered. The Scripture is our guide as to obtaining assistance, and the Scripture says we should trust in the Lord").</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and work at Stains Waterworks—I remember August 12th—I was alone in the evening; I was in my own house—it was between light and dark—I saw all the three prisoners—Smith came into the room first by the back door; he walked in pretty sharp, and wanted to know where the landlord was—I am the landlord—he knocked my wife on the forehead and then he came straight to me as I was sitting in a chair, and hit me on my eye and kicked me on my thigh—I had not time to get up—the others rushed in and they all three hit me at the said time with their fists, and kicked me with hob-nailed boots all over my body—I was black and blue—I was knocked on the floor, and at the time this was going on one of them put his hand in my pocket and took out 3s. and broke my watch chain—Taylor said "Kill the b—"—I did not hear Wood say anything, but Smith struck me with a chair and broke it—that was not the hair I was sitting on—he broke a corner of the chair off with the force of the blow—it was a new Windsor chair—they then went into another room and took some sheets and a pair of drawers—I got away first and was glad to get away, and went up the road to look for protection—I found three constables, one of whom is here now—I know their names—I went back to the house with them but did not find the prisoners there—I went with the police and found their clothes—I found one of the prisoners next morning and gave him in charge of the police—I saw Smith locked up and Taylor was locked up the same night—they were of my premises from twenty minutes to half-an-hour—I was seriously hurt, I had marks on my thighs and legs which I showed the police and I could not go to work for a week—I saw a doctor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Smith lodges in my house and Wood likewise—they work where I do at the Staines Water Works—I have known Smith about two months—they came to lodge there on the Saturday and this was on the next Friday—there was a little unpleasantness before this; my mis<lb/>tress and I had a little disagreement and I was in rather a bad temper—I did not go into the bedroom when I came home and break the windows, certainly not—I did not go up and break the two windows and the bed<lb/>stead, nor did I take the mattress and bedclothes away—the disagreement was not about my mistress and somebody else—it is not true that I broke the window and took some things away—I took away the drawers and the bedstead, but I did not smash the window—after I had taken the things away to sell I came back and found Smith there—he and I did not have a fight that night, but blows were exchanged—I gave him a blow or two, and he gave me a blow or two—I have got a belt with a buckle at the end of it—Smith did not somehow get his head cut open with something hard—I did not hit him on the head with a belt with a buckle at the end of it—I did not use my belt, but it might have come off—I cannot say whether it was swinging about—I know Ploughman John; he is my next-door neighbour—I do not know whether he took Smith to a doctor—I cannot say whether Smith looked a little bit poorly—I had had no drink on that night nor the night after when they came to my</p>
