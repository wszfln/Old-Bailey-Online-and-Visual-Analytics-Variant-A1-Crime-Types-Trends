I told her, she did not ask if the butter was good, nor the price of it. She said, she knew it was good, and she knew the price, for she was recommended to me by a customer of mine up the street. She said, you may send the girl with me, and send change for a guinea. I pulled out two half guineas, and told her I had not silver, but I would send and get change. She said, she was in a hurry, and two half guineas would do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the woman?</p>
               <p>Dickens. Yes, I am. She said, a gentleman at their house waited for half a guinea to pay for a coat, so I gave her the two half guineas. She seemed to be in a hurry, and I gave the girl the butter and eggs to carry, and she said she would send back by the girl the guinea, and also fifteen pence, which the butter and eggs came to. I believe, in about half an hour the girl came back crying, and said, the woman had lost her, and had not given her the guinea.</p>

            . I live with Mrs. Dickens.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Lee. Fifteen years old. The prisoner came to our house the 26th of May; she asked for a lump of butter and a groats-worth of eggs, and told my mistress to send change for a guinea. She gave her two half guineas, and me the butter and eggs to carry. She said, she would send back a guinea, and fifteen pence for the butter and eggs by me. She took me up Berwick-street, and when we came to Chapel-street, she bid me go down the street, and knock at the next door to a gateway, and ask for the guinea and fifteen pence. I went, but could not find such a house. I turned my head, and found she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner promise to send back the guinea and fifteen pence by you?</p>
               <p>Lee Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the same woman?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes.</p>

               <p>I never saw the witnesses in my life till the constable came to me where I live. He said, he came to take me up; I asked him for what. He took me to these people and they swore I was the person. I told them, they never saw my face. They asked me whether I would pay the guinea, and they would let me go. I would not; so they took me before the Justice, and he committed me.</p>

            , in Mutton-lane, about twelve o'clock. Slight and Jones were just gone from there; we found this tea-chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took them?</p>
               <p>Lee. A brother officer took them in Clerkenwell. I found the pocket-book before we went to search this room. The accomplice went with me to shew me the house he had broke open. I think he went with me to the place where the pocket-book was.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Can you swear that tea-chest is your property?</p>
               <p>Parker. I can; I have had it thirty years. I can also swear to the spectacles and the glass.</p>
               <p>- Blower. I am a watchman; I watch at the watch-house on Clerkenwell Green. On the 12th of June, about two o'clock in the morning, I saw three men, Jones was the first; the next was Slight, alias Holtham; and the last was Price; they were walking one after another, and talking together. I knew Holtham, alias Slight, some years ago. I never saw Jones before, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know Price?</p>
               <p>Blower. He had a scarlet waistcoat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see them?</p>
               <p>Blower. Opposite the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from Mrs. Parker's house?</p>
               <p>Blower. Almost a mile. I pursued them all three.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to pursue them?</p>
               <p>Blower. I knew Slight to be one of the wrong sort. They were all three loaded with goods under their left arm. I took Price with this looking-glass. I threatned to cut him down; I had a cutlass. He begged for mercy. I told him, he should have it if he behaved well. I found a steel spectacle-case, with spectacles in it, a box, with some pins in it, and a pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to search Slight's lodgings?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Pinnock's room, did you find any thing there?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes, a tea-chest, another looking-glass, a dark lanthorn, and a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon might you pursue them, after they had passed the watch-house?</p>
               <p>Blower. They had just got a-breast of the watch-house when I attacked them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think Jones was one of them?</p>
               <p>Blower. I do; he had the same clothes on when my brother constable took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed the same as when you pursued him?</p>
               <p>Blower. He had the same hat and clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of the same size and make?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes, he is. I am sure Slight was one, and I believe Jones was another.</p>

               <p>Cohen. The window-shutter was bolted and the window shut down; the window-shutter was on the outside the window, and bolted within.</p>

               <p>Q. Had either of the prisoners been at your house within twenty-four hours before the tea-chest was found there?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. No; if they were, I was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they not a liberty to resort to your house when they pleased?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. Many people resorted to my house. I am an unfortunate girl of the town; I did not see them at my house.</p>

               <p>Pinnock. I bought it at Hockley-in-the-hole; the knife was brought in by Price.</p>

               <p>Pinnock. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. That is impossible: you say, you recollect its being brought in by Price and two men; you must know whether it was day or night?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. It was in the night; I was in bed, they waked me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago?</p>
               <p>Pinnock. I can't tell.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you get into Mrs. Parker's house?</p>
               <p>Price. By forcing open the shutter; we put a chissel to the shutter, and then forced it open with a crow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do inform the court what method you take to force open a window?</p>
               <p>Price. If there is any place we can get a chissel in at, we make a little room, and then we put in the crow, which has such power, that it will force any window open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open this window that way ?</p>
               <p>Price. Jones and Slight broke it open that way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it?</p>
               <p>Price. Between one and two o'clock. I was without side, to give notice if any body came. They gave me a tea-chest and this looking-glass, and a cannister full of sugar; that was all they gave me at that time. I was sent in afterwards, and I brought out two coloured aprons and several other things, and a bottle of brandy or rum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money?</p>
               <p>Price. There might be money, I did not see any of it. There were two or three check aprons, and this pair of gloves, and I took the spectacles; this book was thrown over the bank.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is my book; my name is in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to the constable. Did you find the book where the prisoner directed you?</p>
               <p>Lee. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Price. Where did you go afterwards?</p>
               <p>Price. We came down a narrow path, and so across Clerkenwell-Green. I had a glass under my arm, a bottle of brandy in my pocket, and they a handkerchief tyed up, with some of the things in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had both of them things under their arms?</p>
               <p>Price. No; only one had the bundle.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you yourself ever been with him there?</p>

               <p>Price. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he a coat on or no?</p>

               <p>Blower. He had a coat on then; when they saw me a coming up to them, they turned round short.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a coat on when he passed you?</p>
               <p>Blower. I am certain he had a red waistcoat on; I will not be positive whether he had a coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the next day?</p>
               <p>Blower. The next day at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It struck you that he was the same man from his dress, did it?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a coat on then?</p>
               <p>Blower. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of his dress struck you at that time?</p>
               <p>Blower. A red waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lee. What constable was it that took Slight and Jones?</p>
               <p>Lee. They ran away from me, and a brother constable, Mr. Bishop, took them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Jones to Price. Did you ever see me break open any house in your life?</p>
               <p>Price. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where?</p>
               <p>Price. The house of Mr. Mott, at Ball's pond, and he also helped to break open Mrs. Parker's house.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Rooper came to my house, and said Slight and Jones were gone by at the top of our street; I desired they would pursue them immediately; I also joined them. We overtook them, I believe, in the space of a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Were they running?</p>
               <p>Bishop. They were making the best of their way; they every now and then turned round, and one had a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them?</p>
               <p>Bishop. Holtham, alias Slight, I believe.</p>
               <p>Slight. That knife I cut my bread and cheese with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them make any resistance when you took them?</p>
               <p>Bishop. Slight was taken first; Jones jumped over a ditch. Mr. Rooper bid him come back, which he did, and he took him. We took them to Bridewell, there we searched them; there was nothing found upon them. The keeper of the prison took a piece of linen out of Slight's pocket, which Mr. Mott claimed.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said you were concerned with them in breaking open Mott's house.</p>

               <p>Slight, alias Holtham's Defence.</p>
               <p>I can tell how I came by this linen. I went into a public house and called for a pint of beer. Pinnock's mother, who came to my master's where I lived, with butter, had fetched it out of pawn, and I put it in my pocket I got up early in the morning they are speaking of; I was going to my father's, to do some work that I was obliged to have done by eight o'clock. I work for Mr. Jarvis on Snow-Hill, and make crnet handles.</p>

               <p>The night that Mrs. Parker's house was robbed, I was at my father's house; I was a-bed there at nine that night; I did not get up till half an hour after nine in the morning. Here is a woman here that can swear I lay at my mother's house the night this house was broke open.</p>

               <p>White. On and off about six months; my room is on the garret floor. I heard he was taken up either on the Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell when he lay at this lodging, and when not?</p>
               <p>White. I can't punctually say; he might be there, and I not know it. He was in my room about eight o'clock on Tuesday night; I can't say what became of him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him the next morning the day he was taken up?</p>

It was a very windy night; there were large trees before the house, and we heard a noise, but thought it was the wind among the trees. When I got up at six in the morning, I found the window with the bolt broke, and the staple wrenched off; the drawers were taken out of the bureau, and laid some in one place and some in another. There were six locks to the bureau, which were broke; there was a closet at the upper-end of the room; they could not break the lock open, so they broke the pannel of the door; they took the wine from that closet.

He was discharged on the second of June; we missed the things after that; I did not suspect any thing till Mr. Winch came and offered part of the goods to me. Mr. Winch brought me a sample of saffron; as soon as I saw it, I knew it to be ours. I fetched a sample of ours, and compared them together, and they were as much alike as possible. Mr. Winch told me there were three or four pounds of musk and other things offered him. I went next morning to his house in the Hay-market; he was to get the man to bring the goods. I went and saw them; the musk I trimmed up myself, and can swear to it; and I saw the other things.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they in when you saw them?</p>
               <p>Vazey. They were in paper bags when I saw them at Mr. Winch's; I believe some of the bags were ours. I went on Saturday morning to see the man that had offered them for sale; he was waiting for me. I examined the goods. I said, I shall buy them, and make very few words with you, after I have looked at them. I asked Smith, who offered them to sale, whether the goods were in time, (meaning, whether the duty was paid.) He took me up as short as could be, and said, Yes, they are of my own entry; he knew me very well. I took up the cake saffron, which was manufactured here, and not imported in that state in which it was, and said, Is that in time too? he said, Yes. I said, Do you know me? He said, he knew me very well. I said, I shall stop you and the goods; he then acknowledged that he had the goods of

He told me and his uncle, that this Smith told him several times to take goods out of Mess. Kenton's and Vazey's warehouse; that he told him he would not do any such thing; but that he persuaded him at last to take the goods; that he took them about the beginning of March last, and carried them to Smith's lodgings, and that Smith received them of him, knowing them to be stolen, and that they were Mess. Kenton's and Vazey's. He said that Smith came to him at another time at his master's warehouse, and asked him if he had got any goods; he told him he had not: he said, I can sell the goods very well, and the money will serve us both for pocket-money; but he said that he never received any of the money that Smith sold the goods for.</p>

I called her up into my room, and asked her if she knew any thing of that key; she said, she did not. My wife went up stairs to examine her things; we opened her box, and found the things mentioned in the indictment. As I missed a great many things that we could not find, I desired my wife to search her. We found a bunch of keys under her stays, there was about sixteen or eighteen keys. I charged a constable with her; we found there had been nineteen drawers, boxes, and trunks opened. She confessed stealing my things before my Lord Mayor; she said she had the keys of a person over the water.</p>

The closet door was broke in the middle; the bolt of the back parlour was wrenched off, and the street door, which I saw locked, bolted, and chained over night, was open. I missed the goods laid in the indictment; (mentioning them ) some of them were in the closet, and some in a cupboard in the parlour.</p>

             came into my bed-chamber a good deal frightened, and told me that the house was broke open. I got up and came down stairs. I went in the first place into the little parlour on the ground floor, there I found a window-sash up, and by the violence with which it had been forced, the screw that fastens both the sashes together was broke in the middle, and the hinge of the shutter was wrenched off; it is a folding shutter, and the hinges of one of the shutters happened to be on the outside; one of these hinges it was which was wrenched off, and in the parlour there were several little paper boxes; the papers were all scattered about the room. At the farther end was a bureau desk, which was broke open, and the papers it contained were some of them scattered about. From thence I went into an adjoining room (a parlour.) Upon the marble flab I found the blade of a sword and the scabbard, but the hilt was broke off and gone, and the door of the closet had been broke open. From thence I went into the butler's pantry, which is on the same floor, the door of which, I believe, had not been locked, and there I missed the plate.</p>

               <p>Q. Was nothing gone from the closet?</p>
               <p>Powell. Nothing at all; there was only china in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate did you miss?</p>
               <p>Powell. I can't be particular. Then I went into the one pair of stairs room forwards, (a bed-chamber) I found the clothes-press, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110015"/> folding-doors open, and some suits, one or two plain suits scattered about the bed and about the room. From the next room, (a bed chamber) from the back of a chair, we missed a plain suit of clothes, sea green, quite new. Afterwards as I was going out of that room, I observed the green baize door stand open; there are double doors. I thought it extraordinary that it should stand open, as there was a spring to it, under the door, in order to keep it open. I found this chissel. (Producing a large flat chissel.) I went immediately to Sir John Fielding's, and took the chissel in my pocket. There was a suit of scarlet clothes laced with gold, gone out of the clothes-press, but we did not absolutely know what clothes were lost till the butler came to town. I went to Sir

            . I am butler to Mr. Harley. I went out of town on Saturday with my master; my master ordered me to come to town to get his things ready for dressing against he came to town; when I came to the stable, the coachman told me the house had been broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave any plate behind you when you went from town?</p>
               <p>Woodham. Yes, in my pantry; it was left on a shelf, and I believe the pantry was not locked; the key was in the door, it was very seldom locked when we went out of town, other servants being left in the house. I was told my master had lost a pea-green suit of clothes with silver lace. I went up into the room my master laid in, and found them; the drawer in which they were was not broke open. I missed out of the clothes-press a suit of scarlet and gold full trimmed. From thence I went into the room where I lay, which is the next room to my master's, there a suit of sea-green with gold buttons was gone. From thence I went to my master's dressing-parlour, and missed a gold stock-buckle out of a drawer belonging to a dressing-glass. I went then into my pantry, and missed a pair of silver candlesticks, a silver coffee-pot, a silver waiter, five large silver tablespoons, three or four tea-spoons, I am not certain which, a pair of silver tea-tongs, a silver pepper box, and a silver cream-pot. We went into the kitchen, and they said there was a pair of buckles of Mr. Powell's, that were taken from the fire-side, and another pair of my master's, from the marble slab in my master's dressing parlour, which we did not recollect; then there was a new hat which had never been wore, taken off from a pinon the pantry; there were two shirts taken out of a drawer in master's bed-chamber, one with point, and another with other lace, and two fringed; I saw the blade of the sword, the hilt was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your master's sword left there?</p>
               <p>Woodham. It was left in that parlour; it was a silver hilted one. I can swear that I saw every thing but the scarlet clothes in the house that morning before I went out of town. I found the hat upon

Then we went to the back of Bartholomew-close, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110017"/> Little Britain; we were disturbed there. We were going home from there; we left the remainder part of the things, besides one chissel and one crow, the two pistols we had with us, the rest we hid under some dung, a tinder-box, a lanthorn, and a chissel. We went into Smithfield; a bullock ran out of Smithfield down Little-Britain; we followed it, and the bullock turning short upon us, we ran up a court there out of its way. Donaldson said, Don't let us go away from here yet, we may get something may be; it was a paved court, I don't know the name of it; there were iron rails at the farther end, and steps went down. He got over them iron rails, and opened Mr. Harley's yard door, which was a wooden door, and went down into the yard. I went in, and bolted the door after me. We went and tried at the windows of the house; none of the sashes would shove up of themselves, because they were screwed down, so we forced up the farther sash on the right hand side of the house, with a chissel and a crow.</p>

               <p>Holland. The prisoner. Then he called to me; I went and helped him to get the sash up. After he had forced it a little way, he got the inside shutter open by getting off the hinge, and so got in. Before he got in, he pulled out four or five pair of shoes that were upon a settle in the window, and threw them down in the yard; then he got in and took down the bar, and opened the shutter, and I got in. We went to a little pantry where the plate was; after that we came to the place we first got in at.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take out of that pantry?</p>
               <p>Holland. Two candlesticks, a coffee-pot, and some small plate; I don't know rightly what besides. Then he left me in the room, and went up stairs, and brought down a suit of light green clothes, and a suit of scarlet, trimmed with gold lace. He said, he would go up again. I said, if he did, I would not stay. He said, there was a gold watch hung up over the bed, and that Mrs. Harley was in bed. He wanted to go up and fetch it; I said, if he did, I would go away and leave him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whose house it was?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you take out of the parlour?</p>
               <p>Holland. The silver hilt of a sword; we broke open a bureau in that parlour, but I don't remember that we took any thing at all out of it. There was a dressing-glass with a little drawer, which I think was locked; we opened it, and took out a gold stock-buckle. We came away the same way as we got in; we carried the things to

               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Holland. One hundred and six ounces, with the lace that came off the clothes. We took the lace off the scarlet clothes as soon as we got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it all burnt?</p>
               <p>Holland. All, as far as I know; I did not know of there being any left.</p>
               <p>Q. What, was it burnt before it was weighed?</p>
               <p>Holland. Yes, directly: we sold her the light clothes and the rest of the things; we agreed for twenty-three guineas or thereabouts for all; I am not quite positive whether it was that or more; it was thereabouts. She did not pay us for them; she said, stay till Isaac gets up, that is,

               <p>Q. What became of Donaldson?</p>
               <p>Holland. The money was paid to him, and he paid me; who paid him, I don't know. Here is a hat which was taken from me, that we took from Mr. Harley's, from off a hook in the pantry; he had one, and I had the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this chissel?</p>
               <p>Holland. Yes, this is my chissel; he told me he left it sticking in a door to keep it open. I was not quite up stairs, so I don't know where he left it. He wanted to go back to fetch it; I said, it was too late; St. Paul's clock had struck five before we came out of the house; we were in the yard when he wanted to go back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the chissel?</p>
               <p>Holland. Yes, very well; I broke that corner of it off myself. ( Note, the chissel had part of the shoulder of it near the handle broke off.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do they make the chissels often so?</p>
               <p>Holland. I am not a judge of that; I stole it out of a carpenter's shop.</p>

               <p>Holland. About six months, or rather more; I was bred a poulterer.</p>

               <p>Q. What had you at first?</p>

            . I belong to Wood-street Compter. Donaldson came to me on Sunday morning. and desired to speak to me; I told him I could not come then; as soon as I could I went to him. I took him into a yard; we walked there an hour or half an hour. He asked me whether Holland was admitted an evidence; I said, I could not tell. He asked me if any property was found; I said, Yes, some buttons and some lace; there was nobody but him and I in the yard. He gave for answer, that he thought it was a hard matter to swear to lace and buttons. I said, there is a hat they took off from Holland's head; but that Holland said, it was not Mr. Harley's. He said, Will you do one thing for me? I said, I would, if it lay in my power. He said, Tell Holland to say, when he is upon his evidence, that he bought the hat of a Jew before the robbery was committed. I told him, it was not my place to do any such thing, neither would I. I think he asked to speak to Holland himself; I said, that was not in my power to admit. He asked if Holland's wife was along with him; I said, I believed she was; he desired I would tell her. He said, I can't think what the Devil could possess me that night we broke Alderman Harley's house open, for I had above twenty guineas in my pocket at the same time. I was certainly bent upon wickedness that night, for when I went up stairs into Alderman Harley's room, there was somebody in the Alderman's bed; there was a green and white cap lay upon the pillow, and I thought it stirred; I took the pistol in my hand, says he, and said that if he got up, I would blow his brains out; with that, he said, he never saw the cap stir afterwards. He said, he brought some clothes down out of the room; he said, they melted down the silver, and that there was above a hundred ounces of it. He said, As to that lace they have got, if it is Alderman Harley's, it is what that damned bitch or whore, I don't know which he said, has cheated

             out of, for he burnt it in her room. I left him, and went into the lodge; I said to Holland, How could you say that hat was not Alderman Harley's, when Will has just been telling me it is, and who melted the plate and burnt the lace down? Holland said no more.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Donaldson?</p>
               <p>Brown. He worked with the city carpenter; our prison wanted repairing, and he worked upon it; I have known him about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew you was a turnkey of the gaol, I suppose?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And so, he without any inducement whatever, told you this story?</p>
               <p>Brown. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. It seems pretty improbable he should tell this story to you?</p>
               <p>Brown. He told a good many of these witnesses, Wood and Phillips, That as for Brown, if he had held up his finger, he should have followed me all about London; and that he did not think I should have deceived him.</p>
               <p>Q. What could induce him to make such an ample confession as this to you?</p>
               <p>Brown. I imagine he took me to be a friend, and expected I would tell him every thing that had passed about Holland's being admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. When was Holland admitted an evidence?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110019"/>Brown. The night we took him: we took him to Alderman Harley in Bucklersbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any expectation of being admitted an evidence before this?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner's council to Holland. Do you remember any thing of this man's coming in and asking you how you came to say that hat was not Mr. Harley's?</p>
               <p>Holland. I don't remember any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. Do you remember Brown's saying any thing to you about this?</p>
               <p>Wood. I came to the lodge on Sunday morning; he said, Wood, I have heard more than what you are aware of; and told me the same as he has said now. When I took him, he said, if he had seen me five minutes sooner, he would have blown my brains out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>With regard to what Brown has sworn against me, it is as false as God is true: he asked me twenty questions, but I would give him no reply. I know nothing of the robbery: I can bring proof who I lodged with the night Alderman Harley's house was broke open. The reason why Holland attempts to take my life away, is, we quarrelled once about a supper at Lumley's; I beat him; he brought a pistol and fired at me; I turned the pistol off, and the ball went under my arm; there is a man in Mr. Akerman's custody, that can prove the same.</p>

               <p>Prior. I can't recollect that day particularly what time he came home. He hardly ever came home later than eleven, excepting half an hour on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he never out?</p>
               <p>Prior. Never out of a night since he lodged with me; he generally dined with me of a Sunday, and paid for his dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole time he has been with you, he has not been out of a night?</p>
               <p>Prior. Never to my knowledge; I always lock the door, and take the key into my room.</p>

               <p>Prior. Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get out of a morning?</p>
               <p>Prior. I let him out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you always up at that time?</p>
               <p>Prior. Yes; if I was not, he always called me up to let him cut.</p>
               <p>Q. So you take upon you to swear that he never laid out of your house a night all the time he lodged with you. Do you know where he worked?</p>
               <p>Prior. No; I have seen many of his tools, and have bought chips of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Holland?</p>
               <p>Prior. Yes; I have seen him in my house, but not to know him; only they said that was Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you seen him often?</p>
               <p>Prior. Only once or twice.</p>

               <p>Q. What, get up at four o'clock and let you out?</p>
               <p>Field. Yes, and fasten the door after me, and go to bed again.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Leather-lane. I came to London with the prisoner; he has been in London upwards of a twelvemonth; we both worked for one master; we had words, and he went to work for another; he had a very good character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his following his business these last five or six months?</p>

            . I am washerwoman; I went to wash at Mr. Grieve's on the 21st of May, at one o'clock in the morning. After I had been there about an hour and an half, I was washing the maid said she heard a noise; Mrs. Grieve went up stairs, and said, there was no harm. In about half an hour Mr. Grieve came down, and said he had a disorder in his bowels; he went in a little place backwards; I thought the necessary might be backwards; we washed in the kitchen, I was in the kitchen under ground. I can't tell whether he went into the yard or no; I find since that the necessary is up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay below?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. He returned up stairs directly. The alarm of fire was about half an hour after this; upon which we went to the door. Mr. Grieve came to the door; I went and called the turn-cock; when I came back again, Mr. Grieve was moving some things out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were those things?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. They were tyed up in bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. He wanted a little water to drink, I said he had better have something in it. I saw a woman in her shift, crying out, Fire! I only saw the woman, I did not see-where the fire was. The people came and said, Mr. Grieve, the fire is in the stable, you need not move any more. He said he would go up stairs, and see how things were; several people went up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. When he came down he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110023"/> more than his shirt on; when he came to the door he had on his coat and waistcoat, a white cap, and his shoes and stockings.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear him say that he wanted to go to any place to get some liquor?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he went backwards: do you know where he went to?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He went up stairs again, and there was an alarm of fire, you say?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think, the first thing he did was to endeavour to save his property?</p>
               <p>Dagworthy. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the window up stairs command any view of the stable?</p>

            . I live at the lodge at Clement's Inn, I am porter and butler to the society; I rented the stable that was on fire, of Mr. Wingrave, at the Lamb Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see the stable before the fire?</p>
               <p>Almon. I was at the stable at ten o'clock over night.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses does the stable hold?</p>
               <p>Almon. Two; I had only one at home. I had a candle in a lanthorn with me, but the candle was never out of the lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other way to the stable but by the door?</p>
               <p>Almon. Not that I know of. Between three and four in the morning I was alarmed with the fire. I went to the stable; it began at the farthest end from Mr. Grieve's house, as far as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence did you conjecture that?</p>
               <p>Almon. Because that end was on fire; the other was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observation upon any circumstances that led you to think any thing particular set it on fire?</p>
               <p>Almon. I found two bunches of matches in the stable, one of which had been lighted; I am no: positive whether the other had or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing extinguish them?</p>
               <p>Almon. The litter where the matches laid was damp, and I believe that extinguished them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the stable fastened as you left it?</p>
               <p>Almon. A neighbour had been kind enough to break it open, and let the horse out.</p>
               <p>Q. How far distant is this stable from the prisoner's house?</p>
               <p>Almon. It joins to his back yard; there is a window from the stable into his back yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What height from the ground?</p>
               <p>Almon. About a yard; there was a light inside shutter to it, which hung so that a person might open it with one finger.</p>
               <p>Q. Might a person put any thing into that window from the prisoner's yard?</p>
               <p>Almon. Yes; and I believe a person might touch the hay-loft.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they put any thing into the hay lost?</p>
               <p>Almon. Yes, any thing of a light weight.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Did that wooden window belong to the hay-loft or the stable?</p>
               <p>Almon. To the stable. The hay-loft was all on fire at the other end.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said just now, the fire was on the outside?</p>
               <p>Almon. It was both on the outside and inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the fire appear to be in that part where the matches were?</p>
               <p>Almon. The matches were in the middle of the stable; the fire was at the farther end from the prisoner's house. These are the matches; (producing two bunches of remarkable large matches; two or three matches upon one bucnb were a little singed) I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. How do you get the hay and straw into the lost if there is no door to it?</p>
               <p>Almon. There is a trap-door in the middle of the stable.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any lease of Wingrave for this stable?</p>
               <p>Almon. No; I rent it for two guineas per year; I have had it from the latter end of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the lanthorn no open holes in it, that you carried to the stable the night before the fire?</p>
               <p>Almon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said to any body that there were holes in the lanthorn?</p>
               <p>Almon. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And the fire was at the farthest end from Grieve's house, and from the window you have been speaking of?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110024"/>Almon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, a man might put his hand up into the window, and into the hay-loft?</p>
               <p>Almon. A man might, if he had a long arm, for the bars of the window are as high as the hay-loft.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the other end where the fire was?</p>
               <p>Almon. About six yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the matches?</p>
               <p>Almon. Opposite the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of the straw or litter burnt about these matches?</p>
               <p>Almon. The engine had been playing a good while before I found them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any straw at all singed or black about where the matches lay?</p>
               <p>Almon. I really will not say, it had the appearance of being set fire to. When I saw the fire, it had the appearance as if done from something at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the fire began on the outside of the stable opposite Mr. Grieve's house, or the inside?</p>
               <p>Almon. When I saw it, it was on fire on both outside and inside.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Was the lost burnt through atthe time you saw it, or only burnt at one end?</p>
               <p>Almon. It was not burnt through when I saw it first.</p>

We got it under, and a man belonging to the stable came and said, Here is what set my stable on fire, I believe; here are two bunches of matches.</p>

            . I deal in coals; I live next door but one to Mr. Grieve's. About a quarter or half an hour after three, I can't be punctual to the time, I was alarmed with the fire; this stable that was on fire was just behind my house, between me and Mr. Grieve's. I went to go up an alley to go to the stable-door; there I saw two boxes with a candle alight in them, and a third with a whole candle not lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you alone then?</p>
               <p>Briddel. No; several people came before I came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose abundance of people had been there before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing you observed particular in the boxes?</p>
               <p>Briddel. I took them into my own shop, and set them on the compter, and put the candles out. After the boxes were gone, I observed a great deal of wet, which I supposed to be oil, that ran through the boxes whilst they stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any other contents of the boxes, besides what you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>Briddel. I did not examine them any further at that time; I gave them to the high-constable about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might these boxes be from the prisoner's house at the time you found them?</p>
               <p>Briddel. There is only one house between his house and this alley; the boxes stood against the door that leads into my shop; there was a door that opens in the middle of the alley that we don't make use of; I laid small wood for lighting fires on the inside against that door; these drawers were placed so close to that door that one of the candles had singed the paint on my door.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110025"/>Q. But before this time Grieve had been removing his things out of his house; had he not every thing in confusion?</p>
               <p>Briddel. I was in confusion in my own family; I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the stable were these candles?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Fourteen or fifteen yards.</p>
               <p>Q. They could not possibly burn the stable in the situation they were in?</p>
               <p>Briddel. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there shop-books in these drawers?</p>
               <p>Briddel. There were some papers in the drawers I saw, but I did not examine them while they were in my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the candles fixed in the boxes?</p>
               <p>Briddel. One in a corner in each drawer; one of the candles had turned down, and laid hold of the wood of the drawer; I rubbed the fire out of the wood with my finger and thumb.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these candles open in the drawer?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Yes, burning as if in a candlestick.</p>
               <p>Court. The alarm of fire had been a long time before this, had it not?</p>
               <p>Briddel. I went down as soon as I had got my clothes on.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a good many people, were there not?</p>
               <p>Briddel. There might be ten or a dozen.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. I suppose the candles were burnt down a little?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might these two candles be in the other box?</p>
               <p>Briddel. One was not much longer than my finger.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether these candles were not brought by people who ran out in a hurry in the middle of the night to see the fire?</p>
               <p>Briddel. If the people did bring the candles, I don't know how the drawers came there.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it at all likely, that if Mr. Grieve wanted to set fire to your house, that he would stick candles open in a drawer against the door of your house?</p>

               <p>Briddel. I can't account for his reasons.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Do you know any thing about opening the stable-door?</p>
               <p>Briddel. When I came out the stable-door was not open; the fire was broke out on that side next my house; I took the boxes into my house, and then I went up stairs to endeavour to save some of my own effects. The stable-door was broke open soon after, and the horse taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose this alarm of fire was what called you up?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you was some time a getting up?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Every body that went to the stable up this passage must pass by these candles?</p>
               <p>Briddel. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time the fire of the stable was very high, was it not?</p>
               <p>Briddel. It had burnt up, and I was afraid of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose Mr. Grieve was moving his drawers and put these books in them, might not any people that had been alarmed by fire, put the candles upright, for the sake of making a light?</p>
               <p>Briddel. It was pretty light, we did not light a candle in our room: before I put my clothes on, I saw the person that cried fire, in her shift.</p>
               <p>Sampson Rainsford. I am high-constable. I lay at my house at Enfield, I came home on horseback. When I came to the watch-house Mr. Grieve was conducted there by the constable. I went down to the house; Mr. Briddel told me that he had found three drawers in his passage, two of which had lighted candles in them. The church-warden was along with me; I said, let us see if we can't find places that these drawers will fit: he gave me three drawers; the drawers had greasy shop-books and some bits of candles in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these papers greased in the manner they are now?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they the prisoner's hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. They appear to be the same handwriting as his books are kept in; there is a letter directed to Mr. Grieve in the drawer. I found a place in the prisoner's shop where all the three drawers fitted exactly. There was a quantity of oil in the bottom of the drawers. He confessed they were his drawers before Sir

               <p>Rainsford. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say before Sir 
               <persName id="t17700711-25-person320">

            , how he came to move the drawers out of his house? Did he not say, he moved them out of his house on account of the fire?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110026"/>Rainsford. No; he did not say any thing about them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have these drawers been in your possession ever since?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. No; in Mr. Crocker's.</p>
               <p>Q. from jury. What part of the shop did they come from?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. There is a plan drawn out; I can point it out in the plan. It was at the end of his compter, a little place cut out; there were three hanging grooves that just held these drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they handy to take out at the time of the fire?</p>
               <p>Rainsford. I can say nothing of that.</p>
               <p>- Crocker. I received these drawers of Mr. Briddel; I had them out of his shop about eight o'clock; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they now contain the same things?</p>
               <p>Crocker. Yes, they do, and nothing more, except the brown paper I put at the top of them when I first had them; I put them in a closet, and the oil ran through the bottom of the drawers, and wetted the place where they stood.</p>
               <p>Court to Briddel. If the prisoner had designed to set your house on fire, would he not have put it in such a situation as to set the drawer on fire?</p>
               <p>Briddel. The drawer was on fire; I said, I put it out.</p>
               <p>- Battison. I was at the stable about twenty minutes after three. I brought my engine into the yard; the stable was on fire; I went over the wall; I got it out; then I went into the lost with my branch; the lost was on fire on that part next Temple Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the farthest end from Mr. Grieve's house?</p>
               <p>Battison. Yes, two yards and fourteen inches. The fire was in the inside of the lost, it burnt right up. In about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after I had got it out, there was an alarm of fire in the fore garret. We got that out: after that the two pair of stairs was on fire, the back room on the other side of the house; the fire issued through the frames of the window; we put that out in about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>- Woodward. I am a fire-man. I got to the stable about twenty minutes before four; the stable was on fire; the fire seemed to begin in the hay-loft; the top was fell in. After we had got it out, Mr. - the church-warden, said, he thought it was done on purpose. As we were standing in the street talking, he said there was smoke coming out of the fore garret; I said, that is impossible. He looked up, and said, Gad! there is. I ran up stairs with two more fire-men with me; when we came up to the garret, the door was locked; we broke it open, and there was a large wicker basket full of lighted paper, rags, hats, wigs, &amp;c. they lay upon a sort of rack; the basket was upon a rack of clothes. I burst the door open; the flames flew out; I got in; I could not get out again. I cried for Christ's sake for help. I threw out many different suits of clothes that were on fire. I knocked my elbow through the window, and if a man had not come to me, I should have been suffocated.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in that cradle or basket?</p>
               <p>Woodward. Paper and rags, &amp;c. it cracked and burnt like hemp.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire place-in the room?</p>
               <p>Woodward. I did not see any at all; the door was locked, and the windows were shut. In a few minutes time the two pair of stairs backwards was all on fire, I can't say how long after this; and there seemed to be a place where a candle had stood, at the head of the bed; the furniture of the bed was all on fire; it was greased and tallowed all over; we got it out after. When we have done, it is a common thing with us to make a bill to carry to the office, which is signed by the sufferer; as we were drawing off for that purpose, there came an alarm that the pawnbroker's house was on fire again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the fire in the two pair of stairs?</p>
               <p>Woodward. An hour, or an hour and a half, I believe; the fire was now in the shop, the door was locked, and the prisoner said he had given the key to Mr. Bean, a shoe-maker. I sent to him, and he sent word, he had not had the key. We got into the shop, and the old wigs and papers, &amp;c. were all on fire; we pulled them down: as one of the fire-men had a quantity of the paper on fire in his hand, pulling it down, Grieve made a catch at him to prevent him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication between the fore garret and the two pair of stairs back room?</p>
               <p>Woodward. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there between the two pair of stairs room and the shop?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110027"/>Woodward. No, not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Grieve say, or how did he behave upon this affair in the shop?</p>
               <p>Woodward. He wanted to snatch the fire out of our hands, as I said, and not to carry it into the street; he looked very pale, indeed; he stood very still in a corner of the shop whilst I was putting it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time endeavour to remove any thing out of the shop?</p>
               <p>Woodward. I did not see that he did.</p>

            . I am a fire-man. I was called to this fire between the hours of three and four; when I got there our engine was there. I saw a fire coming out of the fore garret of Grieve's house. I made the best speed I could to get our engine ready for working. I could not get water to my engine, so I went up into the garret, thinking I might extinguish it with buckets; they were heaving clothes out; the fire was put out; the garret was warm in the cieling.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the fire communicate from that room to any other room?</p>
               <p>Meaden. That I thought impossible. I went out at the window to examine the roof; while I was examining the roof a man came up stairs, and said, Make haste down, there is a fire in another part of the house. I went down to the two pair of stairs back room, the tester of the bed was on fire; I throwed a bucket of water over it and extinguished it. I found it smoked very much; when the smoke was cleared out of the room, I went in and examined the bed: upon the head of the bed there was a circle of grease, I believe as big as the palm of my hand, and there was grease upon the bolster, the pillow, the blankets and quilt, which I took to be candle-grease.</p>
               <p>Q. When the fire in that room was extinguished, did any fire break out in any other part of the house?</p>
               <p>Meaden. I was in the street; we had drawn the engine away; Mr. Grieve stood at the door; he came to me, and said, I wish you would come this way, for there is a fire in the shop. I said, Where is the key? He said, he had given it to a man, one Mr. Bean, to look after the shop, about an hour before. We broke open the shop-door; when I came through the entry, he said, Don't break open that door, here is a door more convenient. When I came there it was very dark, I asked for a light; the maid went down and struck a light; while she was so doing, I returned back to the passage; there was a square pane of glass which I looked through, and I perceived more light than could arise from a candle. I forced the door open; on a shelf on the left side there was fire; I throwed some water over it, and extinguished it: after that I examined what it was; it appeared to be paper boxes and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any communication between the two pair of stairs and the shop?</p>
               <p>Meaden. I look upon it as impossible; I call them three separate fires.</p>
               <p>Court. You say, Mr. Grieve desired you not to break open that door, but come another way; how came you not to go that way?</p>
               <p>Meaden. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he was not averse to your coming into the room, because he shewed you a door?</p>
               <p>Meaden. He was not against my going into that room.</p>
               <p>Court. For what reason did you understand that he had given the key of the shop; was it not because there had been a fire in the house?</p>
               <p>Meaden. He told me he had had the key above an hour.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Grieve himself desired you would come and look at his shop; did he not?</p>
               <p>Meaden. Yes.</p>

            . I am a church-warden of the parish. I found these matches in Mr. Grieve's house; (producing several bunches of remarkable large matches) his maid-servant gave them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they a common sort of matches, or not?</p>
               <p>Marshal. I never saw any before in our parish like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you compared the matches found in the stable with these?</p>

               <p>Eliz. Smith. I lived servant with Mr. Grieve.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time buy any matches any where?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; I bought them at Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to buy matches at Wapping?</p>
               <p>Smith. I was complaining to Mrs. Grieve that our matches were not good; I said, I would bring some good ones from Wapping, which she ordered me to do; I bought two pennyworth.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before the fire was it that you bought them?</p>
               <p>Smith. A fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you used any of these matches?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those matches that were sold in the neighbourhood of the same sort?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; they were smaller.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver any bunches of these matches to Mr. Marshal?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; I gave him all that was left.</p>

               <p>Brookes. His wife was present in the house, and at the vestry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think there was 300 l. worth of plate?</p>

               <p>Q. And did you find these things that were pawned in the month of May?</p>
               <p>Brookes. Some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the greatest part there, or missing?</p>
               <p>Brookes. I believe, missing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burnet. Did you understand that the whole of Mr. Grieve's effects were sent to your house, or that they were dispersed in different parts of the neighbourhood?</p>

               <p>Burnet. I went to the fire, and left my door in care of a gentleman that lodged at my house; when I came back again, the shop was full.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Brookes. Did you ask the servant whether any of his goods were carried to particular places?</p>
               <p>Brookes. I did not: I was asked by Mr. Rainsford, to assist in taking the stock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any one pawnbroker appeared on the part of Mr. Grieve at the time this valuation was taken?</p>
               <p>Brookes. We asked him, before Sir

               <p>Council for the prosecution. Though there was no more goods in the house than what has been mentioned, there stood charged upon these goods 3300 l. in one entry in the book, twenty pieces of linen is charged 30 l. 30 s. Another entry, 20 l. 20 s. Is it not customary in your trade, Mr. Brookes, to put by the tickets which are taken off from the pawns, and then, as you have leisure, strike them out of your books?</p>
               <p>Brookes. I do that every morning; it is the common course of business: I believe every pawnbroker does that, that is regular.</p>

               <p>I shall only make an observation of one thing: I sent my goods to any body's house that would take them in: I bid my wife carry the first things to Mr. Burnet's, or any neighbour's that would take them in; I dare say, a quantity of them did not go to Mr. Burnet's; I only told them where to take my books, not my goods.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110030"/> I never was over my door but once, till I was taken out of my house.</p>

            . I was the post-boy who went out went out with the Chester mail on the 11th of March. I received the bags from Mr. Arnold, and put them into the mail, that is, the portmanteau.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you receive the bags?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Between two and three o'clock; I carried the mail in acart. When I came to <placeName id="t17700711-26-crimeloc144">the Shepherd and Shepherdess, in the New Road</placeName>

He took hold of the bags, and said he would blow my brains out if I did not let him have them. In getting down, he hit his pistol against the side of the cart, and it snapped, but missed fire; there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110031"/> no powder flashed. He told me, he only wanted a letter that was going to a young woman, and they would not let him have it; that he would take it out, and then, he said, he would send the bag to my master in a backney-coach. He said, my master lived in St. John's street; I said, he lived in Bartholomew-close. He asked me whether he had not a mole upon his chin; to which I made no answer: I began to pull my horses round, to come back again; he said he would blow my brains out if I did not go on, and appeared to me to pull out another pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the person dressed?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. In a dark brown great coat, and he appeared to me to have a black under coat and waistcoat; his great coat had what they call a Newmarket cape, a large round cape.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a pistol was it?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. A little pistol, and looked very bright (A short pocket pistol shown him.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is that like the pistol the man robbed you with?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Yes, it is like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any guard to that trigger?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark when you was robbed</p>
               <p>Wheeler. It was about three o'clock; it had been star light, but it rained very hard then, and was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any moon at that time?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. There was a moon that night, but it was down at that time (A great coat shewn him.) This appears very much like the coat the man had on; some people call them Fryars, some Newmarket capes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light that you can take upon you to say that the man that robbed you had such a coat as that, with such a cape?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. It was light enough to distinguish that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at first describing the man that robbed you, give an account that he had such a great coat?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular in his person?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I think he had rather a full look with his eye.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner first after this?</p>

            . On Saturday the 10th of March last, I inclosed a bill in a letter, which I sealed and directed to Mr. Fuller of Daintry; about ten or eleven o'clock I delivered it myself to the bell-man in Hatton-Garden, who takes in letters to forward to the post-office. (A draft shewn him) This is the draft; it is drawn by Mess. Shaw and Riley, payable to the order of Mr. Fuller; Mr. Fuller having omitted to endorse it, was the reason of my sending it back to be endorsed. After I heard the mail had been robbed, I applied to the house upon which the bill was drawn, that in case the bill was presented, they might take proper notice of the party: the bill being soon after presented for acceptance, the prisoner was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the bill?</p>
               <p>Watson. It appears so upon the face of it; I am sure that is my letter in which it was enclosed. (The letter read, in which he advises Mr. Fuller, that he returned inclosed, the draft, as he had omitted to endorse it.)</p>

            . On the 20th of March a young man presented that bill at our house for acceptance; upon observing that it was the bill Mr. Watson had given us information to stop, Mr. Sneath, my brother, one of the partners, went over with him to the post-office, and upon informing the secretary of the circumstances, he sent two gentlemen to Mr. Suetton's house; I went with them; their names were Cummings and Braithwaite. We stopt the coach twenty or thirty yards before we came to the prisoner's house, and the two gentlemen went to the house, the boy and I staid in the coach. The door was locked; they enquired at the next house, but could not hear of him. We went to a public house; the boy pointed out his master. I told him I should be glad to speak with him; he desired me to walk to his house; when we came there I produced the bill, and asked him how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the bill?</p>
               <p>Sneath. Yes; I marked it with the initial letters of my name. He told me he had received it the day before, of a man who came to buy some tea of him, whom he looked upon to be a smuggler; that he bought four or five pounds worth of tea; that he had bought six pounds worth of him once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you his name?</p>

               <p>Q. There is such a name wrote upon the bill?</p>
               <p>Sneath. I wrote that as a memorandum. He said, he did not know whether he was a housekeeper or a lodger. He looked very much confused at the time, and wanted to know my reasons why I came, and what was the matter with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110033"/> the bill. I did not immediately resolve him; but told him, if he would go with me to the post-office, somebody should go with him in pursuit of this man. He said, he would go with me. On coming down stairs, there was a man with a cart at the door with some starch; a carpenter came to fix up some shelves for him; he said, he must stay to have that job finished; and that if I would go on, he would follow me. I told him I would wait till he was at leisure. I beckoned to Mr. Cummings, and he came over to me. The prisoner went up stairs for five minutes, I believe, with a young woman that lived at the next door; when he came down, he said he would go along with us. We went to the post-office; Mr. Todd desired us to take him to Sir

He said he had received that of Mess. Welch and Rogers, in part for a draft of 40 l. I asked him whose draft it was; he could not give me any information whose draft it was, nor where he had got it.</p>

            's in search of this Newman, or Newborn; he said he lived in Bond-street. I went there with him; I got out of the coach at the end next Piccadilly, and left him with another man in the coach; I enquired almost at every house, at least at every open door, and could hear nothing of him at all. When we came up to the Castle Tavern, he said, I am very well known at this house; let us have a gill of wine together. We searched all the street, and could not find any such person. He said, Newman was very well known at the Blue Lion in Red Lion Square: I went with him there; he was very intimate with the people in the house; we enquired of them, but they knew no such person. Then we described him to the people of the house, as the prisoner had described him to us, which was almost like himself, of the dress and manner; they said, if it was any body, it must be one Johnson; but they said he was rather taller.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your direction?</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose she went away; did she not?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I suppose so.</p>

               <p>Q. What occasion had you to examine the lock?</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not lock the door yourself?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I could not double lock it; the woman was to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any maid-servant in the house?</p>
               <p>Canfield. No; there was only my master and me.</p>

               <p>Q. What became of the man that was at work in the house?</p>
               <p>Canfield. He went away as soon as he had done his job.</p>

            . No. There was one circumstance I did not mention; the next day after I had sent this letter, I went accidentally to the post-office; I saw a paper stuck up there, purporting that the mail had been robbed, and the bag for Luton stole. I went home and asked my lad if he put the letter into the post-office, he said he did: I referred to my bill-book, and found a draft was drawn upon me by my brother for twenty-four pounds twelve shillings. I then thought the draft must be in the letter. I wrote to Mr. Williamson; he sent me for answer that he had never received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110036"/>Laurence. I had before advised my I had drawn such a draft.</p>
               <p>Canfield. Did you ever receive that or master (Shewing him the draft.)</p>
               <p>Canfield. Yes He ordered me to carry it for to Mr. Laurence, the same time I the other draft to Messrs. Baldero's and Co. I was stopped at Messrs. Baldero's, so I delivered the bill back again to my master; my master called me up, when I got home, and asked me what an came for that was in the shop; I told I was stopped at Baldero's with the note he gave me; he asked me for the other and I gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner Council. Is there no possibility of putting a key underneath the door on the outside.</p>
               <p>Canfield. I don't know, it might be so, I never tried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you might put it over the door?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I don't believe they can.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not this girl go out and double lock the shop door, and put the key underneath?</p>
               <p>Canfield. The key was upon the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cummings. Please to produce all the notes you found at the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Cummings. The bills were found in the drawers, the letters underneath the bed upon the bedstead. A draft for 6 l. 10 s. (read) sent from Nantwich to London, to be forwarded to Bishop Stortford. The letter read in which it was enclosed, dated Nantwich, 7th of March. A note of hand for 6 l. 5 s. from Bishop Stortford (read.) Another from Colchester, dated March 9th, for 158 l. 10 s. and the letter accompanying it. A note for 70 l. with the letter accompanying it; another 19 l. 7 s. another 100 l. accompanied with a letter giving advice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner's Council to Canfield. You say the door was double locked in the morning.</p>
               <p>Canfield. It was to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you no doubt about it?</p>
               <p>Canfield. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you always well satisfied it was so?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I always thought it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have told somebody you have doubted it, will you say you never did?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I can't say positively.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Rutson of Bishop's-gate-street?</p>
               <p>Canfield. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell him that you was not sure whether the door was double locked or not?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I can't be positive.</p>

One of Mrs. Serjant's daughters shewed me up stairs to him, and then left me. He told me he had had a fit in the morning, that he fell down, and was some time before he recovered himself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Canfield. Do you remember any fit your master had on Friday morning?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I never saw him in a fit, I know he complained of one; I have known him intimately for four years past; I knew all his family; his general character has been very good. I told him if he wanted any thing I could assist him in, or if he was troubled or enthralled he should be welcome to my assistance: I mentioned no sum, but if he had wanted 100 l. he should have had it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you apprehend that he was enthralled?</p>
               <p>Canfield. I did not; but I could not tell his circumstances; he was to have opened his shop some little time before. I asked him the reason why he did not open his shop so soon as I expected; he said he was willing to get all his things into his shop before he opened, and his business consisted of a great many articles.</p>

He purchased a parcel of goods of me to the amount of 70 l. three weeks before this transaction, which he was to pay for before he took them away; he desired to have a few currants and raisins against he opened his shop; the goods were sent according to his desire before he opened his shop. We had an account that he was taken up; I went to him, and he gave me an order to have my goods back again.</p>

            . I went out in the evening, and locked the doors; I had one key in my pocket, my husband another; I got home just before nine; both the doors were opened, and I found the house stript of the things mentioned in the indictment. A person told me he saw the things carried into the Pyed Bull. I got a search warrant, but I found nothing there; I was ill, and it was dropt for some time; about four weeks ago Thomas King came to me, and told me where some of my property was, at the White-Bear in Duck-Lane, Westminster; the people were moved, I went to the house where they were, and there I found my plates and a saucepan; Jenkins owned that they were my things which he, Burry Payne and Holland, stole out of my house; Jenkins was taken up I believe on the day after; he said he would not tell where the things were without he was admitted an evidence; he said there was a laced cap and green herbs inside the tea-chest; there was green sage; he said the tea chest had no key; I had the key in my pocket.</p>

            . I have known Jenkins and Burry Payne about five or six months. We were going down White-cross-street about eight o'clock, and we saw this room open. I pushed the sash; one of them said, Don't push the window up, the door is open; so we went in at the kitchen-door; I don't know whether the inside door was open or no. Burry Payne went away directly; he went no further than the door. Jenkins staid at the door, and brought the things out. Jenkins took them to the Pyed Bull, White-cross-street, into the yard; there he staid till I came to him; then we took them to Jenkins's lodgings; the landlady scolded him for bringing the things there. Jenkins lodged up an alley in White-cross-street. We sold the goods next morning to one Mr. Ball, who was brother to the woman that kept the Pyed Bull. We sold them for 45 s. Burry Payne came up after the things were bargained for; he said he ought to have his share, which we gave him: I think he had his full share, or very near. The man did not pay us all together. One of the candlesticks was broke in the foot, one claw was broke off. I was taken up after them.</p>

            . I lodged at the Pyed Bull, White-cross-street. I saw Jenkins and Burry Payne and Holland bring some things in cloths backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of things?</p>

               <p>King. I spoke to them at night; they left them in the back yard all night, and next morning sold them to Ball.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Jenkins lodge?</p>
               <p>King. Jenkins lodged in Goat-yard, White-cross street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Burry Payne lodge?</p>
               <p>King. I don't know.</p>

               <p>King. I don't know; I did not stay long in the house. I took the tea-kettle for Ball down into Grub-street. When Jenkins was taken up, he told me, I knew where the things were sold.</p>

            . I rent a room of the prosecutor. I went out at eight o'clock; I shut the outer door, which goes with a spring lock.</p>
               <p>- Philips. This day month I took up Jenkins; he asked, how I came to take him? I told him, I believed Burry Payne had said something about him. He said, Payne and Holland were concerned with him; and if I would go along with him, he would shew me where he had sold some of the handkerchiefs. I went with him to an inn, but he was not at home; I went to one Ball's; Jenkins said, King knew where they were; it was Ball's brother that had the things. I went with her to the alehouse, and bid her look for the things: she said, she was sure some of the candlesticks were hers. She mentioned one that was broke at the bottom: I examined it, and found it was so broke. We went to Mrs. Ball's brother's house at Westminster; there she saw a saucepan and a pestle and mortar, which she said, she could swear to. I shewed them to Jenkins when I came back; he said, They are the four odd candlesticks.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. You found your doors open when you came back; did you find any force had been used?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The kitchen lock had the nails drawn; Holland said, that Saturday after he was taken, as a cart was coming by the door, that Burry Payne burst the kitchen door open; my lock is very slight.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had passed between you and Holland?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I went with a neighbour of mine that had been robbed. I asked him about my goods: I said, Which way did you get in? He said, If the man swears your outward door was fast, he will swear false, for the outer door was open; and as a cart went by, Burry Payne burst open the other door.</p>

               <p>Q. to Holland. Did this conversation pass between you and this woman?</p>
               <p>Holland. I told her, I could not tell whether the door was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that Burry Payne forced the door open?</p>
               <p>Holland. I did not mention Burry Payne's name to her. I told her, I could not tell whether they broke open the door or no; a cart was coming by, which might drown the noise if they did.</p>
               <p>Q. She says, you told her Burry Payne forced the door open.</p>
               <p>Holland. I did not tell her any such thing. I told her, that I was getting in at the window; that they called to me, and told me the door was open. I went to the door; but whether they forced the other door open or no, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her that Burry Payne forced the door open?</p>
               <p>Holland. No; I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. You hear what he says: did he tell you that Burry Payne forced the door open?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He did say so: I had a neighbour with me at the time, which I would have brought if I had thought he would have denied it now.</p>

            . Conoway and Richardson were concerned with me in the murder of Mr. Venables; we bought a pair of pistols in the Back Lane, near the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Jackson. About three months: we bought two pistols at a shop where they sell pistols and cutlery ware; we gave either seven or eight shillings, I can't tell which, for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of pistols were they?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Horse pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. New or second hand?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Second hand; they were brass-mounted.</p>

               <p>Jackson. Yes; we bought them of the man in the shop, not the master.</p>

               <p>Jackson. No, only his wife; only I went in, the rest staid at the door. I put them behind a picture that hung behind the door; that was on Saturday night: Conoway stood at the door; he was not acquainted with Mrs. Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see him?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I believe not.</p>

               <p>Jackson. To where Conoway lived; we staid there till Sunday morning. We went over about nine in the morning to Spital-fields, to one Homelet's, a green-shop, where we met with Fox and Richardson: Fox lodged there. We went down Whitechapel road, and took coach to the Borough, and from there to Peckham: we came back to the Borough and discharged the coach; we went only for pleasure; we went to an alehouse opposite St. George's church in the Borough; we staid there till about four or five in the afternoon, then we went over London bridge to Ratcliffe highway. We parted with Homelet in Well-close square about half an hour after five o'clock. We left them, and then went about dusk over to

               <p>Q. Did you get the pistols?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I took them out myself, they saw me; Richardson and Conoway took them of me. They went towards the Ducking-pond, I went into Thomas's; when I came back they were loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lodge at Thomas's?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No; but he used to buy the goods of us. I went in to put a surtout coat on, and Fox went in to put a sailor's jacket on: they were putting the pistols under their coats as we came up, each had one. We all four went towards Stepney. We met with a footman; we thought he had no money, so we let him pass; this was in the front of the houses by the ditch side, it was below the Crown; we all looked at him as he went by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No; this was about twenty yards before we met the two men; we met them by a row of houses by the cross post to prevent cattle going through.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were they?</p>
               <p>Jackson. They were both lusty men.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The watchman cried ten three or four minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Not very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the two men dressed?</p>
               <p>Jackson. They had light coloured clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what passed.</p>
               <p>Jackson. Conoway said, I'll stop these men, and pulled out a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he speak to?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He spoke to us all: I said, I would have no hand in it if they did stop them, and I walked off.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say so?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I thought them too strong for us. Then Richardson pulled out his pistol: Conoway stopt one, and

               <p>Q. How far was you from them at that time?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Not above twelve yards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110044"/>Q. What was the consequence of that firing?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The man dropt; that was the man that struck at Richardson. Conoway fired directly after Richardson, and shot the other; he fell close against the wall that is before the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the other man fall?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He fell nearer the highway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any difference in their bulk?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The man that Richardson fired at was rather the stoutest. They came up to me; Fox had a hat in his hand; they bid me run. for, they said they believed they had killed the two men. Fox threw the hat away near Stepney church, by the sign of the Dolphin.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from Stepney church?</p>
               <p>Jackson. About a quarter of a mile. We went to an alehouse below Cock Hill, at Stone Stairs, where we had a glass of gin apiece at the bar: we went away directly; we went to Wapping, and there robbed a man of his watch and eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in Wapping?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Below Execution Dock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where you had the gin?</p>
               <p>Jackson. That was in Shadwell; this was in Wapping. After we had robbed this man, we went to the lowermost public house in Darkhouse-lane, Billingsgate, on the left hand, there we lay till eight o'clock in the morning; we lay two in each bed, up three pair of stairs. The next morning we all went into the Borough, by St. George's church: we went to a public house just turning round the corner of the church as you go to Deptford, I don't know the sign; we had some veal cutlets for breakfast, and Richardson went out and pawned the watch for 30 s. He brought the money to us; he said he pawned it at the pawnbroker's over the way. I told this to Sir

               <p>Jackson. The Wednesday after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you go to the pawnbroker's for the watch?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I believe the Saturday following; but I can't be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to the men?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Conoway went up and bid the man stop, and demanded his money; Richardson went up to the other man, and he began knocking him about with his cane.</p>
               <p>Q. from Richardson. Whether I shot him?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not say that you could not be an evidence, because you shot the man yourself?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Richardson fired; I did not.</p>

             the other: I was looking over the window; they talked of buying a cutlass, but Conoway said, What signifies buying a cutlass? we shall not, perhaps, get our money for it on board of ship. They gave half a guinea, and he gave them half a crown change out of it. I know them very well; I have seen them together before, when they have been in trouble.</p>
               <p>Dun called again.</p>
               <p>Q. from Conoway. What did I ask you when I came into your house?</p>
               <p>Dunn. Jackson came in first, and asked if I had any second hand pistols. Conoway had only a shilling and some halfpence; so Jackson took out half a guinea, and paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Conoway. Did not Jackson ask me to lend him a shilling?</p>
               <p>Dunn. No; I heard no such thing.</p>
               <p>Jackson called in again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you bought two pistols: did you talk of buying any thing else?</p>
               <p>Jackson. We did talk of buying a small hanger, but we had not money enough to buy it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose use were they bought for?</p>
               <p>Jackson. All of our use.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the pistols?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what money did you pay for them?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I think it was a quarter of a guinea, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you had any change or not?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I believe I had some change.</p>
               <p>Q. to Dunn. How was the eight shillings paid you?</p>

He said, he supposed he should; but he should not so much mind dying, if Jackson was to die along with him; for, said he, he was one that committed murder as well as myself. I took him aside, and asked him how they did it: he said, Jackson and he and Richardson, and

               <p>Q. Did she live with the deceased?</p>
               <p>Burn. No; I never saw them speak together till that night. I have a back and a front house; she laid in a back room in the front house. When this woman came home it was between nine and ten; she was much in liquor, and quarrelled with her child; she threatened to stab it, and the like. In half an hour she went out again. Our shop was very full of people; we heard a great noise over head about half after eleven. My husband bid Hatton go and see what was the matter; he brought word, she was breaking her door, and there was nobody but her child with her. At this time Armstrong came in; he hearing a noise, went up with Hatton, and they came down in four or five minutes. The deceased brought a pannel of the door down, which she had broke out. The deceased said, we need not mind it, for a pennyworth of nails would mend it. I went in to turn down the bed, and heard her swear she would stab the child. I came out again, and desired the deceased to go and shut a house up for me up the lane; I desired them before not to go near her, because she was bent upon mischief. When we came back, she was calling Armstrong pickpocket and gallows thief. He went away to his bed: he stood in the shop, and drank a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hear what she said?</p>
               <p>Burn. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she abuse Hatton as well as Armstrong?</p>
               <p>Burn. I did not hear her mention the other's name; it was after this, when I went to bed, that she threatened him. Armstrong went to bed with a lamp; I fastened my doors, and went to bed. Just as I got into bed she threw open her sash; she lays over me: she called out,

He ran up part of the stairs; he cried out, She has stabbed me, I am a dead man; come and help me, Mr. Burn. I called to my husband, and bid him get up, for God's sake. He went up, and I followed him. The deceased was leaning all of a heap at the foot of the stairs. My husband bid us get some cloths, for he was stabbed. The blood was flying all about the room: my husband sent for a surgeon; I called out for people to come and assist me: we could not get a surgeon, so we took him to the Middlesex hospital. He told my husband that Mrs. Burke had stabbed him, and that he was very bad. He put his hand upon the place, and my husband thought his hand was cut. He was wrapped up in the bed-clothes, and carried to the hospital; the blood boiled up against the place to a great degree; I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? Did you hear her say any thing?</p>
               <p>Burn. I did not hear her say a word: I kept at a distance from her; I called to some people to take care she did not get away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear her say something afterwards about it?</p>
               <p>Burn. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing of the knife?</p>
               <p>Burn. I and another woman went up stairs after the constable had taken her away, to take care of the child, and we found this clasp knife shut, and all over blood; (producing a large clasp knife) it was close by the bed-side.</p>
               <p>Q. How many stairs down was it you first saw the blood?</p>
               <p>Burn. Three stairs and a broad step.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was no blood upon two or three of the top stairs?</p>
               <p>Burn. No; she met him about the middle of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a woman was she?</p>
               <p>Burn. She was always in liquor every night. I could not get her out, she paid her rent so punctually.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. I came home about half after nine from Islington. I heard great kicking against a door, this was about eleven o'clock; that was the first thing I took notice of. I heard her say, It is my own room, I can do what I think proper with it. I desired Mr. Hatton to go up: he did, and returned again, and said, D - n the bitch, she has broke the pannel of the door. Armstrong came in and went up stairs with Hatton, and Armstrong brought down the pannel of the door, and said, what mischief this brimstone has done! He did not stay up above two or three minutes, but he said, that with a halfpenny or pennyworth of nails, he could fasten it in to-morrow. My wife took Armstrong with her to fasten up the windows; when he returned, she sent Armstrong for a pint of beer; I did not stay for it, but went to bed. While I was undressing myself, I heard her say, Armstrong, you are a thief from your cradle, and a pick-pocket, and I can prove you one. My wife brought in the beer, and she shoved against my shoulder, and asked me to drink some beer, and said, Armstrong was gone to bed. I fell asleep, and in about half an hour my wife said, For God's sake, get up, for this Mrs. Burke has certainly done Armstrong some mischief. I got up, and found Armstrong upon the stairs, supported by one Mr. Ellis. He said, Mr. Burn, Mrs. Burke has stabbed me; and I believe I am a dead man. He lifted up his hand, and the blood ran very fast; I thought his hand was cut. I was going to put a cloth to it; he said, No, Mr. Burn, it is here, pointing to his left breast, and the blood was boiling out of the wound. I begged Mr. Ellis to take the lamp while I could get a surgeon. I went, and the first surgeon I went to, would not come. Then I went to an apothecary, he said, it was not his business; so I got a chair, and we wrapped him up, and sent him to the hospital. The chairman took him upon one of the shutters; I was taken very sick, so I saw no more of it; we were obliged to have three men to secure her.</p>

I went with him, and he brought the pannel of the door down. He asked her, what was the reason of her breaking the door? she called him gallows thief and pick-pocket, and said she would prove him one. Then he came down: he said when he came down stairs, that with a pennyworth of nails he could make it good again. I went up to bed, and in about an hour was awaked by a woman in the adjacent room: I came down stairs, and saw the deceased bleeding. They desired me to break the prisoner's door open and take her. I got two watchmen to assist, and we broke the door open. I got a light, and we found the prisoner dressed, with the child in her arms, sitting upon the bed. We asked her how she came to stab the man? she said, she knew nothing about it. When we attempted to seize her, she gave the watchman a fall: they desired me to fetch a cord to tye her, which I did, and we secured her. Then we laid the deceased upon one of the shutters, and took him to the hospital; I thought him very light when we put him upon the shutter.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was calling the hour one o'clock: Mr. Burn desired me to fetch a chair; they would not take him in the chair, so they got a horse. I asked him how he came by his wound; he said, Mrs. Burke had stabbed him, and she was up one pair of stairs; we burst the door open, and she was sitting upon the bed, with the child in her arms. I said, You have been guilty of a very bad action, and must go along with me. She said, I durst not take her out of her own room. I said, if she would not come by fair means, I would take her by soul. We took the child out of her arms, and she flew at me like a dragon; she threw me down; when I got up again, I tyed her hands with a handkerchief; she gnawed it in two with her teeth. Then we got a cord and tyed her hands; she swore then, we should not take her to the watch-house. I got more assistance, and we got her away. I then followed the deceased to the hospital, and he died. He spoke very faint to me when I helped him up.</p>

            . The deceased was brought to the hospital a little after two in the morning; he was dying when I saw him. There was a wound just below the left collar bone. I put in my finger to feel if there was any pulsation in the artery, but I found none, I kept the body in the hospital till that afternoon; he died soon after I saw him; I never heard him speak. I received an order from the coroner to deliver the body up, and attend before the jury. I opened the body, and found that the subclavian artery, the artery that runs under the collar bone, was quite cut through; there was a great quantity of coagulated blood in the cavity of the chest. I believe that wound to be the immediate cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of instrument did it appear to be made with?</p>
               <p>Lewington. A sharp pointed instrument, I should suppose.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>This man broke three times in upon me; they fastened the door some how, that I could not get in, though I had the key. This man came in and forced my pocket off, and took my money. He wanted to lay with me; and because I would not let him, he threatened to murder me. The third time he broke in upon me, I stabbed him in my own defence. He wanted to rob me of five pence I had in money, and my life; besides, he knocked me down, I believe, twenty times by my own bed side. I told him the third time he came, I would stab him if he did not keep off; I had many blows upon my head.</p>

            . I lodged over the prisoner; I was a-bed, the noise awaked me. About ten o'clock I heard the deceased come up stairs twice, and the second time he came up, the prisoner cried out murder twice. I called and said, You, Will Armstrong, what do you make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110050"/> such a noise for? I bid him let the woman alone, and mind his business He said, he was about his business. I said, if he did not get along, I would break his neck. He ran up to me, and asked me if I would fight him, and pulled his coat off. A woman came up with a candle, I can't tell who she was, and persuaded him to go down. I shut my door and went to bed, and in half an hour he came up again. The prisoner was calling him pick-pocket and thief, and all the names she could; and said, if he came up again to strike her in her own room, she would stick him. He did come up again, and was stabbed; how he was stabbed, I can't say; I was in my own room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it was in the room, or upon the stairs?</p>

            . I rented a room adjoining to the prisoner's; there was nothing more than a slight partition between her room and mine; the partition is so thin that we are forced to hang a curtain, to prevent seeing out of one room into the other. I went to bed at nine o'clock that night; about half after ten, or eleven, I heard a great noise at the prisoner's door; some people came up, and called out loud at her door, and went down again; after that the prisoner lay raving and swearing to herself, she being very fuddled. Armstrong came up, and swore he would silence her. He went into her room and gave her many blows, which I perfectly heard. He was at the head of the stairs when he said he would silence her; and then he went directly into her room. The prisoner was quiet for some little time after that; I laughed at it. and was glad she was silenced, because she disturbed me. He went down stairs; she abused him again, and he ran up stairs and beat her in an intolerable manner, so that she cried out, murder! murder! The man that lodged up two pair of stairs, called to know the reason why he made such a noise: the deceased damned him, and ran up stairs directly, and abused him. He was drunk, I believe, as well as the woman. In the mean time, a woman came up with a candle, and prevailed upon Armstrong to go to bed; after some time she got him down stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who the woman was?</p>
               <p>Thacker. No, I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it Mrs. Burn?</p>
               <p>Thacker. It was not her. He went down stairs. At the bottom of the stairs he swore how he would use the man that was up stairs, next morning; he swore vengeance against him. The prisoner said, You Armstrong, if you beat me any more, I will stab you. Armstrong ran up again in a great hurry, and said, D - n you, you bitch, I'll make you remember threatning to stab me. He ran to the door; there was a scuffle at the door; I can't be certain whether he went in or not; I believe he opened the door. He cried out to Mrs. Burn, I am stabbed: he ran down about three or four steps; there he stopt, I believe, for three or four minutes, and then he ran down to the bottom of the stairs. I let them alone, as I knew them to be very abusive persons; I should have been abused if I had spoke to them. When I came out of my room, he was just carried away to the hospital, so I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Thacker. Sometimes I sell pocket-books, and sometimes ginger-bread-nuts, as I am almost blind: I can't see your lordship now: I was a peruke-maker by trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these people any quarrels before?</p>

               <p>Thacker. I can't say they had.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of Armstrong's ever coming into her room before this?</p>
               <p>Thacker. No; I have lodged there six or seven weeks; Armstrong lodged there all that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of her breaking the pannel of the door?</p>
               <p>Thacker. That awaked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110051"/>Q. Did you hear Hatton's voice?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I could not distinguish his voice well then.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he was in the room?</p>
               <p>Thacker. He came in twice, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he come in?</p>
               <p>Thacker. The door was open; I heard him go in without opening it. I believe the door was open when he came up the third time, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who broke the door?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say she had a right to break her own door?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I heard her say she had a right to do with her own room as she pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any connexions with this woman?</p>
               <p>Thacker. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No concern in petitions with her?</p>
               <p>Thacker. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say, they should not keep her out of her room while she paid her rent?</p>
               <p>Thacker No, I did not. Two people were talking with her about her breaking the door; she said, She had a right to do as she pleased with her own room; for into her own room she would go. This was before Armstrong came up to beat her. They found means to open her door.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that, when you did not get up?</p>
               <p>Thacker. I heard the door open and shut: I believe she had mislaid her key, and afterwards found it.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to me by two watchmen: I asked her how she came to wound the man; she said, she knew nothing of any man's being wounded. I looked at her clothes, and her apron was all sprinkled with blood. I asked her how that came; she said, the deceased had struck her on the face, and set her nose a bleeding. I looked at her face, and saw no marks of blows; I looked up her nostrils, and there was not the least signs of blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any appearance of her having been beat?</p>
               <p>Boclare. No; there was not the least signs of blows; I saw blood upon her left hand. I saw the deceased in the hospital; he desired to be put to bed; and said, he was a dead man. I heard the prisoner say, she did it in her own defence. I examined the place where the blood was upon the stair-case, three steps before you go into her room, but there was no blood above that; the blood was three or four yards from the outside of her door. There is a large broad step; I apprehend the blood poured down him as he stood upon that broad step.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thacker. Where was the blood?</p>
               <p>Thacker. Down four steps; there he rested: it was his right side as he came down.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Burn again.</p>
               <p>Court. Recollect yourself, and be sure to answer my question truly and with precision. I understood you in the course of the evidence to say, that after you had returned from shutting up the windows, that the deceased remained in the shop, and drank some beer?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. Yes, a very short time, and then he went with me, and shut the shop up afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. You don't know what might have passed between the time of hearing the outcry of murder, and the time you saw him?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. It could not be above a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. In the first place, tell me, as near as possible, how long it was after he took the lamp and went away from you, before you heard the cry that he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next thing you did after he took the lamp, and went to bed?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. The first thing was to shut two doors; then I went into my own room and latched the door, and began undressing myself; I was undressed in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you dropt asleep?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. No; I was but just laid upon my pillow; it could not be but about a quarter of an hour; it was rather more than less.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the stair-case that goes up to her room?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. About two yards; the stair-case goes up by the side of my room; there is only a wainscot between the stair-case and my room.</p>
               <p>Q. From the first time he went up stairs and brought down the pannel of the door, till he went up to bed, had he been out of your sight?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. Never, but for the pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had taken the lamp to go to bed, could any body have gone up that stair-case to her room, without your hearing them?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. No, they could not, unless they went without their shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the account given by these people: is it true?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110052"/>E. Burn. The account they have given is wrong; her husband gives them half a crown a day to come here: they never came out to assist me when I cried out murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true the deceased did go up two different times before this blow was given?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. He did not go up stairs; he went through the entry beyond the stair-case.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, what was it that induced her to swear she would stab him?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. She had been swearing in the morning that she would stab this old man.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell how high he had got upon the stairs when he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. He was a little man, and very nimble. I heard him say, You brimstone, will you? and the thing was done immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say; the Black * and the other man are hired by the husband to come here?</p>
               <p>* Davis is a Black.</p>
               <p>E. Burn. Because I asked them how they came here, when they would not assist me before. Davis said, he had half a crown; and Thacker said, he was paid for it.</p>
               <p>Thacker. I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Davis. Have you half a crown for coming here?</p>
               <p>Davis. I have not had half a crown yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you to have half a crown?</p>
               <p>Davis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did her husband come to you to come here?</p>
               <p>Davis. I don't know whether it was her husband or not; he came to know if I knew any thing about the murder.</p>
               <p>E. Burn. He shewed me two shillings and six pennyworth of halfpence.</p>
               <p>Davis. They are the halfpence I brought from home with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you these two shillings from?</p>
               <p>Davis. From Mr. Burke.</p>
               <p>Q. to Thacker. You said, you had nothing from Burke?</p>
               <p>Thacker. He gave us two shillings apiece to buy victuals.</p>
               <p>Court. Thacker, if you have been betrayed into any thing more than truth, it will be better for you now to correct your evidence in time.</p>
               <p>Thacker. I have not said any thing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Court. You just now said, you had not any money.</p>
               <p>Thacker. I said, I had not half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he apply to you to come here?</p>
               <p>Thacker. On Friday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you here any other day?</p>
               <p>Thacker. Yes, upon Saturday and yesterday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you have had from this supposed husband?</p>
               <p>Thacker. He gave us eighteen pence apiece yesterday; we had neither of us any money, and he gave us eighteen pence apiece to buy something.</p>
               <p>Hatton again. The Black said, that the deceased went into his room, whereas he did not; he stood upon the stair-case. I desired him to go down stairs, and then the candle went out: this was before the affair happened; about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me all you know of the quarrel between him and the Black.</p>
               <p>Hatton. The Black threatened to kick him down stairs when he heard the noise; the Black got out of his own apartment.</p>
               <p>Court. Now tell me the plain truth, I shall catch you if you don't: What made the Black come out of his own room?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the deceased?</p>
               <p>Hatton. At the bottom of the stairs; I was up in the garret. I heard the Black come out of his room: he said, D - n you, if you will not be quiet, I will make you quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was he speaking to?</p>
               <p>Hatton. To Armstrong. Armstrong said, Do you think I am afraid of such a black negroe son of a bitch as you, that have travelled through Europe, Asia, Africa, and America? I am a bit of man's flesh, and am not afraid of you. I came down in order to appease them; my candle went out, and I went to bed directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was you when the Black came out?</p>
               <p>Hatton. Just at the Black's door, upon the stairs, with my candle, going to bed. Armstrong was below stairs, and had a dispute with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at the prisoner's door?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I can't swear whether it was at the prisoner's door, or within the room.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they disputing about?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I can't say.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me truly.</p>
               <p>Hatton. She was calling him pick-pocket son of a bitch, and other names.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110053"/>Q. What was he doing to her that made the Black come out?</p>
               <p>Hatton. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You do know. What did he say to her?</p>
               <p>Hatton. He said, he never was a pick-pocket or a thief in his life; nor never brought a blush upon the face of any of his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not threaten to beat her if she was not quiet?</p>
               <p>Hatton. No; I did not hear any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you went up to bed afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hatton. Yes, and I laid there till they called me up, and told me Armstrong was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>Hatton. About an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you and he had been up and brought down the pannel of the door, before the Black came out?</p>
               <p>Hatton. About an hour; it was about twelve: He was stabbed about a quarter before one.</p>
               <p>Q. to E. Burn. You told me that this man was never up stairs afterwards, and never out of your sight till he was stabbed?</p>
               <p>E. Burn. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to this?</p>
               <p>Hatton. They were all together at the time the pannel was brought down.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Where did the deceased dispose of himself after the lamp was given him to go to bed?</p>
               <p>Court. She said he was going to his own room, partly undressed. It is plain from Hatton's account, that he was up again after he had brought the pannel down.</p>
               <p>E. Burn I will tell you the real truth. Armstrong did not come home till after eleven o'clock. Hatton was the first that went up, then Hatton and Armstrong together, and brought the pannel of the door down.</p>

            , on the 4th of July. I saw the body between six and seven o'clock in the evening; the wound was about an inch broad; it was on the left side below the arm, about four inches. I passed my finger into the external wound, and passing it a little downwards about an inch, I found a wound penetrating into the cavity of the breast. I proceeded immediately to open the breast; when I had raised the breast-bone, I put my finger in the inside, and conveying it under the left side of the lungs, I felt a passage into the pericardium and the purse which contains the heart; then passing my finger upon the surface of the heart, I found a slit in the heart. I then carefully introduced my finger, so that my own knife should not touch the heart at all; I opened the wound in the pericardium; then I passed my left hand under the heart, raised it into view, and put my fore finger into the wound, which I found penetrated into the left ventricle of the heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that wound was the occasion of her death?</p>
               <p>Barton. Undoubtedly it was.</p>
               <p>Q. With what instrument do you apprehend this wound was given?</p>
               <p>Barton. I was shewn a knife, which they said he did it with (a common case knife produced.) This is the knife that was shewn me.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you judge by the orifice of the wound, whether it was made with a blunt instrument, which you see this is, or by a pointed instrument?</p>
               <p>Barton. I imagine from the wound that it was not given by a very sharp instrument; the wound answers to the size of that knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this knife had been thrown with great violence, could it have made so deep an impression as that was?</p>
               <p>Bar ton. That is matter of opinion: I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the woman had been naked, and he had thrown a knife of this sort, it would have made such a wound; would it not?</p>
               <p>Barton. I think not; it is a matter of opinion, not evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, upon due deliberation and consideration, whether, if a man had thrown this knife with violence, directed as an arrow or a dart, whether it would not make such a wound, if thrown with extreme violence?</p>
               <p>Barton. It is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110054"/>Q. Don't you think a man might throw a knife with such a degree of force and violence, that might stab her as well as if he had took it in his hand?</p>
               <p>Barton. I can't doubt of the possibility of a knife penetrating by a throw.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can't take upon you to say, whether this wound was occasioned by a stab, or by throwing at the deceased?</p>
               <p>Barton. The idea struck me then, and does still, that it was occasioned by a stab.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me your reasons why you think this wound was occasioned by a stab, and not a throw.</p>
               <p>Barton. The external wound was rather oblique than transverse. I rather think the wound was given by a stab, and not by throwing the knife. The wound went down near an inch, and then through between the fifth and sixth ribs, rather turned upwards; taking that into the whole complex idea: I am of that opinion.</p>

            . I live opposite to the apartments of the deceased. On Tuesday the third of July, about six in the morning, I heard a knocking by the prisoner at a neighbour's door opposite to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your house to the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Maidly. About the distance of one end of the court from the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise before this?</p>
               <p>Maidly. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any noise, should you not have heard it?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Yes, if there had been any noise in the prisoner's room, I must have heard it; I was up before five.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear the prisoner say at your neighbour's door?</p>
               <p>Maidly. The words, to the best of my knowledge, were. For God's sake! for Christ's sake! get up, come directly, for I have (he said) killed, murdered, or stabbed, I don't know which word he made use of, my wife. When I heard these expressions I looked out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect particularly which word he made use of?</p>
               <p>Maidly. It was one of the words, but I can't say which. Upon that I looked out of the window, and his back was towards me; when he turned back to go to his apartment, I saw his hands were all besmeared with blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your apartment?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Mine was up one pair of stairs, directly opposite the prisoner's; his was the ground floor. I spoke to him out of my window, and said, For God's sake, what have you done? he made answer, that he went to throw a knife at the dog, and it stabbed his wife. As he opened his door to go in, I saw her lay upon her back, inclining to the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you went down to see her?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Almost immediately; her eyes were closed, and she smote upon her breast with her right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear capable of speech?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I thought there were the pangs of death upon her; I told him so. I asked him what the wound had been given with; he went directly to the window, and took a white table-knife which was all over blood; he said, it was with that, as he was throwing at the dog: this was a little after six o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of this woman?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I knew her by sight, but I never spoke to either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What business does the prisoner follow?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I can't tell. The prisoner has lived there two or three months, I believe; I have lived there two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard any quarrels in the house between them?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what sort?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Swearing and cursing, and such like language.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what this dog is that he spoke of?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I know he had a dog; I did not see it that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What does the prisoner's apartments consist of? this was a lower floor, you say?</p>
               <p>Maidly. They had only one floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman dressed or undressed?</p>
               <p>Maidly. She lay by the fire almost, with a gown and petticoat on, without a cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any stays on?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I don't believe she ever wore any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her gown loose or pinned?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Her bosom was exposed, quite indecent.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did these people generally get up?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I don't know that I had seen the prisoner ten times before this morning; I am told he is a watchman. I am out all the morning, and am not at home till the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110055"/>Maidly. I clean shoes in St. Paul's church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You was up two hours before you went to the prisoner's apartments, I think, and had heard no quarrel nor noise?</p>
               <p>Maidly. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose if the prisoner had had a mind to have made his escape, he could have done it?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not hear any shrieks or outcry in his room?</p>
               <p>Maidly. No; she had no shoes, stockings, cap, or handkerchief on; she was naked as low as her navel: it looked to me that he had dragged her from the bedstead by her hair to where she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did she lay from the bedstead?</p>
               <p>Maidly. She lay by the door; the bedstead stands on one side; her head lay from the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to think she was dragged from the bed?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Because the blood lay all in streaks from the bedstead to the place where she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear that smear of blood; when you first went in?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I did not take particular notice of it at first, I was surprised; I only stood upon the threshold of the door. When I went into the room the neighbours had put her upon the bedstead: they asked me if I had any drops; I said, It don't signify giving her drops, the pangs of death are upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what manner she was moved to the bedstead by the neighbours?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I don't know; the neighbours here can tell. The blood was on the different side the bedstead from what she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you suppose he dragged her by?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I suppose he dragged her by the hair, because her hair was all loose, in a distracted form; it seemed so to me, though I would not pretend to swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a drunken or a sober woman?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I believe she was not burthened with sobriety; I have seen her often in liquor; I have seldom seen her otherwise.</p>
               <p>

            . I lodge in the same house with Maidly, I live on the ground floor. About six o'clock on the fourth of July, I heard the prisoner crying out to the next door neighbours, that he had killed his wife, instead of the dog; and begged them, for God's sake, to get up. He keeps a little black dog that used to go out with him when he went out to watch. I put my under-petticoat and shoes on, and went to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there first?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No; Maidly was there before me. She seemed as if she had been dragged out of bed, and pulled round to the other side of the bed, and she laid across the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think so?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. There was a great quantity of blood all round the bed to the door. I asked the prisoner how it happened; he said, he took the white-handled knife off the table to kill the dog; that he threw it at him, and it stuck into his wife. I saw a great quantity of blood upon the floor, and at the bed's-post at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the reason why he threw the knife at the dog?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No. Seeing the poor woman lying in that condition, I said, For God's sake, go for a surgeon. He ran out of doors for a surgeon; in a very few minutes after he was gone, she expired. The people said, we should secure him. We sent a man after him, who brought him back again: before he could get up the place, they took him away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been gone to fetch a surgeon, before the man followed him?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I believe, about five minutes; because, as soon as we lifted her up upon the bed, we found she was gone. I gave the knife to the constable. The surgeon did not come till ten or eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased and the prisoner go to their lodging over night?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Yes; and they were both very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any quarrel between them?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they quarrel often?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I have seen her have very bad bruises in her face; and now she was very much bruised, setting aside this affair. She had a great bruise upon the side of her temple, and another great bruise on the side of her breast.</p>
               <p>Q. How old might she be?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I believe upwards of forty.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any children by her?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I don't know; this was not his wife: he has a wife and children.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether she ever knew us quarrel with our neighbours?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110056"/>Prisoner. She might hear a few words between ourselves; we used both of us to drink for a day or two, when we had money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard them quarrel?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I have seen her have very bruised faces; her fingers were hurt, as if they had been chopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bruise fresh you discovered?</p>

               <p>Wheeler. Yes, I think the bruise on her temple was; and she had a notch on the back of her fingers, that looked as if it was just done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, the last witness said, he thought my wife had been dragged by her hair. I cut her hair off a few days before. I don't believe she had any hair an inch long.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this? how was her hair?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. She had hair as far as I saw.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house with the prisoner; I lodge in the two pair of stairs. The first I heard was, the prisoner came out, and said, that in throwing a knife at his dog, he had stabbed his wife. I was up; I went down stairs; she lay close to the door: It seemed to me by the blood, as if she had been dragged from the bed to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed?</p>
               <p>Holden. She had two petticoats, a gown, and a shift on. I was the first person that went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Just under the left arm, near the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hole through the gown and shift?</p>
               <p>Holden. Yes, I observed there was, when I stript her to lay her out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the gown and shift here?</p>
               <p>Holden. Yes: I washed the blood off, and then we laid her on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry her to that side of the bed where the blood was, or the other?</p>
               <p>Holden. The opposite side. ( The gown and shift produced, very bloody, with a hole in both, under the left arm.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what posture she was when the wound was given?</p>
               <p>Holden. He was not in the room then: before that he asked me to wash her, to see where the wound was. I did not think it was so dangerous then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether her hair was short or no?</p>
               <p>Holden. It was a middling length, about two or three inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her hair long enough for her to be dragged by it?</p>
               <p>Holden. I don't think she was dragged by her hair.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she lay?</p>
               <p>Holden. Upon her back, with her arms and legs stretched out.</p>

            . I heard a great noise of somebody calling to a neighbour to arise. It being an usual thing to have a great many words in that place, I did not look out immediately. When I looked out, I saw the prisoner stand by the window, with his hands all over blood. I went to his room; the woman lay upon the floor. I saw a great quantity of blood lie on the other side of the bed. I asked the prisoner how he came by the knife; he told me it lay upon the table. He said, he called her up to get him some breakfast; that the dog growled, and he could get no rest; so he threw the knife at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the table stand, that he said he took the knife from?</p>

               <p>I have lived with this woman about a year and a half, always vastly united; we never spent 2 d. out of each others company, and I believe we have been about three months in this neighbourhood; two days before we had been to dinner at one Mr. Stanley's a barber, who lived within about 40 or 50 yards of us, a man I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110057"/> knew when I was at the Isle of Minorca; I was 30 years in the Royal Regiment of Artillery; this unlucky accident happened on Tuesday morning; my wife had been on Sunday for a pail of water; Stanley bid her tell me if I would come he would treat me with a pint of beer; I told him I should go the next day to the office to receive a month's pension-money; I ask'd him to lend me a shilling and I would pay him when I came back; he lent me a shilling; I had a breast of lamb, and his wife a cabbage, and we boiled them together for dinner; we spent all that afternoon with him; we went home and went to bed without a word of any malice: the next day which was Monday I went to the office to take my pension; I told Mr. Stanley that I would bring a piece of pork home with me, and something to boil with it, and boil it with a piece of salt beef that he had; I came back about one or two; I bought a piece of pork and three colliflowers, and carried some of it to Mr. Stanley's, and we boiled it with his piece of beef; we continued there all the afternoon; we drank a good deal of porter, and I believe some gin: I can't tell what time we came away; Mr. Stanley told me it was dark before we came away; we went home directly and went to bed without any words; being pretty much in liquor we both of us laid in our cloaths all night. This woman had this dog six or seven years before we came together; I did not care to destroy it, because she had a regard for it; it is very apt to be on the bed, and very often upon my legs, and it snores three times lowder than a christian; I beat the dog off the bed once or twice in the night; in the morning when I awak'd (I don't believe she or I had waked three minutes before this accident happened) I said to her, Hannah get up and light the fire, and make me some tea; upon that she got immediately up; I bid her turn the dog out; her shoes and stocking lay some where about the bed-side; she did not turn the dog out, so I got out of bed; I opened my door and the street door, and then fell a punching the dog in order to get him out; I stood by the door; the dog not seeming ready to come out, this unfortunate knife happening to lie upon my dresser, I took hold of it; I throw'd it with all the force I had in the world at the dog; my wife at this time was stooping, with her head down close to the ground, I believe for her shoes and stockings; she fell down immediately as the knife was thrown out of my hand; her left side was towards me as I throw'd the knife; she was a short woman; I went to her and lifted her up in my arms; she said, Oh John! John! That was all the words I heard her speak. Where I put her down again, God above knows, for the blood came pouring out upon me like a torrent. As soon as I put her down, I cried out, and ran to the next door; some of the neighbours came; I told them I had thrown a knife at my dog, and I believe I had killed my wife; I said to several of them, for God's sake go and fetch a doctor; there was a man so good as to go with me; we went down Grub-street, into Fore-street; I said I knew two doctors there; when we came there it was so early none of them were up; somebody directed me to the Old Jewry to Dr. Sharpe; I saw a young man there, who I suppose was the surgeon's servant; he desired me to sit down; the gentleman would be down soon; I believe the man and I sat down pretty near a quarter of an hour before the gentleman came down; a gentleman came down and ask'd what was the matter; I told him I throw'd a knife at a dog, and was afraid I had killed my wife; he said, I must take her to Bartholomew's hospital; I desired him to come with me, for the consequence was great; when we came to the house there was a great crowd of people; the crowd cried out, ' you have murdered your wife, take him away;' a constable and three or four more laid hold of me; I said you have no occasion to pull and hawl me, I don't want to run away; I made no resistance, then they took me away very quietly to Wood-street compter. I hope your lordship will enquire into my character; I have been watchman in Cheap Ward pretty near seven years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barton again.</p>
               <p>Court. You hear he says his wife got up undress'd, and as she was stooping down with her left side towards him, he flung his knife at his dog, and stabbed her, and that she was a short woman; Was she?</p>
               <p>Barton. I think she was short.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for the kn ife to miss the dog and strike her in that manner?</p>
               <p>Barton. I am afraid not. - I apprehend that as she was stooping the arm would cover the wound entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her then, you apprehended the wound could not be given that way?</p>
               <p>Barton. I gave that as my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Might she not have received such a wound?</p>
               <p>Barton. I should think not; I can't conceive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110058"/> the part that was wounded could be open in such a posture; the wound was a few inches below the arm pit, in a straight line downwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not this part be exposed?</p>
               <p>Barton. I keep in view the whole direction of the wound; I conceive I have that knife in my hand; I contain in my mind that it is that knife, of the same degree of sharpness with that knife and no sharper; then the course of the wound; the skin was forced downwards as far perhaps as it would yield; then by the force of the blow or the plunge, or whatever it was, finding admission through the skin, it came down with the same kind of oblique wound through the intercastory muscles between the fifth and sixth ribs, and then altered its course, turning rather upwards, and slit the heart inward.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot such a knife as this by a throw make such a wound as you have described?</p>
               <p>Barton. I am absolutely of the contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any bruise upon her temples, or cut or notch upon her fingers?</p>
               <p>Barton. I took no notice of any thing but that wound.</p>

            . I was upon the coroner's jury; I examined the body very carefully; I observed a wound upon the left arm about an inch broad, and I observed the left side of her face was very much bruised, likewise her left arm near the elbow seemed to be very much gripped, seemingly by struggling, and the knuckles of her right hand seemed to be grazed with a knife, which appeared as though just done, and the pit of her stomach was black and blue; there was upon the breast what I thought an old bruise, it was rather green, but the other parts seemed fresh; as to her hair, I believe it was as long as mine * at the bottom of her head, some hair was cut off, her hair was long enough for any body to take hold of.</p>
               <p>* The gentleman wore his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you view the body?</p>
               <p>Croker I believe it was almost seven o'clock; there were twenty-one on the jury; I made particular observations; I made remarks upon paper on the whole evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am sensible that there were no blows; if there were any marks they must be old marks, because I used sometimes to give her a blow or two when she was in liquor, but not to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. You said her left arm seemed to be grip'd, was that fresh or old?</p>
               <p>Croker. It looked fresh, of a red colour.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Could not there marks be done in her struggling after she received the wound?</p>
               <p>Croker. I believe they were done in struggling; I lifted up her arm to see how such a wound could come; I lifted up her arm three or four times; I made particular observations, and it seemed impossible for me to believe that a wound could be given in that place without design, for, if a person's arm was hanging down it seems impossible to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. You hear the account he has given, don't you think, allowing her to be in a proper posture, such a wound might be given by throwing that knife?</p>
               <p>Croker. I do think it impossible for such a wound to be given by it without very great force.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The two witnesses I expected to be here, I find are not; the man that went with me for a surgeon, and the man I first called up. I beg your lordship to examine two or three witnesses to my character.</p>
               <p>- Stanley. The prisoner and his wife dined at my house on Sunday, and again on Monday.</p>

               <p>- Stevenson. I am Beadle of Cheap ward; the prisoner has been a watchman in our ward above six years; he was a very orderly sober man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a man of cruelty or inhumanity?</p>
               <p>Stanley. I never heard any such thing of him; I knew nothing of the woman; we had thirty-two watchmen in our ward, and I would as soon trust him as any man we had; I am very sorry to hear of this catastrophe.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Between the door and the dresser,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110059"/> where the knife lay; she was between the bedstead and the wall; the dog was about her feet; I took the knife from the dresser and threw it at the dog, who was between four or five yards from her; consider, gentlemen, I have a very strong arm.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who the people were that pull'd him off his horse?</p>
               <p>Daily. I know two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner strike any body?</p>
               <p>Daily. No, I did not see that he did; he rid about sixty yards in the lane after he had mounted his horse again; the cart was following him; he dismounted and came to his cart, which was about nine or ten yards off; the crowd near him seemed to be encouraging him; then he jumped up and took a spade out of his cart; he put both his hands to it, and walked smartly down St. Martin's-lane, till he came to the bottom of Chandois-street; the deceased was standing there with some people; the prisoner put both his hands to his spade, and without saying a word to him, struck him on the left side of his head, and he instantly fell to the ground; I seiz'd the prisoner, and we took the spade from him; there were a great many people came with the prisoner hallowing and hozzaing.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of people were they that were near the deceased, were they any part of the mob?</p>
               <p>Daily. No; I had been in company with the deceased in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased among the mob before the prisoner came up?</p>
               <p>Daily. Yes; when the prisoner came up first he was about seven yards from him; I did not see him at the time the prisoner was pulled off his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Can you take upon you to say you was sober at this time?</p>
               <p>Daily. I was as sober as I am now; the Bull-head is a house of call for taylors; I had been there in the morning, but I had not made any fitting.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker; I was at the Green Man and French Horn in St. Martin's-lane, at five o'clock; I saw the prisoner dismount his horse and go to the cart; he made a kind of a jump at the tail of the cart, and a woman in the cart gave him a spade; he took it upon his shoulder; there was a genteel man appeared like a farmer who attempted to take the spade from him, but he would not quit it; he walked down the lane; when the prisoner came up to the house where the deceased was, the people made a great hallo! upon that the deceased came out with his waistcoat open at his breast, and his collar open; as soon as the prisoner saw him he made a push at him; the crowd was so thick he could not strike him; he turned about and took the spade in both hands edge ways, and gave the fatal blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the people abusive to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Carney. I thought they were encouraging him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner did he appear to be cool and compos'd, or irritated?</p>
               <p>Carney. He did not appear to be in a violent passion, but indifferent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say the carter appeared to be in a great passion?</p>
               <p>Carney. I never did say any such thing.</p>

               <p>Carney. I said the same words as I say now.</p>
               <p>Court. I will read to you what you said,</p>
               <p>"The woman gave him an iron spade, the carter appeared to be in a great passion, and carried the spade in both his hands down the lane."</p>

            . I live in St. Martin's-lane, opposite the Bull's-head; I heard a great noise in the street; I went to the door; there was a great uproar; there were a parcel of men striking many people, particularly two men in my passage; soon after this I saw the carter coming along very peaceably a horse-back, by the side of his horses; the crowd was so great he could not get by without danger of running over some of the people; he stopt his horses; I believe he entreated the people to get out of the way; he smack'd his whip, or moved it about for the horses to go on, thinking that would move the people; the horses went on, that enraged the people; I believe some of the men that were a-fighting went and laid hold of the reins of his horses, whilst others were beating him in a most unmerciful manner; they that could not reach up to him jump'd up upon one another and struck him. I did not see the blow given to the deceased; the deceased was the person that struck the two men in my passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased after striking the two men?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I did not; I have seen men standing about the door of the Bull's-head, with cleavers in their hands, for what purpose I don't know; I have seen mobs rais'd there by stopping people.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any outrageous behaviour by people at this house?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I have; I once sent over to the man that keeps the house, to desire he would not let the mobs meet about his house; he sent me back for answer that I might kiss his a - e.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very proper that some account should be taken of that house; if we can root out the cause of such matters, that is the way they will cease.</p>
               <p>Q. I am informed that they have a custom in this house for what they call skirt money, that is, they take off the skirt of your coat if you don't pay 'em six-pence.</p>
               <p>Palmer. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon the ground that the case stands upon, I am clearly of opinion that it is only manslaughter.</p>

            . On the 15th of June last, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I heard a screaming; I was informed the cart that was going on had ran over a child; I took the number of the cart; when I returned and saw the condition the child was in, I ran after the carman and told him what he had done; I went with him to his mistress at Battle-bridge, and I brought him back along with me to the Queen's-head in Bath-street; whilst I went to get a constable, they let him go, but I stopt him again at Mr. Bishop's, the constable's door.</p>

            . I live in Great Bath-street, Cold-bath-fields; I heard some-body scream, I look'd and saw two children hand in hand, they were about 20 yards from me; a young woman with a child in her arms endeavour'd to stop the horses; I called to her to let them go, as I saw she would be run over else; the wheel took the child off its legs and ran over its back and head, the other child tumbled within the wheel, and was not hurt: I did not see the driver till the last witness brought him back, about a quarter of an hour after the child was ran over; a surgeon was sent for, who desired the child to be sent to the hospital immediately; the justice asked him whether he was sober; he said no, he was not rightly sober; the justice asked him what he had been drinking; he said he had drank one or two horns of ale at a gentleman's where he had been about business; he was asked about driving over the child; he said he believed he was about twenty yards from his cart, but could not tell.</p>

               <p>The Coroner. I hope your lordship will order the officers of the parish to satisfy the witnesses for their time. I never knew such behaviour in a parish in my life; Bellamy the first witness is a poor man, who is very ill, and is brought from the hospital to give evidence, and we had the greatest difficulty to persuade the officers of the parish to allow him a coach here.</p>
               <p>Court. I don't understand such inhumanity; that poor man has behaved very properly; I will not discharge the officers recognizance till the witnesses are reasonably satisfied.</p>

            . The first time I saw the prisoner was on the 6th of April. On Wednesday the 4th of April, an advertisement appeared in the daily paper, that a person wanted 100 l. at proper interest, with a premium; a letter was to be sent to A.B. at the Surry and Sussex coffee-house, in Fleet-street. I am a neighbour of Mr. Weaver's, and I was to go with him. The purport of the letter is, to enquire for J. C. at the Admiralty coffee-house. On Friday the 6th of April, Mr. Weaver and I went to the Admiralty coffee-house, and enquired for J. C. He was not then to be met with. We accordingly went again on Saturday. Upon our enquiring, the servant went up stairs to a billiard-room, and the prisoner came down. He asked if we were the persons that inserted the advertisement: I told him, Yes. He said, that if Mr. Weaver would draw some drafts three months after date, he could pay them away in the common course of business, as ready money. On Tuesday I went to Mr. Weaver, at a society that there about half after eight o'clock. The prisoner came; he was shewn into the parlour, where the prosecutor and I and another were. That person went out and left us together. The prisoner mentioned the same circumstances of the notes, as before: they wanted some paper; I cut a leaf out of a lottery-book, which he cut into three pieces for the notes. He said, the gentleman that was to advance the money, would only want common interest, as he could negotiate notes to a large amount. The prisoner asked me if I would be the drawer; which I absolutely denied. He said, it should be settled next time who the drawer was to be. He wrote the notes, all except the mark; Weaver made that. They were intended to be the forms, and I did subscribe my name as a witness. ( The bills shown him.) These three notes were wrote in my presence by the prisoner, just as now, saving the drawer's name,

               <p>Q. What is the reason that your name is struck out?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. The three notes were left upon the table after Mr. Weaver was gone, and I put them into the leaves of a book. Mr. Weaver went to bed about ten o'clock, and left the prisoner and me together. I put them myself into the club-book, while the prisoner was in the room; and, I believe, the prisoner went away about half after eleven o'clock, and I went home. I put the club-book in a kind of book-case, and locked it up; but did not take the key out. On Wednesday the 11th, Mr. Weaver was to meet him at the Admiralty coffee-house, and fresh notes were to be drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any appointment made that night to meet next day?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. Yes; in order to have a drawer's name, and to have the money. We received a letter from him that day, which I believe to be in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take such observation of the notes, as to be able to form a belief, whether that is his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. Yes, I do believe it. I was present when the letter was brought, and made a memorandum of it at the time. A porter brought it, and I opened it. I wrote upon it, A quarter before five in the afternoon, Wednesday, 11th of April.</p>

               <p>Clarkson. No:</p>
               <p>Court. Weaver cannot be examined; then the man must be acquitted. We must not presume guilt against a man trying for his life.</p>
