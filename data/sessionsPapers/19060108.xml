                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective-Inspector, City</hi>). On the morning of November 10th I received notice of a burglary at Messrs. Prager's, of 1, Aldersgate Buildings—I caused every inquiry to be made at pawnbrokers and dealers and various places, and from information I obtained I went on Novem<lb/>ber 21st to the London Fur Company at 1, Oxford Street, where I saw Mr. Barder, the manager, who produced some skins, amongst them being this sable (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which I took possession of on account of the marks perforated in it—it has since been identified by Mr. Benjamin, one of the partners of Messrs. Prager, as their property—that same day I went with Mr. Benjamin, Detective-Sergeant Stewart and other officers, to No. 1, Upper Street, Islington—while there I saw the prisoner in the street—he was a stranger to me, but he was pointed out to me—I stopped him and told him we were police officers from the City making inquiries inspecting a case of warehouse breaking which had occurred in the City on the 10th—I said, "Can you tell me anything about it?"—he said, "I cannot "—I did not at that time mention Frager's name—I said, "We are inquiring about a case of warehouse breaking at 1, Aldersgate Buildings, and a number of furs and skins have been stolen; do you know anything about it?"—he said, "No "—I then showed him this little fur and said, "Hive you sold any skins to Mr. Barder lately?"—he said, "No "—I then showed him the skin and told him I had received it from Mr. Barder, who had told me he had purchased it from him along with other skins, and I said, "This gentleman here," that is Mr. Benjamin, "has identified it from skins stolen from their place on the 10th," to which the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080004"/>
               <p>made no reply—he had said he had sold no skins to Barder recently—I then told him he must consider himself in custody, and said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "Anywhere "—I said, "Have you got a work<lb/>shop?"—he said, "No "—I said, "You have got both, an address and a workshop; I know both addresses "—he made no reply, and I said, "I am going to take you there. You are going to 98, Prebend Street, Isling<lb/>ton "—on the way there, in my presence, he handed over two parcels, which he was carrying—I opened them and one contained a Russian sable and the other a bau-marden, which is a fur—they have both been identified by Mr. Benjamin as part of the stolen property—when the prisoner handed Detective Marriott the parcel he said, "That is some of what you are looking for; you will find others where you are going "—he did not say where he got them from—the premises at 98, Prebend Street, are a workshop, and when we went there the prisoner opened the street door with a key and also the door opening into a room—we found a large quantity of furs in boxes, skins and a quantity of tails in a cupboard, all identified by Mr. Benjamin, with the exception of a few rabbit pieces—we also found a few furrier's tools—we have recovered about £450 of property; the reported loss was £750—all I recovered was in the prisoner's possession at his shop, with the exception of the skins taken to the London Fur Company; when we had collected the goods there was practically nothing else—I asked him to account for the possession of the property or produce receipts, and he said, "They were brought to me by a man in a van, but I was not here at the time "—he did not say how the man got in—immediately afterwards he said, "They were brought hen by a man; I was here when he came "—I told him he would be charged with breaking and entering 1, Aldersgate Buildings, and stealing and receiving a large quantity of furs—he said, "You cannot charge me with stealing; I received them, and you have got them here "—I took him to Moor Lane police station, where he was charged, and next morning, when he was taken from the cell to go to the Police Court, he said to me, "I got the stuff from two foreigners; they were introduced to me in the street by a man whom I do not know. One of the foreigners is a short man; that is all I know about him. "</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On this day I had the prisoner under observation for about fifteen minutes—he went into a public-house and I went into another bar; I only saw him have one drink; he was not there long—he spoke to another man who was a bit younger than himself and a bit taller, but I should not say he was a foreigner—I told the prisoner it was warehouse breaking which I was inquiring about, and asked him if he knew anything about it, and he said he knew nothing about it—he did not appear very much taken aback when I suggested that he might; be able to help me—he did not resent it in any way, but was very frank—he has been rather sullen all the way through and would not say-any thing one way or the other—I have made inquiries about him—he has been carrying on business at these premises for about twelve months—he has dealt with Mr. Barder for a great number of years, and I believe those transactions have turned out satisfactorily—on this day I do not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the London Fur Company at 1, Oxford Street—I have had a good many dealings with the prisoner and have bought from him from time to time—on November 11th I bought a parcel of fur from him containing twenty dyed sables; these (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are some of them—he did not say where he got them from; he came in the ordinary way—I have known him for twenty years—I gave him the ordinary trade price for the furs and he gave me a receipt in the ordin<lb/>ary way (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—on November 18th he came again and I bought Another parcel of twenty-two sables—that was in the ordinary way of business, and I have the receipt for them—they have been since identified by Mr. Benjamin—I paid the prisoner £20 for the first lot and £33 for the second, which I considered a very fair value—the price of sables varies very much; it depends on the quality—you can get them as low as 10s. each and you can go up to as much as £20 a skin—the prisoner left both panels of skins with me over night for me to decide if I would buy them, and he took my price, but I forget if there was any question about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I paid the prisoner on both occasions by cheque made payable to himself—generally it was a very small account; I paid cash—I do not know that I have had larger quantities from him; this was rather a large amount for him—I believe he sells on commission, and I think he mentioned something about selling these skins for some<lb/>body else, and he told me he had to pay almost as much as I paid him and wanted very little profit—he did not say for whom he was selling them—the furs do not show the wholesale people to whom they belong—we never take notice of the perforated marks, but we always expect to see the marks on them, and we always buy dressed skins—the merchants stamp the leather, not perforate it—the perforations would not identify who the sellers were—every purchaser of raw skins puts his marks on them.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Prager &amp; Co., at 1, Abrogate Buildings—on Thursday, November 9th, I left the premises about 8.45 p.m.—it was then our busy time—I locked the place up; nobody sleeps there—we occupy the upper part of the building and we bad a separate door leading to that part—next morning my son arrived and found the place opened—I got there about 10.30—we had padlocks and staples on the doors—I found that we had been robbed, and after taking stock we found property to the value of £880 had been stolen besides a sable jacket valued at £230 which had been entrusted to us for alterations by Tudor Brothers, of Knightsbridge—I have since identified as mine a quantity of furs by the perforations in the skin, which we hit with a hammer when we buy them—different firms have different perfora<lb/>tions—the total value of the skins recovered, unmanufactured, is £440—we were insured against burglary.</p>

               <p>floor, in which there was a light and a large fire—I saw three men and two females, amongst whom were Piper and Mrs. Griffiths, who was discharged afterwards by the Magistrate—the others were Clarke and Jones and Griffiths—the three men were only in their shirts and trousers, their sleeves being turned up to the elbows—they were handling some plaster of Paris on a chair—on the table and chair there was a bag con<lb/>taining plaster of Pans, and Jonea and Griffiths manipulated the wet plaster of Paris on to some wooden blocks—I saw Clarke and Griffiths pass to Jones four pieces, and Jones put them into the oven by the fire, and then he handed each piece back to them, when they would rehand it to him and he would replace it in the oven—I put Wedden and Baker at the back and went with Lee and knocked at the front door, which was the signal to Wedden and Baker to enter at the back—as I entered I saw Jones and Clarke in the passage scuffling with Baker and Wedden—this was about 2.30 a.m.—Piper was going upstairs—Clarke and Jones were taken into the room into which we had previously been looking—I said to them, "We are police officers. Consider yourselves in custody for making counterfeit coin "—they made no reply—I then left them with Baker and Wedden and went upstairs, where I saw Lee with Piper, Mrs. Griffiths and Griffiths on the first floor back room—I said, "We are police officers, and you will be charged with being concerned with the two men downstairs for making counterfeit coin," to which they made no reply—I then, with other officers, went to the back room on the ground floor, into which we had been looking, and made a search, when we found a double mould bearing the impression of a shilling and a half-crown; a half mould bearing the impression of a shilling, a ladle with some metal adhering to the sides, a plate containing some acid which I put into a bottle; a purse containing 2s. 6d. and a florin, which, I think, are bad, and three counterfeit shillings on the table; some pieces of mould in the fireplace, some plaster of Paris in a bag, and a cup containing some plaster of Paris, also a spoon and a knife on the chair that I have previously spoken of; a tin containing whiting, cork, three wooden blocks, one piece of Bath brick, two brushes, two knives, and a piece of copper wire used for taking the coins out on to the hob, and twenty counterfeit shillings on the mantelshelf, in between each one being tissue paper (<hi rend="italic">Articles pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—in the front room on the ground floor I found two wet moulds, each containing a good shilling, the pattern piece (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—the articles which I saw being made were similar to these—in the first floor back room I found a cup containing plaster of Paris, a file, a knife, a spoon, and a small quantity of metal—I did not notice the ladle being used when I looked into the room.</p>

This is a double mould that has been used for casting counterfeit half-crowns and shillings—this is a half-crown that has been made in that mould; it was found, I understand, in the purse—this is also a counterfeit florin—they are both very well made—these are twenty-three counterfeit shillings which come from the double mould; they are all pretty well made—these are two single moulds containing a pattern shilling—this is a half mould representing the re<lb/>verse side of a shilling, but it has not been used—as to the tissue paper between which the twenty counterfeit shillings were placed, when they make what they call "A load of tricks" they wrap them carefully in paper—twenty coins form a load—all these articles before me form part of the stock-in-trade of a coiner.</p>

If he made a mistake about that, he might make a mistake about me making the moulds. It was not plaster of Paris the young woman was stirring, but a cup of tea she gave me and Jones. I had only been in the house two hours. She knows no more about it than I do." <hi rend="italic">Piper said</hi>: "That detective said I was mixing plaster of Paris. It was two cups of tea. As I handed it to the prisoners I was stirring it up." <hi rend="italic">Clarke, in his defence, said that he did not make the coins, nor saw them made, being only one and three-quarter hours in the house; that at the Police Court only one police officer had said that it was plaster of Paris Pipes was mixing up, but they had all now said it was plaster of Paris.</hi>

On November 30th, after seeing Thompson taken into custody, I visited 103, Wynford Road, Islington, where Embery has a small shop—in the company of Mr. Beer and Detectives Hine and Loakes, I entered the shop and said to him, "We are making some inquiries about a side of bacon brought here to-day "—he said, "I did buy the bacon from a man I do not know, and paid him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080015"/>
               <p>18s. for it. He said he would send me the invoice in the morning. He has never been here before and I do not know what firm it came from "—I then asked him if he knew the value of the bacon—he said, "Yes, perfectly "—when questioned as to other goods he said he had no receipts, as they were not straight—the other goods were bovril, sardines and other things—one case of sardines had "E. &amp; T. Pink" on a label—it was consigned to a Mr. Inwood—I arrested Thompson at 6 p.m., and at 7.30 I saw Embery—I told him he would be charged with receiving the bacon and other articles, well knowing they were stolen—he was taken to the station—Thompson was there—Embery said, "That is the man I bought it of "—Thompson said, "Yes, that is quite right.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I went to Embery's he was in the shop—there were four others with me—I told him I had a man in custody and asked him if he had bought bacon from him—the prisoner replied, "Yes, it is true "—he then said he had paid 18s. for it—there was very little else said—we were there something like two and a half hours, but as his wife was very ill we did not wish to disturb her—I made my note of the conversation when I got back to the station about 11 o'clock—I put down all that I remembered—the bacon was uncut and exposed upon a shelf—the prosecutor had no difficulty. in recognising it as his—Embery showed invoices for everything except what I have mentioned, and those we took away—he said as to those, that they were not straight—those were the very words; I adhere to that—I told him I should take them away and make further inquiries—the shop was under our observation.</p>

B. &amp; S. "—it drew up at the corner of, I think it is, William Street, a little back street—Thompson got down and went to the tailboard—he then drew out the side of bacon, lifted it on to his head, and carried it into Embery's shop—he did not go into the shop before he took the bacon in—I went up and saw him handing the bacon over the counter to Embery—I saw no money pass—I watched Thompson drive away with his van and I then made a statement to Inspector Crouch—I saw Thompson in the shop and watched him come up—the bacon could not have been weighed while he was in there, as he was there such a short time.</p>

On November 30th I accom<lb/>panied Inspector Crouch to Embery's shop and went in with him—Crouch said to Embery, "We are police officers; a man has delivered a side of bacon in here this afternoon "—he replied, "Yes, that is quite right "—Crouch said, "Have you still got it?"—Embery replied, "Yes, it is up here "—he produced the bacon, which was then identified by a witness with us—later on Inspector Crouch said, "I should like to look round your place "—Embery took us into his stock room—as to the bacon, he said, "I bought it from a man this afternoon; I do not know his name. I paid him 18s. for it; he said he would send the invoice on in the morn<lb/>ing; I do not know what firm it came from "—Crouch asked him if he knew the value of bacon—he replied, "Perfectly well "—we went into the back parlour, which was stocked with various goods—a number of goods were in front, and amongst them a case of sardines, two boxes of bovril, bloater paste, Nixey's polish and other things—Crouch asked Embery, "Have you any invoices for these?"—he replied, "No, they are not straight "—upon that, he was charged and taken to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I made a note at the station after he was charged—I cannot tell you when Crouch made his note—I did not see him—my note is, "Reply to Crouch, 'They are not straight,' referring to case of sardines, etc. "—I attach great importance to anything in the nature of an admission—I did not talk it over with Crouch before getting to the station—we took his statement for granted, for what it was worth—it was worth a good deal to the Prosecution—I did not make any observation upon it to Crouch—I will pledge my oath that we did not then talk it over—we have since talked it over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not consider it necessary to make any observa<lb/>tion, because it is a remark made by thieves; when it is said that a thing is not "straight," it is regarded as stolen property, and it was not neces<lb/>sary to discuss it further.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a number of J. Baer &amp; Sons, wholesale provision merchants—Thompson was one of my carmen and had been for about two years—Embery is not and never has been a customer of ours—after Thompson was charged with stealing the bacon, I went with Crouch and the other officers to Embery's shop—the bacon weighed about 56 lbs. and was worth 36s.—I identified it as ours—there is a factory mark on it, but no label—I did not hear the first conversation but the subsequent ones I did—the detective held up a box containing tins of</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This bacon was not at first weighed; it was on being returned to our place—I say it weighed about 56 lbs.—there was no brand on it, but a factory mark—there was nothing to show from what country it came, but anyone in the trade would know it was Danish—there is Lo bacon sold as low as 18s. for a side, however bad or poor in quality—Thompson does not go round offering goods for sale to customers, which have not been ordered—that is not our way of doing business—salesmen do go round with carmen offering goods for sale for certain dealers—a salesman never goes without a vanman, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 45, Cadogan Gardens, and am a member of the Guards' club—I was at that club on Tuesday, October 10th, between 5 and 6 p.m., in the smoking room, which is also used as a card room—no one else was then in the room—I rang the bell, and sat down at a writing table, and started writing a letter—the bell was answered, but I am unable to say by which waiter—I know Leonard Caffrey is a waiter at the club, and attends the smoking room and card room—I asked the waiter for Cox's cheque book, and he brought it—while writing the letter I took out two cheques, one of which I made out for £10—I asked the waiter to get it cashed in the club—he brought me the change as I was still writing the letter—I put the other cheque on the table—I finished my letter, and then filled up the cheque that was on the table for £30 in favour of Mr. J. H. Saunders, drawn to order—I put it inside a letter, and the letter in an envelope, addressed it, took it downstairs, and put it in a letter box, which is on a round table close to the door—I always make it a rule to initial the counterfoil, put in the date and the amount, and pay the waiter the 1d. for the stamp—I did so in this case, as far as I remember—downstairs I met three other members, and returned with them to the smoke room—I had been out of the room about ten or fifteen minutes—nobody was in the room when I got back—I ordered cards from the waiter, and played two rubbers of bridge—I left town the next day—I returned to London on Monday, the 16th—I looked for, but could find no acknowledgment of my cheque—I left London again on the 17th, and returned on Friday, the 20th—I arrived about 10 p.m., and left the next day about 2, I think—I made inquiries, and in consequence saw Mr. Evans about it—an attempt was made to find the counterfoils of my cheques—I could find the counterfoil of a cheque that I wrote afterwards, but not any counterfoil of those two cheques—after that I communicated with Mr. Evans as to the missing letter and the missing cheque—this is we cheque I drew.</p>

I live at 46, Boundaries Road, Balham, and am chief cashier at Cox's Bank—Sir Francis Corbett banks there, as well as the majority of the members of the Guards' Club—I cashed the cheque produced on October 11th—I find from my notes that I gave in exchange for it £20 in gold, two £5 notes, Nos. 61199 and 61200, dated April 19th, 1905—the cheque was in order and I took for granted that the signature was genuine—it is an order cheque—I knew the signature of the customer, but I did not know the signature of the endorser—as far as I can judge from the entries in my book, the time I cashed the cheque was from 11.30 to 12 o'clock—I do not recognise the person I paid—our bank supply cheque books to the Guards' Club for the use of the members generally—the book produced includes Nos. 582801 to 582850, which includes the cheque produced, 582847—a manservant generally comes for a new cheque book, which is entered as supplied to the club—we change several cheques for members during the day—a cheque book is delivered to the messenger without any written order, on payment of the amount for the stamps, so we do not have to charge for the cheque books in the account with the club, but we keep a record—this cheque book is dated September 30th.</p>

I am secretary to the Guards' Club, Pall Mall—Leonard Douglas Caffrey was a waiter in that club from March 26th, 1001—his attendance was required on what we call two long days, and the then on a short day, including Sundays—on the long days he would have to he in attendance from 8 a.m. till 1 a.m. the next morning—October 11th was his short day, when he would attend from 1 p.m. till 3.30 p.m., or inereabouts; then he would go off duty, come on again at 7 p.m. and remain till 9.15 or 9.30 p.m. to cover the dinner-hour—that would refer to October 10th and 11th; the 12th would be his long day again, when he would be in attendance for exactly the same hours as on the 10th—to duties would be to attend on the members in the card room, or the smoking room on October 10th and 12th—he would not share those duties with anybody; he would be the only card room waiter at that time—the card room head waiter, and the coffee room head waiter were supplied each with a cheque book from Cox's bank—we sent for these cheque books as they were required, and there would be at least two in use, and if one</p>

               <p>book was running near the end another book would be sent for, for the convenience of the members—the box produced is for the members letters, and is kept locked till the page boy, who has a key, collects the letters, puts them in a bag, and takes them to the post—after Sir Francis Corbett's letter was missed I tried to get out of the box an empty envelope and got it out within ten seconds by turning the box over—after that I asked for the counterfoils of the cheque books, when I was told they were never kept—up to that time the counterfoils remained with the waiters, and they did what they liked with them, but afterwards I looked through what counterfoils I could find—I also found this nearly finished book for the card room, which was issued on September 30th, 1905—I could not find any counterfoil of the cheque of Sir Francis Corbett, and I was told that the counterfoils of that particular cheque book had been destroyed—I searched through the counterfoils of other books, but could not find "Sir Fancis' counterfoil—the next day I spoke to Leonard Caffrey—as far as I remember, I asked him, "What did you do with the counterfoils!"—he said they had never been kept—I expressed my surprise that the counterfoils had not been kept, and gave instructions that they were to be kept in the future—as far as my memory goes, I told him what had happened on the previous day as to Sir Francis bringing this cheque to my notice, when I asked for the counterfoils of the cheque book, Nos. 582801 to 582850—the few cheques left in the book would be used up on that or the following day, probably the same day—the last date is "17-10-05 "—there must have been that cheque in the smoking room at the time, and also the other one which was issued on September 30th from the bank—Leonard Caffrey would attend to the smoking room, and would not attend to the coffee room—the post boy collected the letters about 5.40—he would start collecting about five minutes before that time—he does not warn the members of his going to collect—this is the other cheque No. 582848, drawn by Sir Francis Corbett for £10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Besides that cheque, No. 582848, two other cheque forms would remain out on October 10th, assuming Sir Francis is correct as to dates—inquiries were commenced on October 20th—the other cheque forms in the book would probably be used up on the 10th—when another cheque book was applied for, half a dozen cheques might remain in the book in use—Leonard Caffrey attended to the smoking room and library too—he would be entitled to have a cheque book—we have two waiters in the coffee room, Stott and Noakes, who each have a cheque book on Cox's bank, but although one is issued to each of the smoking room waiters, the waiters coming on alternate days, the one off duty would lock his cheque book up, so that practically there was only one in use—the head waiter on his short day comes on duty at luncheon time there are two head waiters; the one who is on duty has charge of the cheque book—on his "off" day the head waiter will come on duty at from about 1 p.m. till about 2.30, or thereabouts—I am not clear whether he comes on again in the dinner hour—not many members turn up in the dinner hour—as a rule, they mostly come in to luncheon—I found that the cheque book of the smoking room waiter was kept in an unlocked</p>

               <p>drawer, and that any servant of the club could obtain access to it in order to supply a member with a cheque—Leonard Caffrey would be supplied with a cheque book, provided he brought the 4s. 2d. for the stamps—Jarman may have acted as a smoking room waiter, in which case he would be supplied with a cheque book from our office—I have never kept a record of the cheque books supplied, but the bank does—Leonard Caffrey would have his meal hours, but he would have to answer his own belt—if he was absent most likely other waiters would wait till he was disengaged—Caffrey would very rarely have to answer the morning room bell—I discovered that more than one cheque book was in use in the smoking sad ia the morning room at that particular time, and that the cheques were kept in the morning room, in a drawer which was open to anyone who went there—when Sir Francis made a complaint to me on October 20th about the cheque, Leonard Caffrey was off duty—I at once made in<lb/>quiries—I asked Herman and Jarman for the counterfoils—they told me they had not been kept, and that it had not been the practice to keep them in the smoking room—Herman was on duty that morning, but both waiters were present in the morning room, when I gave instructions that the counterfoils should be kept—I have been secretary since May, 1905—I know it is the practice of members who use the smoking room to frequently leave the counterfoils of their cheques blank—looking at these counterfoils produced, only about a third are filled in, so that about two-thirds are quite useless—it is no part of the duty of the waiter to fill in the counterfoil, and I do not see how he would know what to fill in—is the coffee room he would know, but in the smoking room it is quite different—in the dining room if the member wants a little more money the charge for his luncheon is taken out. of it, or for his dinner, and in that case the member fills in the counterfoil himself—the day following, when I was told by Herman and Jarman that it was not the practice to keep these counterfoils, I saw Leonard Caffrey—the first information I got about destroying the counterfoils was from the two waiters, and I issued orders to keep them on the 20th, and on the 21st as well—Leonard Caffrey has been employed by the club about five years—during that time he has borne an excellent character—he had been in the habit of handling cheques most of the time at any rate—he may have been a page boy when he entered the service at eighteen years of age, and he is now twenty-three.</p>

Dear Len,—You will be surprised to hear that I have had a visit from a detective to-night. You remember I told you some time ago that I went to Finsbury Park Post Office to get some £5 notes for gold.

               <p>a fool for doing so, but I did, and you see what a mess I have caused by so doing. The detective told me the note was stolen, and, therefore, I am under suspicion for changing it. Do not tell anyone, as he told me to keep it secret. The fellow gave me a card with Scott, Wareham Road, on it, but nobody lives there of that name, so it must have been false. Trusting it will end satisfactorily, I remain, Your Affe. Bro., Alg. I am keeping my eyes open for the blackguard, so am quite an amateur de<lb/>tective. N.B.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective, City</hi>). On December 15th about 12.15, I went to the prisoner's shop at 67, Huggin Lane, City—I said to him, "Are you the proprietor?"—he said, "No; what is it you want?"—he is a waste paper dealer—I said, "I am a police officer; I want to see the proprietor "—he said, "He is out "—he saw me looking at a piece of anti-friction metal there, and said, "What is it you want to know: who brought that lead here?"—I said, "I may do later on "—he said, "A <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> brought it just round the corner; I will soon fetch him "—he left the shop—from what I was told I waited in the shop about four hours—the prisoner did not return—I and other officers took possession of a quantity of lead—about 60 lbs. weight has been identified, and this piece of anti-friction metal—about 8 o'clock the same evening I, with Inspector Lyon and Detective Annerton, saw the prisoner in the Bell public-house, Bush Lane—Annerton had stayed in the shop till 6 p.m., I stayed till 5—I called him outside the public-house, when Lyon said to him, "We are going to take you into custody; you will be charged with receiving a quantity of lead, well knowing it to have been stolen "—he said, "Wait a few minutes "—he was then taken to Cloak Lane police station, where he was shown thin piece of metal—Lyon said, "This piece of metal has been stolen from 49, Queen Victoria Street, and has been found in your possession; how do you account for its having been in your possession?"—he said, "I know nothing about it "—he was then shown a quantity of other lead, amongst which were these pieces produced—he produced this receipt, dated December 13th, from R. Gillver—the date below is "15-12-05 "—on the window of his shop in Huggin Lane is the name of "Francis &amp; Co., Wholesale Waste Paper and Metal Merchants," and</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About 30 lbs. of lead piping has not been identified—the address on this receipt is 6, Dowgate Hill, which is close to the public-house where the prisoner was arrested, and the next turning to it—I was looking at the anti-friction magnolia metal when the prisoner said, "What do you want to know?"—there was a small lot of lead there, but not this produced—I did not take any note of the conversation—there was another man in the shop at the time; there may have been two—I am positive when I told the prisoner I was a police officer that he said he was not the proprietor—the conversation did not take a minute; he was gone as soon as he had the chance—at the public-house he did not say the man from whom he got the receipt sold him the lead—when I asked him about the anti-friction metal he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

Murder!"—I went down to the prisoner and found the place all tittered up with smashed crockery—the prisoner and his wife were, quarrelling—Mrs. Green took up some crockery and I went towards her to bring her out—she had nothing in her hand then—the prisoner rushed towards the chest of drawers and got something from underneath it and made a blow towards his wife, but caught me on the wrist—I said, "George, you have cut me "—he said, "Yes, and I am cut too "—I told Blackall to take me to the hospital—they took me to Leman Street police station, from where they took me on a police ambulance to the hospital—the prisoner and his wife were not sober, but the prisoner was more sober than his wife—I remained in the hospital till the 27th and I have been an out—Patient since then—I have got to go back there to-day to be kept in—I cannot use my wrist yet.</p>

Getting &amp; Sons," of 4, Corbet Court—the prisoner has been in our employment as bookkeeper for three years and eight months—we kept our cash book in the safe of which he had one key and I the other—it was his duty to fill up the cheques on the pay days and bring them to myself or my partner to sign, together with the statements for those cheques; he would bring the cheques in the book, not taken out—he entered the counterfoil as well—I see in my pass book on August 4th there is a debit against my firm for £44 12s. drawn by a cheque, No. 3715—we never drew that cheque nor authorised it to be drawn—I have searched for that cheque and it is missing from the re<lb/>turned cheques from the bank—it would be the prisoner's duty to check the bank pass book brought from the bank by one of the other clerks with the cash book, which he kept entirely, and in which there should be all payments made by the firm, including cheques drawn for the purpose of keeping the petty cash in funds—it was the practice to enter in it the number of the cheques with the amount similarly as it appears in the pass book—there was no payment to be made to him of £15 on August 3rd—the counterfoil to cheque 3715 which is filled up in his handwriting, is dated August 3rd, 1905, "Burne, Turner &amp; Co., £1 13s. "—this is the cheque book with the cheques pasted in again (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—there is a cheque of August 3rd pasted in to counterfoil, 3713; cheque 3714 is here, and 3716, but 3715 cheque is missing, but a cheque of August 3rd would come about where that gap is—there was no such amount as £1 13s. due to Burne, Turner &amp; Co. on that date; it was paid on July 22nd, and I produce a receipt and letter from that firm saying they had received it; the cheque is No. 3676, dated July 21st, and in the prisoner's handwriting—in the cash book I see the payment of that amount to that firm by two different cheques, one No. 3676 on July 22nd, and one, No. 3715, on August 3rd—there was only one amount due—I see on August 10th a payment of £44 17s. 1d. to G. P. Kent &amp; Son, Ltd., by cheque No. 3719—the counterfoil to the cheque says, "G. P. Kent &amp; Sons, 5s. 1d. "—the pass book shows that 5s. 1d. was debited in regard to that cheque, 3719, on August 14th—deducting 5s. 1d. from £44 17s. 1d. leaves £44 12s., the amount of the cheque which is the subject of this charge—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080038"/>
               <p>in the pass book I find on September 23rd a cheque for £46 12s. 6d., No. 3816, debited—that is a missing cheque—I did not draw it nor authotise the drawing of it—on referring to the counterfoil of that cheque, which is in the prisoner's handwriting, I see it is entered up as "Edward Jones, £1 8s. "—there was an amount due to Edward Jones on that day, but it was paid by cheque No. 3802, dated September 22nd, which has since been returned by the bank with the paid cheques—the entry in the cash book with regard to cheque No. 3816 is "Discount, per bills receivable, £4 8s. 6d. "—there was such an amount due on that date, but there was no cheque drawn for it, so that the entry in the cash book that that was paid by that cheque is untrue—in the pass book on October 21st I see debited a cheque No. 3867 for £42 10s. 2d. which I did not draw nor authority to be drawn—the counterfoil is entered as £1 3s. 4d. to the Gas Light &amp; Coke Company—there was no such amount due to that firm on that date—I see in the cash book cheque 3867 is described as a payment to George Dunlop &amp; Co. of £2 2s. 6d.—I find that payment was actually made to that firm by cheque 3866—I find an entry on October 20th of a payment to Henry Heath, Ltd., of £42 10s. 6d.—there was no such payment made and no such amount due to that firm—again in the pass book I see a cheque No. 3868 for £42 12s. 6d. debited on October 28th, which I did not draw or authorise to be drawn—the counterfoil is "George Cockerell &amp; Co., Account of Charges, £2 12s. "—such an amount was due to that firm plus an earlier amount, making £6 10s., which was paid by cheque on November 17th—the entry in the cash book with regard to cheque No. 3868 is "October 24th, Westcott Lawrence, Ltd., No. 3868, 15s. 3d." which sum I find was paid by cheque 3870 on October 25th—under date October 27th in the cash book there is an entry of a payment to "F. and H. Ayres," of £42 12s. 6d. by cheque 3882—there was no such amount owing to that firm, and it was not paid by that cheque—on November 14th I made a comparison of some of the counterfoils with the pass book, which I had not been doing previously, and on notice ing several discrepancies, I pointed them out to the prisoner and asked him to explain—some of them I have alluded to in my evidence, but there were others—he tried to bluff it out, saying that I must find it out—he said he could give no explanation and went home—the next day he came and gave me this letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Dear Sirs,—I have come just to show myself and to inform you that I mean to stay here in London and face out everything. I am too unwell both in mind and body (I did not sleep all night) to do anything, and therefore I request you to let me go home again, where I shall stay for a day or two, talking a rest, unless of course you intend to take steps and measures against me, in which case kindly say so now. On the other hand, I beg you to be merciful, not for my sake, but for the sake of my poor, poor wife. I am the culprit. Will you allow me to say, and please take it seriously, that whatever may be the result, I do intend to pay every penny back if I get the chance In the meantime, after a day or two I am ready to give you every assis<lb/>tance in my power. Kindly let me know at once if I may go home, as my head is swimming, and I am quite unable and quite unfit to do any</p>

               <p>work or answer any question. Yours very obediently, C. E. Besson "—I asked him what he had done with the missing cheques and he said he had destroyed them—to the best of my belief this indorsement on this £5 note, 17301, which reads, part of it having been cut away, "Besson, 79, Burgoyne Road, Harringay, North." is in his handwriting, and that is the address he has been living at.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We draw cheques for nearly everything except very trifling matters, occasionally for under £1—our business is largely con<lb/>nected with Buenos Ayres—the prisoner speaks four or five languages—I am not a linguist, but my brother speaks Spanish—the prisoner did only part of the foreign correspondence—our business consists partly of people coming over from Buenos Ayres and other places to make their purchases in England or Europe—occasionally the prisoner would go round with those who did not speak English, to warehouses and other place—I kept the petty cash myself—practically the whole of the cashbook and the ledger is in the prisoner's writing—my signature differs considerably from my brother's—we have banked at the London &amp; County Bank since well before 1902—the prisoner certainly did not so to the bank once a week to cash cheques over the counter; he might have occasion to go, but very seldom—the dates of the missing cheques all correspond with the place they ought to come in the cheque book—cheque 3714 is not in the cheque book,; I cannot swear who signed it; I believe I did—since we found this out we have been sticking in returned cheques, but we used to keep them in a box—there might be some missing, but not many—the prisoner might present nine or ten cheques at a time for signature, and occasionally twenty—he would produce a statement of what the cheques were for—I used to go through the accounts with him, for which the cheques had to be made out, and he used to submit this statement to me, which I checked myself—the body of cheque 3716 it filled up in the prisoner's handwriting and is made payable to the Royal Mail Steam Packet Co., for £1 10s.; it is not signed by anybody, it is a cancelled cheque—if possible, we keep even the cancelled cheques to show what has become of them—the counterfoil is filled in by the prisoner—3815 is a genuine cheque filled in by him, as is the counterfoil—it is signed by my brother—3817, dated September 28th, is signed by myself and filled up by the prisoner, as is the counterfoil—the same thing applies to 3868—I say I never signed cheque 3715, because all our cheques being crossed, I know I never opened a cheque for that amount and this cheque was and also that I never sign a cheque without looking at the counterfoil, and that cheque which was cashed for that amount does not agree with the counterfoil—the same answer applies to the forged cheques 3816, 3867 and 3868—I am quite sure J have never signed a blank cheque for any purpose whatsoever—I do not recollect having a blank cheque for £10 signed by my firm in my pocket, nor speaking to the prisoner about it, saying that I could not make my petty cash balance—I do not recollect having a blank cheque having reference to a £10 transaction signed by my firm in my pocket—I have a motor cycle—I do not remember having a blank cheque in my pocket with reference to that and speaking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080040"/>
               <p>to the prisoner about it—to the best of my belief I never have had a blank cheque in my pocket signed by myself or my brother—I am not prosecuting in this case—we have made a claim on the bank for the amount of the cheques in question, on the ground that the four cheques and others were forgeries—the prisoner was paid monthly—I saw him once or twice after he gave me the letter of November 14th—in a manner I went to Birch's with him after this; he told me he felt faint and I paid for some refreshment for him, as he had no money—I did not have any—he had already drawn his salary for November—he has had several loans during the time he was with me—at Christmas time I had given him I bonus—on one occasion, when £28 or £30 was standing against him, I deducted a portion as being paid in place of a bonus—I know he was given in custody by a representative of the Bankers' Association, who are the prosecutors in this case, but not at our instigation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We had laid the facts that had come to our knowledge before the bank—there is nothing in the counterfoils to indicate that there was anything wrong with the cheques; they are all in order of date—cheques 3867 and 3868, according to the counterfoil, an dated October 21st; 3869 is October 25th—in each case where a cheque has been forged it has been the last of a series on that day—the box, in which we used to keep paid cheques formerly, was kept in the book-keeper's room, and the prisoner would have access to it—on November 15th he was waiting for my brother to come—he seemed in a very agitated state and said he felt faint—I had to go out, and he came with me and I gave him some refreshment at Birch's.</p>

Goerz, Holborn Circus—Wilson was sent for it—he came back without it—I had not at that time ordered another camera and photographic lens—I have been shown one by the police since.</p>

Dear Sir,—I am writing to give notice of the fact that I am starting in my auxiliary steam yacht, <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> about the middle of November for the Tristan d'Acunha islands.

Sir,—I am directed by Mr. Secretary Lyttelton to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, announcing the intended departure of your auxiliary steam yacht <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> for the Tristan d'Acunha islands about the middle of November. I am to state that the Post Office will be informed accordingly, and an advertisement inserted in the press in order to enable persons interested in the island to take advantage of the opportunity of transmitting, any presents which they may desire to send to the inhabitants. Before taking any steps in this direction, however, Mr. Lytcelton would be glad to know the full address to which parcels and mails designed for shipment in the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> should be sent and the dates within which it would be convenient for you to receive them. I am, etc., F.

In answer to your letter of the 24th inst., it would be convenient to me to receive all parcels and mails between the dates October 3rd and November 10th sent to the following address: J. Russey Freke, Esq., Auxiliary Yacht <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>, lying at Greenhithe, Kent. Might I be allowed to suggest that a short paragraph be inserted in three or four of the leading papers besides the advertisement announcing the fact of the departure of a ship for the Tristan d'Acunha Island; in order to attract the attention of people who do not look through the advertisements and who would be glad of the opportunity of sending out useful presents to the islanders? Believe me, Sir, Yours faithfully, T. C. Kerry "—then there was a letter of October 7th from the Royal Colonial Institute (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Royal Colonial Institute, Northumberland Avenue, London, W.C., October 7th. Dear Sir,—I acknowledge the receipt of your letter of October 3rd, and I shall have much pleasure in handing the enclosed memorandum to the inhabitants of the island on my arrival. I hope you received the letter I wrote you on September 16th, as I have seen no advertisement in the papers. I am afraid there will be barely time now for the African mail to be sent to England. Believe me, Yours truly, T. C. Kerry "—the memorandum mentioned there is with regard to a schoolmaster—we had had a communication from one of the officials at the Cape, that the islanders at Tristan would be willing to re<lb/>ceive a schoolmaster and we took advantage of Mr. Kerry going out to the island to send a communication to the head man—Exhibit 7 is an advertise<lb/>ment which was sent to the "Times" and appeared on October 18th, 1904, setting out that Mr. Kerry was proceeding to Tristan d'Acunha (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Tristan d'Acunha. We have received the following from the Colonial Office:—"Mr. T. C. Kerry, auxiliary steam yacht <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>, sailing from Greenhithe, Kent, in November, will call at the island of Tristan d'Acunha and convey mails and small parcels for the inhabitants of the island. Letters and parcels should be posted so as to reach the General Post Office, London, early on November 9th. No charge is made for sea carriage of letters</p>

               <p>and parcels sent by the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> and only the inland postage to Greenhithe need be paid. Parcels sent by post must conform to the island regulations as regards size and weight. Parcels sent otherwise than by post must be fully prepaid to Greenhithe. Such packages must not exceed 100 lbs. in weight and should be of such size and shape as to admit of their being landed easily in a small boat. They should be addressed to "J. Hussey Freke, Esq., Auxiliary Yacht <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>, lying at Greenhithe, Kent," and should be accompanied by instructions for their disposal. It is believed that the gifts which will be most acceptable to the inhabitants are tea, flour, clothing, and sea-fishing tackle "—the next communication that the Colonial Office had from Mr. Kerry was his letter of July 31st, 1905. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Royal Colonial Institute, Northumberland Avenue, London. W.C, July 31st. Sir,—I have the honour to report that I left England in my exploring vessel <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> for the island of Tristan d'Acunha on Decem<lb/>ber 18th, 1904, and arrived off that island on the morning of February 19th, 1905. The weather being fine and the sea calm, I was able to lay a quarter of a mile off the shore in comfort. Immediately on our arrival some of the islanders put off in their boats and came on board. I then proceeded to land the mails, presents and provisions, which were very numerous and most acceptable to the islanders, who seemed to be badly in need. I also landed the Admiralty presents, namely, a black ball, telescope and code flags. I then proceeded ashore in the whale boat and, having gathered together all the men and women of the island, explained clearly to them that I was commissioned by Mr. Secretary Lyttelton to ascertain from them how much they would be willing to raise among them<lb/>selves every year for the salary for a schoolmaster for the island. Also if they would be willing in addition to the salary to build a house for the schoolmaster and to provide a milk cow for his use. I also pointed out that His Majesty's Government might make some addition to the amount so raised, but if the islanders wished to have a schoolmaster on the island they must pay as much as they can afford toward his salary. Having carefully discussed and considered the matter, they requested me to give the following answer to Mr. Secretary Lyttelton: That they regretted they were unable to pay anything towards the salary for a schoolmaster for the island, as they had no money and no means of procuring any, but they would willingly provide a house and such products as were obtain<lb/>able on the island. I found the islanders intelligent and hospitable, and the children were clean and well clad, and seemed to be well looked after The men are handy, but not of striking physique. The women, on the other hand, are well developed and tall, and seem to be rather more in<lb/>telligent than the men; the health throughout was excellent. The popu<lb/>lation numbers seventy-seven, no births or deaths having taken place since the visit of the last man-of-war. No headman is recognised on the island and I discovered that petty quarrels are of frequent occurrence, but the islanders are particularly careful to prevent strangers from finding this out. The island is very fertile and well watered, and there are large quantities of good cattle and sheep scattered about. Having had it brought to my notice that rats exist in large quantities, during the</p>

               <p>three days I was on the island I took particular notice, but failed to see a single rat or traces of any. During our stay at the island we discovered splendid anchorage in several places. We were unfortunate in losing one of the ship's party during our stay at the island. A youth named Reginald Macan went out shooting on the island with another member belonging to the expedition and crossed a dangerous gully against which he had been especially warned by the islanders. His friend, who had also been warned, refused to go across with him and sat down to await his return. Having waited for some time and receiving no answer to his shouts, he returned to the settlement to give the alarm. A search party was immediately organised, but owing to darkness coming on were only able to make a short search. Another search party, composed of the whole male population of the island, started out at daybreak. They returned at noon with the news that they had traced the missing youth back to the gully where all further traces disappeared and they were unanimous in their opinion that he kid been killed either by a fall from the cliff or by drowning. The next day another search party went out from the ship, accompanied by the islanders as guides, and on arrival at the gully discovered the body. It had been washed up on the beach and was in a terrible condition, the neck, back, both legs and one arm being broken. As the body was in no way swollen it is surmised death was caused either by a fall from the cliffs or by the body being dashed by the sea against the rocks. The body was conveyed down to the settlement in an ox waggon. We gave him the best funeral possible under the circumstances. My carpenter made a coffin out of the mail boxes, being the only timber obtainable, and the body was buried in the island cemetery, and a wooden cross was erected over the grave. The scene was most impressive. All the islanders attended, some bringing flowers, and all seemed much upset that such a catastrophe should have occurred on the island. Their conduct in the matter was most praiseworthy and they took endless trouble in trying to find the body. The next day I sailed to Inaccessible and Nightingale Islands. Of these islands we met with a serious accident to our rudder, which made it quite impossible for the ship to stay any longer, as the lives of the crew would have been endangered, and the ship, being out of control, might at any moment have gone ashore. The rudder head was badly twisted, which made it quite impossible to steer the ship. Under the circum<lb/>stances I was unable to carry out the whole of my work as I should like to have done. We then sailed from Nightingale Island to Tristan d'Acunha, where I lay oft from 4 o'clock in the morning to 5 o'clock in the evening in order to give the islanders plenty of time to send their mails and presents to their friends and relations in Cape Colony. We then sailed for Cape Town, and, having repaired the rudder, sailed for England. Unfortunately, having met with contrary winds and having ran out of coal, our passage home was considerably lengthened, and we arrived in England July 27th. I have, Sir, the honour to remain, Your obedient servant, T. C. Kerry. The Colonial Secretary, Colonial Office, London "—we had a letter from Mr. Repello, who it one of the principal inhabitants of the island, and in consequence of that, a letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080052"/>
               <p>dated August 5th, 1905, was sent to Mr. Kerry (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Downing Street, August 6th, 1905. Sir,—I am directed by Mr. Secretary Lyttelton to acknowledge the receipt of, and to thank you for, your letter of the 31st of July reporting on your recent visit to Tristan d'Acunha. 2. I am to transmit to you a copy of a letter from Mr. A. Repello on behalf of the inhabitants of that island representing that their stock of signaling flags is deficient. Mr. Lyttelton presumes that this deficiency was made good by the flags which were landed by you, but he would be glad to receive your observations on this point "—Repello's letter was very illiterate—on August 30th Mr. Kerry called to see me with his private secretary, Mr. Burl ton—at that time I had received some communication from Mr. Stone and Mr. Balfour and I had caused statements to be taken from a number of the members of the crew, and I was then considering with others what steps would be taken, if any, in the matter—that was before Mr. Kerry had called—when he called on that day I saw him—Mr. Grindle, who is in the South African-Department, and deals with Tristan, And Mr. Risley were present—Mr. Kerry first alluded to the Admirally flags and said he did not understand how it was all were not there, as he had delivered all that had been given to him—I was at that time not very familiar with the question of Admiralty flags, and I said it was not a matter I knew much about, but we should probably have to ask the Admiralty about it, because the flags had been sent by them—he then went on to complain of the size of the parcels and said they were very large and cumbersome, and he had to break bulk to store them—I asked him if he had not a hold on the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>, and he said he had no bold, as the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> was a yacht, and some of the things he had been obliged to stow down below and some in the chain locker, and then went on to complain of the amount of things that were sent, and said we had no suspicion what rubbish people had sent, as there were old clothes and old books and newspapers and perfectly worthless and useless article; that he had had to sort them out and throw some of them overboard; that they were old newspapers, full of bugs and fleas, and that he had had to make a selection—I told him that it was not for him to decide what he would deliver and what he would not—he repeated his argument and I told him the same thing again—I did not tell him that he was to carry them all, bugs and fleas, and everything else—the licence says that if he is in doubt about what he is to carry and not to carry, he can refer it to the Secretary of State about the size—he seemed to me to be assuming that he had a discretion as to what he should deliver to the island and what he should not—he said he had delivered the food and all the ordinary things—before he went out of the room he repeated his statement that the only things that he had thrown overboard were those which were absolutely useless, and I said that I clearly understood that that was what he meant—he left the room, and in a moment or two came back and said he hoped that he had made it clear that all he had thrown overboard was absolutely worthless, and then said that somebody had delivered to him a box to deliver to Pitcairn, and I said as Pitcairn was the other side of the world he could not deliver a box there when he was</p>

               <p>delivering things to Tristan, and that there would be ho trouble about that—after that interview I got a letter dated the same day (<hi rend="italic">Reaa</hi>): "Royal Colonial Institute, Northumberland Avenue, London, W.C., August 30th. Sir,—In answer to your letter of the 5th of August I beg to confirm the statement made to-day at the Colonial Office (which, owing to my absence from town, I have not been able to give before) that the inhabitants have received the flags which you sent out, and these, I presume, have made good the deficiency. With regard to the further conversation I had to-day, I would venture to advise that in future all consignments should be made up in small parcels or boxes under the supervision of some official from your office, as some things sent in the way of papers and journals were in such a dirty condition that I was forced on unitary grounds, firstly, to place them in the chain locker amongst the cable, and some weeks afterwards at much inconvenience and trouble to sort out those which were eaten up by insects and absolutely dirty, the remainder (fairly clean) being duly delivered by me to the islanders. Yours obediently, T. C. Kerry "—during that interview Mr. Grindle made notes of what passed, and he afterwards copied them out—I had no knowledge of what was sent out—I do not know if half a dozen cheap razors would be useful to the islanders; I cannot say if they shave—before these means of communication by means of the licensee with the island communication was kept up by a chance passing ship and by the admiral at Cape Town, when he could spare one, dispatching one of His Majesty's ships, but he, of course, had not always one to spare, or thought he had not—if you were to draw a straight line on the map between Monte Video and Cape Town, about half-way or a little nearer Cape Colony and almost due south of 8t. Helena, you, would find Tristan d'Acunha—it is not in a position where many passing ships would touch, and we are not able to communicate with it as much as we should wish—I do not think the inhabitants are descendants of the guard at St. Helena at the time of Napoleon the First—the island was annexed in 1816, and from 1812 to 1816 cruisers seem to have used it to snatch up vessels coming from the Cape and in 1816 the British Government thought it best to annex the island, and they sent out a man-of-war, and some of the seamen remained—I think some of the people on it now are descendants of some shipwrecked sailors—I think the women came from the Cape, bat I am not certain about it—they are all British now, but some fire of Swedish descent and a mixed people—all the communications I have seen are not in very good English.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not been to the islands—I should think the population is between 100 or 120 from the latest report that I have seen—I do not know who the head man of the island is—I think the last two or three times we have heard from the island we have heard from Repello—I have seen his writing and know it—when Mr. Kerry came and com<lb/>plained about what he called rubbish he seemed to be aggrieved, but he was quite polite about it—he did not strike me as being emphatic; he seemed to think there was cause to complain—I regarded it as a com<lb/>plaint by him that he had had things sent to him which ought not to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080054"/>
               <p>have been sent, and he rejected them, although I did not agree with the method of rejection—I said at the Police Court that assuming that part of the consignment were verminous or in such a condition as to injure the health of the crew, he was right to throw that overboard, and that seems to be reasonable—as far as I know, he did not ask for any payment in respect to any parcels submitted to him—I do not think it occurred to the office as to the number of books which would be sent out—in these licences we have always made it a condition that the island must be communicated with, our main object being to get the islanders things which they cannot get themselves—in the licence it says that the parcels must be small, but I do not think I ever reflected on the question as to their quantity or quality—Mr. Kerry knew before he started what he had got, and if he had communicated with us we should have done what we could to help him, either by communicating with the people who were sending, or hearing what he had got to say—if the parcels which were delivered were too large to go down the hatchway I should say, "Stow them on the deck "—the main object was to get them to the islanders—at my interview with Mr. Kerry he did not tell me of a bag with some things which he had not delivered at Tristan—I should say the interview lasted fifteen or twenty minutes—that day I do not think I saw anybody else, but I do see a great many people—I do not remember his saying that a few things had not been landed, but I remember him mentioning the box for Pitcairn, because it struck me as foolish for anyone to send a hot for Pitcairn to a person going to Tristan—he said that in future an official from the Colonial Office should arrange and sort the parcels delivered—he said, "It has given me so much trouble that next time I go to Tristan the Colonial Office or the post office must sort them out "—I do not know if we had appointed an official whether he would have made a list of things delivered—I do not think we should have felt ourselves called spot to label every parcel going out—I did not tell Mr. Kerry that I had inter<lb/>views with the sailors or anybody else—I did not question him at all; I listened to what he had to say, and if he had said anything to me pre<lb/>judicial to his case I should have cautioned him, but he did not do any thing of the kind—I heard from his own lips that he had thrown things overboard, whether he did it rightly or wrongly—he did not explain to me that his secretary, Mr. Burlton, had written a number of general letters, thanking people who had contributed the various parcels, and Mr. Burlton was there at the time—I have not personally compared a letter written to the Duchess of Bedford with letters written he Mr. Kerry—all the letters I have seen purport to be signed by "T. C. Kerry, and not "Per pro" or anything of that sort—these letters were received by the Colonial Office and purport to come from Repello—this death certificate purports to be signed by Repello, and I should think the two signature are in the same writing, but I do not pose as an expert in handwriting—this other letter appears to be written by the same person, but it is not so well written, and the signature in this other letter seems to be the same writing.</p>

               <p>the packages were not to exceed 100 lbs.—when Mr. Kerry came to the Colonial Office I had seen Mr. Stone before and had an interview as well as with some of the crew—I had a communication from Mr. Balfour, and in consequence of those conditions I asked Mr. Kerry no question, but he had a full opportunity of making any statement he pleased—he made no statement as to any property still in his possession or as regards Mr. Morrish's tools or with regard to the Duchess of Bedford's books.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a first-class clerk at the Colonial Office, and I was present by Mr. Cox's desire on April 30th at the interview which took place between Mr. Kerry and Mr. Cox—I made notes of what was said by Mr. Kerry and afterwards from them made a memoran<lb/>dum of the interview—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the original—Mr. Kerry dealt with the question of the flags, about which we had written to him, and he offered an explanation which was not quite intelligible, but Mr. Cox did not pursue the matter; then Mr. Kerry said he wished to ask if another time the packages for the island might be sent by post to the yacht, as they were often of an inconvenient size and the contents were abso<lb/>lutely worthless—he said he had to break open the packages to pack them away, as the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> was a yacht and the packages would not go through the doors; he thought it would be better if the packages were received by an official of the Colonial Office and the goods put in smaller packages—he said we could have no idea of the rubbish which was sent, old newspapers, and that they were not worth the wood they were packed in—he laid he had thrown over some packages of old journals full of bugs and fleas; that he had sorted out the box and threw the filthy ones overboard and kept and delivered the ones which were of any use—he complained that the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> was then full of bugs forward, and some articles had to be stowed among the chains—Mr. Cox said it was not for Mr. Kerry to judge what was of use and what not, and Mr. Kerry again insisted upon the rubbishy nature of several of the goods—he mentioned that the islanders did not want newspapers, as many of them could not read—he said distinctly that there were some good presents of tea, coffee and cocoa and one or two useful things, and these were all delivered—I do not see why he should not have then said anything he liked, but he said nothing whatever as to having property still in his possession—he made a statement with regard to some books, but he did not mention the Duchess of Bedford's—he did not mention Mr. Morrish's tools—he went out of the room and returned to say he hoped he had not been misunderstood, and that what was thrown overboard was absolutely useless.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi>, I do not remember exactly what Mr. Kerry said when he came back into the room, but it was about a box addressed to Pitcairn; something which he still had in his possession and was un<lb/>delivered—I</p>

               <p>do not know if he said he had not delivered the box to Pitcairn, because it was obvious that he had not—I think his object in coming back again wan to make sure about the nature of the things he had thrown overboard—I think he asked Mr. Cox what he should do with the box—he did not add in addition that he still had on board some things undelivered, which were in a bag—I am not a shorthand<lb/>writer, but I suggest that I got down all the points of the interview; it is not a verbatim report—there is nothing about the Pitcairn box in my note; I did not consider it was a point—there was nothing else of importance which I did not put down—the box for Pitcairn had nothing to do with the delivery of things at Tristan.</p>

I was assistant chaplain to the Mission to Seamen Institute, East India Dock Road, up to the end of last year—I produce the certificate of the registration of the steam yacht <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> as a British ship—about the middle of October, 1904, I heard of the contemplated voyage of the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> to Tristan d'Acunha—towards the third week in October I went to the ship, which was then lying at Greenhithe—I saw the defendant and Mr. Hussey Freke on board—I went to the deferdant's saloon—I told him I was chaplain to the Mission to Seamen Institute and asked him to take out to Tristan a service box of devotional books for the use of the inhabitants—he agreed, saying that the last time he was there' there were only two tattered bibles on the island; he did not say when he was last there—he said the islanders had great need of flour and asked me if I could get some, as the rats had destroyed all the crops, and said the islanders suffered from a very great lack of flour and kindred things—I offered to send out as much clothing as I could get, food to a certain extent, and books apart from religious books—the defendant agreed and was particularly anxious I should get flour for the inhabitants and showed me a letter from the Colonial Office to the islanders about a schoolmaster for them, which I read—he suggested I should write to big manufacturers for the food and stuff, and flour was particularly men<lb/>tioned, and either then or later tea and cocoa were mentioned—I think I may have said I would write to a few; at any rate, I did so—I told him I would bring the things on board by our mission yacht or otherwise, and he asked me to deliver them within the next few days, and they should be packed <hi rend="italic">smallish</hi>, so that they could be handled by a man—he said large things would not go down the hold, and it was dangerous to put large boxes in the islanders' boats, and that on one occasion some<lb/>body was drowned from doing so—the packages were to be about the size of a Tate's sugar box—I communicated with about six food and clothing manufacturers in England and got replies, but no goods—I then com<lb/>municated with some subscribers to our institute and sent out a circular letter to about eighty or ninety people—I specified the kind of things which would be useful—on the boat I asked Mr. Kerry if there was any</p>

               <p>limit to what he wanted and he said, "No "—I repeated the question and he said, "No," and he would take as much as I could send—a number parcels of different things were sent to me in my name at the institute, where we unpacked almost everything and repacked them—there were a number of books of miscellaneous literature and a number of devotional books, a quantity of clothing, male and female, almost all secondhand in good condition, some of it as good as new—there were two cork jackets, a number of fish hooks, a quantity of religious books from the Religious Tract Society, which were packed in a case which I did not unpack; it was rather large and I sent it down as it was—I got a similar case from the S.P.C.K., which I did not open—both those cases were ad<lb/>dressed to me and I believed each had, "For the Island of Tristan d'Acunha" on it—I am sure one had; I am not sure of the other—there were some rat traps, a roll of flannel and this service box provided by the institute itself (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I put into it sixty new prayer and hymn books and some bibles and other books, making about ninety books altogether—the prayer books were very small, like this one (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—the box had a strap round it—I saw no notice on the inside of the lid—the whole box was worth about 25s. or 30s.—on the outside there was "Service Box" stencilled on, which means books for divine service—in repacking the goods I made thirty-nine packages, including the provisions—there were 25 lbs. of tea in five canisters, three 14-lb. tins of Fry's British Workman's Cocoa with Fry's label on the outside, exactly similar to this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I got them at our own stall—they were pat in a large box without a top—I think I gave 17s. or 18s. for the three—I got them at wholesale price—there were three bottles of brandy, for which I paid 3s. 6d. each, which were put on board at Mr. Kerry's request—I superintended the transmission of the thirty-nine packages—Froud and Puxley took them from the institute to the dock—twenty-one contained books, ten boxes and one large barrel of clothes, sad the rest were life belts, fish hooks and provisions—I numbered them consecutively and made a list of them, which I put into an envelope ad<lb/>dressed, "T. C. Kerry, Esq., Steam Yacht <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>," and gave it to Mr. Hussey Freke on board the ship—within a short time of doing so I saw Kerry and told him I had just left a letter for him with Mr. Hussey Freke containing a statement of what I had put on board—I forget what he said then—I was constantly on board—on one occasion he mentioned the thirty-nine cases and said he had a great number of things coming down and that he was stowing them forward—he said, rather chaffing, "I hope we shall not get any more books, as there are a lot on board," and I thought there were quite enough—at one interview he said that on the voyage he would open them and re-sort them so that each islander would have a fair share—I paid him 25s. for a sack of flour which he was to get and give to the islanders, which he agreed to do—I went to the vessel for the last time about the first week in December; I saw Kerry—that was the occasion I left the letter—the next I heard of the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> was about the middle of August last—the information I received did not come from Kerry; I gathered it—I then went to the Sailors' Home, Wells</p>

               <p>Street, London Docks, and saw Newman only—I then went to the Colonial Office on a Saturday and saw Mr. Grindle—on the following Monday I saw Mr. Cox—I should think that was about August 10th—up to that time I had received no communication from Kerry that he had returned—after my visit to the Colonial Office I saw some members of the crew and had conversations with them—on a Tuesday, at 7.45 p.m., I saw the defendant at our institute—if that was on August 29th it was the 19th that I went to the Colonial Office, as it was ten days before I saw Mr. Kerry—he came with Mr. Burlton, whom I had seen on the ship before—Mr. Kerry did not come at my invitation—he said his lawyers had informed him that I was stating that the flour I had paid him 25s. for had not been delivered at Tristan, and asked me if I had stated it—I said I had not—he said his lawyers had advised him to get anyone arrested who was guilty of such criminal libel—he said he was a man of means; that he had spent £27,000 in bringing Lloyds to their knees, and then got very excited about the <hi rend="italic">Ariadne</hi> case, which he mentioned—I said it was very desirable that all people who were guilty of libel should be put in prison—he asked me what statements I had heard and I said I could not repeat them—he asked me what statement I had made and I referred him to his lawyers—I said, "You had better go to your lawyers. They have put you on the wrong track once; perhaps they will do it again "—he criticised the crew as being the worst he had ever had, that they were a lot of thieves and liars, that he would not trust the packages which I had given him near them, because he knew what would happen if he had, and that all the packages had been dealt with by himself, Mr. Hussey Freke and Mr. Burlton—he said that Newman was an incom<lb/>petent seaman, that Hamblin, the cabin boy, was a little liar, and that Whatever character he had on the <hi rend="italic">Warspite</hi>, he was a thoroughly bad boy—he said he had given Lyon a good discharge, which he ought not to have done, but he did not wish to spoil his sea career, although he was a bad man—I thought he was trying to bluff me and was bullying me, but he changed his manner and said, "I have been very frank with you; won't you be frank with me and ask me any question you wish?"—I said I had no question—he asked was I satisfied that the flour had been landed and I said I was—he told me on his word of honour that everything put on board with the exception of one case had been delivered to the islanders and he emphasised the "everything "—he said the one case was not left by mistake—he turned to Burlton, who said, "Yes, everything was landed "—Mr. Kerry then asked me if I felt satisfied, and I said I did not think my feelings concerned him—he asked me if I remembered putting tea and cocoa on board—I said, "Yes "—he did not actually say it had gone ashore, but he mentioned it among the other things—he said he sold a lot of ship's stores, his own property, at St. Helena—he said that in further somebody else would have to take the islanders' presents out and that he would have nothing more to do with it—he asked me several times if I was satisfied, but I fenced the question in various ways and would not state anything—he said, "I suppose the crew have come to you for money "—I simply raised my eyebrows and said nothing—</p>

               <p>before the vessel left I was taken over her on my first visit—on my last visit I simply went outside the chart house—I did not notice that it was very full of parcels—I noticed nothing—these books, "Stanley in Africa," a volume of the "Boys' Own Paper," "Pitcairn Island," and the "Popular Educator," were all contained in the thirty-nine parcels; two of them have my name in them and two of them belonged to my father—these two volumes, "Excursions in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway," have the label of the institute on them—I packed them in the thirty-nine cases—sixty of the prayer books in the service box were like this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—I can see the remainder of the words, "Service Box," on this box (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—that is the one I sent out—I have here a black linen apron, a cloth jacket, a golf cape, and four woollen mufflers (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—these mufflers are exactly similar to those which are sent to the institute for the use of seamen, and I put a lot on board—this jacket is of the same type as many of the clothes—I seem to recognise the apron more than I do this jacket—we never deal with these aprons; they were sent to us for the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>—I believe this apron is the one I put on board and also these mufflers—this golf cape is very similar to a lot I put on board.</p>

If any derive any blessing and are able to help other crews to similar service boxes, which may cost from 20s. to 30s. each according to the number of books, any such aid for our less-favoured comrades would be gratefully received by Commander W.

               <p>I should have had no objection provided they were delivered—the cocoa which I bought was 17s. cost price—I did not know that Mr. Kerry had about £600 worth of stores on board at the time I delivered the cocoa, including a very large quantity of cocoa—the amount of provisions which I supplied would be under £5 in value—I am afraid I cannot give you any estimate of the value of the clothing—I do not know if £5 would be an outside price—I do not know how much the mufflers would be; I have never bought them—I knew that other people were sending books besides myself—I thought the consignment was not large for a place where a ship only goes once a year—there were a number of books on astronomy and book-keeping—I put them in on account of the school-master—I do not agree that the underclothing was not in good condition—some of it was extremely good—Mr. Kerry did not tell me who the solicitor was who was going to have everybody arrested for libel and I did not trouble to find out—Mr. Kerry talked like a man labouring under great indignation and as though a false charge was being made against him—I did not disclose at that interview that I had been having inter<lb/>views with seamen or people—there was no question of giving myself away—I had had interviews with the sailors and I knew that the Colonial Office had taken the matter up—if you like to say so, I was one of the prime movers; I was one of the witnesses—I gave him the impression that I was going to tell him nothing; that is different to knowing nothing—I hope he left me as wise as he came—I should think that on half my visits to the vessel I saw Mr. Kerry—I went down six or seven times in all—I saw far less of Burlton and Freke—I did not see where the parcels were put—on my first visit I went over the yacht, but not after my goods had been delivered, except into the saloon—I was quite willing that Mr. Kerry, when he got out to sea and had time, should open the parcels and re-sort them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 86, Brunswick Street, Sheffield, and in October or November, 1904, my attention was attracted by a statement in the press that persons would have an opportunity of sending presents to the islanders of Tristan d'Acunha, and I determined to send them out some tools—I communicated with Messrs. Marples &amp; Sons and ar<lb/>ranged with them that I should have a parcel of tools at wholesale price—I selected a number which I thought would be useful—this is a list of them—there was a X-cut saw six feet long, a butcher's saw and other saws, an oil stone, an American felling axe and blades and some choppers, hammers, some draw knives, adzes and chisels, altogether amounting to £4 2s. 6d.—in addition to those I purchased from Mr. Reynolds a down knives and some razors similar to others which have been sent abroad—I communicated with the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> and got an acknowledgment on Novem<lb/>ber 9th (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Royal Colonial Institute, Northumberland Avenue, London, W.C., November 9th, 1904. Many thanks for your present to the islanders of Tristan, which will be duly delivered to them, and for your good wishes for the success of the trip. I shall be pleased to secure specimens of rock if possible. T. C. Kerry "—there was a further letter which Kerry wrote to me about packing and sending off, but that was attended to by Marples—as far as I know, the razors were also packed with Marples' goods—the next I heard of the matter was the receipt of a letter from the prisoner, dated July 30th (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "I arrived back in England a few days ago in my exploring yacht <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> from the islands of Tristan d'Acunha.

               <p>they were delighted with your presents, which I personally distributed to them. They requested me on their behalf to thank you very much indeed for the presents, and to say how much they appreciated them. My voyage has been most successful and I discovered on the islands most valuable guano deposits in enormous quantities. Again thanking you on the islanders' behalf, Believe me, Yours truly, T. C. Kerry "—I believed that my presents had been properly delivered—the next com<lb/>nunication I got was from my wife, and in consequence I wrote a letter on September 4th to Kerry (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Dear Sir,—My wife informs me that tome one called at my Sheffield address and mentioned your name. As his story did not at all fit in with the information contained in your letter to me of July 30th, I write to ask you whether my contribution of tools really was sent ashore at Tristan d'Acunha or what became of the things, When sending the tools I mentioned that any little curios would be accept<lb/>able (from Tristan) and you wrote me that you would be pleased to send something, either birds, skins, or geological specimens. With apologies for troubling you, I am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully "—I had received a litter of September 2nd (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Dear Sir,—You were kind enough last year, when I went out to Tristan d'Acunha, to send a present of some tools to the natives. I am sorry to say owing to an accident to my rudder and the dangerous position we were in when lying off the island, I was unable to land them. On the passage home I found that some of them were going rusty through the salt air and the dampness, and I could see it would be a great pity to return them to you in such a poor condition, as it would probably have taken off half their value in England, and perhaps they would have been useless to you, so I thought that under to circumstances the best and correct course would be to sell them at the best price I could get, which I did, disposing of them for £4 10s. off the West Coast of Africa. In case this amount does not cover what you paid for them, I am quite prepared to be the loser and to make good the deficit. I hope that you will agree with me that I acted for the best under the circumstances, and I enclose a cheque for the amount I received, namely, £4 10s. I went to Sheffield yesterday to see you, but unfortu<lb/>nately you were away. However, I saw your wife and explained matters, and the agreed with me in the course I had taken. I hope to hear that you accept the same view. If you wish to send out any more presents I shall be most happy to take them next time I visit the islands. Hoping to hear from you in reference to the matter, Believe me, Yours faithfully, T. C.

Some letters were sent out on. arrival home in a general way thanking people on behalf of the islanders for their presents, and my secretary happened to get your name mixed up with the rest, and that is how the mistake arose. I have a few little curios which I shall be pleased to send you if you will accept them.

               <p>also got a cheque from my wife—Mr. Kerry had also sent me a bear's skin and a sheep's skin mat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think this is one of the chisels which I bought from Marples (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Mr. Kerry showed it to my wife at sheffield—I did not see it until I was at Bow Street—it was then rusty—I paid about 7s. 6d. for the razors—I got a cheque from Mr. Kerry, but I did not make a profit out of it, because I paid the carriage—I know now that Mr. Kerry had to go to Marples to find out who it was bought the tools from them and in that way discovered me—when he called I happened to be away, so he saw my wife and explained the matter to her—he sent the cheque by post—I have lost nothing by the transaction—Mr. Kerry explained to my wife why my present had not got to the natives—assuming, for some reason, that my tools were not delivered and were going rusty, I should have no objection to Mr. Kerry doing what he did and then giving me the money—I have seen the two razors which were brought back; they have not been used.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—on September 1st Mr. Kerry called and asked for Mr. Morrish, saying he was the owner of the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>, and that he was sorry to say he had not been able to deliver the tools which Mr. Morrish had sent as a present to the islanders of Tristan d'Acunha because something had happened to the rudder of the ship, owing to which he was bound to sail away—he said he had been bound to sell the tools to a ship's carpenter on the coast of Africa, and it was better than bringing them back, as they were going rusty—I had sent a box of magazines, and Mr. Kerry said all had been delivered except the tools, a few books and some rubbish—that was on his second visit on September 18th—on that occasion I said that then were some razors which my husband had sent and Mr. Kerry said, "Then would have been delivered, as all small things were delivered in sacks "—at one of the interviews he produced this chisel, which was very rusty—I had no cause to disbelieve him as to his story of the accident to the rudder, and I thought that was the reason he could not leave the things.</p>

               <p>and some were stowed forward in the chain locker—there were fourteen sleeping cabins aft, two saloons and a big ward room—the two saloon were both on the same deck—the dining saloon was forward, the other was aft, and the wardroom was under the after saloon—there were some other people on board besides the crew; they were like passengert—there was Mr. Lascelles and Mr. Macan—I do not know if Cameron was a passenger; he slept aft—Sworder paid to go—Mr. Hussey Freke was on board as well as the mate, Mr. Burlton, and Mr. Hocker—at Las Palmas we took on board Mr. Boyce, and there was a Dr. Newton—before we reached Las Palmas I saw someone bringing books up from below—I was at the dinner table most of the time, but I believe they were coming from the chain locker—I went forward and saw a big heap of books by the port harness cask; it was about 1 p.m.—I should think the books were being carried up for about an hour—when I came up I saw 500 or 600 books and magazines—some men were throwing them overboard and they told me I could take what I wanted; I took some—this is the only one I have left (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); I gave some away—the books I saw in the heap and which were being thrown overboard were clean, but a bit duty; I mean they were not damaged—I did not see any bugs or fleas on them—there were no fleas on board when I joined—it was not from the cabin that I saw the men carrying the books—I came up to lay the table, and after dinner I got some more books from those on the deck; they were still being thrown overboard—I picked out altogether about six—before we started on the voyage I saw some provisions come on board—I remember three tins of Fry's Workman's Cocoa like this one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) coming from the Mission to Seamen—at first they were put in the forecastle; we unpacked them and I stood them in a locker over the w.c. aft—at Las Palmas, Cameron and Hocker left; they would see the books and were forward throwing them overboard—I remember another occasion after we left Las Palmas, and about a week or ten days before we got to Tristan, when books were thrown overboard—I saw a heap of books about dinner time at the stokehole door on the port side about 18 inches high and 4 or 5 feet long—Dr. Newton, Mr. Kerry, and one or two others were there—I did not hear Mr. Kerry give any orders to anybody else, but I picked up some books and he told me to throw them overboard—I asked him if they were any good and he told me to throw them overboard—I do not think he said if they were any good or not—there were a lot of bibles and some magazines in the heap—Macan kept some; there were 300 or 400 there, I believe—some of the books I showed to Mr. Kerry were bibles, some of them were old; he threw some of the books overboard himself—all the books on the deck except those taken by the crew were thrown overboard—I went on shore one night at Tristan when Mr. Macan was buried—my employment on board would keep me in a great measure down below—while we were at Tristan I reminded Mr. Kerry about the three tins of cocoa being aft—he said, "That has gone on shore a long while ago "—after leaving Tristan we got to the Cape, where Dr. Newton, Mr. Lascelles, Mr. Freke, Arnold Saunderson, Brown and Captain Newman left; we were there for five weeks—</p>

               <p>after we had been at Tristan some days about five of the islanders came on board and went to Inaccessible Island with us—I saw some potatoes, cranberries, eggs, a bullock and a sheep which the islanders brought on board—the islanders who went to Inaccessible with us came back to Tristan on the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>—the day we returned we got there early in the morning and left in the evening for the Cape—I remember a barge full of provisions being landed at St. Helena, amongst them being three tans of Fry's Workman's Cocoa—I believe I actually handed it to Hearn; they came from the same place that I had stored the other tins in—I hid seen no 14-lb. tins of that cocoa except those from the Mission to Seamen—I remember some took from Sheffield coming on board before we started—I remember seeing those tools on board at Sierra Leone; they were wrapped up, I think, in brown paper; they were apparently in the same condition as when I stowed them away When we started—at Sierra Leone provisions were being sold to the <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi> cable ship, and Mr. Kerry told Mr. Freke and me to get the took out from the place where they were stowed and put them on the ward-room table, which we did; they were then wrapped in paper with the exception of one or two gimlets which had fallen out—some of those in paper had string round them—the carpenter and the chief steward from the <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi> came on board—I was in the wardroom nearly all the time, but in the end Mr. Kerry sent me out—I do not know if the Carpenter saw the tools; fee may have turned the paper up—I heard Mr. Kerry say to the carpenter that they had cost him £14—I afterwards saw them on deck—at Ascenaion I took thirty or forty books on shore in a portmanteau on Mr. Kerry's instructions—they were rather new books, something like this one (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>); somebody else had packed them—Mr. Kerry told me to take them to the Governor's office—I took the books out of the portmanteau and brought it back to the ship—I remember some women coming on board at St. Helena with curios—I bought some; Mr. Kerry paid for them—he put it down on our account of wages—I had half a crown's worth—all the men bought something—I do not know who settled with the women—I saw them go away—I do not know if they had anything with them then—one had some washing; they came every day except Sunday—during the voyage it was necessary for the men to be supplied with materials for cleaning brass and other things—it was got from Mr. Kerry; he gave the men all sorts of different articles of clothing, men's and women's—I believe he got them from his cabin—he went there when the man asked him; they would stand at the cabin door—I have been sup<lb/>plied with things of that kind for cleaning—if I remember right, he kept the clothing in one of his drawers in his cabin—in the West India Dock he gave me a knickerbocker serge suit with the name "Carson" on it, which he said had belonged to the great barrister's son, a blue serge coat with brass buttons, some collars of different sizes and patterns, some shirts, and on the voyage from Cape Town he gave me a woollen shawl or crossover—he gave me a new muffler for cleaning purposes—I have seen the men using things which had been given to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I sailed to Tristan on the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>, but not as a member of the crew—I knew by the articles that the crew were prohibited from keeping diaries, but not being a member of the craw I kept a diary—I first met Mr. Kerry at Brighton in 1903 at the end of the West Pier by his remarking about the weather while I was listening to the band—he did not tell me exactly what he was, but I gathered he was a traveller of some kind; not a commercial traveller—I next eat him at Earl's Court Exhibition in 1904; it was quite a casual meeting—at neither of those meetings had I given him my address, I think—I next saw him in 1904 in Old Jewry, and he told me he was the owner of a yacht and was thinking of going out to Tristan d'Acunha; that was the first time I had heard of it—he said if I wanted to write to him I could always address letters to him, "Mr. Kerry, bound for Tristan d'Acunha "—after that I saw a notice in the papers and I telephoned to the Royal Colonial Institute, where I had written to him, and he came to the place where I was then working—I asked him if there was any chance of going out with him—he said he did not know exactly, but provided I worked there might be a chance, and eventually he consented to my going with him—I really do not know in what capacity I went—I was not a member of the crew or a paying passenger; I was a working passenger and messed in the moss room next to the forecastle with some of the crew—there were two engineers there and one or two other fellows like myself—on the way to Las Palmas a lot of books were thrown overboard—I handed them up from the chain locker, as Mr. Kerry gave me orders to do so; there were others helping me—we were over two hours handing then up—I should think quite 1, 500 books were handed up in that time—as far as I know, they were placed on the deck in a pile, and Mr. Kerry gave orders for them to be thrown overboard—he did not give me orders per<lb/>sonally, I think, but to everyone; I heard him—they were a very good mixture of books, magazines, and ordinary bound books and papers of all descriptions—there were a few tracts and a lot of monthly magazines—they were in very good condition; there might have been one or two with their backs torn off—I saw nothing against their cleanliness—I do not think it would be true to say that they were so infested with bugs and fleas they had to be thrown over for sanitary reasons—there were a few old illustrated newspapers, but I did not see any daily papers—I saw this service box (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) full of prayer books, and there might have been one or two bibles in it—I think it was fastened by a strap and hooks; it was marked "Service Box," but I can only see now "cc "—the bibles and prayer books were absolutely new; they wore handed up on the deck when I saw them, and I think they were thrown overboard—Mr. Kerry said that if we wanted any books ourselves we could pick them out—I picked out several and the others did the same—these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) are some of the books I picked out; they are absolutely clean; I should not have taken them otherwise—I kept them in my bunk in the mess room where I slept—the other fellows who slept in that room</p>

In the end he was sent to his room, and all day he refused to turn to "—that affected me somewhat—"Tristan sighted after breakfast. Men had a row with Mr. Kerry about two weeks' stores being given out "—that interested me—on February. 19th, 1905, there is an entry, "Tristan d'Acunha reached about 7 o'clock in the morning. Men came off in their boat from the island. About sixty-five inhabitants. Mr. Kerry went ashore by himself; all sealed mails given them and some boob. Sheep brought off island and was killed; finished milk for tea. Fish you could catch about fifty in ten minutes; several sacks of potatoes brought aboard, including cabbage. A very nice and sharp lot of people. Sworder, Lawis, Maoan and Mr. Hussey Freke went ashore to stop until w" had explored all the other islands. Steaming all day owing to bad anchorage "—we could not anchor, but we had not got to steam away; we kept up steam to prevent ourselves drifting—on the 20th I write, "Sea very rough and we were bound to strain right out to sea, otherwise we should have been washed ashore "—that is right—it was not a very easy coast to lie off—one observation is, "Food a little better "—that was after we had had some fresh provisions—on February 21st I wrote, "Whistled for the islanders' boat to come off, but without avail. One of our boats was lowered and went ashore "—I did not see what was in the boat except the men; I thought Mr. Freke, junior, was there—"Mr. Hussey Freke came back in it and reported about Mr. Macan being missing "—that is correct—next day I write, "Mr. Kerry went ashore and came back with the horrible news that Macan had been found with his head nearly severed from his body and all his limbs broken. After dinner Mr. Kerry, the carpenter, and Hamblin went ashore. After they had left a gale sprang up and we were bound to leave there; nearly went ashore in the night, if it had not been that steam was all ready "—that was according to Mr. Kerry's account, but I am not a nautical man, and I may be mistaken; I may be a diarist—I do not think I wrote that down at the time—it is true that a gale sprang up—I think it is my own Account when I say, "Rudder of ship giving way under the strain of the recent seas, and we were all day fixing it up so that she would not have to much strain on it. He is as soon as possible going to Cape Colony to have it repaired, or else she will lose her rudder altogether. Six of the islanders, Dr. Newton and Mr. Lascelles, left in a small boat at 9 o'clock for the Inaccessible Island, from which we were about one mile. They returned about 3 in the afternoon with several sacks of guano. Left again in about 5 for Nightingale Island and did not return, sleeping all night on the island. Mr. Kerry did not go with them; a gale of wind sprang up soon after tea "—on the 25th we were not at Tristan; we were</p>

Said good-bye to islanders about 4.30 in afternoon, giving them cheers, which they returned. Started for Cape Colony soon after. Mr. Kerry in a very bad temper. The worst crew on board of a ship he had ever seen "—that is what he was saying, and I wrote it down at the time—on the 27th I wrote, "Full-rigged ship sighted, to which we signalled that we were disabled with a damaged rudder and also asked her to report us "—according to Mr. Kerry's idea we were disabled—I looked at the rudder, but I could not see if it was disabled—I thought then that we were disabled, but I do not know if we were—we were at Cape Town for a month while it was being repaired.</p>

I live at Writtle Hall, Chelmsford, and as just over eighteen years of age—in the autumn of 1904 I saw an advertise<lb/>ment in a paper in consequence of which I came up with my father to the Hotel Metropole and saw Kerry there—he said he was going to Tristan d'Acunha, and if he found the guano satisfactory there he would come home as quickly as possible, but if he did not he would go on to New Zealand—he said ho was a naturalist and explorer—I was to be his assistant is regards the natural history and geology—I was to pay £40, and finally I agreed to go—my father paid the £40—I joined the ship about a month before she sailed—a number of cases of all sorts came on board—Kerry was there at night, but most of the day he was away—while he was away there were on board Mr. Freke, Hamblin myself and another boy called East—there were some wooden cases which came on board and there were two wooden cases on board containing books when I got there; I did not see them arrive—they were standing in the after saloon, the tops being off—they were full of books—Mr. Kerry told us to take them out and put them into several bookcases—he saw what we did—I think we put about 150 books into the bookcases—Kerry said they had come from the Duchess of Bedford—they were in very good condition—we put some of the books out of those cases in the fore saloon and some in different cabins—Mr. Kerry and the officers had their meals in the fore saloon—some of the books</p>

               <p>and remember some things coming on board, amongst them two bundles of literature in brown paper—I think one of them had the name of the Printing Press Association on it—I believe one was addressed to Tristan d'Acunha; one was very heavy—when I saw them they were on a meat safe on the port side—I saw Kerry tear the brown paper cover off a corner of each—I saw there were books and magazines inside—Kerry said, "Throw that d—rubbish over," and told us we could take some if we liked—I took three or four monthly illustrated magazines, as far as I remember, like the "Strand" or "Harper's "—several of the crew were there and, I believe, took some, and the rest were thrown over the side—that was at Gravesend—those which I took appeared in fairly good con<lb/>dition; there was nothing dirty about them, but I do not suppose they were new—the parcels themselves were in a good state as far as I saw—it was evening time and I had a lamp—before Las Palmas boob were thrown overboard and I saw one name in them, "F. Field, Ealing," and "S.P.C.K." and "R.T.S. "—I remember a wooden box containing bibles, prayer and hymn books, which were all new—they went over the side, but the box was kept—I should say about a thousand or more books went over before Las Palmas—while they were being thrown over-board I saw Kerry there—I saw nothing about their condition as being objectionable; I selected three of them; there was nothing dirty or nasty about them—I noticed others of the crew with books; I saw nothing objectionable about them—about a week before we got to Tristan I saw some more books thrown over; I should say a few hundred; then were several of R. M. Ballantyne's books there—at St. Helena I remember seeing some British Workman's Cocoa—on the voyage I had to do sons cleaning, and once at Cape Town I got a lady's night dress from Mr. Kerry for cleaning—as far as I could see, it was in good condition—I also got a white knitted scarf from him; I do not know where he got it from—we did not always go to him for things; sometimes we went to Mr. Freke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> About the middle of the voyage I saw a great quantity of bugs—by the time we got to Cape Town they had just about stated to trouble us—the fleas did not cause us much trouble, although we had some—while we were at Cape Town we had a plague of bugs and spent a greater part of our time fighting them—we cleaned the place out and used paraffin, but still they came, and at last we had to submit, as they came in such numbers—I saw them practically all over the place forward—going home I saw them among the books and papers there—I joined the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi> on a Saturday, and on the Monday I went to the quay in a boat, but I did not actually go on shore—while I was in the boat close to the quay a man came up and handed me a note—I did not know who he was—I do not know if it was 10 p.m., but it was fairly late and dark—he said, "If you send me information of what goes on aboard the ship I will pay you well "—at first he asked me if I was one of the apprentices and I told him no—it struck me as funny and I took the note to Mr. Kerry and told him what the man had said—I first gave it to Mr. Saunders, who was in the boat with me—at the Police Court I</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw about a dozen books altogether thrown over-board—I was not about the ship like the rest; I was stoking part of the time—I suffered a little from bugs—as we went on they got worse—the bugs came first after we left Cape Town, and before that fleas; they came on board with us, I think, but I did not bring them—I remember the three tins of cocoa well—there was a lighter full of stores put on shore at St. Helena—I have been receiving 4s. a day.</p>

               <p>we all had to sign receipts for 5s., which entitled Sir. Kerry to deduct 5s. from our pay, which was done—I remember the tools going away at Sierra Leone; they came from Mr. Kerry's cabin.</p>

I have been engaged on this case from the time inquiries were first made at the instance of the Colonial Office—after some time the matter was put into the hands of the Public Prosecutor and a warrant granted at Bow Street for the prisoner's arrest—I executed that on September 27th—the charge was for stealing on or about December 30th, 1904, a service box containing prayer and other devotional books on the high seas within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty of England, the property of the chairman of the Mission to Seamen—that is the service box produced at the Police Court and here—I reed the warrant to him—he said, "There is not the slightest foundation for it; I have never stolen a book in my life "—on September 28th a Magistrate in Sussex granted a search warrant, and with it I and Inspector Smale went to the <hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>—we went over it and made this list of the articles we found—it contains a list of the books found on the ship, about fifty four in all—they are those identified by the witnesses—we also found some articles of clothing—I have got a list of those identified, but not the whole of the property—I found two razors identified by Mr. Reynolds, two letters written to Mr. Morrish, a chisel with the name of Marples on it, a letter from Mr. Balfour, a way bill for the books from Mr. Morrish, and a receipt for the same, and a registered letter receipt for a letter addressed to him—amongst the clothing I found a lady's black coat, four ladies' cloth jackets, a skirts, eleven silk blouses, fifteen cotton blouses, eight petticoats, five wool<lb/>len crossovers, articles of ladies' underclothing, two boys' flannel Skirts a lady's cape, a flannel jacket, a bundle containing stockings and things, two pairs of slippers, and two pairs of woollen gloves—amongst the skirts were those identified by Mrs. Moginie, and some of the other witnesses have identified other of the articles of clothing—in the cabin I found two sailors' kit bags with labels on them, which appeared to be freshly written, and had on them "Books to be returned to Tristan d'Acunha"—amongest</p>

Smythe, glass factor, 11, Chapel Place, Chapel Street, Islington—we wrote to Mr. Smythe, but had no reply—on the 17th we had a letter from John Adams (<hi rend="italic">Read: Stating that he had known Lewis in business for years and "a straighter and better business man I do not want to know</hi> ")—Lewis gave us a further reference to a Mr. Hawley—we wrote to him and got this reply (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi>30) (<hi rend="italic">Read: Stating that he would prove a desirable tenant</hi>)—we did not let Lewis have the premises—we did not make any personal inquiries at Harringay; we heard indirectly—I went to Brecken<lb/>ham Road, where Lewis was living, and saw him—I did not know who Adams, Smythe or Hawley were.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Stating that his reference was Mr. A. Hawley, glass importer</hi>, 24, <hi rend="italic">Sebright Street, Bethnal Green, E.</hi>)—Lewis remained there about two months—I know that a Mr. Ben Gee used the shop periodically—he recommended Lewis to us—Lewis remained there till about the end of December—the premises after that remained closed—china and glass ware was sold by auction there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager at the Edmonton branch of the London &amp; Provincial Bank, Fore Street—on June 6th, 1905, Lewn opened an account as Robert Lewis, trading as Evan Gwynne &amp; Co., 241 and 243, Fore Street, Edmonton—I produce a correct copy of then account as in the books from August 23rd to October 19th, 1905, when it was closed—on August 28th there is a cheque payable to Pahl for £10—on that day the account was overdrawn 5s. 5d.—that was the only occasion on which I allowed it to be overdrawn—the largest amount to his credit is £19, on September 4th, which the same day was reduced to £8 9s.—after that date there was never as much as £10 standing to his credit—he had his pass book made up very frequently; I should say three times a week at least—he had it made up on September 16th, 20th, 25th, 27th, October 2nd, 9th, 11th, and it was handed back to him on the 17th, when the account was closed—there are two occasions when there were ac<lb/>ceptances of a man named Hawley, October 2nd, £5 and October 7th, £5—on October 7th the prisoner asked me for a new cheque book, which I declined to give, as the account had been too troublesome; I mean by drawing cheques and having them dishonoured—he asked me to allow him to continue the account a little longer, because he was getting over his financial difficulties, and he would keep the account more satisfactory in the future—I asked him to embody that promise in writing, which he did—I told him if he broke his promise I should insist upon the account being closed forthwith—at that time he mentioned three cheques—he asked me not to pay them, but to return them, as he specially wished them not to be paid—on October 7th ho had to his credit £3 13s. 5d.—on the 9th £5 3s. 10d.; I could not pay the cheques out of that—after October 6th there were six cheques dishonoured; three were dishonoured after his account was closed.</p>

Turner, ls, James Street, Essex Road," dated July 26th—a good many of his cheques were dishonoured—this cheque, drawn by Charles Wilson to T.

Ingersoll &amp; Brother, watch manufacturers, of Ely Place, Holborn, in a large was of business—on September 6th, 1905, we received a letter, signed H. G. Jorey (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 82), in reply to our advertisement for a traveller—he gave a refer<lb/>ence to a Mr. Huggett—we engaged him and supplied him with about £10 worth of samples—we received four orders through him—in sending in an order he said he had received one from Evan Gwynne &amp; Co., but had torn it up—we told him he should turn in all orders to us and leave it to us whether they should be filled or not—we told him to return the samples, as ho was doing no business—Mr. "Gwynne" called and bought some goods for cash, which he took away—he subsequently wrote us for goods, but we did not want to do any business with the firm, having investigated the matter.</p>

               <p>circular wound, such as the round part of a belt causes—my attention was not particularly called to Mary Spencer—I believe there was no complaint made by the prisoner as to his having been struck on the head—I afterwards attended the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> on the deceased at the hospital on the 27th, when an examination was made by Dr. Woodhill—in my opinion the cause of death was a severe blow on the head, causing laceration of the brain and consequent hæmorrhage—there was a large effusion of blood on the brain—that would have been caused by his head having come in contact with some hard substance with considerable violence—I do not think it could have been caused by a blow from the buckle of a belt, as there was not sufficient force—I think it might have been caused by this iron bar or if he had fallen with his full weight against a wall or on the pavement.</p>

I have never done any<lb/>thing bad to you "—he then stepped back, fell over a chair, and I sprang upon him, beat his hand on the ground, and took the revolver away—I found the door of my bedroom, and my box broken open, which had my money in it—after that Vince and I took a lamp to see if we could find the bullet in the garden, but we could not—the prisoner went to bed, and I sat up with Vince all night by the fire—I called for a policeman, but I was so confused that I was not able to explain sufficiently in English—the policeman said if I would get him out of the house he would arrest him.</p>

Shoot!"and that is how I could make out what he meant—he was searched at the station—only a pocket knife was found on him—when the prisoner was afterwards charged with shooting he said, "I did not do it; I did not do it.

Siddall &amp; Hilton, mattress makers, of Chapel Street, Forest Gate—the prisoner called on me on October 10th last and said he had been sent from our place at Finsbury Park and that he wanted to purchase rugs, etc.—he gave an order for about £20 worth of rugs, bedsteads, spring mattresses, bedding, etc, and asked that we should deliver the rugs first and we should have cash on receipt of invoice, and would we keep the other goods over while we were going into the references?—he gave two references: John Adams, of 35, Breck<lb/>enham Road, Edmonton, and Albert Hawley, 3 Gilpin Crescent, Totten<lb/>ham—he said he was Evan Gwynne &amp; Co., of Upper Edmonton, and gave me this card—I wrote to Hawley and Adams—the letter to Hawley was returned through the Dead Letter Office—we received no answer to our letter to Adams—I went to see the prisoner and mentioned these things—he said that Albert Hawley had gone away; I forget now whether he said into the country or on the Continent, and as to John Adams not answering, he said he could not account for it, but he said he was not surprised—I arranged with him that we were to receive a cheque on receipt of invoice which we sent him for £7 19s. 3d., after deducting discount—it was for rugs—when I called on him at 241, Fore Street, Edmonton, he said he was changing his bank and he could not give us a cheque, but if we would accept a bill payable at a month from the date of invoice he would send it on per return—the acceptance was subsequently sent to the firm for £7 19s. 3d., but they would not accept it—I suggested the bill so that we might have proof of delivery of goods for suing purposes—when he came to us he seemed to follow what we said our terms of business were; they were cash on receipt of invoice—we sent the invoice by post and it would get there probably before the goods arrived—that was so that the cheque should be ready when the goods came—we never got our money.</p>

I am manager at the James Cycle Co., South<lb/>ampton Row—in November, 1904, we received a letter of January 25th, 1905, from Robert Lewis saying he wished to buy one of our bicycles by instalments, and that he was manager of the firm whose card he enclosed—that was Evan Gwynne &amp; Co.—we sent him a form to fill up—it gave kit business address 100 and 100s. Breckenham Road; then there is this:—"Being over age and a householder, Therewith give the address of a gentleman who will say whether I am to be trusted: 'Evan Gwynne, Esq., glass merchant, 72, Grand Parade, Harringay' "—we wrote to the reference and received a satisfactory reply—we let him have the bicycle—three instalments of £1 have been paid out of £12—we have never got the rest nor our bicycle—we parted with the machine on the strength of the reference from Evan Gwynne—the primer had said that the bicycle was not necessarily for himself; it might be for a messenger or errand boy in his employ—I did not know till this case came on that the prisoner and Evan Gwynne were the same—we were a long time in the dark about that—I did not know he told it the day after he got it.</p>

Laurie Lazarus &amp; Benjamin, of Andrew Street, Holborn, glass and china merchants—I knew the pris<lb/>oner as Evan Gwynne &amp; Co.—he came to us on September 1st, 1905, and purchased goods for £8 9s. 6d.—he said he would send a carman for them and a cheque as well—next day a messenger came with a cheque and a note asking us to deliver the goods—he had the goods on the following Monday, September 4th—we presented the cheque and it was dishonoured—at the time I received it and patted with the goods I believed it to be a good and valid order for the payment of money—he afterwards raised some question about some of the goods being broken and short—we sued him in the County Court and got judgment, but we have never had our money.</p>

My firm are china and glass merchants, of Commercial Street—the prisoner called on us last October in the name of Evan Gwynne—we sold him a parcel of goods, valued £9 2s. 10d—he was to call and take them away, paying cash—we sent him an invoice the same day—somebody came from him the next day with a letter, asking for the two top lines of the invoice to be delivered, sending cheque for 2a. 6d. in excess of what they came to—he had the goods and we paid the cheque into our bank, but it was returned marked "Account closed "—we parted with our goods, thinking it was all right—the messenger came for the rest of the goods and handed in another cheque for the total amount of the invoice—he had the goods, but the cheque was dishonoured—we have received no money for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor practising at Ambleside in Westmor<lb/>land—the prisoner and his father before him have acted as my London agents for thirty-four years—the prisoner's father died some time before 1902, and since then the prisoner and his cousin, who died about five years ago, acted as my London agents, but after 1902 the prisoner alone conducted the business—in 1902 I was acting in the matter of James Brooklebank, deceased, and on March 4th, 1902, an order was made by the Chancery Division for the payment into Court of £316 16s. 10d.—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the order, and the name, of the prisoner's firm is en<lb/>dorsed on it as being the solicitors who took it up—I received this letter from the prisoner dated March 25th, 1902 (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "<hi rend="italic">Re</hi> Brocklebank. the order has now been passed and entered and we shall be glad to receive the £316 16s. 10d. to pay into Court We send you the draft order and the statement showing the figures "—on March 26th I wrote this letter to him (<hi rend="italic">Enclosing cheque for</hi> £316 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to pay into</hi> Court)—this (<hi rend="italic">Pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is my cheque—on March 27th I got an acknowledgment from the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had received the cheque to pay into Court and enclosing note of charges; that the dividends would be accumulated in Court and would not be paid out unless it were shown that it was necessary for the maintenance and education of the infant</hi>)—I received their usual half, yearly account (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), probably at the beginning of the long vacation—upon one side there is the acknowledgment of the cheque under the date of April 1st, and on the other side without any date, but underneath the date of April 24th, and under the words "Into Court" there is "Ditto re Brooklebank, £316 16s. 10d.

Hastie, Hughes and Dayrell, of East Grinstead and London, acted on behalf of the defendant—the prisoner, as my agent, conducted that litigation, and this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is the account which he sent to me showing the state of things up to June 30th, 1903—I find no reference to Mawson in that account, but I scarcely expected to, as the payment he had received was simply on amount and would be held in suspense until he accounted for the full of that account I learnt of its receipt by the defendant in relation to his claim, but I have no document to show it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a cheque for £157 14S. 7d. by Hasties to the prisoner, but I cannot say</p>

This matter has been settled and we will send you an account and cheque in the course of a day or two "—I do not remember if an account was sent, but a cheque was sent dated September 28th for £350, which I paid into my bankers in the ordinary way, but it was returned dishonoured—I had some correspondence with him, no doubt about that, but I did not come up to London until later—I was solicitor for Mr. Thomas Parkinson Worthington, who has since died—he was a plaintiff in some Chancery proceedings and the Court through Mr. Justice Byrne made an order directing a payment out of Court to Mr. Worthington of £1,567 17s. 3d.—the total came to £1,578 6s. 2d. with interest—the name of the prisoner's firm is attached to the order and the Power of Attorney is in the prisoner's name—on July 30th, 1903, I wrote to the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Asking that the matter of Worthington and Storrs should be cleared up and finishes before the long vacation, or it would be fatal to Mr. Worthington; that the Lancashire Banking Co. had grown tired of waiting and had placed the matter into the hands of another solicitor to take proceedings against Mr. Worthinton, who had also sought other advice as to his position, and there was every possi<lb/>bility of the witness losing him as a client</hi>)—on August 11th I wrote to the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Worthington <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Storrs. I am obliged to you for yours of yesterday's date with print of the order for Foreclosure Absolute, and beyond the misprint of Albert Grey, which should be Albert Greg, on page 3, and about which I wired you, the print seems to be in order "—on August 18th I wrote again (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Worthington <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Storrs. I am obliged by your letter enclosing order herein to go with Mr. Worthington's papers. What about the cheque for amount in Court?"—a Power of Attorney was issued to the prisoner and executed by Mr. Worthington and for<lb/>warded to the prisoner in order that he might receive the money on Mr. Worthington's behalf—on August 20th I wrote (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "I am in receipt</p>

We have to fill up a form of application and the paymaster hands out the Power of Attorney for execution. Directly we get the Power we will send it on to you "—on August 31st the Power of Attorney was sent to me for execu<lb/>tion and it was sent back by me under the date of September 3rd with a letter (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "I return Power of Attorney duly completed by Mr. Worthington and attested, and shall be glad to have cheque in due course," and received this letter on September 5th from the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "We are in receipt of the Power of Attorney duly executed.

Worthington is anxious, the Lancaster Bank is anxious, and I am being asked daily when the matter is to be ended. Please let me have your costs up to date in this matter, so that I can render a state<lb/>ment immediately I receive the cheque "—I received this reply, dated September 25th (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "Our Mr. Scott will be here on Monday, and we will send you agency bill and cash account with cheque for balance.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the prisoner since he was a boy, and have regarded him as an upright, honourable man, and do so no—he has done very considerable transactions on my behalf, and up to these matters, money matters had been strictly and correctly dealt with by him—we had a running account, but I cannot say we had a settlement twice a year, because I was generally owing him money and sent him a cheque for £100 or £200 on account—there was a statement of account every half year, which generally showed a balance in his favour—when I sent him money from the country I expected them to be dealt with in the course of the account, and when he received money in London he gave me credit for it—it was all a matter of account between us, but when this unfortunate matter happened the amounts were rather larger than usual and rather larger than I cared to pay out of my own account—with regard to the Mawson matter, I think one payment was made in one half year and one in the other half year—I expected that matter to be settled up in one transaction when the compromise was fully effected—I make no complaint of the first payment not being included in the account for the first year half—I do not know the date that I received the cheque for £350, dated September 28th, but probably it was the day after—if that cheque had been met it would have paid off the balance between us in Mawson's matter—I do not know that on September 28th the prisoner's banking account was garnisheed and he did not tell me about it after<lb/>wards—I do not know of any letter which came to me about that—there was no concealment about his having received the £1,578 cheque—the Brocklebank cheque was paid into Court to accumulate with interest—I think it was received about April 1st or March 26th, and I understood he was ill and was away for about ten days—it was just before Easter—the prisoner did not tell me the name of the lady to whom he had been making advances; he said she was a foreign Countess—that was the matter of Mrs. Tottenham—the daughters claim the titles as well as the mothers in foreign countries—I firmly believe it to be true that the prisoner had made those advances—from my interview with Mr. Scott I think he believed in the security he was taking, and my impression is that he is the biggest loser and has been the most deluded—he was absorbed in the professional part of his work as distinguished from the financial part; his cousin did the whole of the office work—I believe the prisoner was very much overworked and had not time to attend to the inside and outside business—I only know from hearsay that since</p>

               <p>the bankruptcy proceedings £52 a year has fallen into Mrs. Tottenham—my clients nave all been paid; no man has lost one penny through me or through the prisoner by me—I make no claim; I refused to prosecute twelve months ago and the Treasury are now trying to ruin him for the second time—I did not force him into bankruptcy and I took his view at the time, that if he was allowed to realise this Tottenham business he would have paid everybody in full, but I do not think he could do so now after it has been in official hands for eighteen months.</p>

I am a chartered accountant of 66, Gresham Street, and the trustee in the defendant's bankruptcy—the net assets which I have been able to realise amount to £449 1s.—I have been unable to obtain anything from Mr. Comber—I have obtained a charging order on an annuity of £56 a year coming to Mrs. Tottenham—no dividend has been declared in the bankruptcy.</p>

I am going to take a new partner, and, as you see, I have got all my books about me "—the room was very much upset—I saw him. again in May—I thought it was time the money was paid and I am afraid I pressed him for it rather closely—I said, "It is very evident you are not going to move in this matter, but I am.

                  </hi>. I am managing clerk to Mr. Lewis Harding, a chartered accountant, and I have been in the habit of posting up the defendant's books—this ledger contains his agency accounts, and under the date of April 1st, 1902, I find £316 16s. 10d. credited to the account—I find no debit entry in that account in relation to that sum—I balanced the account for the half year ending June 30th, 1902, and when I did to there was £202 4s. 8d. carried forward as the balance in the defendant's writing—it is quite different to the rest of the writing, which is mine—that entry was made before I balanced the account, and purported to show a debit balance against Mr. Gatey—I cast the items in the account and corrected the balance according to the figures—I corrected it to £114 12s. 2d. and put my pen through the £202 4s. 8d.—the £114 12s. 2d. is correct—the £316 16s. 10d. is not shown on the debit side, and it should not appear there if it had been paid away—according to the figures in the book the £202 is wrong and the account ought to be £114 in credit—my attention was called to it in September or October, when I went through the books—in Exhibit 6, which is the cash account, I find the £316 16s. 10d. on both sides and the debit balance is correctly shown at the bottom as £202 4s. 8d.—these figures, £646 9s. 8d., are mine—in the ledger account of May 8th, 1903, there is a credit of £157 14s. 7d., which not carried to the debit side of that half year—I find in the defendant's writing in pencil another credit entry of £157 14s. 7d., but it may not be under the date of August 18th, because I take it that is only a note—the last date before that pencil note is August 18th.</p>

               <p>Edward Scott, £25; Mrs. Gatey, £12; and a client, £7 Us.—the cheque for £1,500 from Worthington was dealt with by the overdraft for £322 11s. 6d.; Mrs. Tottenham, £532 9s. 6d.; counsel, £359 9s.; sell, £198 8s.; shorthand writers, £39 0s. 4d.; clients, £112 10s. 8d.; agency, £59 16s.; Inland Revenue, £11 17s. 3d.; Wells, £44 1s. 5d.; Mrs. E. Scott, £7 2s. 9d.; bank, £4 16s. 1d.; and other payments into the bank were deducted, amounting to £113 16s. 4d.—the sum which the assets are expected to realise will be about £500, inclusive of the annuity, of which I have heard for the first time to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Northampton Street, Islington—early in 1900 I was engaged to be married to Henry Parkins—the engagement was broken off, and I took steps to bring an action for breach of promise of marriage—I saw a plate on the door at 18, Shelburn Road, Holloway; that is about twenty minutes' walk from my place—it was a plate of Mr. Edridge and had on it "Solicitor, Commissioner for Oaths "—I had known the prisoner two or three years before that—we belonged to the Salvation Army, and I thought he was a good man—he told me he was a solicitor's clerk in the employ of Mr. Edridge, but that he had not been working for him long—this was two or three weeks before the action commenced—when I met the prisoner he advised me to go and see Mr. Edridge—I went to see him about May, 1900—I saw the prisoner, who told me the solicitor was very ill, and was away for the benefit of his health, in Italy, or Spain—he offered to bring the action, and took down my statement in writing, and wrote the letters produced—I signed this retainer (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) and gave him 4s. 8d. to write a letter to Mr. Parkins—on May 20th, 1900, I made him a payment of £5, for which he gave me the receipt produced—he said he would take the case up for £20, and I did not pay it all at once; I paid it as he asked for it—I had been engaged in the City, but was not very well at that time, and had left my business—I had then £20 in the bank—he wrote me this letter of June 13th for further instructions, and asking for £5, and I then paid him another £5—I received this letter of June 14th, stating that be had issued the writ, and that a copy had been served on the defendant; also the letter of June 23rd, stating that he had signed Interlocutory Judge<lb/>ment for the damages to be assessed by the Sheriff, and that he required £15—I am not quite sure that I paid him that all at once, but I know that I paid him altogether £31—he told me that the £20 was to cover expenses till we got to the Court, and then he said there were other ex<lb/>penses—I paid him all the money I had in the bank, and borrowed the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080151"/>
               <p>other £11 from my brother-in-law, so as not to let the thing fall through, as I wanted to get damages out of the gentleman who had treated me so badly—he gave me this receipt for £6, dated June 29th, on account of costs and disbursements, and signed for Robert Edridge—I have not had all my receipts—on some occasions he said he had not any stamps—I think £9 was my last payment, but I had no receipt for that—the letter produced of July 11th purporting to come from Robert Edridge was to ask me to give evidence, and accordingly I attended at the Sheriff's Court on July 20th, when the damages were assessed at £25—the following day I got this letter asking for 30s. to enable him to sign judgment, which he states "will involve a further payment of £1 10s. "—I paid him that—on August 1st I received this further request for 5s., giving details of small payments—I think I paid him 5s. then, and another 16s. on August 20th was demanded as the balance of the judgment summons—I received this letter of December 3rd:, that as I had not kept my promise and paid the 16s., he did not propose to act further for me—I had promised him the 16s., and I had paid him what I could, but he had told me a wrong sum, and I hesitated, but I paid him altogether £31—I was next served by Mr. Parkin's solicitor with a notice to set aside the judgment on the ground that the solicitor's name had been placed improperly on the writ of summons—I was surprised in a way, but I had gone to see the prisoner and found the place shut up, the brass plate gone, and the door locked—I saw him once since at a Salvation Army meeting, but he got out of my way as quickly as he could—he was not in the Army uniform—I wrote and informed the officers of the Army, and I laid my charge before the Magistrate some time in October, 1900, just after signing judgment—I next saw him at the Salvation Army Headquarters, when he wanted to give me the benefit of his life insurance and said he did not think a warrant was out against him, as it could not be after twelve months, and that I should have to renew it—I knew that a warrant was out against him, and that he had insured his life for £60, and he said he would pay me out of that—I declined—he went away, and I have not seen any more of him—I never saw Mr. Edridge—the prisoner told me he was away, but that it was quite right, as he was acting quite fairly, and in reply to me he said that Mr. Edridge was much better, and that he had heard from him; I said that my father wished to see him, and that he ought to see my solicitor—he said he was working for me, and not for my father, and that if I did not trust him I could take my papers elsewhere, and he could not say when Mr. Edridge would return—I think that was after I paid him the £9, when I got no receipt—I did not know Mr. Edridge was dead—I asked the prisoner if Mr. Edridge was aware of the proceedings, and he said he was quite aware of them—that was when he commenced the action—I thought I was going to see Mr. Edridge at the Sheriff's Court—the prisoner told me it did not matter, and that I had counsel acting for me—counsel was at the Court, and the prisoner told me if I was asked by counsel where the solicitor was I was to say he was still away for the benefit of his health—afterwards the prisoner said I should not get any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080152"/>
               <p>money, and I ought to be satisfied that I had got clear, and had right on my side, as he did not think I could get any money out of Parkins—that was about the middle of the proceedings, but I was not going to let it fall through—he said Parkins was a man who did not earn mock money—Parkins always gave me to understand he was an engineer's assistant—the letters produced, signed "Robert Edridge," written to Parkins, are in the prisoner's writing, so is the writ, but I am not sure as to the notice given to Parkins—the bill of costs is the prisoner's writing, the judgment summons, and the certificate of costs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I knew the prisoner as "Brother Tress," having met him at a Salvation Army meeting—when we were speaking together about my love trouble he asked me to come to his office—he told me directly that I could not see Mr. Edridge—I never saw him at all; I never saw anybody but Tress—I know that he did carry on my case, that he did pay out-of-pocket expenses, and that my not getting the money was not owing to to irregularity—I am quite sure I paid him £31, in instalments—as to the £9, he said he had no stomps, and asked if I would mind if he sent it on, but I never got it; that is why my father wished to see him, and then he said that Mr. Edridge was away in Spain—I do not remember him saying that he had not heard from Mr. Edridge and that no news was good news—I saw the prisoner several times at the Salvation Army Barracks at Hoxton—I refused to take an insurance on his life—I did not say I wanted £50 more than he offered me—I refused his insurance, as he might hate lived longer than I—I do not suppose he had £50—I knew the warrant was out in 1901, and I thought it was the duty of the detectives to find him, but he kept out of the way—I did not make any other inquiries than through the officers of the Army—a colonel of the Army asked me to see the prisoner, and I saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was told the prisoner was living in Glynn Road—one of the Salvation Army officers went there, and found he had gone—all the five years this warrant had been out I did not know where he was living—in 1901 I had an interview—I only met him once after the writ was out, and that was at the request of the Army officer Stitt—I did not ask for a sum of £50—I at no time saw Mr. Edridge—the prisoner never at any time introduced me to anybody as Mr. Edridge.</p>

We have a warrant for your arrest "—he said, "Oh, I suppose that means Miss Taylor's matter "—he commenced to make a statement, when I said, "If you are going to make a statement I will take it down in writing now "—I took it down—he said, "This matter was settled after the warrant was issued. It was a few months afterwards; we all met at Colonel Stitt's office of the Investigation Department of the Salvation Army. We were all present: Miss Taylor, my wife, and Captain Atherton, a lady officer. Miss Taylor and I shook hands. She forgave me the debt and said she would take no further step. She did not put it in writing; I asked her to. I promised if ever I came into any money I would pay the money over, though I had been legally advised I was not liable. I was advised so by my father, who was formerly managing clerk to a firm of solicitors. My father told me that morally something ought to be done for the sake of the girl. He advised me that there was no false pretence. I understood that the warrant was withdrawn. They wanted me to bring up £3 10s. 6d. for the costs of withdrawing the warrant, as I understood. I was out of work at the time, and could not find the money, They told me if I could not get the money nothing would be done. I have not heard anything of the matter since, though I have occasionally met Miss Taylor since, but not to speak to her. I did not have so much as £30; it was £23 16s., and that I did not have for my own personal benefit. The man Edridge, by whom I was employed, had the money, and absconded, or is said to be dead "—he afterwards made a further statement, which Jennings took a note of—he was taken to the station and charged—before he made that statement I explained to him that the warrant had not been withdrawn, or else it would not have been in our possession, but he persisted in making the statement, and I said would write it down—I have examined the Rolls of Solicitors—I cannot find any record of Robert Edridge, except that which has been produced.</p>

Faithful and Sons, solicitors, of Thanet House, Temple Bar—I have known the prisoner from about 1887—I knew his father—I knew Robert Edridge—I often used to see Edridge and the prisoner about the Courts and in Chambers, but not together—I met the prisoner in September, 1900, when he ex<lb/>plained to me that he had commenced an action and obtained a verdict in a breach of promise of marriage case; that the costs had been taxed and he was about to issue a judgment summons to enforce the judgment; I asked him who the solicitor was and he said Mr. Robert Edridge—I said that Mr. Edridge had been dead for some time—I think at that time he had been dead about three months—he seemed astonished, and I said, "I think if I were you I would not do anything further in the matter "—he then left me.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—I was married to him seven years ago, I think on October 22nd, 1898—I do not remember dates, but about five years ago I was living at 18, Shelburn Road, Hollo<lb/>way—my husband was then acting as a solicitor's clerk—on two occasions I opened the door to the gentleman I understood to be the solicitor—my husband told me he was his principal, Mr. Edridge—his name was on a brass plate outside on the railings—we had three rooms on the first floor, a front room, a sitting room, and a kitchen—I remember seeing post-cards with the name of Edridge on, but I have looked for them and could not find them—I do not know what became of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been to South Africa and returned last February—I had then a little money—I was without employment—on April 7th, 1905, I saw this advertisement in the "Daily Telegraph ": "A City firm of auctioneers and land agents require a smart gentlemanly man to take charge of their offices. Security cash required. Address 'Reliable,' Horncastle's, Cheapside," and replied to it—I received this letter: "With reference to your application, kindly give us a call to<lb/>morrow (Saturday) at 11 a.m. and oblige, Tours faithfully, Howarth Bros, &amp; Co. "—the letter has this printed heading: "Howarth Bros. &amp; Co., Auctioneers and Surveyors, Land Agents and Valuers. Expert Mortgage Brokers. Managers to the Hayling Estate, Ltd. And at 317, Lake Road, Portsmouth, and Branches. 21, Bucklersbury, Bank, E.C. "—I called on April 8th at 21, Bucklersbury—I saw the name of "Howarth Bros, &amp; Co." up—there were two clerks in the office—I noticed auction bills stuck up round the office—I saw the prisoner—he asked me if I wished to accept this employment as clerk in his office at a salary of £2 a week and would I deposit £100 cash security for fidelity, as I should be handling sums of money—I asked him if he was doing a good sound business—he said he was; that he had branches at Portsmouth, Bristol, Leeds and Bradford—I asked him how long he had been estab<lb/>lished in business as an auctioneer—he said between eight and nine years "—I asked him what his financial position was—he said the debts of the establishment did not exceed £20—he said he would hold the security for me and repay it to me within one month of my leaving his service—</p>

"—I parted first with the £100 on his representations and with the £200 on his representation that he would get £1.000 on June 1st—I believed him to be a man of means and a man of high standing—I did not know that on the one occasion he had 14s. 6d. in the bank and on the other 19s. 9d.—I went on in the office—I found he was doing practically no business, that he was drawing cheques with nothing in the bank to meet them that the office rent had not been paid, so I said to him that he was not acting straight, that I believed his contracts he had were encumbered with debt and he had secured everybody else and left me in the lurch—he said, "You have been misinformed. I have £1.785 to come: your information is another wrong "—this was on August 28th—I do not at that time he had a contract in his possession at all—I lent him the £200 for a month on May 1st—I asked him for it back at the end of the month—he said, "This company has not gone to allotment yet;, the purchase is going to be completed on Monday "—when the Monday came it was to be on Friday and so on—this went on for months—when I did not get my money he offered me rooms in his house, which I ac<lb/>cepted—out of my salary he stopped the rent—I had food with him for a fortnight and paid him separately for that—I went on hoping against hope and believing him when he said it would be settled this day and that day—it never has been settled—I left him on September 11th—I consulted a solicitor and laid an information against him.</p>

I am secretary to Messrs Weeks &amp; Cooper, Ltd, manufacturers, at 22 and 23, Charterhouse Square—the prisoner was in their service as a foreman packer—it was my duty to keep the petty cash—I supplied the cash when articles were re<lb/>quired to be purchased by one of the directors or myself for the company for odd jobs such as screws, cases, mantles, fixtures, etc., the prisoner also superintended our gas engineers—on October 30th I gave him some money for the purchase of some screws—the practice was for him to give mean I.O.U. at the time, bring back the change, and exchange it for the I.O.U.—Exhibit 2 shows goods supplied to the amount of 2s. 11 1/2 d.—that invoice is in the prisoner's writing and in the same state as when I received it from him, and it bears his initials—Exhibit 6 is an invoice for burs, nuts, and screws that were wanted on November 23rd, when I gave him a sum of money for which he gave me his I.O.U.—it purports to show a payment by him of 2s. 4 1/2 d.—it is in exactly the same state as when I received it, bat it does not bear his initials—in the majority of cases he initialled the invoices, but there was no occasion for him to initial them at all; the firm's receipt was sufficient—I remember speaking to him about a month previous to October about a cabinet which we required to keep photographs In for our new models of goods, and I gave him two pieces of card of the exact size for what we wanted the drawers to contain—he said it would cost rather a high price—I asked him how much—he said £15s.," and I told him to get it made—he told me when it would be ready, and I gave £1 5t. on November 4th—he went for the cabinet on a Saturday, sad came back and told me it was not finished, and he went for it on tie Monday and brought back Exhibit 11—the cabinet was very satisfactory—I know the defendant's writing—this receipt for 25s. is his writing in pencil—I did not notice it at the time—it purports to be signed, "M. Eglash," as the cabinet maker—I did not know Mr. Eglash—Exhibits 5, 7, 8, and 9 are invoices which I have received from the defendant, and Exhibit 3 is a counterfoil—they are in exactly the same condition" which I received them, and bear his initials—Exhibit 4 is another invoice which I received from one of our lady clerks exactly in this state.</p>

These are the very things we are looking for "—he said, "I know nothing at all about them; someone must have put them there.

                  </hi>. I live at Swiss Cottage Gardens, Hackney, and am a labourer—on December 16th last I was at Bullimore's yard helping to clip a horse—the prisoner Smith held the horse's head—I did not see Bullimore at first; he came in afterwards—Walsh took part in the clipping afterwards—when the latter came in he brought a hone with him, which had no shoes on—he said, "That will be the next one you want to clip'—he put it into the stable—whilst there Detective Saunders came in and talked to Mrs. Bullimore—this was on December 16th—on Monday, December 18th, I was in Morpeth Road and saw Walsh leading a horse, one without shoes—I did not help to clip that horse—on Monday afternoon I went past the premises and heard the dipping machine going—I remember on the Saturday while I was there about 1 1/2 lbs. of steak was brought out by Walsh—I thought I saw it brought out from Bullimore's house, but cannot be sure—I had half of it and smith had the other—Walsh had none of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bullimore, in his defence on oath, said that he had bun a wheelwright for twenty years; that he did not himself use his stables, but let them; that he could neither read nor write; that Mrs. Bullimore let them for him to a man named Jones; that Smith and Walsh frequented Jones' stable and that a man named Burdett brought the carts found on his part of the premises to be repaired, altered and painted.</hi>

I am Buldmore's wife and I assist him in business as much as I can—we let the stabling—it was let first about six months ago to a Mr. Arnold, Morpeth Road—he went out and I then let it to a man who said his name was Jones—this is the rent book I gave him—I never saw the man after he took it—Walsh paid the rent—the stable never had a lock on it—last Christmas I had a bit of meat given to me to hang up by Walsh for him—my son did so—I never cooked any meat about December 17th or 18th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I told the police officers that I had bought the meat myself at Smithfield—that was not true—I did not know what I said when I had all those men in my place, which I never had before—my son is now in a convalescent home—we do not keep books—if there is any work to do I make a bill out and give it to my husband.</p>

               <p>I returned him the copy—I also met him at corners of streets—this has been going on down to shortly before these proceedings—I also did the same sort of work under an account which was described as the People's Music Publishing Co., upon Willetts' instructions—I used to deliver the blocks at 17a, Paternoster Row—I do not think any of the People's Music Publishing Co.'s work was delivered at cloak rooms—I also de<lb/>livered some blocks of(Nursery Rhymes' to Messrs.

(<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 24) was given me by Colbon with "Fisher &amp; Co." filled in as the payee's name, dated August 31st, 1906—this is a cheque given me by Wallace, dated May 30th, 1905, for £5: "Pay Mr. Bond or older," drawn at Parr's Bank, Fleet Street branch, and signed "W. Wallace" (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi>25)—I paid it into my banking account, which I had in the name of Lemaine, and it was returned to me "Payment stopped "—it was in part payment of my account—there was some difficulty in my getting paid in full for the work I did, and I was always mentioning to him about the amount due to me—he said that he could not get his money off the people that he was doing it for, and he was not able to pay me—I found out afterwards in an indirect way that he was doing the work for Willetts—Wallace, or Ross, mentioned incidentally, in connection with the work that "Fisher &amp; Co., of Walthamstow." was the name of the firm Willetts went by, and I saw many of these postal orders with "Fisher <hi rend="italic">k</hi> Co." on them—I had never much to say to him about it; I only saw him once a week when I tried to get the money; I do not remember anything definite as to what he may have said—he mentioned "Fisher &amp; Co." and Willetts, and what he had to say amounted to that Fisher &amp; Co. were Willetts—as far as I found out from him, Fisher &amp; Co. was the company Willetts was the one who gave the orders out on behalf of Fisher</p>

               <p>not later—he had been manager for Ross early in 1905—I knew Colbon had physical control of the <hi rend="italic">jiggers</hi> while manager for Ross—I entered into partnership with Ross's manager at a time when Ross was still print<lb/>ing, out I do not think it was a very shabby thing to do—I did not com<lb/>municate with Ross that I had done so, because it was none of his business; it did not affect him in any way—Ross mentioned to me a good many times that he wanted to give it up, and so did I, but we agreed to keep on as long as we possibly could, so that we could get the arrears due to us for my sake he said he would keep on with it—he said he wanted to give up taking the orders to print this particular music—when I had got my money I was going to give it up—it was with the idea of carrying it on financially that I took Colbon into the business, because if I stopped I lost my money—I was trying all the time to work up another connection and then drop the music—Colbon was taken on to work as a general printer—I think I first spoke to Ross about dropping this business about Christmas, 1904; I was on very friendly terms with him—I did not know any of the raiders before the raid—I did not know that Ross some time before the raid had handed over some plain direct to one of the publishers without making any <hi rend="italic">bones</hi> about it—I di not know that at the time Colbon entered into partnership with me Ross was giving up the contracts altogether; he wanted to give it up especially about that time—I should say the arrears in July were about £50, some of which was out of pocket—it was not very remunerative work, and that was why I wanted to give it up—I never approached Willetts with a view to getting the work done direct—I did not mean by saying, "I decided to take a place for myself and do it alone, and took a place at Featherstone Street," that I was going to do the work without a middle<lb/>man, direct with other people—I got nearly all my information as to Willetts and Fisher &amp; Co. from Colbon—during the time he was carting the paper in, some time between February and July, we discussed that it would be a great deal to our benefit to have the work direct from Willetts, but he said he would not act underhanded to Ross in that way, so things went on just the same as before; we would not think of it—the partner<lb/>ship was not in writing; it was to cover the whole of our printing trans<lb/>action—he did not provide any money—he shared in the profits of the music printing between July and September—the block of "Egypt" was handed to me after this partnership arrangement—I was printing it on and off right up to the end—there was some of the music and the blocks seized at the raid—the blocks were continually being changed—after the raid and between November I asked Colbon if he could find me any work to do through Willetts, as I had absolutely nothing to do—before the raid I swear it was never mentioned—at the meeting at the public-house with Willetts with reference to the raid, Colbon was there being concerned in it as my partner, and it also concerned him as Ross's manager—the contracts about which the raid had taken place were not at that time between Colbon and myself, and Willetts on the other hand—Ross was away on his holidays then; he was not present—I used to call round at Farringdon Street—I did not telephone Willetts, but Colbon did, to</p>

               <p>inquire for orders—this was a long time before July—I was calling there from the start for orders—before the partnership I asked to telephone Willetts for orders and there was no difference in my way of getting the orders after the partnership—when we met in the public-house on September 2nd, between 11 and 12 a.m., Willetts had no money, and the arrangement was that I was to meet Colbon later on, when he would give me the money—there was no reason for my men<lb/>tioning the 1s. postal order in my letter to Willetts; I had not sold it to Cooper when I wrote it—I saw Cooper two or three days after I wrote it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at North Finchley—I have done printing work for Puddefoot, first at Turnagain Lane, and after<lb/>wards at East End Road, Finchley, for three years—I printed music for him at both places and was doing that when the police came to East End Road in October, 1905, one of the pieces I was printing being "Ring Down the Curtain "—I have also printed "Rainbow" "Ora pro Nobis," "Angels Guard Thee," for all of which songs Puddefoot supplied me with the blocks, which, I believe, were called <hi rend="italic">jiggers</hi>—when the music was ready for delivery I packed it up and have upon some occasions gone with the carman who has taken it away—then it was left at the railway station cloak rooms, when I would get the cloak room ticket—I have been tine or four times with the carmen to King's Cross railway station and once to St. Paul's; I did not always go—I would give the cloak room ticket to Puddefoot—the <hi rend="italic">jiggers</hi> went with the music and were left at the cloak rooms—this document (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 29), which is in pencil, is in my hand<lb/>writing—it is a memorandum on which is "Angels Guard Thee," of which I printed 1, 000, "Dream of Paradise," 1, 000, "Star of Bethlehem," 1, 000, "Ora pro Nobis," 1, 000—I do not know what "Jinks" means I wrote it there because Puddefoot told me to do so—the memorandum refers to four lots of a thousand each, made up into eight bundles, which I was to deliver to the carman who came there by Puddefoot's instructions—he never mentioned the name of the man who would call, but the signature is "W. F. Brett," and I suppose he is the carman who signed for them—I was told on September 9th that a man would call on the 12th—I cannot remember any more directions being given me except that a carman would call—this is another memorandum in my writing, dated September 12th (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi>30) in which is ten parcels "Angels Guard Thee," "Dream of Paradise," "Ora pro Nobis," and "jigger Nos. 1 to 5 "—"Tiny Tim" I got from Puddefoot; I suppose it was another customer—the next one (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 31) is twenty-three parcels, and eleven parcels also for "Tiny Tim "—this js in my writing: "September 8th, 1905, 23 parcels. T. H. Gorro," and "eleven parcels, 6-9-05," but I cannot call to mind what that means—Gorro is the name of a carman—this (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 32) is in my writ<lb/>ing and begins, "Jenks delivers," which means delivered to Jinks—it gives amongst others "Star of Bethlehem," "Old Sweet Song," "Dream of Paradise," "Angels Guard Thee," nine bundles of 1, 000 each," and on the other side "Jinks jiggers," and then occur a large number of names of pieces of music and the number of <hi rend="italic">jiggers</hi> necessary for the printing of each of them—about seven of the names of songs are in Puddefoot's writing, hat the rest I wrote at his instructions—Exhibit 33 is written in pencil and says, "Tiny Tim delivered ten parcels 'Angels Guard Thee,' 'Dwarm of Paradise, 'Ora pro Nobis,' and jiggers Nos. 1 to 5," and on the other side "5, 000 No. 4 "—I do not know what "No. 4" is; it is scratched out here it is in Puddefoot's writing—the pieces of music were called by numbers—the <hi rend="italic">jiggers</hi> were numbered, so that if you wanted so many pieces of music of the number of a particular <hi rend="italic">jigger</hi> that is how you would identify</p>

Hobley and told him I wanted the van stopped and taken to the station—he went on one side of the road and I on the other—as I approached the van a man, whom I took for the man I had seen the night before, Bokenham, bolted round the corner as quick as he could go, leaving the carman and the van—my belief at the time was that he was Bokenham; he wore a bowler hat and a brown overcoat; that is all I could recognise—I and the constable took possession of the van and found it contained 20, 000 copies of pirated music, among them being a number of the "Orchid," selection, "Eileen Allannah," and "Sleep and Forget "—Bokenham was arrested on December 4th—I was with the police when they searched his premises at Cazenove Yard, where we found a number of blocks for printing music, among them being blocks for printing the there pieces I have just named.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corrector of the press and live at Lam<lb/>beth Grove, Lower Sydenham—I have known Willetts for some years; he has been called "The Colonel," "Mr. W.," "The King of Pirates," and "The Boss "—I have known him also as the chief representative of "Fisher &amp; Co. "—I never saw any other Fisher—perhaps I had better explain that he was called in the first place "Fishy "; that developed into "Fisher" and then into "Fisher &amp; Co., eventually becoming "Fisher &amp; Co., Ltd. "—in January, 1905, I went to see him at 17a, Paternoster Row, and said, "I hear you have started a new business. I am out of work. I should think you will want a traveller "—I called two or three times, as he said he had to consult someone else before he could give me an answer—he eventually gave me an appointment as a stock packer, saying the printers who were working for him had to deliver the work that they had done at certain places and that he was practically at their mercy, because they might charge him with a certain amount of work which was supposed to have been done and deposit a smaller amount—so far as I recollect, I commenced work on January 10th—the work I had to do was to meet the carman and to ride in his wagon to the various places where the printers had deposited the parcels of printed music every night, to collect them and to take them to the depots where the parcels were made up for despatch for each day's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080194"/>
               <p>orders—I saw that the parcels contained pirated music to a great extent, but always music—amongst the places from which I used to collect was a stable yard somewhere near James Street, Bloomsbury, which was called "The Cockpit," a depot at 6, Whitefriars Street, in the basement where a large amount was deposited each night by the printers, another one in Pemberton Row, Gough Square, Fleet Street, which we called "Pem<lb/>berton's," another one at a coffee house in Gravel Lane, Southwark, another one in a street which I cannot remember in Hoxton, two doors away from a board school, which we used to call "Pope's "—I visited about eight places altogether, I should think—the printer who deposited this music every night would leave a slip indicating the number of parcels that he had deposited and the contents of those parcels—I would take that slip and see that the parcels were there—they would then be put in the van and taken to the depot, where they would be made up into the various orders—from there the bulk of it was sent out by van loads to various railway termini to be dispatched to different parts of the country—in special cases some London middlemen used to come and fetch a few thou<lb/>sands on a hand barrow—this is an account of the wages I paid to these men who were employed there at the time (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 6), amongst them being Grace, Darcy, Dan, who was Frederick Tennant, George Ellis, and John Tennant, another brother of the prisoner—there was another man named "Bill," who it was understood was the brother-in-law of Tennant—I know Tennant, who was called "White Knob," George Wootton, who was called "George, the Carpenter," and Ross, who was known as "Wallace Ross "—Ross had things given him in the name of Andrews, but then was another man in his office named Andrews, so I really do not know which was which—I have seen Puddefoot at Paternoster Row—after I went there Tennant went for a holiday—a few days after I had been there Willetts called me into his private office at 17a, Paternoster Row, where I saw his legal adviser, Mr. Johnson, to whom he introduced me—Willetts told me they were going to start a company, and said, "You see, these constant fines that are being inflicted upon us in the Police Courts are getting too hot; we shall have to dodge them, so we have decided to form a limited liability company. When that is formed there will be no particular individual to sue, and the only thing they can do with as is to apply to the High Court for a compulsory winding up of the company and they will have to pay the whole costs of that. We shall not oppose, and the next day we start another company and keep on "—he did not tell me what business the company was to carry on, but referred ma to Johnson, saving, "Mr. Johnson is a lawyer and he knows all about it, and he will explain to you "; then Mr. Johnson explained to me just exactly what Willetts had already told me, and he said, "We are going to make you a trustee of this business first "—he had a document already prepared for me to sign, which I did sign at his request, by virtue of which I became trustee of the business—I was supposed to have bought the business from Tennant, for, I think, £600—the offices of the company were to be at 27, Clarendon Road, Hoe Street, Waltham<lb/>stow—Johnson asked me if I would read the manuscript through which</p>

               <p>he handed to me, and I read it through—I took very little interest in it—he said, "Now you understand that?" and I said, "Yes "—he said to Willetts, "Very well, we will have it typed, "—Willetts and myself then went and had a glass of beer at a public-house—he said to me, "You are stony broke one day, and now you are a secretary of a city company "—I said, "According to this document I am buying this business off Bill, You do not appear in it at all "—he said, "Oh, no; I must not appear in this at all. That is all right. Don't you trouble "—this is the typed document that I signed (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 146: <hi rend="italic">An agreement dated February</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1905, between Frederick Hymers &amp; James Fisher Co., Ltd., reciting that on <hi rend="italic">December</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st a provisional and preliminary agreement was made and entered into between William Tennant, trading as Fisher &amp; Co., and the said Frederick Hymers for the sale by Tennant of his music publishing business to Hymers as the trustee of the promoters of a joint stock company then in process of registration under the title of "Fisher &amp; Co., Ltd.," the price being</hi>£500 <hi rend="italic">for the stock-in-trade, and</hi>£100 <hi rend="italic">for the goodwill of the business, total</hi>£600)—I never went to Somerset House about this company at all—I see my name as secretary upon several of the documents in this file of James. Fisher &amp; Co., Ltd.—I signed the list of subscribes as the secretary, but all these documents where my name appears are not signed by me—the signature on the application for certificate of incorporation is mine, and I find my name among the names pf the subscribers signing as secretary of the company—article E of the memorandum of association states that the company is to be carried on for the purpose of a music distributing agency and to carry on the business of wholesale publishers and to deal in copyrights and rendering legal assistance to members against whom proceedings were taken for the alleged copyright music—I had not seen Johnson before he was introduced, to me by Willetts—the man who is on one of these documents as "Harry Clifton" I addressed as Andrews—I attended one meeting of the company, which was held in the back room of a tobacconist's shop, 41a, Farringdon Street, Ross's place—the regis<lb/>tered address of the company is 24, Clarence Street, Islington—Johnson, Wootton, Robinson, Ross and a man I addressed as Andrews were present—as to the ordinary secretarial duties of a company, I never performed any; I never had any books or anything of that kind;. I only answered two or three letters from customers—there was one book only at this meeting that I did attend, which Johnson took away—I never handled it at all, and what the contents of it were I do not know—I should say the company had no banking account, nor books of account—letters for Fisher &amp; Co. were always addressed to 27, Clarendon Road, Hoe Street, Walthamstow, Tennant's address, and they were brought from there direct to Willetts at Paternoster Row—whilst Tennant was away on his holiday "young Bill," his brother-in-law, used to bring them, but when Tennant was there he brought them—they were opened by Willetts, assisted by his lady typist—about seventy to one hundred were brought every day, most of them containing marked catalogues and music for the supplies required—they also contained postal orders, cheques Or stamps, and Willetts used to call upon his lady typist to draw up a list</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190601080196"/>
               <p>of the amounts sent in from each customer, and then he put the postal orders away in a drawer of his desk—he would then send the orders on by messenger to the different depots, where the parcels were made up, and such letters as required to be answered would be sent to me for answer<lb/>ing—the remainder of the letters were burnt; there was a daily bonfire-all of the letter contained money, as they all had to be prepaid—there was no list of orders made out—the marked catalogues were sent out, not the letters—somebody wrote on the marked catalogues the address to which the music was to be sent—the reason for sending the catalogues out with no prices was that the retailer could charge what he chose for the songs—after the marked catalogues had been sent out and executed they would be destroyed—it was a fluctuating business, but from the order I have seen they amounted to about £30 to £70 and over each day; that is for orders received by postal orders, not for private cash orders—the price for 100 for small orders like a few hundreds was 9s. for a twelve-page piece of music, 6s. for others, and 3s. for others, and the price to large dealers, middlemen, who would deal with many thousands every day, was 8s., 5s., and 2s. 6d.</p>

To a large extent Miss West cashed the postal orders, and those that were not cashed Willetts would take to pay printing bills and such like things—this is the stock book that I kept (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 6)—the system was to take one of the catalogues, and cut it up and paste it in this book and by the side of each piece of music to keep a record of the number of parcels of music in stock at each particular depot, and each day to mark off the number of parcels of music that were taken away from that depot, the difference being the stock on hand—the number "6" against the first catalogue under "Stock" means that there were six parcels, of that particular piece of music in hand at that depot<lb/>parcel represented sometimes 1, 000 sheets of music and sometimes 500—the sheets were unfolded, in the flat—a ream is 480 sheets—if it were a piece of music of eight sheets it would be two sheets to the piece—I kept in this book a record of the stock that went out to people who had ordered from different parts of the country—"Duff' is the name of a depot at Duff Street—"Cockpit" is the name of another depot in Cockpit Yard—"Whitefriars" was at No. 6, Whitefriars Street—"Mann" is another depot, called so because the name of the printer was Mann—it was in Great New Street at the back of Fetter Lane and the depot "Mann" was at a coffee house in Gravel Lane, Southwark, where he de<lb/>posited the music to be fetched away—the next one is called "Pope "—he had one or two places—this place I went to was in a street in Hoxton, of which I cannot remember the name; there were two places in the same street—there is another depot that I called "Andrews,' the name by which I first knew Ross—his depositories were at 6, Whitefriars Street, White<lb/>friars, and 3, Pemberton Bow, Gough Square—afterwards I knew the man whom I addressed as "Andrews" as Rosa, and I concluded that the other

               <p>man was his partner, therefore I addressed him as "Andrews "—every day whilst I was employed I kept a record at the other end of this book of the payments made to the men—to take a specimen day, Saturday of the first week: "Grace, 3s.; Taylor, is.; George, 4s.; Charlie, 5s.; Dan, 15s.; John, 5s.; Bill, 2s.; and so on; these were men employed to collate the orders, to parcel them up and despatch them—I used to take this to Willetts every time I went to 17a, Paternoster Row, and every Saturday night to get the wages—when I became secretary of the company Willetts told me that if anybody came and asked who was in charge of the particular place I was to say that I was, but I was never inside any of the places when they were raided—I believe it was done by surprise always—every day any reports that had to be sent to Willetts were sent by telephone from the nearest public telephone—in the case of a raid the routine would be to go to the nearest public telephone and 'phone through to him, "The red light is up at" so and so, wherever it might be—I have been at the other end when the message has been sent—as regards the raid at Boundary Row, which was in charge of all these men whose names I have got down as receiving wages, I went out from there to get some change for some gold and as I was coming back, having met Grace, we met Dan, who said, "Don't go near; the red light is up "—we went straight to a telephone office and sent a message through to Willetts at Paternoster Row; Grace conducted the conversation because I was unused to it—these people whose names I have mentioned all gravi<lb/>tated to the Elephant and Castle, Stoke Newington—Wootton came down afterwards from Paternoster Row and told us to wait there some time and we would have a further message—or of these men was sent to Paternoster Row by his direction—I knew that there was a van load of goods coming from Duff Street, Poplar, to Boundary Row just about this time, because the carman who brought the first batch of goods early that morning drove back to Poplar to fetch the other lot—Grace and I intercepted him, Grace saying, "The red light is up. Turn back. You know where to go "—I have been present twice at these meetings in public-houses, on both of which occasions Willetts was present—as to the Boundary Row raid, he made arrangements for us to meet him at a public-house in Thames Street that evening—I there received instructions from him to meet Jack, the carman, at the usual place the next morning, as usual, and he would show me where the fresh place was—I carried out his instructions—I remember a raid at Larkhall Lane about February 15th or 16th, during which week Tennant returned—on the following day I met Willetts and Tennant at the Black Swan—Willetts said that there had been three very heavy raids recently and he and Bill thought that someone had been putting them away; he said, "I am going to send back all the postal orders that we have received this morning and tell them we are going to stop business for a month "—he was going to pay off ail the hands and he suggested that I should get a situation and go away into the country—he said, "Have you got any papers belonging to us with you?"—I handed him a paper with the names and addresses of all these men on it; that is all I had on me—I had taken the names</p>

Can you trace it? 'Telegraphed' seems to be a bit strange "—I sent that to Willetts' office for Tennant to answer, as he had not gone away then—I think it most probable that I wrote that note on the envelope (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 113, <hi rend="italic">read: Enclosing money for music and catalogues, and stating that it was bad enough for them to pay</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d. while other wholesalers paid</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that they knew of another pirate king at Leeds who could supply them with songs at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a hundred; that if they were not supplied with all they asked for they would go to Leeds at once.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HEAD</hi>. I have been engaged as a corrector of the press together with journalism for about seventeen or eighteen years—my profession it is not usual to get characters; it is possible to get one if it is applied for, but so far as I am concerned I never troubled about it—before joining Willetts I was with Wyman's eight months—my wages with Willetts were £2 a week—I left him on February 16th or 18th and the first interview I had with anybody connected with the Pro<lb/>secution would be with Mr. Goodman in the latter part of July; I have had four or five interviews with him, I suppose—I should say I have met 1 dozen, probably, of the raiders, but I have never given them any in<lb/>formation in connection with this case—I never met them before they raided, but since Willetts' arrest—I have discussed the prosecution in general with them—I gave information to Mr. Goodman both before and after Willetts' arrest; I wrote out for him the evidence I have given to-day—I have received nothing for it; on each occasion when I lost time to attend an interview with him I received a small sum—I cannot tell you the amount, but if he had asked me the value of my lost time I have laid something like half a sovereign—I got about £3 altogether—I acquiesced when asked at the Police Court if it was about 30s. or 35s.; they were trivial sums I received, at any rate—when working at Paternoster Row I imagined I was doing something morally wrong—it did not occur to me that I might possibly be standing in the dock; I did not know it was illegal—I have committed no criminal act—I gave information to Goodman because I understood that some action was to be taken, but whether it was a civil or a criminal action I had no idea whatever until I saw the announcement in the evening paper of Willetts' arrest—it was never suggested to me personally that I might find myself in the dock—to the best of my recollection the last time I saw Willetts to speak to was in a public-house in Newgate Street a few weeks before his arrest—I</p>

I had one discussion about the com<lb/>pany when Willetts and Johnson were present—Johnson showed me a card with his employer's name, Mr. Angel or Angia, of 10, Swan Street, Piccadilly, with his own name in the corner—the last time I saw him was at Bow Street—he was a plausible sort of man; he told me he had</p>

I am a box manufacturer and have known Willetts over twenty years—I have been in his employment on various occasion, the last time being at 17a, Paternoster Row, last August, having been there from August, 1904—I first entered his employment at 102, Compton Passage, Clerkenwell, late in 1903—he took me on to pack parcels, as I was

               <p>better see Tennant—I saw Tennant and he told me the best thing I could do was to go and see Mr. Johnson and the other side, meaning Willetts, and see what they could do for me; he would have nothing whatever to do with it—he meant by "the other side" that Willetts took a part in the management of various things which Tennant used to leave to him and that came under Willetts' management—I was told by one of the men that when a place was raided where I was employed to go to a public-house next morning, where I met Willetts and Tennant—I was told with the others to wait for a few days until they got another place to give us some<lb/>thing to do, and we were drafted off to this place, wherever it was—Tennant gave me instructions to go to the fresh place; then the same business went on there until that was raided—I became One of the signatories of James Fisher &amp; Co., Ltd.—I did not pay for my share, nor did I get a share certifi<lb/>cate—I attended one meeting of the company at Ross's shop in Farringdon Street, at which Ross, Wootton, and Johnson were present—Puddefoot passed through the place; he did not stay there a second—after that meeting the business went on just the same—I took orders both from Willetts and Tennant both before and after this meeting—when I was at Paternoster Row in 1904 and 1905 Tennant used to bring in the money, chiefly in postal orders, and give it to Willetts, that was the same before as after the company—I was paid 5s. a day sometimes by Willetts and some<lb/>times by Tennant, and there was no difference as to that after the company.</p>

After the raid at 5, Bentley Road, I asked Willetts if he could keep me on—very nearly about that time he said he could not—he told me to look for a place suitable for work in the pirate music line and then he would give me something to do—I found George Mews and told him—I was at Paternoster Row all the time Hymers was engaged there; I do not know what he managed or what he done—I believe he was engaged to look after the stores—the man who paid 11s. for a week for George Mews was the previous tenant and not Tennant—I never paid anything out of my own pocket; I was only a packer—after the raid it was to Tennant I went first, and he referred me to Willetts—at 17a, Paternoster Row, my place was presumably in the shop—when Tennant came down with the money the letters had been opened no doubt at Clarendon Road, his place and the money and letters were brought down to Willetts—whatever did take place with regard to them took place in the inner office, and I would not have a very good oppor<lb/>tunity of seeing.</p>

I am employed by the Music Publishers' Associa<lb/>tion for the purpose of tracing persons employed in musical piracies, and have been so employed for some time past—I was present on June 9th and 10th, 1903, at 102, Compton Passage, when on June 9th over 3, 000 and on June 10th 16, 000 pieces of music were seized—I had been watching those premises for several days previously and had seen Willetts, Tennant, a man named Ellis, called "Tum-tum," and a man named Chapman there—the music seized was taken to King's Cross Road police station and summonses were taken out against Fisher &amp; Co.—I was present when a van was stopped in Lever Street, St. Luke's, on September 29th, 1903, Willetts being in charge of it with another man whom I did not recognise—when the van pulled up at the house "Tum-tum" came out in his shirt sleeves and started unloading—I requested Constable Bradstreet to seize the music, and he did so—I asked Willetts his name and he said, "You know me "—he was asked his name several times, but he abused us and refused it—I then said to him, "You are Willetts, alias Fisher "—he did not answer, but walked away—the van was taken to the station and the music left there—nobody claimed it—I was present at a raid at Pool Street, Hackney, on October 19th, 1904—a week previously I had Seen Tennant, Albert Grace, known as "Long 'un," Frederick Tennant, whom I know as "Dan," John Tennant, whom I know as "Long</p>

               <p>John," Anderson, "Jack, the Rabbit," and a van boy, whom I understood was Tennant's brother-in-law, frequenting the premises—237, 728 copies of music were seized, taken to the station and left there; no order was applied for—an action brought by Tennant in respect of that musk is still pending—the next raid at which I was present was at Boundary Row, Walworth, on January 28th, 1905, when about 114, 000 copies of music were seized; no order was applied for and they have not been claimed—on the night of January 27th I was outside when Wootton asked me what I was after and I told him pirated music—he said, "You will find none there. I am the landlord of those premises and I forbid you to touch them "—I asked him to let us in and he refused, saying, "I have got the keys," and he walked away—later in the evening I saw a man, whom I know now to be Johnson, come and put an extra lock on the door—Wootton was with him—Johnson said to Abbott, who was by my side, I believe in Wootton's hearing, that he represented his clients, Fisher and Co., and said something about taking an action against Abbott if any forcible entry was made—on January 31st I was present at a raid at Ormond Yard, Theobald's Road—we could not get in for an hour and a half—on getting inside we found Grace, Frederick Tennant, and John Tennant and about 200, 000 copies of music torn in half—there were also several thousands of songs, of which the copyright had run out, not torn up—while we were waiting to get in, "Jack, the Rabbit" drove up with another man in a van containing 11, 000 copies of pirated music which were seized and left in custody of the police, no proceedings being taken—I was present on July 27th, when a raid was made on Bentley Road, Dalston, when 287, 000 copies of pirated music were seized—while waiting to get in, Bokenham came up and spoke to me with another man named Pope, a carman—he let himself in with a key—he said that we could have what there was in the bottom stable, but the upstairs did not belong to him and we should not be allowed to touch that—we found the pirated music both in the stables above and below, and there was also some in a van locked up in the coach-house, on which was the name. "Pope, 4, Stafford Mews "—we had to persuade Bokenham an hour and a half before he would let us in—an order was applied for at the North London Police Court against Wootton and the music was ordered to be destroyed—on various dates before and after the raid I saw Tennant come in and out of the yard at the back of those premises—I was present on August 10th, when George Mews, Holloway, was raided, and about 112, 000 copies of music were seized—a summons was taken out against a man named Robinson, who was on December 1st ordered to pay twenty-eight guineas, or one month, after about seven remands—music was ordered to be destroyed—Robinson opened the door to us on that occasion, and later on Frederick Tennant and "Jack, the Rabbit," arrived, all of whom I had seen frequenting the premises—I sent agents to raid the printing works of Dobson &amp; Co., Cazenove Yard, on August 17th, but I was not present—when watching those premises previously, I had seen Bokenham and Clark going in there—the name of the business is up, "Dobson &amp; Co.," and there is also a plate above that, which I saw at a later date with the</p>

               <p>name of Bokenham on—on August 18th he rang me up and said that no doubt I had heard of his being raided, and asking me to make an appoint<lb/>ment to see him, which I did—I saw him the following Monday at the Castle public-house with Clark, his partner—they wanted to know how I might avoid taking the summons against them for the destruction of the music, because they had not any money; that they were working for the "Colonel" and he would not help them out of their trouble, and that if I insisted on the summons, as they had not any money they would have to do time—I told them I would lay the matter before my superiors and let them know later—I did so, and no proceedings were taken against them—before Bokenham left he said they were going to see Willetts; that there was going to be a b—row and he would like to see Willetts lose his lot—on their leaving I pointed them out to Wilson, an agent, who followed them—I was present at a raid on August 23rd at Duff Street, Poplar when over 6, 000 copies of music were seized, which were left at the police station, and remained there unclaimed—on the next day Bokenham rang me up and asked me about the raid at Duff Street—he said, "I hear you have done Harry "—I said, "Who is Harry?" and he said, "You know; Duff Street "—he inquired how many <hi rend="italic">jiggers</hi> we had got, and I told him I did not know, as I had not counted them—he asked me why I did not say it was coming off, and I replied, "I did not know it was coming off so soon," and asked him if he had seen the "Colonel," meaning Willetts—he said, "Yes, and serve him b—well right "—I was present at a raid on September 1st at 39, Featherstone Street, the place of Bond, a printer, when 260, 000 copies of music and twenty complete sets of blocks were taken to the station and detained there—the blocks were given to Chappell &amp; Co.—no summons was taken out—a few hours previously to this I was present at a raid on the Earl Printing Works, Earl Road, Bermondsey, when I saw "The Long 'un" and Dan and several other men whom I did not know—previously to raiding the premises we seized a van load with 15, 000 copies of music that was coming away from the Earl Printing Works—we then seized at the works 75, 000, and a number of catalogues and printed en<lb/>velopes—on September 29th I was present at a raid at 34 and 35, Kirby Street, where 9, 000 copies of music were seized and taken to the station—no summons was taken out—on October 7th I was present at a raid at Milton House, East End Road, Puddefoot's premises, where some 2, 300 odd copies of pirated music were seized and five sets of blocks—Puddefoot and Donovan, who was printing "Ring Down the Curtain" and "Rainbow," were present—this is a printed schedule of music, which was found at different depots (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 107) made by me, in the first column of which there are names of a number of songs of which these are the cer<lb/>tificates of the copyrights (<hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> 65 <hi rend="italic">to</hi> 106, <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the list relates ex<lb/>clusively to the songs of Chappell &amp; Co., about 300, 000 copies.</p>

It is a list of songs with the approximate number found at each of the raids I have mentioned—the first raid at Pleasant Grove, mentioned in the list, I was not present at; I only speak as to those at which I was present—when we make an application we attach a blue list to the order and also the information—when the order</p>

               <p>is granted the blue list is taken by the officer to execute the order and he works from that list of songs—it is a full list of copyright songs, so that the officer knows which is pirated—as the songs are found the list in marked with the number found, and that is produced at the Court when the defer<lb/>dants are summoned to show cause why the music should not be destroyed; we then prove the copyrights—we never carry away songs at raids that turn out to be legitimate—I did not say at the Police Court that we once took away 10, 000 copies of music to which it was afterwards ascertained we had no claim; I said I left about 10, 000 copies of "Himalaya Maid" at Finchley—I cannot say there are other people engaged in piracy other than the prisoners—I have met a lot of their friends at times—I did know the name of Penny &amp; Co.—they were engaged in piracy business years ago—after Chappell &amp; Co. obtained an injunction against them, eighteen months ago, they ceased business—he was what we call a door-to-door man; not a wholesale man—I have never spoken to Willetts in my life—I do not know anything about the practice of registration—I have been engaged in the musical world twelve or fourteen years—I believe Francis Day &amp; Hunter brought out a 6d. edition of music as long as twenty or thirty years ago, which has since been pirated—the 6d. edition is sold in the street as cover for the piracy—you can buy perfectly legitimate music for 1d.—I cannot say about it being copyright—the 6d. edition of Francis Day &amp; Hunter is copyright, and they are sold sometimes by hawkers for 3d.</p>

Bokenham told me he would not get paid by Willetts for the music which had been seized, but that was not his chief complaint—this was after August 21st, when I had an interview with him and Clark in the Castle public-house—on August 21st he made out that he was <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> with Willetts, but I did not believe it, because I saw him in company with Willetts a few days afterwards, drinking—he was working with him the whole time and going on with this business—I do not know that he issued a writ against him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Bokenham told me he would give up printing copy right music, and now that he had lost his lot Willetts would not give him any further work—later on he told me that he had seen Willetts, who had asked him to find a fresh place to go on with, but he had not done so—I thought he was sincere at first, and that is why I endeavoured to stop the summons against him—while these proceedings were going on at the Police Court he was printing pirated music—about 75 per cent. of Francis Day &amp; Hunter's 6d. edition of songs has been pirated.</p>

The raid on Puddefoot's premises in August, 1904, was what I referred to when I reminded him that he had been previously found guilty—Abbott and Cooper would have as good an opportunity of hearing all that was said on this occasion as I had—I cannot say positively that I showed my report to Abbott two or three days after; I mentioned the purport of it to him—I am positive I showed it to Cooper—I think I said at the Police Court that I mentioned the purport of my report to Abbott (<hi rend="italic">Extract from witness's deposition read</hi>: "<hi rend="italic">I showed my report to Abbott within two or three days of the conversa<lb/>tion before I sent it off to Mr. Becher</hi> ")—I have thought over it since I gave my evidence at the Police Court to clear it up in my mind—I do not think I saw Abbott's—I think Mr. Becher read it to me at his office—I said at the Police Court to the best of my belief I had seen Abbott's.</p>

Chappell &amp; Co., Ltd., instructed the solicitors in this prosecution through their Board—I was not the mouth piece altogether—I have certainly had many interviews with our solicitors—I know many Martins in this piracy business—James Martin has never been in our employ—a Mr. Martin called upon our solicitors; I cannot say his initials; I simply understood that it was a Mr. Martin and it was not his proper name—he professed to give some information as to pirated music depots—the solicitors discussed the matter with him and they can inform you of the arrangement come to—generally speaking, the arrangement was in consideration of his giving certain information, his services would be recognised, but I have not the particulars of that recogni<lb/>tion here—he came forward as many others have done and offered to give information for £50—I handed him over to our solicitors, who promised to give it to him if what he promised to do was forthcoming, but that has never been done and he has not been paid—we had a perfect right to do that—that was almost an isolated case.</p>

We did not expect the business to pay to start with—we have an all-round season—the pantomime season affects some classes of songs, such as "Looping the Loop with Lucy," which was sung in sixty-eight pantomimes and thus was popularised—as the result of that it was sung at al fresco and pierrot entertainments at the seaside afterwards—round the crowds at the pierrots on the sands you would find pirates selling it—I had agents to sell it where it was being sung—we cater as much for pierrots in the summer season as we do for the winter—very often a song sells better at al fresco entertain<lb/>ments than it does in the pantomime season—when we bought "Looping the Loop with Lucy" on October 8th, 1902, it was being sung by Miss Florrie Ford at the music halls, and she subsequently sang it at a pan<lb/>tomime—it would not be sung in sixty-eight pantomimes the next year, but I do not think by the following October it would have had its day—I do not suggest that songs like "I Could Do, Could Do, Could Do with a Bit" are still popular, but then "Paddle Your own Canoe," which was sung forty years ago, is asked for yet—I do not think that is an excep<lb/>tional song—it is a popular style of song, as is "Looping the Loop with Lucy "—the certificate which I produce does not show the assignment of the author to us.</p>

I have been a warehouseman, but I am now an engineer—I was a member of the Victoria Temperance Loan and Invert<lb/>ment Society—it was not registered—it consisted of 120 members—each member could hold as many as four shares to each book—he could have more than one book—the subscription was 6d. a week on each share—the members met every Saturday night at Thome's coffee house, Wood<lb/>grange Road, Forest Gate—the prisoner was the treasurer and his son secretary—the society has been in existence about eight years—the prisoner and his son had held those positions all the time—the prisoner</p>

None of his family, or anybody at Forest Gate have seen or heard of him since "—he was questioned whether he had gone abroad, and he said he did not know, and after some more questions the matter was left to an investigation committee—the prisoner produced this balance sheet—it shows at the bottom of it that the prisoner is responsible for £269 5s. 9d.—he also produced in oath £24 6s. 1d., which where the takings of the last week—I was ap<lb/>pointed on the committee of investigation, which met the next day—the prisoner attended and said he had another £2 3s. 3d., which he said belonged to some member who had not come for his money the week before—he said he had forgotten the name—he was asked, among other questions, did he know the duties of treasurer? was he a paid treasurer? and was he not in debt on the sharing-out night the Christmas before to some considerable amount? and he said, "Yes "—that meant Christ<lb/>mas, 1904—he did not say how much he was then in debt—he said he had borrowed that money from a friend to pay it back—we asked him if he had seen the bank book—he said, "Yes, in August, 1905, on my son's table," but that he never took the precaution of opening it—he was asked how his son had got it out of the bank, but he made no answer—he did not say in what name the money had been banked in 1904, but we found out that it had been banked in Walter Symons' name—we asked him how much money he had borrowed in 1904, and he said about £70—we asked him how it was paid back, and he said it was paid out of Walter Symons' purse—Walter Symons was an insurance collector—we also asked him if he knew that Walter Symons' furniture had been removed from his address, and when he saw him last, and he said he saw him on the Thursday before the Saturday of the last paying-in night, December 7th, I believe—that is all I remember being said at the committee—as a member of the society I had had a loan in August after waiting a fortnight for it—he gave me no explanation of my having to wait—he had not said anything during the year as to where the money was.</p>

I am a commercial clerk—I held four shares in this loan club—I paid 2s. a week—the club met every Saturday at Thorne's coffee room, from 7.30 to 9 p.m., for the purpose of taking the members' money and granting loans—the prisoner's son took the money—he handed it to his father, and then initialled the book—I was present on the sharing-out night on December 19th, when the prisoner said his son had absconded with the money—he produced this sheet of blue paper, and handed his books to me when I asked him for them—they are the day book, ledger, and the I.O.U. book (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); they are properly kept by the secretary—a check secretary, a trustee, and a committee-man named Rawlins checked the ledger, which was made up from the day book—the treasurer entered the amounts in the day book when he re<lb/>ceived them—the balance sheet has not taken in the full amount, but it is approximately correct—it does not include the dividend paid out, nor the interest that the members paid—about £33 has to be added, including what was due for fines and that sort of thing—the difference would make the amount about £300 for the 237 shares of the 120 members—I was present when the prisoner made a statement to the committee and was questioned as to his duties, as to his handing the money to his son without authority, and if anyone gave him that authority, and he said, "No "—he was questioned further about the bank book, and he said he had not seen it except once casually at his son's house in August, 1905, when he did not take the trouble to look at it—no order was given as to the money being banked, but the members' impression was that it was in the bank—he acknowledged it was in the bank, but when he was questioned as to what bank, he could not give us the name; he gave us to understand that his son had put it in the bank and kept the bank book—he said that he had borrowed about £75 to make up the deficiency for 1904—5—and that in 1903-4 he had borrowed, to make up a deficiency, but he did not say how much that was—he said he knew that he had gives the money to his son, but he never gave us any satisfactory answers—he would not reply to some questions—we have gathered since that he had borrowed £60—he told us that he had banked part of it in 1904 in the three different names of his son, his son's wife, and that of Mr. Rawlins' at the Post Office in Catherine Road, East Ham—I am not sure, but I think there is proof of that—he was asked, "You knew of this, and still trusted your son with the monies?"—he said he did not know—he was asked how long things had been going wrong, and he said two or three years—we said, "You knew things had not been going straight for two or three years?" and he said, "Yes "—the books were supposed to be audited by a committee—they did not do it—I asked a trustee if he had looked into it, and he said that about six months ago a committee had been appointed, made up of the son, the treasurer, a trustee, and one</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner frankly owned he had been grossly careless—the check book was kept by the trustee who called himself the check secretary—that was always Mr. Rawlins—he said this balance sheet had been made up from the members' cards—the prisoner met us every week—at first he said the money was banked, but when questioned still further he said he could not tell us—both the secretary and the treasurer were sitting at the same table when the money was paid to the secretary, who noted it on the member's card and the money was passed on to the prisoner—I cannot say whether he passed it back to his son—it was not handed back to him that I saw—when a member wanted a loan the matter was put into the hands of the treasurer.</p>

I did not see him. On coming back again to get on the tram I kicked against a piece of paper. I picked it up and found two 2s. pieces in it, which I found were bad. Coming along the road, as I was so hard up, I gave my wife one and said to her, 'Go and get some cakes.' She went into a confectioner's shop on the left-hand side. When she came out she said, 'They told me it is a bad coin. What did you want to give it to me for?' I said to her, 'I did not know it was bad,' hut that was a lie. We then walked down the</p>

He said, 'That will be a <hi rend="italic">bob</hi> a-piece for us.' After that we came back to Forest Gate, had a drink at the Fox and Hounds, near Forest Gate station We then walked up the road to the archway, when we were arrested. On the way to Forest Gate I gave the other man one of the bad coins. He went into one or two shops, and whether he passed them or not I do not know. He only left me a minute when the police officers came along. When he came out of the shops he told me he could not pass them. On second consideration there must have been three coins in the paper I picked up, as I gave the other man one and had two myself. Anything my wife has done in this matter she is entirely innocent of. She had no knowledge that the coin was bad, and only went into one shop "—when I first saw the female prisoner she had this basket and the two bags in it, and I took possession of it—one is a bag bearing the name of Barton and containing two scones and some crumpets, and the other a bag containing tapioca—as I took the buns out of the basket she said, "Those are what I got at a shop up the road"—with reference to the tapioca she said, "I got that from a shop at Bow just after we came out. I do not know the name of the street or the name of the shop "—I said to her, "Yes, we have been watching you for over an hour, and we know very well where you called "—I spoke from what I had been told—she then said, "Well, it is no good telling lies. I suppose you know where I got that from (pointing to the tapioca). My husband gave me another 2s. piece up at Manor Park, and I got 1/2 lb. of tapioca for 1 1/2 d., and they gave me 1s. 10 1/2 d. change "—she made that statement after the male prisoner had made his—as soon as I had finished writing the male prisoner's statement I read it to the female prisoner, who said, "That is quite true "—I then commenced to take the things out of the basket, when she said, with reference to them, what I have already stated—she then made this statement, which I took down in writing (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>): "I have heard the statement my husband has made and signed.

                  </hi>. I am carman to the last witness and live at 5, Gundulf Street, Kennington—on December 23rd I saw my master and handed him 11s. 1 1/2 d.; that was change out of a sovereign—I saw the prisoner and two others talking to him—when I came up I said to the prosecutor, "Here is your change, sir "—the prisoner then said, "You have some money now; we want some beer. I want a shilling; if we don't get it we shall snottle you "—with that he struck him on the head—one of the others struck him behind the head—I was struck on the jaw—my master was knocked nearly senseless—I picked him up—I did not what went out of his pocket—the men ran away—on Christmas morning</p>

               <p>the prisoner came up to me and said, "I hear you have prosecuted me "—I said, "I don't wish to say nothing to you at all; you had better get about your business"—he said, "Well, me and my gang will see you're all right "—he walked away.</p>
