The prisoner and another woman ran against me, and asked me to treat them—I said, "No"—they asked me repeatedly to go with them—I would not—they let me go, and I missed my purse and money—I found it in the prisoner's hand—there was about 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in silver, in it—I gave it, and the prisoner, to a policeman, who was just crossing the road.</p>

I had a shop at Woolwich—the prisoner was in my service as shopman in London, and afterwards at Woolwich—he left in the middle of Dec.—this silk and linen are my property—I saw them both safe in my stock at Woolwich on the last Sunday in Nov.—the prisoner was then in London—he arrived in Woolwich about three hours after I left there—I did not see him arrive—he had been three separate times in my service, and the last time he was with me four months, nearly—these two pieces of tape are mine—they were found at the prisoner's lodgings; they have my writing on them—these things were all kept at Woolwich—I know this ribbon; it should have been in the indictment.</p>

I had a petticoat and shawl hanging on a line in the yard—I saw them safe about five o'clock—about eight I saw the prisoner in the yard—I bad a candle in my hand, and I am certain she is the woman, I was about two yards from her—I went into the passage, shut the street-door, and gave an alarm—when I did so, the prisoner rushed through the passage, opened the street-door, went out, and held the door in her hand—Sarah Turner came down and took hold of the door inside—the prisoner let go, and we went out and took her about two yards from the door—I went into the yard, and found the petticoat and shawl down in the corner of the yard where the prisoner had been standing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. William Brayley Wedlake. On Saturday afternoon, 20th Jan., I saw the prisoner in my master's yard, about five o'clock; he was driving six: ducks and a drake, belonging to my master—he bad no business to drive them—I knew him, and am sure it was him—I went to the top of the yard, and saw him leave the yard with something under his smock-frock—I said, "What have you got there?"—he made no answer, but went on—I went back to the yard in about five minutes, and missed the drake—I went to the privy, which is in the yard, and found there some blood and feathers—the prisoner came into my master's tap-room in about two hours and a half afterwards—the police<lb/>man was fetched, and he was given in charge—he was searched, and I saw some feathers under his frock, and some blood on his shirt—those feathers looked like the feathers of my master's drake—I heard the prisoner</p>

There was a question raised whether or not the second count of the indictment was sufficient, and the point was fully argued before the tribunal which is now appointed to determine questions of this sort, and the Judges, afler taking time to consider, pronounced judgment, that for the reasons which they then assigned, the indictment was sufficient to justify the passing sentence upon you; because, although in point of form the indictment would certainly have been better if it had stated the child to be of tender years, and incapable of maintaining itself; yet, inasmuch as the indictment did state that by your unlawful act of exposing; the child, in consequence of it, died, the Judges are of opinion that that averment could only be supported at the trial before the Jury, by proving that when you exposed the child, you exposed it under such circumstances as that the 
death necessarily and reasonably followed from that act of exposure, which it would not have done if the child was not of such tender years as to be unable to walk away, and take care of itself. Therefore, after the verdict of the Jury, we think we are bound to presume that inasmuch as the indictment stated that the child died of the exposure, it died of the exposure under circumstances in which it would not have died if it had not been of tender years.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am superintending president of the London district post-office. The prisoner has been about three years employed as an auxiliary letter-carrier under the Stratford post-office, and was so in Sept. last—he applied to me, and in consequence of his father's services he was appointed—he was paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I think his duty commenced about seven in the morning, and he finished about twelve or half-past at noon—on 18th Sept. I received by post a letter, containing some pieces of paper, amongst them were the two letters to Miss Moffatt and Miss Kydd—this is the cover—it was posted in East Smithfield—there is a great deal of pencil writing upon the papers—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "I broke the key, <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi>; I thought it was gold when I opened the letter; I have been in the office some years, and was honest a long time, but I shall not be so <hi rend="italic">no</hi> more for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. shillings a week.

               <p>that auxiliaries want more money. I am short of money this week; I roust have some too, Sir. This is one of my complaints; fire tells no tales"—on 28th Nov. I received another letter by the post, enclosing the fragments of five envelopes of post letters—the addresses were cut out—this was amongst them (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "If you remember I sent you a polite note some time ago about a latter direçted 'Walthamitow,' which was mis-sent to me, <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi>, and now I have sent two, Mr. Smith.

                  </hi>. I am an officer attached to the post-office. On 6th Sept. I took the prisoner into custody—I searched him, and found a door<lb/>key on him—I asked him several times where he lived, and he said he would not tell me—I went to 20, Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, to the back room, first floor, and with the key which I had found on the prisoner I opened the door—there was nobody in the room—I searched, and found some letters and papers, two buttons, and a seal, which I produce—I have applied the button to the seal of the letter addressed to Mrs. Girt, and it corresponds—I afterwards told the prisoner that I had been to 20, Lambeth-street, to the first floor back room—he said that was his lodging—I took him to Bow-street station, and told him I charged him with stealing a letter containing a key, and he would be charged with stealing other letters—he said he knew nothing about the letter containing the key, or the other letters, but the letter I found at his house he could not deny—I showed him the letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The whole is a vile, abominable conspiracy, and the parties implicated in it have done it from feelings of envy and malice; I was appointed between two and three years ago to assist a letter-carrier named Keasley, on the East Ham Branch; on 1st. Sept. I went to the office, as usual, and found a small parcel; I opened it; it contained three pieces of paper, which they said belonged to a Miss Coutts; one said something about getting 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week, and the other said something about "I will not deliver this letter;" I placed it in my pocket, and at once concluded it was a mean retaliation from some one at the office owing me a spite; after finishing my delivery, I went to the Green Man public-house, to get my breakfast, and waited there till the next delivery of letters was brought to me there; after finishing them, I went home; I placed the papers under the bed, intending to take them with me next morning, to find out who sent it, but next day I was taken into custody; I did not tell the officer where I lived, because the street was not very respectable: they took me in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the Stratford Post<lb/>office, and the officers had some communication with the letter-carriers, and, after leaving, one of the officers asked if I was not a Chartist; I said I was</p>

               <p>not; he asked if I had not been to the meeting at Kennington-common; I said I had, but only out of curiosity; I was taken to the Post-office, and Mr. Smith charged me with sending him two anonymous letters with covers, and parts of other letters; I told him I knew nothing of them; some gentlemen in the office asked if I did not live in Lambeth-street; in about three quarters of an hour the officer came into the office, and showed Mr. Smith a note which he said he had found in my place; and he said the two batches of sealing-wax corresponded with the letter Mr. Smith had received; I at once perceived that the whole was a conspiracy; my brother and a witness named Harris swore to my handwriting before the Magistrate; I never wrote to my brother in my life, and he has never seen me write since I left school, eleven years ago, and Harris never saw me write; these letters have been written through spite; Craddock and the other auxiliaries have frequently wanted me to change walks with them, and I would not, and they charged me with stealing a letter that was mis-sent; but it was impossible for me to have got it, for I was always last there of a morning, and never opened the bags, and the first man opens the bags and sorts the letters, and if a letter is mis-sent, he sends it away; it is not the first time I have been robbed of my letters; not long ago a man stole a money-letter belonging to my walk, and was found coming out of the office with it in his possession, and if he had not been taken I should have been charged with it.</p>

I was on duty in Ebury-street, Pimlico, about eight o'clock—I saw the prisoners walking abreast down Ebury-street—Gunn had this handkerchief, which seemed to be heavy—they were in conversation together—I stood still, and they came towards me—on their crossing the road I stepped into the road, and stopped Gunn; the other three ran off—Savage took one direction, and Grant and Salmon the other—I took Gunn into custody; be endeavoured to drop the handkerchief on my foot, but I caught it, and still kept my hold of him, and took him to the station—the handkerchief contained this lead and a knife; he said he found it near Chelsea Hospital—knowing the other prisoners I gave directions to the policeman to bring them in—Salmon was brought in about twelve at night—he said he met Gunn near the Hospital, and he had asked him to take a walk with him down Ebury-street—Grant was brought in about half an hour afterwards—he said he had met Gunn near the Bun-house, and he had asked him to walk down Ebury-street—next morning, between six and seven, Savage was brought in, and was told the charge—he said nothing—in consequence of information I went to Chelsea Hospital, and compared this lead on the ridge of a roof, where I found lead to be wanted—the lead corresponded with the marks, I have no doubt it belonged there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk of the Petty-bag—the office is in Rolls'-yard, Chancery-lane—it is an office of the Court of Chancery. On 2d of Dec., in consequence of information, I went to look at some of the presses—the clerks were in the office, and the prisoner was amongst them—he had been employed in the office eight or nine months as a writing-clerk—I saw that some of the rolls were not in their places—I inquired of all the clerks who were in the office—the prisoner said he knew nothing about them—he came to the office again on the following Monday, a few minutes before ten o'clock, and at half-past ten, intending to make a further investigation I went to the room where he was in the habit of writing, and the foreman came down and said he had left—on the Monday I made further search in the presess where those parchments were kept, and ascertained that six rolls were missing—I made a communication to Lord Langdale, the Master of the Rolls, on the subject—I afterwards communicated with some of the police—the prisoner did not return to the office after Monday, 4th Dec.—the next I heard of him was by this letter from him, dated 15th Dec, stating that he was ill (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—on 19th Dec. I received this other letter from him, stating that he had been trying to find the shop where he had left some rolls of parchment—in consequence of receiving that letter, I went to the police<lb/>office—four of the rolls of parchment which I discovered to have been taken from their place, were soon after this brought to me by Sergeant Shaw—on 21st Dec. 1 received this other letter from the prisoner—these are four of the rolls of parchment that were removed (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner had no right to remove them, they are records which are preserved in the Petty-bag office—they relate to specifications of patent inventions—two of them are of the date of 1841, another of 1844, another of 1846, another of 1847; and one of them is of 1836—I have recovered four out of the six—two of them are still missing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at North-place, Kingsland-road. On Friday evening, 29th Dec., I went to 8, Nottingham-place, about seven o'clock, and met the prosecutrix in the passage—I went with her into the kitchen—I found her clothes completely saturated with blood, while appeared to come from a small wound over the left temple—it must have been inflicted with some instrument; a fall, or a blow from the fist could not have produoed it—she fell back into a chair in an insensible state, and con<lb/>tinued so half an hour—I thought she was dying from loss of blood—her feet and legs became very cold—after she recovered she became violently sick—that would be very likely to be produced by such injuries as she has stated—I particularly observed what she vomited, and smelt it, and told the policeman Gilbert to do so also, and there was no smell of liquor—on the Saturday I found that one of her ribs was broken, I could not set it—I dressed the wound over the eye the same night, while she was lying on the floor—the prisoner was brought in by the policeman, and she said, "That is the man; it was he that did it"—the prisoner immediately answered, "I own I struck her; she struck me first"—I have seen a knife, and also some clothes-pegs—the wound was such as might have been produced by either of those.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long do you think she had been bleeding before you got there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say at least three-quarters of an hour—it was a jagged wound down to the bone, wounding a branch of the temporal artery—I will not say that the wound was made with the knife—a knife generally makes a clean, sharp kind of wound, but this is not a clean sharp knife—it might have been made with the clothes-peg—there was blood on that—from that I draw the inference that the clothes-peg was the instrument—I think it is the more likely instrument of the two—that peg was found among about three dozen others, in a basket on a table in the kitchen where the woman was—the prisoner said he had cut his knuckle, which he might have done with the nail in the clothes-peg—I should not like to say whether if the woman had fallen from a push or a blow given her, with the peg in her hand, and the peg struck her temple, that would produce such a wound—the prisoner always denied using the knife—the prosecutrix told me that the prisoner said he would give her a Lancashire kick—I have been four years a surgeon—I am a member of the College of Surgeons, and a licentiate apothecary—I had a good deal of experience in wounds while in the hospital.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 23d, I was at the White Horse, Fann-street, and saw the prisoner there in front of the bar—about twelve o'clock, I told him not to interfere with any words that were going on in front of the bar any more than myself—there were words with other people—I asked for an<lb/>other pint of porter, and they would not serve me—the police-sergeant came in—I walked out, and the prisoner turned out after me—he stood in an atti<lb/>tude to fight me with both his hands up, and before I had time to ask what he meant by it, he struck me a blow with his right hand—his left hand was down—Elgar rushed in between us—I was going to return the blow, and be cut me a second time with the same hand—I did not feel that I was subbed—I thought the people had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> some hot water on me out of the win<lb/>dow till I saw both my hands smoking with blood—I then turned round, and said, "By God! he has struck me with a knife!"—I was taken to the station, and Mr. Childs examined me—there was a wound across my throat which bled very much—it soaked through a thick handkerchief.</p>

On 25th Jan., about six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came, and offered me this chronometer, tied in a dirty piece of cloth, with no top to the case, as it is now—I questioned him whether he had the "rate" of the chro<lb/>nometer, stating how it goes, whether losing or gaining—he said he had, and pulled some papers out of his pocket, and said he had lost it—he said he had left the top of the case at his lodging—I asked if it was his own—he said it was, and he bought it in Liverpool for fifty guineas—I said I must go with him, to make inquiries—we went out; he did not want to go any further; he wanted to return, and get the chronometer—I took him to the station.</p>

I was in Whitechapel-road—I saw the younger Arment offering a piece of yellow damask for sale to Mr. Jewel, a broker—he did not buy it—I followed young Arment, and when I came up to him I asked him what he had there—he hesitated at first, and then said, "Stuff"—I said, "What stuff?" and after some further hesitation he said, "Damask"—I then asked him where he got it—he said he bought it at a sale-room—I said, "What sale-room?"—he said he did not know—I said that was very unsatisfactory—he then said he was entrusted with it by a man to sell—I asked him what man, and who he was—he said he did not know—I told him he must go to the station-house with me—he immediately said he had bought it in a public-house—I asked him what public-house—he said he did not know—when he got to the station he said he bought it at a public-house kept by a man named Webb, in Whitechapel—he said he had never dealt in any damask, or sold any before.</p>

On 26th Dec, about eight at night, I was on duty, and saw the door of the King's Arms, at the corner of White-cross-street and Chis well-street, open, and saw fighting going on inside—there were two soldiers, of whom the prisoner is one, and a number of other people—three women and one man were turned out, and then the two soldiers—they stood outside the door—I was about twelve yards from them, and when I came towards them the prisoner said to me, "If you won't let me fight them, you b----r, I will fight you"—I said, "Oh, no you won't, comrade, take my advice, and go away;" with that he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his foot and kicked me in the private parts—I recollect no more, till I found myself in a chemist's shop—I was afterwards taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, remained there about a quarter of an hour, and then went home, and Mr. Mather has been attending me—the prisoner was quite drunk—I went on reserve duty again last Monday week.</p>

On 27th Dec Haynes was placed under my care—he had received an injury in the penis, both testicles, and the contents of the scrotum and the urethra were ruptured; the parts were very much enlarged and swollen; he was under my care for a month—there was no external wound, except that the lining membrane of the urethra was ruptured, that caused a small flow of blood for two days mingled with the urine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at the Cresent vault-office, wine department, in the London Docks. On 9th Jan. my attention was called to this tasting order—I asked the prisoner were he got it from—he said from a person in a tobacconist's shop—I asked him who he was and what was his name—he replied, "I do not know"—I said I thought it very strange that he should get a tasting-order from a party whom he did not know—he replied that it was so—I then said, "I have my doubts about the genuineness of this order, and I shall consider it my duty to send to the house of Vincent and Pugh to ascertain if the signature be a genuine one"—he said, "Very well, do so, and I will return in half an hour"—I said, "You had better wait until the messenger returns"—he said, "No, I shall come in half an hour"—he appeared to be in a very excited state, and anoxious to get away—he west away, and was not taken till many days afterwards—I have the charge of the wine in these vaults—it is not my duty or Daniels' to be present when the tasting orders are executed—Daniels accepts the orders—one of the coopers in the vaults has to be present.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Dock Company. On 24th Jan. I was at a public-house in Blackman-street, Borough, with a man named Sayer and another constable, and saw the prisoner there—Sayer asked him if his name was Thomas Illidge—he said, "No; my name is not Illidge"—a cooper, named Felgate, in the service of the Dock Company was with me who knew the prisoner, and I said to him loud enough for the prisoner to hear, "Is this the man?"—he said, "That is the man"—I then said to the prisoner, "I want to speak to you, if you will step into the parlour; we went in, and I there said to him, "We are officers belonging to the London Dock Company; I have eighteen or twenty forged orders for tasting wines which I find you have uttered"—he said, "I know nothing of twenty orders, I only know about one"—I said, "Do you mean the last one you presented, and which was rejected"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where did you get that one?"—he said, "I got it from a young man at a public-house"—the pri<lb/>soner has only been identified in connection with the three orders produced—I took him into custody, took him to the Docks, and showed him the whole of the orders—he made no remark.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I apprehend that this indictment cannot be supported, upon two grounds; first, because the instrument must at the time it is uttered purport to be a valid order, warrant, or request, showing an authority to deliver</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">the goods mentioned in it. Now the witness Daniels, has proved that it is not a valid instrument for any such purpose until he has countersigned it, which I he had not done when the prisoner presented it. Secondly; I submit that the instrument if completed would only give a permission to taste, and would not be either an order, a warrant, or a request for the delivery of the goods so as to enable the party to get them transferred into his own possession or control.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">As to the purport of the instrument, that is matter of evidence or explanation; it is obligatory upon the person to whom it is issued, although for the purpose of the internal management of the Dock business it might be required to be countersigned, (in the same way at a banker's check might, by some private regulation unknown to the party presenting it, require to pass through some particular hand before it is paid;) but its operation as a warrant is complete for the purpose to which it is applied at the time it issues from the merchant. With regard to the second point, there is a delivery of goods within the meaning of the Stalute; although, certainly in very minute par<lb/>ticles, and not for the purpose of being carried away to such an extent as might form the subject of a charge of larceny</hi>,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CRESSWELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I do not think the case of a banker's cheek would be the same thing. It has been held that a Bill of Exchange cannot be described as such in an indictment, unless it has been accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">A Bill of Exchange is an instrument requiring certain attributes, without which it would not exist; but it might be good described in another form.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE CRESSWELL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">do not think that observation answers the objection. I have a very strong opinion at present that this is not an order for the delivery of goods. An order for the delivery of goods means that they are to be delivered to the party to be dealt with as his own, in any way he pleases. This wine is not so delivered; it is delivered to him for the special purpose of tasting, and nothing else, he has no other control over it. The order is directed to the cooper. Vincent and Pugh have no power to give an order operating on the cooper; he is not in any way bound to obey their order on the contrary, he is not to do so. Therefore it does not appear to be an instrument issued directly from Vincent and Pugh to the cooper, but it is to go through some other hands. The perfecting of the order is to be received from the clerk appointed to accept it, and it is his acceptance which is addressed to, and which binds the cooper.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a translator of foreign lan<lb/>guages. In consequence of something I heard, I called on the prisoner, at 11, Angel-court, Strand—I said that I thought the best thing he could do was to disclose the whole of the robberies that he was acquainted with, and I would make application to the Secretary of State to get a pardon, and have him admitted as evidence for the Crown—I more particularly alluded to the prints which I recognised in his room—I did not then know that there was a charge against him—I became bail for him at the Mansion-house—I was not employed by him as an attorney; I appeared an clerk to Mr. Medina at the Mansion-house on that single occasion—I have no doubt, hope and expecta<lb/>tion were the real cause of his disclosing this.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where were the prints? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On a sofa, in a bundle, covered over—the prisoner opened them, and showed them to me—I had been informed by him that a man named Schmidt and he were acquainted—I gave information of what I had seen the same evening—I placed them for security in the hands of the police—after telling the prisoner I would apply to the Secretary of State, I went and gave information—the prisoner promised to meet me at the house of another solicitor, to make this disclosure, on the following Monday, and I gave information instantly—I had not seen the prisoner before on this subject—I had seen him at the Mansion-house, on the subject of Schmidt and Boyal—I communicated to the police their address, which I obtained from Mrs. Robertson—I did not go to the prisoner as his attorney, I had gone for Mr. Medina a week before—I was introduced to the prisoner by a most respectable friend of his, to get bail, and Mr. Medina wrote a letter to the Lord Mayor, stating that it was inconvenient for him to attend, and he would be obliged to him to let me act for him—I wanted the prisoner to give information respecting this robbery—I pressed him to give all the information possible to put a stop to this system of robbery—the relation of solicitor and client ceased as soon as I had performed my duty—it came out in evidence that there had been a previous conviction against him, and I thought I did not stand in a very pleasant situation, unless I induced him to clear up the matter—I said, "I advise you to make a disclosure of these things"—I promised to solicit his pardon, and wrote to the Secretary of State on the subject—I was not his attorney in any shape or way; he left it to me to deal with these prints as I thought best—he was to meet me on the Monday, at the office of Mr. Lewis, in Ely-place—Mr. Lewis is not in any shape or way mixed up with this—I did not go before the Magistrate, and state that I was there representing Mr. Lewis, and he did not have to write a statement discarding me, it was a mis-report—Mr. Lewis did not say he had written to the newspapers, stating that he had nothing to do with</p>

               <p>me, and tell me to go away—he did not state that he must decline having anything to do with me; the question did not arise—I had seen Schmidt one night at the prisoner's lodging—I had a very strong impression that these things had been taken by Schmidt—I asked the prisoner about him—he gave me information partially, and his wife gave me the remainder—I am not clerk to Mr. Medina—Mr. Lewis declined using my evidence in Schmidt's case; I do not know on what ground—I have been in the army; I was in the Portuguese service, as Major of Lancers—I never was bail for any one but the prisoner—I have seen his friends—he was introduced to me as an extremely respectable man—I had seen him two or three times—I had no interview with him till I had left the Mansion-house—I have worn the coat I hare on about six months, it has been worn by Mr. Lloyd once or twice—it is not the coat for appearing before the Lord Mayor—Mr. Lloyd has sometimes worn mine, and sometimes I wear his—this is not his, I cannot say who has the greater share in it—Mr. Lewis got two guineas from the Commissioners of the Insolvent Debtors' Court for me.</p>

I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>; in consequence of which I went to Dawson's Stables, Crown-street Westminster, on the 7th, and asked to see the horse referred to in the advertisement—Perkins was there, he showed me two horses—I treated for the bay one—it was a showy-looking horse—I said I was going to Collins, a dealer in the Kent-road, to see a horse, but looked in there on the way, and I would call in on my return—I afterwards returned, saw Perkins, and said I did not think the horse would quite match the one I wanted him to go with—he said, "You have not seen him enough," and pullrd the cloths off—he asked 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but said he thought Mr. Burrows would take less—I asked who Burrows was—he said he was in the wool business in the City, and lived in Fludyer-street, Westminster—I went and saw Burrows—he said he was in the wool business, and had got the horse to sell for his brother who was abroad, and he said he had had another and a carriage with it, which he had sold, but he did not like selling horses—I asked if the horse was sound and quiet in harness—he said, yes, anybody that understood driving he would go very well with, and he was perfectly sound—I asked what he wanted, and he said he had refused 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him a little while ago, but he would take thirty-five guineas—I said, "Won't you take pounds?"—he said he would not take less; that I might have him on trial seven days, and if I did not like him, by forfeiting a guinea, he would take him back—I asked, if I did not approve of him, if he would let his man come down and take him back, in case any accident should happen—he said, "Certainly"—I asked him to lend me a saddle and bridle, and I would ride him down—he said,</p>

               <p>"Oh no, you had much better not do that; "that he would tend him down properly with his cloths and kneecaps on by nine o'clock next morning—I agreed, and wrote a check for the money—he said, "We had better have an agreement"—I wrote one, he signed it, and I gave him this check (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then said, "But if I am not to have the hone, I had better keep my check"—he said, "You may depend on my sending him down quite safe;"—I took his word—Perkins brought the horse home about half-past eleven next morning—he was not fit to ride; one of his shoes was only hanging by one nail, I had to send him to the farrier's—Perkins told me that Burrows said, if the horse did not suit me, he was to come and fetch him back—he left directly, before the horse came back—next morning I tried him—I had not been on him half a minute before he made a tremendous noise, and in less than a minute I found he was a tremendous roarer—I went up to Fludyer-street the same day—I could not find Burrows, but left a message that I would be there on Monday—his wife said he would be sure to be at home—I went, but did not find him—on Tuesday, Perkins came down and took the horse back, he said Burrows had appointed ten o'clock on Wednesday to meet me, and he would be sure to be there—he looked at the horse, and said he was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. better than before, and as fresh as a lark—I went on Wednesday and found this letter, and should say from the memorandum which Burrows signed that it is his writing—(<hi rend="italic">this letter was signed 'J.P. Burrows,' stating that he was sorry he could not keep his appointment, but that he would come down to Mr. Thompson next Monday</hi>)—I went to my attorney—I afterwards received this letter from Burrows—(<hi rend="italic">this letter requested Mr. Thompson to call on Burrows on Monday, between eleven and twelve</hi>)—I sent my attorney to him—I have never teen horse, check, or money since.</p>

On Thursday night, 21st Dec., about ten o'clock, he came into my house with another man, who was quite a stranger to me—the prisoner asked me for the change of a Bank of England 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I took it from his hand, looked at it, went to my desk, and changed it—I gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and five sovereigns—I said,</p>

               <p>"What name am I to put to this note, Kimber?"—he replied, "In the name of Harvey"—the other man was standing by him, and they both replied at the same time, looking at each other—I wrote that name on the back of the note, and I see it here now (<hi rend="italic">looking at the note</hi>)—the prisoner wrapped the sovereigns up in the note, and they both went into the tap-room—they staid there a short time, and left together—on the 23d I sent the note, by my son, to Mr. Peppercorn, for change, and he returned it to me on the 29th, stamped "Forged," as it is now—upon that I sent to the prisoner—he lived within twenty yards of me—he came directly—I showed him the note, and said, "Kimber, here is a pretty job you have got roe into; you have passed a forged note"—he said, "I see it is, I see it is; it is a very bad job indeed"—I said, "Do you know this man Harvey?"—he said he had seen him before, and that he was a plumber, living at the lower part of Deptford—I told him to go and find him, for I should hold him responsible for the note—he said, "I know it, and will pay it by instalments"—he went out to find Harvey, and came back in about an hour—he said that he bad been down to the lower part of Deptford, and could not find Harvey—I said, "Well, it is a bad job," and again repeated that I should hold him responsible—he said he knew it, and then left—he came again next morning, of his own accord, and said, "Well, Mr. Barton, what is to be done?"—I said, "What money can you raise, Kimber?"—he said he would go out and try what he could get—he went out, returned very shortly, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and agreed to pay the remainder at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a week—he did not pay me anything beyond the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he was taken into custody that same evening—he it a maker of pattens and clogs, and is a sort of jobbing horse-dealer.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside with my father, and assist him in his business. On the evening of 21st Dec., about ten o'clock, I was there, when the prisoner came into the bar with another man, a stranger—the prisoner gave my father a note, and asked him for change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and five sovereigns—my father asked him what name he should put on the note, and they both answered together, "Harvey," and the other man said, "Harvey, a plumber, living at the lower part of Deptford"—they both said so—after changing the note they had one or two pints of porter, and then went into the tap-room for a few minutes—while my father was getting the change for the note I just peeped outside the door, just to see if there was any horse there that they were dealing for, to satisfy my curiosity, and I saw two men under the lamp, just outside the door—the prisoner said he had been looking at a horse for this Harvey; that was whilst my father was getting the change—after I came in again the two men from outside came in, went into the tap-room, and stopped there a few</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 38). On Saturday, 30th Dec, from information I received I went to Mr. Barton's, and received from him this note—it has the name of Harvey endorsed on it—it is No. 64505, dated London, 4th Oct., 1848—I afterwards went after the prisoner—I found him in his own house—I told him he was charged with having uttered to Mr. Barton a forged 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—he said it was a bad job, and he was very sorry for it, but he did not utter it; it was not for himself; it was another man that was with him—I said, "Yours was the hand that uttered the note, and yours was the hand that received the change"—he then said, "It was not for myself; it was for a man of the name of Martin, a baker, living at the lower part of Deptford"—I am sure he said Martin—I asked if he knew the man—he said he had seen him before—I asked whether he could tell me where he lived—he said, "I have been trying to find him myself, but cannot"—I asked how he came in company with this man—he said that he had been called by a man in Deptford Broadway, and was asked by him if he would earn a bit of silver, which he said was for assisting him in the sale of a pony—I asked who the man was that was about selling the pony—he said, "It was a man that I have seen in Smithfield, but I do not know his name"—he said that the changing of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note was for the payment of the pony—I then said, "What remuneration were you to get for changing that note?"—he said, "I was to have 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I did have"—I did not mention the name of Harvey to him on that occasion—I believe I did at the station say that the name of Harvey appeared on the note instead of the name of Martin which he gave me, I believe that was all—he never mentioned the name of Harvey to me, not at the time he was apprehended; he did afterwards at the station say that it was Harvey, and not Martin, and I said, "I do not know what you meant, but you told me Martin"—he altered the name—after the first examination before the Magistrate I asked him who the other men were that were with him—he said there were no other men with him; the only person that was with him was the man Harvey—I said, "There were two other men outside the house, who came into the tap-room and joined you, and all four of you came away together"—he said there were no other men with him but the man whose note it was, nor were there any other men outside of the house, and that he had come away from the house with the one man only—I have searched through the whole of Deptford, and there is no person named Harvey, either a baker or plumber; nor is there any person named Martin a baker or plumber, but there is a man named Martin, whom I know to be a companion of the prisoner, who keeps a lodging-house for all sorts of travellers.</p>

               <p>returned in a short time, leaving the door open, went to the fire, lighted his pipe, and stood before the fire again, in the same position as before—he stood there for some time and I said, "This is the second time you have done the like; you ought to have sat down when you were told the first time"—he said he was not going to stop a minute—he went out a second time and returned with Johnson and another whom I do not know—Carey went before the fire again, and stood in the same way—a man on the other side of the room said to him, "Why don't you sit down; you have been told to do it a second time"—Johnson, who stood by the door, replied, "No, if I was him, I would not sit down"—Carey then made use of tome very bad expressions, and said that he would not sit down, and nobody in the room should make him—he then walked from the fire to me—I got up to go out—he seized me by the jacket-collar, and I instantly found blood flowing from my head, in conse<lb/>quence of a blow I received, but I do not know from whom—William and Richard Rivers and his wife got up to go—Carey laid hold of William Rivers, and Johnson struck him with a quart pot, twice, I believe, and knocked him down senseless under the table—Richard Rivers and his wife both received several blows from Carey.</p>

The prisoners were in their employ, Healey as the driver of an engine, and Watkins as stoker—I t is generally the stoker's duty to act under the orders of the driver—on 17th Nov. they were in charge of the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> locomotive-engine, which was allowed to be used by Mr. Brassey, the sub-contractor, for the purpose of ballasting—when done with, it was to be returned to the Company's shed—they charge him so couch a day, and find fuel, and everything—when the engine has done ballasting, it is the duty of the prisoners to report themselves to Mr. Doland, the overlooker under me; they are not allowed to go out again, after having brought the engine home—the books produced are copies of the rules; one is delivered to each of the Company's servants; it is also usual to deliver to the engine-driver a time-table—the 22d rule is, "No engine, truck, or carriage, is to be allowed to cross the main line when a train is due or is approaching, and in no case are trucks to be left standing on the main line; whenever the line is obstructed the proper signal must be exhibited whether trains are due or not, and every person belonging to the Company is personally responsible for this rule being strictly observed"—the 65th rule is, "During the whole journey the engine-man must keep a sharp look-out forward, standing in such a positiou as will enable him immediately to work his engine as may be required, so that he may instantly observe any ob<lb/>struction that may be on the road, or signal, to which he must pay instant attention whether be knows or understands the signal or not; the fire-man must keep a sharp look-out forward, and frequently backward, to the train, to see that all is right, and he must be in a position to use the break on the instant appearance of any signal"—the 74th rule is, "No person, except the engine-man and his fireman, shall be allowed to ride on an engine</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184901290104"/>
               <p>or tender, except the officers of the Company, unless authorised by the secretary"—the 79th rule is, "In approaching any station or any place where he cannot see, the engine-man having charge of any engine, whether laden or not, shall slacken his speed, and approach so slowly as to stop his engine without danger"—the Old Richmond line is a little on a curve; in certain positions that would prevent the engine-man seeing fairly a head—I made an experiment with an engine from the Old Richmond station, and placed a man, with a light in his hand, at the same height from the rails as the buffer, in the direction in which the train would be coming at "M," I was on the engine at "E," 555 yards off, and could see him—the line is perfectly level there—I went at the average speed of twelve miles an hour, and stopped at thirty-seven yards; it was a dry night—being on the alert it was a most satisfactory experiment—I told the engineer to go at the usual speed, and from my observation it was so; and when he got opposite the light he was to shut off the steam; it was shut off at "E"—the express-train should have the steam shut off at "N," about three-quarters of a mile from the Old Richmond platform; that would be before it got to "F'—the line from New Richmond to the junction, is on a considerable inclination, which requires you to approach that point cautiously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you try the experiment nearer to the points than "E" after you had passed the points? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not as to stopping, but I satisfied myself I could see the light which I placed at "N" the whole distance from "E" up to the point of junction—I could see it rather better between "E" and "G" than I could at "E"—there is no curve—I used the <hi rend="italic">Southampton</hi> engine, as the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> was too much damaged—both engines are for passenger-trains—I had not been called upon to examine the breaks of the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> before the accident—the breaks do not very often get out of order—it depends on circumstances; perhaps it is once in a month; sometimes not once in two months—if out of order, the length of time is greater in stopping an engine, but it is the duty of an engine-man to report such a case to hit foreman, not to me—when the engine stopped at thirty-eight yards, the engine-man, the fireman, myself, and another were on it—it takes one man to the break—he has not always bis hand on it—he stands by it, except when engaged in other duties—his duty is to throw coke on the fire, and assist generally in anything that has to be done, and to supply water, all of which require him to be standing close to the break—the engine-man opens the fire door while the fireman puts the coke on—water is procured by merely turning a handle, that is the duty of either of them—the handle for the water is by the handle of the break—if one is turning it, the other may put his hand on the break—the engine sometimes gets a little wrong, and then it is their duty to mend it as far as they can—the steam is turned off merely by turning another handle—there is no person whose express duty it is to stand by the break and watch—I made the experiment about six or half-past—I did not take care that the break was in good order, it was an engine which happened to be standing there—the express-train travels at the rate of forty-five to fifty miles an hour—our express-trains are all first and second-class—if leaves Waterloo at thirty-five minutes past five, and would be due at the points about half-a-minute before six—I have not tried the experiment of stopping an engine going at forty-five miles an hour—we have one engine to a train one day, and another on another, we are not particular—the breaks are all of the same character and quality; we are not able to put greater power on express-trains than on others—the time in which we could stop a train would depend on its weight—I think the point "M" is three-quarters of a mile from the station—the break would be put on as well</p>

               <p>as the steam shut off—they sometimes put on the break at full pressure; that is safe, but would cause a little more wear and tear—there is an up-train from Datchet, that ought to have arrived at Richmond at 5h.-40m.—there was a down-train due at the old station at 5h.-50m.—when a train arrives, a bell rings—all trains stop at Richmond, a bell would ring for all.</p>

                  </hi>. On 17th Nov. I was acting as time-keeper to Mr. Brassey, the contractor—I had been out all day ballasting by the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine, which Healey drove, and Watkins was the fireman—it was my duty to take an account of the time the engine was employed by Mr. Brassey—when the engine returned from the ballasting, as it pasted the booking-office it was three minutes to five—I saw the ballast-wagons put up, and left the engine standing close in front of the wagons, in the same position as when I first arrived at the booking-office—I left it about a quarter-past five—I left Healey with the engine—I afterwards went with two of my men into the Locomotive beer-shop, which is about 180 yards from the shed—it took us two or three minutes to go—after we had been there ten or fifteen minutes, Healey came in, and about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, Watkins came—we had two pots of beer between six or eight of us—the prisoners were sober—a porter named Pitt came to the door—the prisoners were both there then—Watkins had then been in about half-a-minute or so—I believe Pitt said the engine was blowing off her steam—Healey then turned to Watkins, and said, "Go, <hi rend="italic">mate</hi>, I am coming directly"—Watkins went out directly—I heard Healey say that he was going to Nine Elms station—I went out, and he followed close on my heels—there is a clock at the beer-shop—I did not notice Healey look at it, but I did particularly, and it was then about three minutes to six—the deceased, Richard Perry, and Andrews were with me—I then went to where the engine was, and got on it—Perry was on it before, and Andrews also—all the people on the engine were Watkins, Healey, Perry, Andrews and myself, I being the last the engine was put in motion directly—I went down with it to the points at New Richmond—I did not hear a word said about the express till Healey turned and said to me, "Oh dear, we are running into the train"—I think those were the words he used—Watkins immediately applied the break, which caused me to fall backwards as I was standing behind it—it was put on suddenly, and apparently very hard—it shook the engine so as to make me fall—I did not fall out, I fell on a quantity of coke that was in the tender—a few seconds after that the two engines came together—I was in a great fright, and had my kneepan cut in two.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know the elbow that has been spoken of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know a small curve—the break was put on before we had fairly arrived there, before we had fairly got round it—it did not immediately stop the engine—the speed was very much moderated when the collision took place—I cannot tell at what speed the express train was coming—I did not see it at all—Healey was in his proper place at the engine at the time, and Watkins was at the break—I cannot say at what pace we were going—I should think net more than three, four, or five miles an hour, but being in the dark I could not see—I should consider, by the distance we bad gone, it was not more four or five miles an hour—we were going up to Vauxhall for coke—that, certainly required—it has frequently occurred that we have had to stop; for coke—I did not hear either Healey or Watkins say before we started, "Now, the express train has passed we will start"—I did not hear any words from the time I was on the engine till Healey said, "We are running into the train"—I did not hear any bell ring—I did not know that Healey was injured till I was told—I saw no one afterwards, except Andrews.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Richmond, and was em<lb/>ployed by Mr. Brassey, the contractor. On 17th Nov. I was at work for him at Datchet, and after the work was over I came to Richmond by the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine with Perry and Mee—we got the engine to the station at Richmond somewhere about five o'clock—I went home to get my tea—Perry said Healey was going to Vauxhall for coke, and he was going with him—it was arranged that I should also go as far as Barnes—I afterwards went to the Locomotive beer-shop, which is close to the station, and found Healey, Mee, Perry, and several others there, having some refreshment—Watkins came in, and said something about the engine—a little after that Pitt, a porter, came in, and said the steam was blowing off; in consequence of which Healey desired Watkins to go and look at it, and he went—a few minutes after that I observed Healey take out his watch and his time-bill—he then got up and said, "Come, my lads, we must be off"—I went with him and the rest to the station, and found the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine there, and Watkins with it—Healey then got up on the engine—I think he was the first to get up, and Perry, Mee, myself, and a man named Suteliffe, I believe a flagman; that was all—I think most of us were at the back of the tender—Perry was nearer the boiler—there was a quantity of coke in the tender—as soon as we had got on, the engine started—after we started a little way up the line Healey blew the whistle, and looked back, and told Mee it was no use talking to all of us, that we were going into the express-train—we were then going round the curve—he called to Watkins to put down the break and jump—I suppose he meant to jump from the engine—I and Mee fell down in the tender, in consequence of the sudden shock of the break, and Watkins jumped off; I think he was not hurt—Perry was standing at the left-hand side of the boiler, on the foot-plate of the engine, next the Datchet line—I cannot say how soon it was after Watkins jumped off that the other engine struck us; it was a very short time—I saw Perry moving from his standing<lb/>place, and he <hi rend="italic">lolled</hi> himself, or was thrown round, and I saw no more of him—I believe I was thrown off—I have no recollection of getting off, but I found myself off—I was very much shaken, and cut a little about the head and several places—when I got my senses a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> I went round the tender, and saw Healey and the fireman throwing some ballast, and one said to the other, I am not sure which it was, "This was a bad job," and the other said it was—I cannot say at what speed we were going—I was never on an engine before—I thought we went rather brisk at first starting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you hear Watkins say before you started that the express-train was gone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said in the Locomotive that the engine or the train, I am not sure which, was gone—it was not till after that, that Healey started—when the train was coming Healey called out to us to jump, but he remained on the engine himself to the very last—I believe he fell on me—he did all he could to stop the engine—when I afterwards saw him throwing some ballast, he did not appear to be very much injured, but it afterwards appeared that he was—I was taken home, and have been confined for weeks in consequence, and when I got better, in eight days' time, I went and saw him in bed, still suffering from the effect of the injuries he had received.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been employed by different railways for nearly ten years. In Nov. I was a pointsman at the Old Richmond station, at the point marked "C" in this plan—the engine-house is at "A"—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> after it came in from ballasting—I saw Watkins come back to it and move it—the moving it pumps water into the boiler—I told him he must not go up the line, as there was a train coming—I did not say what train—he said, "My <hi rend="italic">mate</hi> is not here: I want a little drop of water in the boiler"—he went up the line for 150 yards, and then returned again to the shed—at that time the down-train, due at ten minutes to six, had arrived—the passengers were getting out about twenty yards off—if a person came from the Locomotive beer-shop to the place where I spoke to him, he would come down the arrival platform—after Watkins had brought the engine back I had occasion to go away, to make arrangements about another engine for another train, and while I was away I heard a rash of steam out of the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi>—that meant that they were coming up the line—I did not know which line it was on—I looked out in consequence, and saw the steam rushing out of the cylinder-cocks, and the engine in motion—that was about two and a half minutes after the engine had come back—I <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> out to Hunt, the driver of the <hi rend="italic">Southamp<lb/>ton</hi>, which was the engine which had brought in the train, to hold on—they were on the same line—I had got hold of the points with my left hand, and my lamp was in my right—I put the red light between my hands, ran forward, and held it up to the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi>, to try to stop her—she had gone off down the road, and was near the tank—the buffers of the engine were right opposite me—she would have to pass me—I had showed the red light in front of her—she passed me—I hallooed, and asked where they were going—they passed on—the red light means "dangerous," and "to stop instantly"—I cannot say exactly, but I should think they were going at about seven or eight miles an hour when they passed me—I constantly see the engines leave—she went out a good deal faster than they usually do—I heard the Datchet bell rung, which means that the express-train is in sight, or at the wooden bridge—they get sight of it at the Richmond station, a little on the other side of the wooden bridge—it was after the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> bad passed me that I heard the bell ring—she was then just going round the curve—I was alarmed, and followed the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi>, and then found that the collision had taken place.</p>

On the night of 17th Nov., at six o'clock, while the Church clock was striking, I saw an engine coming down from the Old Richmond shed towards my points—by the time-bill, the express from London was then due—the Church clock is about two minutes before the Railway time—the express was not then in sight—when I saw the engine coming, I turned on the red light, which is a signal to stop—the engine then went back out of my sight—about three or four minutes after that, I saw the express coming, and rang the bell for some time longer than usual, as the wind was blowing in a contrary direction—when I had done ringing it, I heard a whistle blowing from an engine coming in the same direction as be<lb/>fore, from Old Richmond—I then turned the red light to it—they did not appear to take any notice of it, the engine still came on—finding it still kept on, I turned the red signal round to stop the express—almost immediately afterwards the collision took place—the express engine was driven four or five yards off the line—the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> was thrown back, but not off the line—they were about two lengths of metal from the crossing—when I showed the light the second time, it appeared to be about 150 yards from me—they could have seen it distinctly—the train that arrives at Old Richmond at 5h.-50m. must have been in something like fourteen minutes before—that arrived in time, and the express was about five minutes late—I afterwards went up to the <hi rend="italic">Vulture</hi> engine, and saw how Perry was jammed into the engine—he was killed by the collision.</p>

               <p>the express-train from London to Datchet. On 17th Nov. we ought to have left the Waterloo-station at thirty-five minutes past five o'clock, but left two minutes late—the train was due at Richmond at six—on passing the Mort-lake-station I looked at my watch, and it was then two minutes past six—it takes three or four minutes to run from there to the New Richmond-station—if we had got there without this collision, we should have been there at about five or six minutes after time—we shut off the steam about three-quarters of a mile before we get to the station—just before I got to the wooden bridge I saw the green light, which means "come with caution," turned from me—that is always shown for us to go by—seeing that turned away, I looked and saw an engine coming out of the old Richmond-station—I then reversed the engine, put on steam backwards, and opened the whistle—that made it go slower, as much as if we had put on the breaks—that was all that could be done—shortly after that we came in collision with the other engine—I have been a driver in this Company better than three years—I know this curve—the time at which an engine can stop depends on the state of the metal and the speed at which you are coming—you can stop at fifty or twenty yards—it is the duty of any engine-man driving on the main line to pay attention to engines coming on sidings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose an engine-driver had three or four persons on the engine with him, would that prevent his having a sufficient control over the engine? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is according to where they were—if a person was standing in the way it would prevent him, but a man might stand on the foot-plate and not be in the way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What sort of a night was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was mizzling of rain—there were a good many old decayed leaves about the line; we found it very difficult to work the breaks; they would not hold to the line—I have been down several times when I could stop at half the distance that I could that night—from where I was signalled to where the collision took place was better than a hundred yards—I had shut the steam off about four hundred yards before—I was not exactly aware the engine was coming out till I saw the light—I was signalled a hundred yards before I got to the point—the break was on before that, not with much force: it was put on with greater force when we saw the signal—I have been on the line nine years next month, and I think Healey was there when I came.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 48, Howland-street, Fitzroy-square, and am a printer. On the morning of 16th Jan., about twenty minutes to one o'clock, I was coming over Hungerford-bridge, from the Surrey-side—I had taken a glass of rum and water, a drop of porter, and a cigar, but I was perfectly col<lb/>lected, and knew what I was about—I had not got more than fifty yards from the toll-bar, when the prisoner Flood accosted me, and walked a few steps by me, and then pressed me so tight against the wall, that I was unable to extricate myself—I did not see Smart then—when I rescued myself a little from her hold she gave me a violent blow in my face, which sent me right across the bridge with great force, and knocked me down—I was stunned for a few minutes, and immediately afterwards Smart made his appearance, raised me up, wiped my face, and accused me of taking improper liberties—I was unable at the time to make any defence—I know nothing more till the officer came up—I told him I had lost my watch, which I had safe in my pocket three minutes before I went on to the bridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter, and live in Granby-place, Lower Marsh, Lambeth—I was passing over Hungerford-bridge on this morning, at twenty minutes to one o'clock, and saw Bates, with his back against the side of the bridge, and Flood close to him, apparently pressing him—I was about eight yards from them—I was going towards the Surrey-side, and had not arrived at where they were—I thought them not in a proper position, and crossed to the other side, meaning to pass them unnoticed—when I had passed them about three yards, I heard a sort of blow; I instantly turned round, and saw Bates in the act of falling—at the same time, I saw a man, who I had not seen before, come from the recess on the left—he was in the act of rising when I first saw him—the woman rushed past me to make her escape to the Surrey-side—I called out" Police" and "Murder" till I saw the toll-man come out of his box, and saw the shine of a policeman's hat in the centre of the bridge—the woman was taken on the bridge—I had lost sight of her for more than a moment when I turned my head—I did not see her face when I first saw her with the man—when I advanced, I kept her in sight, constantly crying out "Police" and "Murder," and she was stopped—about eight yards before she got to the gate, I saw her hand in a raised position—I accompanied the policeman to where Bates was—Smart was there then, apparently supporting him—I swear positively he is the same man I saw rise from the recess—I accused Flood of knocking Bates down, and said, "That is the man that came from the corner," putting my hand on Smart—he instantly began to <hi rend="italic">bounce</hi> me about with a sort of <hi rend="italic">domineer</hi> or threat, and said, "No; you must be mis<lb/>taken"—I said, "I am positive you are the man;" but from his continuing to <hi rend="italic">bully</hi> me, I began to be fearful I might be mistaken—the woman immedi<lb/>ately said, "Do you mean to say I am the woman who knocked the man down"—I said, "Yes; I swear it," and clapped my hand on her shoulder—she immediately gave me a desperate blow in the eye, which nearly sent me over—I continued to call out "Murder" and "Police"—I rushed down to the toll-house, and begged the toll-man to spring his rattle—a policeman was there at the time, and had charge of Flood—I met two people, and begged them to go to the policeman's assistance—the prosecutor was then bleeding; but I was in too excited a state to think about him—next morning he ap<lb/>peared in a dreadful state—I never saw a man so dreadfully beaten about—his eyebrow was cut; and there was a hole or cut in the forehead, and one under the eye, which, I think, must have been done with some instrument—I pointed out to Bradley, the policeman, the place where Flood raised her arm—I should say that is nearly a hundred yards from where I first saw Bates and Flood.</p>

When you walk out, you no doubt feel quite conscious of your own safety; but, in one of those walks, you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> see that which will make you start back with affright. I do not intend wasting my time in making use of a lot of vain and foolish words, but merely to write that which will be to the purpose. A party formerly boarded at your establishment, but who having now left you, for certain reasons, which you are aware of, and who has, as yet, eluded my grasp, and who has gone, I know not where. How<lb/>ever, you may rest assured, that you will not be able to follow in her ways. You have very deeply embittered my days, and I should have a mean spirit indeed, were I not to resent such conduct from you. In my own opinion, I have done nothing but what is quite right in thus writing to you." [No. 2.] "London, Dec. 4, 1848. Miss Ward,—Fearing that my last letter was never received by you, I have again written, and if I see this one safely delivered, why it is not my intention to write to you any more. I should not have had occasion to write to you now, only I find that when you walk abroad you are accompanied by a gentleman, besides other of your friends. It was my intention to have come to your house to see you one night last week; and, indeed, I was about to demand admittance, when I suddenly thought of something, and I found that I was right in my own thoughts, for you had got a gentleman with you. However, rest assured, that the time will come when I shall meet you by myself, and then I shall send you to your last home; in fact, I shall never rest satisfied until such times that I have fulfilled what I have said respecting of you. My reasons you are perfectly aware of. Yours truly." No. 3.] "London, Dec. 19, 1848.</p>

The first is, that I want you to give me the address of Miss Elizabeth Spriggs, who I am confident you know the address of, owing to some little difficulties which they could not prevent that is, owing you some money. In the second place, mind you, if you refuse to give me the address (why), I shall only have one course to pursue; and remember, that when once I have begun my work, I 'will not stop until I have seen you deprived of every comfort that this life can afford; I will send some of the most hor<lb/>rible letters that the human mind can possibly frame, to the higher class of society, all of which shall have your name signed to them. I will also send some powder to different parties, which will cause instant death, <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> name being signed to the letters which shall contain this deadly powder; and, in fact, <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> name and address shall be coupled with such horrid things that they will eventually believe you are the party. After I have done all this, then, remember, I will make you tell me what I am anxious to know. How<lb/>ever, you have it in your power, and you may prevent all this by merely sending me the address of that girl. What is my reason, perhaps you may ask, for my going on in this manner. I will tell you—you refused to let me see her once, when I came to you. In conclusion, I tell you you <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> tell me the address of Elizabeth Spriggs, or I will hunt you to the very death; so now take heed, and remember what I have said. Yours truly."[No. 4.] "London, Dec. 21, 1849. Miss Ward,—I am utterly amazed to think that you do not give me the address I asked you for, viz., that of Miss Elizabeth Spriggs; and you mast also be perfectly aware that you art acting a very foolish part; in fact, it is but little short of madness to go on in the manner that you are. Now, young lady, let me beg, nay, intreat of you, not to refuse me what I have asked of you; for you will not be doing yourself any harm. In conclusion I must tell you, that I shall expect an answer between this and next Sunday week, 31st Dec.; and mind you, if you refuse to send me one, why I shall be under the painful necessity of stopping you in the public street. I beg you not to misunderstand my meaning, nor be deceived as to how I shall act. I can be patient a little while, but not too long. Yours truly. (Private.)"</p>
