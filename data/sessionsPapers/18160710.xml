Squibb and I went into the house; Mahoffey and his wife were satting on the side of the bed; he was polishing a piece, of brass of the shape and size of a sixpence with his thumb and a stick. His wife was employed in rubbing something in a wet rag, which she threw under the bed, and which I afterwards picked up. I told them to stand up, for they were prisoners., I was tying them together, when the man threw his left hand up, and put something in his mouth; I immediately seized him by the throat, and he chuckled a little, and he threw up forty into my hand; they are all brass, in the shape of a sixpence; there is a mark of a little a on almost all of them; they were so when I took hold of them. I searched him; but there was nothing more on him. I then searched his wife, and found a quantity on he; they were in her pocket; there were also six finished in her pocket. All the pieces I found, finished, or unfinished, were marked with the letter a, which on all of them seemed to me made with the same punch. The finished ones were rolled up with paper between them; they were brighte when I found them, than they are now they now assume a greenish appearance. The bustle brought Squibbing with the other two prisoner, and I tied them all together, and searched the two Mitchells; on the elder

A small pair of plyers; they are brassy also. Also a small quantity of cream of letter, and a small quantity of salt. I don't know the use of these articles; a rubbing stick like the other, and a little drop of aquafortis in a bottle; two pieces of pumic stone, and a sheat of sand paper, unused. I also found some six pences, which fell behind young Mitchell; they appeared to fall from her; I picked them up near her. there were still a finished state, wraped up in paper, like the others; they have also the letter a.

             M'MILLAN. I am a rope-maker by trade. I know the four prisoners at the bar, from a late acquaintance; the first time I saw them was at Diffield, in Yorkshire; that is about seven weeks since. From a short conversation then, I learned that he was a drover. I saw no more of them until about a fortnight after, when I saw them together in Hull; I then formed a public-house acquaintance with them; but nothing farther. I agreed to travel to London with them, and the man said, that I should not want any of the necessaries of life. Accordingly, I agreed to travel with them to London. We embarked at Hull, and came to Burton, where we stopped that night; I did not see any of them do any thing extraordinary until we got to Stamford; I there saw James Mahoffey employed with a file scouring and rubbing of brass under a hedge; it was a wet day. It was a thin sheet, which had been cut up, and rounded to the size of sixpences; nothing more passed until we got to Peterborough, which was at about five o'clock in the evening; James Mahoffey went to work, I saw him; I had a full opportunity of seeing him colour some of these pieces; he put colour out of a piece of paper, and it produced an effect to make it look like silver. We did not drive cattle on the way to London; it was on a Sunday when we arrived in London. We occupied a room in Mrs. O'Neill's; the four prisoners at the bar and I went to Mrs. O'Neill's, in Carrier-street, St. Giles's; we had a ledging there until Tuesday, consisting of two beds; that served the whole five. We remained there until Tuesday, and then we took the lodging for a week, on condition that I was to sleep below in another bed, and we were to pay seven shillings and sixpence a week; we continued there from Tuesday until the Monday following. During the time we were there, we lived together; they were then employed in the same service which absolutely I have sworn to; I saw them. I went to the cutler's to get the scissors sharpened for the same execution. On the Monday, I was down along with Mary Mitchell, the younger, at Greenwich, and circulated twelve. We afterwards went on Tuesday to M'Lawrence's, in Bainbridge-street; two rooms were taken there; the one on the right hand belonged to the two Mitchell's; the other to Mahoffey and me. The morning after I went to this house, Mahoffey after preparing seventeen sixpences, gave me a penny to procure a pennyworth of aquafortis; I went to a chemist's, and got it, without any qustions what it was to do; by his request, I gave it to

In about fifteen minutes after that, she came into the room in which I was, with that cup, and delivered it into Mahoffey's hand in his room; it had then some stuff in it, more than it has now. He immediately applied it to colour those seventeen pieces which he had prepared; he succeeded in that, and affected it. He then wrapped them up in paper, sundry with paper, and told me to go up Highgate-road, and buy any small article; but return him two pence out of each sixpence. On my return from that place, I was apprehended. I put them all off but five. The last words Mahoffey said to me were if I was apprehended, to swallow them, and they would injure me not; that was the same evening on which I was afterwards escorted to Bainbridge-street by three officers. Those five which I had not uttered, the gentleman of the name of Squibb got.</p>

I have been so a considerable time, and am conversant with transactions of this nature; I have seen the various things produced to day; from my experience, I think they are complete to finish the counterfeit money of the description now produced; they are tools proper for making the pieces that have been produced, and they appear to have been appropriated to such a purpose.

             M'Manns said, there was no cream of tarter in the house, and asked him if he would go and fetch any; he said, he would, and she gave him some halfpence; he went, and on his return, gave it to her, saying there was an ounce, and telling her to be careful of it. He then sat himself down, or laid himself against the bedstead, and did not do any thing else. Catherine was there; but she was doing nothing but aiding and assisting in getting warm water, and they were washed in it by Margaret, after they had been rubbed in salt and dried in a cloth; then they were put into a cloth, and rubbed with cream of tartar again; Margaret did that. Nothing else was done to them by either of the other prisoners. She then washed them again in warm water, and then dried them in a cloth again; from that she put them on a hot iron, and put some blacking on them while they lay, one by one on the iron. Then she rubbed them between her thumb and finger, and put them away. Then I had the first six that were finished, and gave her the two eighteenpenny-tokens; Margaret gave them to me. Catherine took the money for them. I then left them; I went to the officers in Tottenham-court-road, Mr. Burton and Mr. Craig: I went to the public-house where they were; I knew they were there, because I left them there. I gave the shillings to Burton. I went into Mulvey's lodgings with the officers; we knocked at the window, and the door was opened by

I furnished her in the morning of the 11th of May, with two eighteenpenny-pieces; before that, I searched her, and ascertained that she had no other money, neither good, nor bad. Craig was in company with me. Craig, she, and I, went towards Shropshire-place, Pancrass-street; I stopped at a public-house at the corner of the street; the woman went away; I sent her. I stood there better than half or three quarters of an hour before she returned; we then went to Mulvey's house; I then told Mrs. Mulvey I must see what she had about her; and she said, do you think I have got any bad money about me, with that, she took out of her pocket three eighteenpenny-pieces, a shilling, and three halfpence, and jinked them on the hearth stone, and said, you hear they are good. I then told her to give them to me. She did, and I found two of the eighteenpenny-pieces were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100006"/>the two which I had given to the last witness to purchase these with. I then searched her pockets; but she had nothing else. I then searched the room; I found two papers of cream of tartar, and a quantity of blanks of the size of a shilling, in an unfinished state; four were the size of a shilling, and four the size of a sixpence; they were pinned up in one of the bottom corners of the window curtain I then searched the table-drawer, and found two files with brass in the teeth of them; I found a pair of scissors, but there is nothing on them. I also found a quantity of clippings of copper in a little bag; I found a bottle on the shelf, with nothing in it, and I found an old tea-pot, with a quantity of salt in it; and in the room, I found a quantity of rags, some wet and some dry; they are stained with something; I found a little tin pot in the cupboard, which had a strange smell; I found a small stamp with the letter A upon it. I found nothing else. Craig and I conveyed the woman to the watchhouse. I locked the door, and took the key in my pocket. Before I left the room, I saw a boy of the name of Rowley; he and his father went to the watchhouse. I locked the room door, and fastened the window. We returned in the course of a quarter of an hour, we found the room as I had left it. While we were there, I saw Rowley and his father; Rowley's father gave me twenty-nine counterfeits, and the boy gave me one. I afterwards saw 
               <persName id="t18160710-3-person83">Margaret</persName>
             M'Manus on the next evening, about ten o'clock; I saw her at the corner of East-street, Paddington-street, at the watering-house. I have applied this punch to several of the finished shilling, to some of those which I received from the last witness, the mark on them appears to be such as is made with this punch. I have applied the punch also to those given me by Rowley's father, and the mark is the same, and I believe it to be made by that punch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Margaret. Was I in the house when you first came, I came in for my bonnet?</p>

               <p>Witness. I did not see her at first; but when I turned round, I saw her.</p>

               <p>Examined by the COURT. I had marked the eighteenpenny-pieces with a small cross on their edges.</p>

               <p>WILLAM CRAIG. I went with Burton to apprehend the prisoners; I went in company with the two last witnesses to the house in Shropsh re-place. The woman knocked at the window, and the man rushed out. I was behind, and could not see if a blow was given to Burton; Burton told me to secure him; I went after him, and as I was going down the court, I saw the window opened, and a quantity of things like shillings thrown out; I was busily ingaged with the man, whom I took, and was bringing back. I searched him, and found five three-shilling pieces, two shillings, and some halfpence. I took the man to Pancrass watchhouse. I then returned to the prisoners's lodging alone. I found these blanks in the table drawer, some not round. In a box at the other end of the room, I found a paper with seven pieces of mettal in it. In different parts of the room I picked up pieces of sand paper, more immediately near the fire place, which appeared to have been used for working mettal; I found also a pair of scissors, pinchers, and a hammer, which are all slightly discoloured with mettal.</p>

            's Defence. About six o'clock on this said Saturday evening, the prosecutrix came in and sat down; I don't think Mulvey was there. She asked me for some of these shillings, and asked me for six of them, and I told her, she knew I had none; and then her sister said, Poll, I have got plenty, and then she returned to me, and gave me two eighteenpenny pieces; and I said, what do you give the money to me for; and she said, if my husband knows I have got money, he will get it from me, and I don't like to take it home; and at that same time, I returned them on the table, and she said, she must not take it, as her husband was very scarce always in giving her money. Then the sister after that, know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100007"/>ing she owed me eight shillings, which I lent her to go and see her husband, who was on board the Hulks, contrived to give me the two eighteen-penny-tokens; and the moment: Mrs. Harbour saw me put the money in my pocket, she goes out, and fetches in the officers, they laid the plan of bringing these things into my appartment. I never took the money from her, but received it from her sister; she herself has been convicted, Mr. Powell knows, of uttering bad money, and does it stand to reason, that if Margaret sold these things to her, why not pay her the money.</p>

               <p>Mr. Powell. Re-examined. Mrs. Harbour came to me voluntary, and without any imputation against her; I had no charge against her at all; she was acquitted once, as only being in company with her sister, who was uttering bad money,</p>

I had not observed him on the opposite side of the way; I have every reason to suppose he ran from a door against which he stood. The push was violent; I did not fall by it; it moved me from the position I was in; it moved me on one side. I immediately hallooed out to the watchman, and called stop thief. The watchman called stop thief; I did not at all perceive the countenance of the person who ran up to me in this way; the person who was running from me, I lost sight of. He was pursued, and taken within two or three minutes; I learned that he was taken, and that my watch was safe. I have had my watch ever since. The watch was delivered to me the next day by the officer; it is worth fifteen pounds. The person I found in custody was the prisoner; he was a stranger to me quite. I was quite sensible of what was going on.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner in the evening of the 7th of April; I saw the prosecutor that evening also. I did not see him before the complaint of being robbed; I first heard he was robbed, about ten minutes before eleven o'clock that night. I saw the prisoner cross upon Mr. Wood; he walked over to him; I was then about ten yards behind them, and expected there was something going forward. The prisoner was alone; I kept my eye on him. A scuffle ensued between the two parties; he caught hold of him, as I suppose. The prisoner, as I suppose, by the collar, and I saw his arm drawn, and I expected he had a watch at the same time; I did not see what it was. Mr. Wood cried thief, several times. Petticoat-lane is partly in the City, and partly in the County. That part were they were was in the County part. I proceeded after the prisoner; I saw his person many times before; I went after him when there was a call of stop thief; I lost sight of him for a short time, but caught it again; he was the only person who ran at the cry of stop thief. I laid hold of him in a turning which leads out of Petticoat lane into Gullstone-street. When I was about two yards behind him, I saw him stoop, and he put the watch down in the corner of a step of a door; it was a moon-light night, and when he had taken his hand from the place,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100008"/>I saw the watch glisson; I perceived it was a watch. I caught hold of him immediately; he asked me what was the matter, and I did not make him any reply, but secured him. I stooped down, and picked up the watch; it was the same watch which was afterwards returned to the prosecutor. I then brought him into Petticoat-lane, and took him to Aldgate watchhouse. The prosecutor came up in three or four minutes. I shewed the watch to the prosecutor, and he owned it to be his, as the watch he had been robbed of.</p>



               <p>Joseph Wood. Re-examined. I was very much in liquor, I will allow; I have no knowledge of the man taking hold of my collar. I know there was something of a scuffle, and in that scuffle, I lost my watch.</p>

               <p>Q. You admitted that you were the worse for liquor, but said that you knew what was going on. Now have you ever said, at any time, or in any place, that you were seized by the collar - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you be so seized without knowing it at the time - A. It might have taken place without my remembering it; as to being collared, I don't recollect it.</p>

               <p>CHARLES HAMBLETON. I am a watchman. Just before eleven o'clock, I was standing against the door; I observed Mr. Wood standing opposite me, with his chain and seals hanging showey out. There was a man stood along side of me; I don't know who he was; be seemed to take greatnotice of Mr. Wood, very much. I then saw Mr. Wood advance towards Whitechapel, on the right hand side. This man rushed into the Black Lion, and then the prisoner came out; the prisoner was not the man who stood by me; I knew him well before; I had seen him very often about the place, As soon as I saw him go forward, I called to Kinley, and said, that gentleman will lose his watch before he goes any farther. I had a light in my lanthorn, a candle was pretty fresh, and the moon shone pretty light. Kinley called me back, and said stop with your light, I will go forward. I did not go forwards enough to see what was done. I heard the cry of stop thief; he was not quite in my sight then; nor was Mr. Wood quite. I stopped momentarily, for I knew which direction they would take. I heard Kinley's rattle spring, and came up directly, and the next I saw of the prisoner was when he had hold of him. The prisoner came out of the Black Lion alone, and crossed the way alone.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent. There was a cry of stop thief, or something of that, and I was running with the others, and there was a man near where the property was found.</p>

While I was in the crowd looking at the ruins, I felt my coat pulled very tight, and on looking down, saw my seals in one of this boy's hands, and the scissors in the other. He immediately threw them on the ground. and I held him fast while I picked them up; they were my seals; the ribbon had been cut. I handed the prisoner and the seals over to an officer.</p>

            . I am a corporal in the 3rd Guards. On the evening of the day in the indictment, I went with some of my comrades to celebrate the Anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, to a house in <placeName id="t18160710-10-crimeloc46">St. Catherine's-lane</placeName>

                        targets="t18160710-10-off45 t18160710-10-crimeloc46"/>; the deceased, Benjamin Twigg, was with me; it was a little after then o'clock; there were a good many soldiers with us, there were twenty or more. While we were sitting in the house, the prisoner at the bar came in; we were in the tap-room at the time we fell out with the prisoner; he forced himself into our company, and we refused him. He wanted to get some beer to drink, and we refused him. We told him to be off, because we would not have any Foreigners among us. He did not go; he would not. He told us that he was an English man, and would not go away. We told him to be off, for we would have nothing to do with him. We ordered him out of the door. Upon that, he refused, and some of the soldiers turned him out; not in a manner to hurt him at all; I can't say Twigg was one; I can't say he was not. He did not say any thing to the prisoner. The prisoner did not come in again; it was ten minutes before I saw him again. Twigg went out; I followed him soon after, almost directly; I saw Twigg and the prisoner close together in the lane; I saw the deceased fall; before that, I did not see any thing done by him. I did not see him strike the prisoner, or any thing of that kind; I am not sure he did not strike him. I was within five yards of them. I saw the figures of two men in short; the soldier was not dressed in scarlet; I was near enough to see one lift his hand to the other, if he had done so; but I did not take any notice. I saw Twigg heel back; on seeing him fall, I jumped up the prisoner, and he made a blow at me. I discovered that the two persons I saw were Twigg and the prisoner. Twigg groaned out when he fell. When I came up, the prisoner struck me; he made a back handed blow at me, and I felled him with my left, and seized him with my right hand. The blow he made at me, cut me; it was such a cut as could not be done without some sharp instrument. I secured the prisoner, and there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100009"/>was a man came up, and took him to the watchhouse. I did not say any thing to the prisoner, nor he to me. I went to the watchhouse; but did not go in. I did not see what became of Twigg, the deceased.</p>

               <p>Prisoner, (by interpretation.) Q. Do you say I struck you?</p>

               <p>Witness. Yes; he struck me in the street, after Twigg fell.</p>

            . I am also a soldier in the Guards. I went to this house with some of my companions who were at Waterloo; the deceased was of the party; we went about half past nine; there was a good many. I did not see the prisoner there; I had seen him in the course of the day; he has lost one of his arm; it was about four o'clock in the afternoon that I saw him. He had a fork screwed to the stump of his arm, it screws into the top of the arm; I took that from him, because he was breaking the doors open with it, and abusing the people in the lane The deceased was not with me then. The prisoner was in liquor, but not drunk. About half past nine, I and my comrades were in the house. I recollect the deceased going out to buy some tobacco; I saw there was a row just opposite the White Lion soon after, and there I found Twigg laying there; I thought it was from liquor that made him lay there at first; he was twenty or thirty yards above the White Lion. He was laying down; he was wounded, as I discovered afterwards; I directly went up to him; he was laying with his face up, I believe; he was put on my back; he was not able to get up himself to go to any place, and I took him to the Guard-room at the Mint; that was about fifty yards, or more. He said something while he was on my back; but I could not tell what it was, I did not understand him. I laid him down when I brought him to the Guardroom; he continued there until the surgeon came; he was the same man the surgeon saw.</p>

               <p>DAVID EVANS. I am a surgeon; I live in that neighbourhood. I was called in to examine the deceased, on the 20th, two days after the murder, it was before the Coroner. He was wounded a little below the navel; it is my opinion that, that wound was the occasion of his death. It appeared to be done with a sharp instrument; it was three inches deep; a portion of the omentum protruded through the lacerated integuments; it had reached the intestimes, but not to wound them.</p>

            . I am a police officer. I conveyed the prisoner from Aldgate watchhouse to the police office. As I went along, I had a conversation with him. I asked him where the knife was; (for I had searched him at the watchhouse, and found none.) he said, he had no knife. I asked him how he came to commit the murder; and he said, he did not commit it; that was directly after I asked him for his knife. He was taken, and examined before the magistrate. He was asked what he had to say; whatever he said, I believe the clerk did not put down. He said, he was drunk and mad, and did not know what he did.

When I was at the public-house, three soldiers fell upon me, beating me about the head, and when they took me to prison, all my head was swelled, and I had two black eyes. I lost all my money and my knife. I was at Greenwich; where I have been eight years, and I received twentyeight pounds to go home to my own Country; and they robbed me of all my money.

I had occasion to go to the privy in the yard to throw some water down, on the Saturday before the Coroner's Inquest was holden; I observed part of a child's leg and thigh under the grating; it must have been put down the hole of the privy; the grating belongs to a drain which communicates with the privy. This was in the morning. When my husband came home, I informed him what I had seen; he went out; and brought in the body of the child; it was a male child. I observed that the navel-string was not tied as it usually is by medical men and nurses after delivery. The body was quite putrid, and must have been dead some time; how long, I could not judge. The people of the next adjoining house use this privy.

            's wife's bed. The prisoner appeared to be very poorly when I first went; she appeared to be very bad; but nothing as I thought dangerous. She complained of a pain in her bowels, Before that time, I had never been informed that she was pregnant. Upon her complaining of this pain, I went as soon as I thought the apothecary's shops were open, to get some castor oil, but the shops were not open. I did not at that time believe her to be in labour. I was gone about ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I found her worse on my return; her sister was sitting on the bed by her, and I sit down by her also, and she seemed very much agitated, and in a great deal of pain. She took hold of my hand, and grased it, and her sister's, and she said, God will help me, and has helped me. Then she said, I am better, for it has come from me; and I said, what come from you, in the consternation I was in; she made answear and said, I don't know mother; but I believe a child. On that account, I looked to see what it was, and on turning down the bed clothes, found it was a male dead child; it appeared like a child that had gone its full time; there were marks of recent delivery on it, and in the bed. When my son-in-law came home, he was very much surprised, and said, what should we do with it; I had put it into a dry chamber-pot, which stood by. My son-in-law said, mother, what shall we do; we must get a box, and bury the child; that was first agreed upon. I said, I did not know what to do; the best way will be to hide the child, and nobody will know any thing about it, to hide the shame of the girl. I don't know whether he saw the body of the child; he did not say what way to hide it. It was taken into the yard; I took it from the room, and carried it to where it was found in the privy; I put it down the privy. As near as I can guess, it was near nine o'clock. My daughter was not told what was done with the child.</p>



               <p>JOHN PARTRIDGE. My wife is not able to come out; she was brought to bed last Wednesday was a week. I got up just before five that morning; my wife told me to get up, and go call her mother, as she had heard

             all night; I proposed to them, and told them, that the child ought to be buried in a proper manner; I told them that it would bring disgrace on my own family, and they might do what they liked with it, and throw it down the privy if they liked. I did not see the prisoner after it was born. My mother took it through to the privy while I was at breakfast. I never suspected what was the matter with the prisoner,</p>

On the 1st of June last, I was sitting facing a large looking-glass in the parlour at my dinner, and in that looking-glass I could see a great part of the shop. I happened to look into the glass, and saw a woman in the shop. I went to see what she wanted, and it proved to be the prisoner at the bar; she was about a foot and a half into the shop; she had her face towards me, not as if advancing farther; she stopped, and I asked her what she wanted; she asked the way to Westminster; no other person was in the shop at that time; I told her the way. She left me; I then turned round to go into the parlour again, and perceived a piece of flannel was missing off some wooden steps, which stood about three feet and a half within the shop, quite within. I had seen that flannel when I went into my dinner. On missing it, I went after the prisoner; I overtook her about four doors from our house; I took hold of her arm, and I thought I saw something under her clothes; she had no cloak, and I found this piece of flannel there. I got hold of her, and in leading her back, she said, don't push me, and I told her to deliver up the flannel, and she did so; she gave it me just before we got to our house. I have the flannel here; there are six yards; it cost above eighteen pence a yard; it would sell for a greater price.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the flannel, and there was another woman coming out at the door when I picked it up.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I live in Mile-end-road. On Sunday morning, the 9th of June, I got up between four and five o'clock; I went and threw my sash up, and threw the shutters back; I saw some persons on the same side of the way as my own house; there might be ten or a dozen men standing in the street; they had got the prosecutor between them, hustling him. I then saw John Watts come towards my house; he came from the others, and had a watch in his hand; that I saw; it was a silver watch; he had an apron before him, and seemed as if he was putting it into the apron; the other man, Edmonds, was with the others, endeavouring to keep the prosecutor back; he was on the outside of the party that was round the prosecutor; he was standing still, and looking towards Watts, said, push it, Jack. I am sure the prisoner Edmonds said so; I had a full opportunity of seeing him. I saw this out of my parlour window.</p>

               <p>Cross examined by MR. BARRY. All the parties were totaliy strangers to me. My husband was constable of the night; he asked me if I could describe the person who got the watch; and I said, I could. I know there are such things as rewards. I have heard of such a thing, but not from my husband.</p>

I saw him again on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100012"/>Friday at about eleven o'clock; I know nothing of the prisoner with respect to it.

            . I was at work with this horse on the 17th of June; I went home with him about three o'clock. I saw him about nine o'clock on that day. The next morning, the man who looks after the team, went to the stable first; I went between five and six, and saw that it was broken open. I had locked it the over night, that I am sure of; I carried the key in doors, and hung it up as usual. I know the prisoner at the bar; I did not know him before the horse was lost. I did not go with my master to Mr. Ing's.</p>

            . Mr. Ing is my master, and my uncle; he is a cow-keeper. I and Mr. Ing were at the Grafton Head, the corner of the yard, on Wednesday morning, the 19th of June. The prisoner and another man came in, and the prisoner asked Mr. Ing if he had any place that he could put his horse in; he said, yes, and came out to the door, and he sent me down to take the horse in; I took him down the yard, and the prisoner went with me. The horse was in harness in a cart; I unharnessed him. and we took the collar off, and hung it up in the stable. The prisoner bid me give him a quartern of oats, which I did. After that, he asked me if I would go up and have any thing to drink, and I said, yes, I would, and I went up, and got something to drink, and the other man was there; they had a bowl of gin and milk; nobody paid for it. After this, the prisoner came down the yard again, and ordered me to give the horse another quartern of oats. I did not see the prisoner or the other man after that. I never saw the prisoner again until the next morning. My master went up to Mr. Roffey's, not this Mr. Roffey, his brother. The next morning the prisoner came to fetch the horse and cart away, and I was ordered, if he came, to get some body to help me to secure him. He said, he wanted the horse out directly, and while he was gone to a certain place, I sent for a constable; then I gave him into the hands of the constable. I was ordered directly to fetch the officers from Bow-street.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SQUIBB. I am watchhouse-keeper, and apprehended the prisoner. I went up to him as he came out of the privy, and said, my friend, is this cart, and the horse belonging to it yours; and he said yes, it is. In consequence of that, I said, there is a very strong suspicion that it is not yours, and I must detain you; and I said Mr. Goodwin, you assist me to take this man to the watchhouse. In his left hand waistcoat pocket, I found this pistol, loaded; it is not loaded now; there was a ball in it, and powder; and there was ball and powder enough for another load or two.</p>

               <p>George Hughes. I have been to look at the horse; it is now down at the door; that is the horse that the prisoner brought in the morning of the 19th; I have the collar in my hand.</p>

            . I have been down to see the horse, it is mine; it is one that was lost from the stables on the morning of the 18th.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the first place, the constable said that pistol was loaded, and it was not; neither are those two balls that are there, mine. Another thing, the ostler says that nobody brought the cart in but me; but the owner of the cart took it out himself. I am a total stranger. The first time I saw this cart was at Battle Bridge, on Tuesday, about the middle of the day; the man was offering it for sale, and I believe the person who was looking at it, would have bought it, only he said, he had another one making. Then after that, the owner went on with his cart. I went to the person who was about buying it, and the man said, if he could get it for fifteen or sixteen pounds, it would be a bargain. The next time I saw it was when the owner was coming from Cambden Town, coming from the New-road to Tottenham-court-road, and I said, hoy; have you sold your cart; and he said, no; and I said, stop, and I will buy it of you if we can agree; and he said, very well, wait a minute or two; and I waited a bit, and he returned again, and we agreed for fifteen pounds, and I paid thirteen pounds down, twelve pounds in notes, and one in silver, and I told him I would give him the rest if he would go up to my cousin's, and he said, very well, and we put the cart in, and then he came back again, and we waited, and then came another person, who lived handy there, and paid him some money, and I thought he well knew him, and he paid him down some money, three or four pounds; I understood that he kept an iron shop, and that he brought it from his own home. When he got to my cousin's, I asked him to take the rest of the money, and he asked me my name, and where I lived, and all that, and I said, I would come and meet him.</p>



               <p>- KENTON. I am a sawyer; I live up by Lord's cricket-ground, near Paddington. I know the prisoner; all I know of him is seeing him along with his brother; I know him by sight.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him any where on the morning of the 19th of June-A. I don't know the day of the month, but I saw him in Tottenham-court-road, Wednesday three weeks, yesterday, it was between six and seven o'clock in the morning, and in Tottenham-court-road. As I was crossing the top of Tottenham-court-road, I saw him looking round a cart; that cart had a horse to it; there was a tall stout man, and the prisoner, with that cart. I heard the prisoner say the cart was not worth so much money; it was fifteen pound that he said was two much; he said the cart was very much out of repair, and would never run long. The other made answer, that sold it, and said, it would run for three months longer with very little repair. Then they walked round it a little bit, and then walked of the road on to the pavement. The prisoner said I have not enough to pay you now, but I will pay you some now, and settle the rest with you in the morning, or something to that purpose. He said, you meet me here at this public-house to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock; there was a public-house not far off, he pointed towards it, and said, I will settle with you, and you will get a stamp for a receipt. I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100013"/>pull his money out, it consisted of notes; he said, here is twelve pounds in paper, and here is one pound in silver. I saw the prisoner give that money to the man.</p>

               <p>MARY GATES, I am a widow; I live in Thomas's-buildings, Somers Town, at the top of Phoenix-street. The prisoner at the bar has lodged with me; he took my lodging on the 1st of May, Wednesday. He lodged with me until he was taken up; he slept at home the night before he was taken up, and the night before that; he never slept out of his lodging since he has had it; he went to bed at about half past ten on the night of the 17th; he came in about seven, and continued at home from seven until he went to bed, and never went out of doors, and at half past ten he went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he continued in the house until the next morning - A. I am certain of it.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did he go out the next morning - A.About nine.</p>

On the evening of the 19th of June, at about half past eight, the prisoner was talking to a lodger of mine at the door, and asked to go into the parlour with him, as he had something particular to say; they went in; and after they had gone about a quarter of an hour, I missed my watch; it was most usually hung over the mantle piece in the parlour; but whether I left it there, or whether in the privy. I don't know. The lodger was a female lodger; she is a distant relation of my wife, and was out of place then; she is in service now. She went into the parlour with the prisoner, and came out first, leaving him. When the prisoner was apprehended, about half past eleven the same night, he acknowledged he had been in my parlour; but denied taking the watch. The outside-case of the watch was found in his waistcoat pocket; the other part in his other pocket.</p>

I saw the watch on the seat on the necessary, and I took it up to look at it, and being rather intoxicated, I let the case drop, and put it in one pocket, and the body of the watch in the other, with intent to give them to the owner of the house; but, being so drunk, I forgot it, and I quite forgot having it in my possession when I was sober. If I had taken it with any fraudulent intent, I had plenty of time to make away with it; but I forgot entirely that I had it.</p>

On Wednesday evening, the 12th of June, I was up late, I was drinking in the early part of the evening; I was some what in liquor; but was sensible of what I was doing. I went into a coffee-shop about two o'clock in the morning, in the neighbourhood of Clare-market; I had some coffee there; there was a good many people there; they were intirely strangers to me; there have been two of them to my house. The prisoner was in the coffee-shop. We went in together. He accested me first in the street; he had some sort of conversation with me, and seeing this place open, we went in to have some coffee, and we drank it together. I staid there a short time, half or quarter of an hour. I went first out; I had paid for the coffee for both. We sat next to each other. I remember when I paid for the coffee, I took out all my silver to see if I had a sixpence. I went out first; he followed me out, and made up to me almost directly; he came up to me, and gave me a blow on the front of my head, and knocked me against the wall, and thrust his hand into my pocket, and took every farthing in the world that I had, and did not leave me a halfpenny. He stupified me for a moment; but I directly called out, when he ran away; I told the watchman, and every one I met, what had happened. I went back to the coffee-shop, and told the people there; I described the man to them, and somebody in the shop gave me some information where I should be likely to find the prisoner; they asked me if I would go with them to Fleet-market, and they would find him; but I declined going, as I had no hat; and then they told me to stop where I was. While I was there, they went; and one of them then came back, and gave me some information; in consequence of which, I went with him, and saw the prisoner; he saw me, and escaped out of the market; I followed him into Holborn-hill, and there he got into a tobacco shop; I went over to him, and saw my hat on his head. I asked him what he was doing with my hat on his head, and he said, it was not mine; I said, it was. I also asked him where my money was that he took out of my pocket; and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100014"/>said, he did not take any out of my pocket. He then shuffled out of the shop, and got away again, with the hat on his head; I ran after him, and overtook him; he ran through the cross courts, and I overtook him in Poppins's-court, Fleet-street; he fell down; when I overtook him; I took hold of his two wrists, and the hat fell off his head, and fell down, and he said, he had none of my property; he said, he would murder me if I did not let him go; and I told him, I was in a good case, and was not afraid of him; and he was in a bad one, and all I wanted, was my own. Some people went and fetched an officer, Mr. Cresswell, the street - keeper of Fleet-street. The hat was laying at the prisoner's feet when the officer came. This was about half past seven, or a little after. I had had some liquor; but I am perfectly sure that he is the person who struck me in the street.</p>

            . I was called to Poppin's-court, and found the prosecutor and the prisoner there. There was a hat laying about three feet from them, and the prosecutor had the prisoner by both wrists. The prosecutor told me what mark I should find in the hat before I took it up; he mentioned three or four particular marks, as if done with a bodkin; I took up the hat, and found those marks in it; I have kept it over since; it was in my own sight the whole time, close to myself; I observed the forehead of the prosecutor, the forehead and nose were very red, as if they had had a blow.</p>

            . I am a constable, and street - keeper of the Ward of Aldersgate. On the 20th of May, I was in company with Block and Pelliam, in Little Britain. Brock came to me in Aldersgate-street; when we three were in company, we went to Augel-alley, Moor-lane; this was between two and three o'clock; we went to a house which had no number. Petham led us to that house; we went up stairs first, and he could not find out the exact room; we then went away, and hid ourselves; and then he came and beckoned us, and we returned, we went up into the two pair, we went into a room where the three prisoners were. I secured them myself; they were setting on their bottoms; they were all three sitting in a row, colouring shillings; they had a piece of mettal rubbing it with white colour; that white colour was on their fingers; each was so employed. I secured the two tallest, and clapped the two handcuffs on them, and told them not to resist. I have got the three that they were colouring; they flung them down.</p>

               <p>Q.Which is which - A. I don't know, I am sure that out of the number you now hold in your hand, three of them are what fell from the three men. The rest I picked off the boards; they were laying in front of them. Brock secured the third man. We afterwards searched the room. I found them laying before them, and by the side of them. Amongst them, there was a phial full of aquafortis, and here is one here which has had it in; aquafortis was in that phial. Here are nine uncoloured blanks, and eight shillings wrapped up in Roerdon's waistcoat pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have seen the little man, Quinn, at the time of Mr. Duncan's new house being built; as for the other two, I don't know them. They said that a man had gone out with two shillings to buy them some dinner, and after we secured them, they wished us to stay to see if he would come back.</p>

             POWELL. I am assistant to the solicitor of the Mint. I have looked over the articles, sand-paper, bason containing the mixture, the blanks, and the phial, which smells of aquafortis. There are materials sufficient to produce the colour of silver on these blanks. I look at the blanks in question; they are of a size to resemble the Current Coin of this realm, called shillings; all of them are the same.</p>

            . Re-examined. They look something yellowish.</p>

               <p>Mr. Powell. Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Putting them into the water takes off the action of the solution, which if it were not for the water, always turns them yellow, and the water takes away that discolouring quality.</p>

               <p>Q. There is a metalic material imparted to the blanks, and that is confined by the aquafortis; but unless they are afterwards washed with water, they turn yellow - A.Certainly.</p>



               <p>Q.Therefore the colour to continue, so as to be issued into the World, ought to be washed in water - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Re-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. The colouring gives it a silver colour; but to fix it, it requires water.</p>

               <p>JOHN NICOLL. I am one of the moneyers of his Majesty's Mint. I look at the three which fell from the prisoners; they were never issued by the Mint.</p>

               <p>Quinn's Defence. (By interpretation, for he spoke in Irish.) On the morning that I was taken, I left my house, I went to Cheapside Market, where all Irish labourers look for employment as bricklayer's labourers. When we went to the market, we remained there until seven o'clock, and there was a man came up to us, and asked us if we wanted any employment, and of course we said yes; and so we went with that man; he said, he could not send us to work until after nine. We went down to the lodging, and stopped until after nine. I had only a bit of dry bread for my breakfast. After that, the man told us to come to Cripplegate Church, and we waited for the man, and then he told us to go along<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100015"/>with him, and he brought us up in the two pair in Angel-alley; we were there a few minutes before the man shewed us what employment he was going to give us; then he brought a piece of copper, and a large pair of scissors, and a file; he shewed us then what we were to do with these things. When we saw what colour he brought, we did not like to do it. The man said, he would give us our dinner that day; the man is now taken prisoner. I left some of these pieces on the floor. After the man was gone, the officers came in, and hand-cuffed us. I asked the constable to stop a few minutes to see if the man would return; but the man did not.</p>

On the 22nd of May last, in consequence of my attention having been directed to the middle drawer of my sister's dressing-glass, in which the trinkets and jewellery that I seldom wore were deposited; I perceived it was shut; but the bolt stood up, and prevented it from going into its place; it had been opened by some violence. I missed several things from that dawer, and among others the diamond ring and brooch in question.</p>

He came to me on the evening of the 22nd of May, between seven and eight o'clock; he brought this ring, and said, he wanted ten pounds on it for his father; I told him that was more than it would do for, and I said, I would give him six pounds; he said, that would not do; but he would go and ask his father; I then saw him go to another pawnbrokers. In two days after, he came again; then he said, that would do; but I was not inclined to lend him so much, and I lent him five pounds, twelve shillings, and sixpence.</p>

             WILSON. I know the drawer from which the jewellery in question was taken. I cannot speak positively to its state of safety previous to the loss. After this lad was taken up, I had a conversation with him. Messrs. Watson and Chappel sent for me, to inform me that the prisoner was then at their house. I went down there; I found the boy there. In his presence I said, that that ring and the other articles were stolen from my house, and that in consequence of the information given to me, I apprehended that a ring which he had offered at Messrs. Watson's, answered the description of the one that had been stolen. I asked him what he had done with that ring, and he said, he had returned it to his mother. I asked him where his parents lived, and who were his employers; he told me he was in the employ of Mr. Brown, at St. Mary's hill, and that his parents lived in Sloaue-street, Chelsea. Not wishing to cast any doubt on the prisoner's character with his employers, I abstained from going to St. Mary's Hill, and prefered going to Sloaue-street. The prisoner assented to his accompanying me and the pawnbroker's man in a coach to a house in Sloane-street, which on our arrival at it, by his direction, we found to be empty. I sat in the coach with the prisoner, while the pawnbroker's man went to a shop on the other side of the street, to make some inquiries. The result was that the house had been shut for three months. The person of the shop where the inquiry was made, sent his errand boy to ride on the coach-box to the landlord of the empty house, who resided at Brompton, whom I found at home. I asked him if any one could have occasionally slept at the empty house, and he said no one could have acces to it, because the key was in his own possesssion. Finding the boy had told me that falsehood, I determined to have him taken into custody; not knowing whether he should be given into the charge of an officer of the County or of the City, I went to Bow-street, and in consequence of the advice given me by the magistrate, I had the prisoner apprehended by a City officer, and he was taken to Giltspur-street Compter. In his way thither he retracted what he had said with respect to having the ring from his mother, and he said, he had it from one Singleton, who, he stated, lived at the house of Messrs. Finch and Co. in Skinner-street, Snow-hill. No person of the name of Singleton lived there. The prisoner was taken before the Alderman on the next Monday, and Singleton attended, and is here to day.</p>

               <p>LEE SINGLETON. I live in Newington, with my father. I know the prisoner at the bar, and have known him about fifteen months; I have known him when my father was unfortunate, and in the King's Beach. I look at that ring; the prisoner never had it from me; nor did I ever see it before I saw it at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>(Property produced, and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Singleton gave me the ring, and I pledged it for him; I was not aware it was stolen.</p>

               <p>-SQUIRE. I never saw Singleton but twice in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100016"/>my life. I saw him in company with the prisoner about a week before Easter; they came together to my counting house where I was in Castle-court, Biching-lane; I was out when they came at first; they brought two rings; they were only guilt ones; they were cheap articles, and Singleton appeared as the proprietor of them. After that time, I did not see either of them until the 22nd of May, and then I saw the ring in Hawkins's possession. I had no dealing with Singleton.</p>

The next time I saw her was in Smithfield, and I knew her very well.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WEBB. I am a dealer in horses. I was at Redbourne on Wednesday, the 5th of June; that is about four miles from St. Alban's; I saw the prisoner there, on the mare in question; I will swear to it; I saw him about half a mile on the other side of Redbourne, between Redbourne and Market-street; he was riding towards London; but turned up a lare, I believe on account of seeing me; that laue only leads into fields. I was on horseback myself; I hed no conversation with him; and I saw him again on this side of Barnet. The mare was very much fatigued; it might be two hours before I saw him the second time. The distance from Baruet to Redbourne is about fourteen miles. I had no conversation with him then; he kept on the road to London; he continued going towards London, and I passed him. I saw no more of him that day. I came to London. I was in Smithfield on the morning of Friday; I think soon after two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner on the mare; he had got her there for sale; he was riding her about for sale. I am sure the mare I saw him on at Smithfield, was the same I saw him with at Redburne and Barnet. I went and asked the price of her; he asked twenty guineas for her; twenty guineas in the state she was then, was a good price for her. She was very much cut up, and looked as if she had been hard ridden; I agreed to give him twelve pounds for her; and I took him to the toll-book to hare her booked; and I told him he must find a voucher before I could pay him for her, as I was not satisfied she was his property; he went and brought a voucher. He first told me his name was

He said, he lived at Grimley, near Market Halborough. I saw the mare was about three years old. I found him in various stories. At first he said, he had had it three years, and afterwards he said it was his uncle's. I left the mare at the Ram. Worrall was in the room, and I gave him charge of the prisoner, on account of his various stories. I don't know whether he saw me with the mare.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Whit-Monday, I was at Hinckley-fair, and I went into the sign of the Ram about five o'clock, and I fell into conversation with a person about coming to London, and I said, if I could get a horse any where, I would go to London myself; and John Jameson said to me he had a horse to let; upon which, I asked him what he would let me have it for ten days or a fortnight for; he said four pounds, and I offered to give him three pounds down, and one pound when I returned. I staid there until about nine o'clock, and I agreed to this man to bring this horse to Southeol, which is about seven miles off the Fair; he was to bring it on the Tuesday morning, and put it into Mr. Messing's field, which was a friend of mine. The next morning about six o'clock, I took a bridle and saddle to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100017"/>see if the mare was there, and I found her there I then came to my uncle's at Knighton; he asked me where I was going, and I said, I was going to see a friend at London. He said, I think you ride your mare too hard; don't ride her so hard. Then I went to Northampton, and staid there all night, and came to London about eight o'clock the next day, and put her up at Riding-house-lane; and on the Friday following, I went through Smithfield, and this horse-dealer Webb, whom I had seen on the road, asked me to go into a house to have something to drink, and tie my horse up with his, which I did; and I called for some beer, and after that I had some liquors, and ram and water, until I was very much intoxicated, and this horse-dealer pulled out ever so many bank notes, and said, now I have got plenty of money, what would you like for your horse; and another horse-dealer pulled out ten guineas in gold, and I refused it, and I came out, and wanted by horse to go away, and they wanted me to have more liquor, and I said no, I would not have any more, and another said pay my reckoning before you go, and I refused; and the man said, give me the horse; and he tied it up at the Ram; and I was quite intoxicated in liquor, and did not know what I did.</p>

            . I live at Brackless-street, Barbican. I had been along way to the other end of the Town, to Oxford-street, to see a friend; it was on the 12th of June. I came home very late, between twelve and one; I could not get away before; it was a beautiful moon-light morning. I never saw the prisoner until he came up to me, which was at the top of <placeName id="t18160710-25-crimeloc112">Cow-lane, Smithfield</placeName>

At the top of Cow-lane, the prisoner came up to me, as I was going along, he came putting his hand on my shoulder, and I told him to go along about his business, and he would not go for some time; and I said, what do you want, what do you mean; if you don't go, I will screem out, and he immediately said hush; he immediately threw me down on the pavement; I don't think he was in liquor; he uatied my clerk at that time; it was tied before that time. I was down; but I could not struggle; I screamed out, and he heard a coach coming, so he ran off. I screamed out, and the coachman jumped off his box a good hit before the coach came up, and the coachman asked me what was the matter. The prisoner took the cloak with him; it was worth very little, it was not worth more than two or three shillings. He was puremed; I left the coachman, and ran after the prisoner, to see if I could find him; the prisoner had got out of sight. I went down as far as Snow-hill, and there saw him. I went down Hoster-lane, and saw him at the bottom of Snow-hill; I am positive he was the same man. I then gave the alarm; I saw him talking to three women, and I went up to him; I did not see my cloak. I charged him with the cloak, and asked him what he had done with it; and he said, he had got no cloak. I have neverseen it since. Then two of the three women went away directly, as fast as they could get away. I am very positive and confident that the prisoner is the man; he went a little way, and I said, if you do not give me my cloak, I will charge the watch with you; and then he walked on a little bit, and then ran away again; but he was secured that night.</p>

               <p>PATRICK CARNEY. I am a watchman, and apprehended the prisoner. The coachman the last witness spoke of, is not here. I took the prisoner at the foot of Holborn-bridge, in Swan-yard; there was a crowd there, and when I went by, I heard of the robbery, and followed the prisoner, and when I was following him, he ran across Snow-hill into Cock lane; he might have heard the charge. I sprang my rattle after him up Cock-lane, and he was not stopped there; but ran up one Mr. Munn's yard, up Cock-lane; I and the City patrole went into the yard, and secured him; he said nothing.</p>

               <p>-HORTON. I am a City patrole. I assisted the last witness in securing the prisoner at the bar. The charge was for robbing the woman. He was on his all fours in Mr. Munn's yards. I secured him. I then brought him to the watchhouse; I went back and saw the woman in the watchhouse, where there were ten or eleven people, and she pointed out the prisoner directly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lords and Gentlemen, I hope you will take into consideration my doleful situation, to be confined in a prison under irons for what I am not guilty of; I have been at work these twelve weeks past with Mr. Hemmings, who, if called upon, can give me a good character. On leaving my work on Tuesday evening, I proceeded to my lodging at Mr. Fitzeraid's, near John-street; but having a few words with him. I resolved to take lodgings else where, and for that purpose I went out of his house at twelve o'clock at night. Wherefore meeting with this woman, whom, to the best of my knowledge, I never saw before, she accused me of knocking her down, and taking her handkerchief from her some time before. Now, my lords and gentlemen of the jury, I hope you will take these few lines into consideration, as being in a strange Country, destitute of friends to speak for me, and I have no more to add.</p>

I went to the White Horse livery stables, in the City-road, on the 17th of last month, about ten in the morning;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100018"/>I found the poney there; how it had been brought there, I don't know.

             M'GHIE ESQ. I am the brother of the last witness. I know this poney. I know where it was at grass; I saw it at grass on Sunday, the 16th, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I saw it on the Monday morning following, about half past nine, or a quarter before ten; I saw it at the White Horse livery stables, in the City-road, when I rode into Town. While I remained there, the prisoner at the bar came for the poney; the hostler said something to me. I then spoke to the prisoner; I asked him where he got the poney he rode on that morning; that was just at the stable door. I pointed to the poney; he must know what poney I meant; he then said, he bought it on the Hampstead-road. I asked him of whom; and he said, of a butcher. I said it was my brother's poney. I think he said he bought it that morning at half past five, or half past six. After we stood a short time, he offered to give it up, on condition of my giving him the bridle and saddle; I did not do that. We stood talking to the hostler; and then he said, he would fetch the butcher. I told him he had better stay until my brother came, because he knew more about it. He said, the butcher was a fat man, with a green coat; he did not know his name. I think that was what he said. I am sure he said, he did not know his name. I asked him how he came to buy a poney of a man he did not know; and he said, he bought it, cheap, and gave six guineas and a half for it. I asked him to stay until my brother came. When my brother came, he said, he would hang him; then my brother sent for an officer; he said, he would pay any man who would go for an officer; he said that aloud in the yard. Great numbers of persons were assembled in the yard at this time. I beeckoned the prisoner to go, as the people said let the poor fellow go. I did not wish him to be hanged. He went before the officer came; I did not see him go; in the crowd he went away.</p>

            . I am assistant to the hostler at the White Horse livery stables. I look at the prisoner at the bar; he brought the poney in question, himself, at about half past six o'clock; I had seen him twice before; he ordered a quartern of corn, and two pennyworth of beaus for the poney, as another person would do; he went awayin about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I never saw the poney before. I was there when he came back. The younger Mr. M'Ghie rode in about half past nine. When the prisoner first came in, I said, you have a pretty poney there; he said, yes, what do you think I gave for it; I said, I don't know. In the result he told me he gave ten pounds ten shillings for sandle bridle and all. I should think it was worth that. I had seen him twice in the week previous; he was in the Star public-house.</p>

               <p>JOHN-. I am hostler. I was not at the stables when the prisoner was taken. A person came into the yard, and said, a person wanted to see me. I went, and took the officer with me to the Angel in Tabernacle-walk, about an hundred yards across the way. I asked the landlord if any one wanted me, and I saw the prisoner outside the house in the street; he was going to speak to me, and then I told the officer he was the man, and he apprehended him.</p>

               <p>BERNARD GLEED. I am the officer that took the prisoner into custody. I asked him where he bought the poney. I told him what I took him for, on suspicion of stealing Mr. M'Ghie's poney. I asked him where he bought it; and he said, by Primrose-hill, of a butcher; he said, he gave six pounds ten shillings in the whole for it. I asked him if he had any receipt to shew for it; and he said, none I asked him if he knew the man he bought it of; and he said, no. I searched him, and in his waistcoat he had a few halfpence, and in his coat pocket I found a pair of spurs.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, and I let of this man, and asked him what time the Yorkshire coach would come; and he said, he did not know any particular time. He was walking before me; and he said, are you going down to Yorkshire; and I yes; and he said. I had better ride the poney down, and I paid him six pounds ten shillings for it; there were plenty of people passing, and I paid him the six pounds ten shillings, and he did not tell me where he lived, and I did not inquire. I brought it to the White Horse, and put it up, and I remained there a little time, and the gentleman was there, and he said this is my poney, and he sent for his brother, and he came. The young gentleman told me to go away, and I went away, and when I came back, I was taken.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HULM. I lost this property on the 27th of June, the ribbon was cut with a pair of scissors, and the watch left behind. I was in <placeName id="t18160710-28-crimeloc129">Aldersgate-street</placeName>

I crossed over the street just to look at the ruins. I felt my coat bound very tight, and I immediately looked down, and saw the seals in one of this boy's hands, and the scissors in the other; he immediately threw them down, and I hold him fast while I stooped to pick them up; my ribbon had been cut. I delivered the boy to an officer.</p>

I left the clothes named in the indictment in the room in my chest, which was not locked. When I returned, the prisoner was gone, and my room door was locked, and the key was left with the landlady; I have never recovered my clothes again.</p>



               <p>DANIEL WATTS I live in Cable-street, St. George's in the East. The prisoner offered to sell me a blue coat, and white gown. The coat had yellow buttons, as the prosecutor has described it. I observed the size of the coat, and thought it was one that would it Dale. I asked him if the coat was his own; he said, it was. I asked him what made him sell it, and he said, he was very much distressed, and he said, the gown was his girls; I bought them of him. I saw him again afterwards. I told him go to some regular clothe's shop, and they could give him more than I could. He said he sold the coat to an old woman in Rosemary-lane; he said, he sold it for eight shillings, and some gin.</p>

            . I am an assistant elder at the Cutler street warehouse. The prisoner was also in the service of the company. On the 29th of June, the prisoner was up stairs repairing the wood work of a chest of tea, and on my going up to him, I observed him put the lead of the chest down quick. I asked him if that chest was open; he looked me in the face, and said, no. I immediately examined the chest, and the lead was cut, and that some tea was missing. I took the prisoner into the next room, and the quantity of tea stated in the indictment was found on him, in one pocket, there were two empty-bags. He has been in the service of the company twenty five years.</p>

               <p>PHORE STOUD. I am servant to Mrs. Stephens. On the 10th of June, in the morning, at about a quarter before eight o'clock, I discovered the prisoner in my master's Counting-house; that Counting-house is a part of the dwelling-house; it is the back parlour. The prisoner was stooping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100021"/>down when I saw him, and the clothes in question, which bad previously been hanging on a nail at the other side of the room, were close to him. He ran to get out at the gate, but I stopped him.</p>

He was walking up the hill, when I went after him, and he threw the property away. I stopped him, and asked him what was that covered up in the handkerchief; he made no answer; but kicked my legs, and tried to trip me up. I secured him, and gave him to an officer.

When I came down stairs, I found the doors were open; the street door and the bar door locks had been picked, and the lock of one of the tills was picked; the other till was not locked. I found no instruments. I missed three table-spoon, and four tea-spoons; two were marked J S B; one spoon was an old one, with a crest to it; that was some sort of a bird. I also lost one teaspoon marked J B three others marked J S A, they are mine, and the sugar tongs were marked J A B, and were belonging to my wife's first husband. I missed the money out of both tills; there was a great quantity of halfpence and farthings to the amount of nine or ten shillings. I saw these things the night before, before I went to bed. It was past two o'clock before I went to bed that morning, and I left these things in the cupboard in the bar. There was a silver mounted reading glass in the till, which was gone, and a patent cork-screw. I found a handkerchief, and a great number of things tied up in it, in the passage; among the things in that handkerchief, were two pieces of cheese, a piece of bacon, four pounds of currants, two pounds of tea, a shirt, and a waistcoat, and about a dozen pair of shoes, which were old, and brought down stairs to be repaired. There is a mark T C on the handkerchief. The prisoner had lodged in my house nearly a year and a half; he always went by the name of

            ; he lodged at the top of the house. The shirt, waistcoat, and shoes are not here. In consequence of this, I took the bundle into the bar, and also the two bottles; there were about two pound of tea tied up in a silk handkerchief, and some tobacco twisted up in an old newspaper. When I took this back, I found the mark on the handkerchief, and I suspected by the T C that it was the prisoner's handkerchief, and I took a constable, and took the prisoner in the City.</p>



               <p>EDWARD BARNES. I am pot-boy to the prosecutor. When I awaked on the morning in question, in was about five o'clock; when I got to the bottom of the stairs, I heard a noise, and when I came into the passage a man struck me there; I saw his arm; but not his face. I heard the voice. He asked who I was; I could see the back of another man. I am sure there were two men; it was morning light, it was day light. I could not see who they were; I did not know the voice of the man; I don't think I ever heard it before. I had lived at the prosecutor's house about twelve months. I well know the prisoner's voice; I am sure he was not the man who struck me. I went up stairs, and called my master. When I came back, they were gone. I was not many minutes up stairs, as soon as we could get some young men up, we came out directly. There were people in the house when I went to bed the night before.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH ORCHIN. I am a washer-woman. I have washed for the prisoner. The handkerchief was brought to me to know if I knew it; and I said yes. They asked me what mark it had on it, and I knew it by the letter T; it was marked with T C; but I had always noticed the letter T, because it was marked so crookedly and badly. On the Sunday he had fetched away a shirt, a waistcoat, a pair of gaiters, and this handkerchief; I knew that to be it, because he had five handkerchiefs, and I had three of them, and he took away this one; I had had it three weeks. This was the smallest handkerchief he had belonging to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you positive sure that is the handkerchief he took away-A. Yes, from that T, and if it was not for that, I should not know it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The handkerchief was never mine; I never had a small white pocket handkerchief. I lodged with the prosecutor a year and a half, and I should wish to know if he knew any thing of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100022"/>my character. I would wish to ask the lad whether he knew any harm by me all the time he was there?</p>

               <p>Richard Gale. I never heard any thing amiss of him.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 25th, I missed some linen, between four and half past five o'clock, from the house-keeper's room; that faces the street, there is an area before it, and it is on the basement floor; there are steps down to the area; the gate of the area is never locked in the day time. I left the house-keeper's room at four o'clock, and the window was shut down; the door was not locked. I then went into the kitchen, and retured at half past five; when I returned again the window was open, and the iron bar was wrenched; it was an upright bar; there was a broom in the room within side the window, on the ironing-board; the handle of it was lodged on the ledge of the window; I knew the broom; it had been in the outer cellar for sweeping the coals up. All the family were in the house at this time; there were two men servants and two maid servants, besides myself. My young mistress was in the house; I am certain Miss Winter was at home, because I immediately went up stairs, and told her; she had not been out all the afternoon; I had not seen her in the house during that time from four to half past five; I had seen her about four o'clock, when I came out of the house-keeper's room; she was not ill, and there was nothing to prevent her from going out. Persons of the family might go into the house-keeper's room while I was in the kitchen, without my knowing it. This bar was wrenched from the screws which fastened it to the wood; the bars were so close together that the broom would not have gone between them. I missed all the articles named in the indictment; they had been placed in such a situation that a person with the broom might reach them out at the window. I saw some of them again; I saw the two gowns on the Monday following, at Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>JOHN WEST. On the 11th of June last, about half past ten in the morning, I went from my room on the basement to the water-closit in the front area. After being there a few minutes, I heard a person come down the area steps, and I supposed it to be some trade's person. In a minute or two, I returned to my room, and found the door unlocked; I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100023"/>left it locked, with the key in it. When I opened the door, insted of its going back as usual, it recoiled upon my arm with some force, which naturally caused me to look behind the door, and there was the prisoner; I looked at him for a moment; I did not know him before. I said to him, what do you want; he said nothing. I said, what do you do here then; says he, I want to speak to Mr. Webbe. I did not know a Mr. Webbe, and I said, there is no such person lives here; and that is not your business; to which he made no reply. He had got the two corners of his apron held up. I said what have you got in your apron; he said, nothing. I said it is a lie, you have got some of my plate. I then called another person. I took the prisoner into the middle of the room, and told him to put down what he had got in his apron; he did, and it was the plate in question. I sent for an officer, and gave him into custody.</p>

Directly as she past me, the prisoner Thomas came and ran his head against my body. The small one is Thomas; and at that moment I felt my watch drawn from me. It was a sort of tortoise-shell case, and had Britannia and a ship in pins upon it. When I felt that, I saw

             throw his hand behind him, and there were two others in black coats came up at the same time. They came up close behind him, close to him. I never saw my watch after that. There was no body near Thomas when I felt my watch go from me. I then seized Thomas. I said, you are the person who has robbed me of my watch. In the space of about half a minute he held up his hands, and said, see here, I have not got any watch. I told him that he should go to the watch-house, and then the other two went away. Then the tallest of the two, who is now the other prisoner, came up again, and said, I am sure he is a respectable young man; he would not rob you of your watch. I had Thomas taken to the watch-house; and when he got there, he was well known. John was taken on the Tuesday following. At that time, Saturday he was not taken; but I described his person. He went away before the officer came up; but he was apprehended in consequence of my description. My watch was never discovered from that time to this.</p>

               <p>SARAH HILL. I am with my husband. On the 1st of June, I was at Whitechapel market; I went up to ask the price of a bit of beef. I turned round to ask my husband if he would have it; and I thought

             was talking to my husband; that is the tallest of the two. I thought he was talking to him. He was looking at him full in the face, and I looked at him for half a minute, and found they were not speaking, and with that I went up to him. It was at the side of the shop. There were two large lamps outside. I could distinguish his dress, and every thing, and he came before the Lord Mayor in the clothes; that man was John. I have not the least doubt about his being the person. I went up to my husband in the presence of the two prisoners, and asked him whether he had lost any thing. He said, yes; this lad had drawn my watch. He then had hold of the least prisoner, Thomas. Then the eldest got hold of me, and said; do you think a decent lad like him, could rob your husband of his watch; a decent lad like him. He is like a trad-sman's son. He was dressed as he is now, only he had a short white apron, and he looked like a working lad in a tradesman's shop. My husband told him to keep off; for if he did not, he should charge somebody with him. He said that to the tall one. Then Mr. Le Fevre came up and took the little one, and the big one turned up Whitechapel. My husband asked the lad where John lived; the little one did not speak, and my husband and Le Fevre took him to the watch-house; we were in the lower part of Whitechapel. I have no doubt whatever of them, by the lamps.</p>

            . Coming down Bishopsgate-street, about eleven o'clock at night, on the day of the indictment, I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw the prisoner run across the street from the prosecutor, and the watchman caught hold of him, but he got away. I endeavoured to stop him, but failed just then. He ran to the end of the Old Bethlem, and there I caught hold of him. In the scuffle my had was knockad off, and on stooping to pick it up, he got away again, and ran towards Bishopsgate-street, and the officer Sapwell caught hold of him.</p>

They shoved the basket down over my face, and took the three-shilling piece out of my pocket. After they did it, I began to cry, and told me to husk, and hold my tongue, and they would give me another. Bowers said, if you will stop a minute, I will go and get a penny candle, and look for it, and if I can't find it, I will go home to my mother, and get another three-shilling piece for it.

I called out for assistance, and it happened that there was no watchmen convenient, or any person by; Mr. Cavenagh came from the public-house, and siezed one of them; he seized Healey; he took him to the watchhouse. I neither got my coat, hat, nor money, again. I had observed that Healey was one of those that pushed me. I pointed him out. I can take upon myself to say, I saw Hickey run away from behind me; he helped to take my coat off, and ran away. I was a little tipsey, not much. I had never seen Hickey or Hesley before. I saw Hickey in the watchhouse when I went there, the same night; he was brought to the watchhouse before I got there. I did not see him that night; but I saw him the next morning.</p>

I did not see what any of the men did to him; he had his coat and hat off when I came out. I saw Healey; he was not near Gardener; he was about four yards from him; he was squaring at Gardener at the time, and I asked Gardener who took his coat, and he told me, that they stripped him of his coat and hat. I said who, and he pointed out Haley, as one of the party who hustled him. He did not mention his money at that time. I siezed Healey, and called watch, and the watchman came up, only one watchman came, and I delivered Haley into his charge, and sent him to the watchhouse. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100026"/>did not see any thing of Hickey. I followed him to where I was told he went into; I found him there; it was in a cook's shop, about forty yards from the house where I live.

I first went out without a rattle and siezed Healey, and finding he had not the coat, I let him go. Then I took hold of another man, and finding he had not got the coat, I returned to the man who was pointed out to me. Healey was squaring the second time, and not the first.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Cavenagh. I remember Gardener being at our house; he was rather in liquor. I heard no noise until I went to put up the shutters, at a little after eleven o'clock; it was about ten minutes after Gardener had left the house; I heard a man sing out in the street for assistance; it was this young man Gardener; I saw a great number of men about him. I ran, and told my master; he jumped out with the rattle; I went after him. I saw one of the prisoners run down the street with a coat in his hand; I ran after him; I saw him go into the cook's shop; he then had the coat under his arm; I did not follow him into the shop, but I stood at the door; I called for a watchman, and a watchman came in the course of five minutes, and then I went up to my master, and told him where the man was that took the coat. I staid at the door a little white; but not until the watchman came up. My master came, and we met the watchman, and then went to the cook's shop, and searched the house, and found the prisoner Hickey pretending to be asleep up on the garret stairs, with his clothes on. We did not find the coat. We took him into custody, and gave him in charge of a watchman. I am sure he is the man who ran down the street with the coat. I saw nothing of Healey.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Hickey. Q. Did you see me take the coat from Gardener's person - A. No. I was within a yard of him when he started with the coat, and I am sure of it.</p>

            . I am a watchman; but was not on duty that night. I was standing next door to the cook's shop, and saw Hickey run past with a coat in his arms; he went into the cook's shop with it; I did not follow him. What became of him and the coat, I don't know.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Hickey. Q. Was it a coat, a bundle, or what - A. it was a coat; it hung on his arm; I saw it was a coat by the flaps of it.</p>

               <p>Hickey's Defence. I went to this gentleman's house to have a pint of beer, and when I was returing, I saw the prosecutor in a row with a parcel of men, and he pulled his coat off to fight, and he gave it away to a person, and he ran away with it. When I went home, the door was fast, and so I laid down on the stairs, and some time after I had been asleep, the watchman and Mr. Cavenagh came, and awakened me; and I told them I had no coat and hat, and the house was searched, and they were not found, and I had no place to put them.</p>

               <p>Healey's Defence. I was at Mr. Cavenagh's house, and by the same score I owed Mr. Cavenagh two-pence halfpenny, which I paid him, and after that, I and this other young man went out together, and saw this man, the prosecutor, and I saw a man with a coat in his arms; but I know nothing at all about it; I am paite innocent of it.</p>

            . Re-examined. I know Healey; he had been to my house that night, and had left it about an hour before Gardener; I did not see Hickey, I have no recollection of him; I rather think Gardener was capable of going home.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Was Gardener putting himself in a position to fight - A. No; he did not appear like a man who was fighting at all. When the prosecutor accused Healey of having robbed him, Healey squared at him.</p>

               <p>James Gardener. Re-examined. The coat was pulled off me; I did not pull it off to fight; I did not put myself in any position to fight, nor any thing of the kind.</p>

I had a band-box, a bundle, and an umbrella. I met three men; they were strangers. I know the two prisoners; they are two of the men; Capsey caught the bundle off the bandbox; he went a few steps, and it fell, then it dropped. I went and tried to pick it up. He gave me a push, and I slipped down. He got it up again and ran away; I ran after him a little way. I did not overtake him. The other man, Lewis, asked me what I wanted; and I said I wanted my bundle, and I would have it. He said no more. He seemed to smile; he did not prevent me from running; and then he and the other ran after Capsey, and I came back again. I saw Lewis and the other go after Capsey. I then went on to Newington. They went on Islington way. I next saw the prisoners at about twenty minutes before two o'clock. They were then taken into custody. When I got across the fields, almost to Newington, I met a young man. He asked me if I was frightened at the cows, and I said no; but that I had been pushed down by two men. I told him what had happened, and he went after them. I can't recollect what was in the bundle. There were about six pairs of stockings; they belonged to Miss Parker, and she was with me. There<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100027"/>were focks, but I can't recollect what else. There were shoes, a pocket handkerchief, a shift, a night gown, and a night cap. They all belonged to Miss Parker. There were some other things which I have not mentioned; there was nothing of my own in the bundle. I was to take them to Dr. Gascoigne's. Miss Parker was going there on a visit; she is eight years old; it is about twenty minutes or half an hours walk. When I was pushed, and slipped down, the bundle was close to me at the time he pushed me; he picked the bundle up, it was then close to me. When I saw them again, it was about two hours after. I knew them again, and I am sure Capsey is the man that took the bundle of the box.</p>



               <p>JURY. Did the prisoners speak together before the assault was made. - A. I did not hear them talk; they were as close together as persons usually are, who are in company with each other, and the man who asked me what I wanted saw the other run.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Lewis. Was I within ten yards of you when it happened - A. They were all together when I saw them.</p>

               <p>Lewis. Did I run the same way as the others - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Lewis. Did I not say I would foilow the man and get the bundle back - A. No.</p>

               <p>Capsey. I wish to know whether it was I that shoved her - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>BENJAMEN CLARKE. On the day in the indictment, I was in a field near Paradice Row, in a field facing the church. Before the young woman came up to me, I saw the prisoners and another with them. They were coming over Kingsland-road, and they passed me as I was milking a cow. I first saw them in the road, and then in the field. That was the field the young woman complained of being robbed in. It was the same field in which I was; and about seventy or eighty yards from the spot where I stood. They were in company with them; I saw them all in company together in the road also, looking into a watch-maker's shop. They seemed to be persons loitering along, and not walking like regular passengers. Their manner was such as to call my attention to them, and it did. The young woman came up to me; I asked her if she was afraid of the cows; and she said no, she had been knocked down by three men. In consequence of that I pursued the men. They were then out of my sight; but I got sight of them again in about a quarter of an hour. I got sight of them by Cannonbury House. I saw them all three stop under a tree. I got near to them. I believe they took an apron and put the bundle in it; for I saw them doing something with the bundle under the tree with an apron. A servant of Dr. Gascoigne's came after me in the pursuit. I got near to them almost by High-street, Islington, and they were both taken. I was present when they were stopped. I am quite sure they were two of those persons that I had noticed before.</p>

               <p>JOHN LOCKE. I am servant to Dr. Gascoigne; I followed the last witness in pursuit of these men. I came up to them, just by Cannonbury House. I was not up with him before the cry of stop thief. One was stopped by a man who could not hold him, and I assisted him; I seized Lewis, and gave him and the bundle to an officer. The prisoner Lewis said he was running after us.</p>

               <p>Capsey's Defence. I never saw this man Lewis before in my life.</p>

               <p>Lewis's Defence. I was coming from my uncles at Stoke Newington, and I met three men, and asked them the way to Islington, and one of them told me to follow my nose; and then one of them hallooed out, that I might follow them if I liked, or something similar to that, and I did follow them; but I know no more of the robbery than the child unborn.</p>

I heard a woman ballon out stop thief, and I ran down stairs immediately, and missed my box coat off the coach box, which was in the coach house. I went into the street and saw the prisoner in Piccadilly. He had nothing with him. I saw my coat again afterwards. It was brought to me by a man who is not here. The prisoner was secured, and that is all I know about it.</p>

               <p>ANNA MARIA SHORE. I live in Dover Yard. On the 6th of June, in consequence of something my sister said to me; I ran down stairs into Berkley-street. My sister was just passing the window of my room when she spoke. That window commands a view of the prosecutors stable. In cousequence of of what she said she saw, I ran down stairs and saw the prisoner going towards Piccadilly, with a great coat on his left arm. I raised an alarm, and he threw it into a cart of brooms.</p>

I then retired to bed. I was the last person up in the house. In the morning I missed the quantity of silver in question. I found the till unlocked, and I found a mark as if a knife or something of that kind had been put in to slip the lock back. I had all my servants searched; but nothing was found on them. I sent for an officer, who accompanied my eldest daughter up stairs, and they will describe what they saw.</p>

The prisoner came in after I was there; he caught hold with my ribbon in my medal, and called me a b-r of a guardsman, and asked who authorised me to wear a medal. I told him, persons who knew my deserts, and who had a better right to do so, than he had to call me such a name. Almost directly I discoverd that the medal was gone from the ribbon, I told him to give it me; and he said, he'd be dam'd if he did. It could be only a good whipping, and that he had hait many a time, and did not care for. I offered him five shillings to give me the medal back. He said, very well; give me five shillings, and I'll give it you; but I knew better than that. Then I told him I would give him five shillings if he would come into the next booth; but he would not; so I went and sat down. I told him that I durst not go home without it. He then went out, and came back again, and asked if there was no other reward for it; and I told him there was not, a constable was sent for at this time.</p>

When I was awakened, I missed my money; it was eight shillings and sixpence, consisting of two three shillings pieces, a one and six-penny piece, and a shilling. I have seen one three shilling piece, to which I can swear. I know it, because there is a hole close to the edge of it. I saw it the next day at Hatton Garden.</p>

               <p>JAMES BROWN. I was sent for to the Black Lion. I took the prisoner into custody, and on searching him, I found three eighteen-penny pieces, and a few halfpence. As I was going along, my man tread upon the heel of his shoe, which accidentally came off, and I found two three shilling pieces, one of which had a hole in it near the edge.</p>

            . I am the wife Patrick Manning. I remember the Saturday night in question. This child was walking with me on one side, and another was walking with me on the other. There were three aprons, two handkerchiefs and a quilt. The prisoner came up to me, pitying me having two children. Then she went round and snatched the bundle away. I followed her, but did not catch her that night. I am sure she was the woman. Some of the neighbours told me to go for an officer, which I did.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called the following witness.</p>

               <p>MRS. MALEY. On the 7th of June, I lived in Grasshopper-court. Her general character was honest and just as far as I know. She occupied a room jointly with me, and she slept with me. On Saturday night the 8th of June, I went to bed at ten o'clock, and she came into bed at half past ten o'clock, and she cever went out of the room until the Sabbath day, when she went to Church.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been a sailor, and was in the greatest distress; I have been in several engagements, and cutting out, and in cutting out a french frigate under Commodore Linsey, I fell off the ship side, and cut my head on the side of our boat; after that I was rather incapable of doing regular duty, and was put in port; after some time, my ship was paid off, and I came to London in hopes of getting some employment. I found that every where there was a want of work, and I could get none; at last. I bethought myself of offering to eater on board the Tender; I went down, and presented myself to the officer on duty, who hearing my distress, ordered me a day's provision. The next morning, the regulating captain examined me, and said, old man, you will not do; you are two old; with a heavy heart I went on shore again, with no other prospect before me than that of famishing in the street; my reflections overcome me, and I sat down on Tower Hill, and my lord, I am sorry to say, I was unmanly enough to cry. While I was in this situation an old ship-mate came by, he asked me how I got on; and I told him, there was no work to be got any where, and I was starving. He said, never mind, I have got a little money, and will see what we can do with that; with that he took me to a public-house, and we had some beer, and he gave me some gin, which on account of my head, and my stomach being empty, took such an effect of me, that I was driven to take the prosecutor's property. This my lord, I assure you, is the truth.</p>

We usually buy lead of any one who brings it; but we don't buy any for money, unless from persons we very well know. I had known the prisoner a short time. He had brought old lead, and taken new for it. He said, he wanted thirty feet of three quarters pipe. The prisoner came again after we had seen Mr. Aburrow. I did not stop the prisoner when he came again, and it was after Mr. Aburrow claimed the lead as his.</p>

I was in bed on the night in question, the last, except my daughter; I fastened up the house about a quarter past one. I got up at about half past six in the morning. When I got up and was going down stairs, I found the door on the second stair case fastened, and I could not get down. I never found any obstruction before. At last, I opened it, and a parcel of tobacco pipes flew but; it was secured with a staple. When I went stairs, my bar door stood wide open; the two doors were wide open; the skittle-ground door was open, and one of the back doors was open. I found seven tiles taken off the roof of the skittle ground. and I supposed they must have dropped throuh the rafters; there was no other way, because every other place was safe; for the skittle ground is next an alley, and they climbed up, and knocked down a new brick or two, where it was just repaired. When they got through the roof, they must have climbed to a high window, the screw of which is not perfect, and that is the way that I suppose they must have got in; for on the outside doors, there was no violence; they had opened them.</p>

            . I went to bed between one and two; I saw my mother make the house fast. I did not get up until after my mother found the house was broken open. I know no more,than that I locked the bar up the evening previous to the robbery; and it was broken the next morning.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM SHIRES. I belong to the public office Bow-street. On the morning of the 10th of July, about half past six, I was coming down the City-road, and I heard a cry of stop thief; I looked down Old-street Road, and saw three men running; the prisoner was one of them, and I apprehended him. I took him to the watch-house, and starched him; I found a picklock key on him, a silver tea-spoon, a caddy-spoon, and one shilling and eight pence, all in farthings, in a silk handkerchief. I went to the house which had been robbed, and brought the servant girl down to Worship-street; and she said she could swear to the shawl which was round the prisoner's neck.</p>

               <p>THOMAS WOODCOCK. I am headborough of the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. At about twenty minutes after six, on the morning in question, I was waiting at the corner of Agnes Terrace, when the prisoner, and two more passed me. I heard the prisoner make use of these words, if the cart had been there half an hour sooner, we should had the whole. That gave me a suspicion that all was not right; one of them had a bag with four copper saucepan covers, and other things in it. I followed them up to the Nelson, in Old street, and there asked the one with the bag what he had got; and he immediately put himself in an attitude of fighting; but after he found who I was, he said, I might have the things, and they all three ran off. I pursued them, and called stop thief. The thermometer was afterwards found in a privy in Hoxton.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MOSS. I keep the George, at Stratford. On the Morning of Tuesday the 12th of March, at about ten o'clock, the prisoner came to my house, and ordered some brandy and water; in about half an hour, he was joined by another person, who had a canvass bag; I did not see that they joined company at first, but they did afterwards. They were in company the best part of the day, and went away in the evening, in a returned pest chaise, to the three Nuns, at Aldgate; I did not see which took the bundle.</p>

               <p>RICHARD MULLEY. I keep the three Nuns, at Aldgate. On the evening of Thesday the 12th of March, the prisoner came to our house, in one of our chaise; he had another person with him. they had some liquor, and the prisoner gave me a parcel, requesting me to take care of it. He then went out with the person in whose company he had come. I had a suspicion that all was not right, and I sent for Mr. 
               <persName id="t18160710-75-person554">Ray</persName>
             the officer; Mr. Ray came, and went into the back parlour, where the parcel was.

The moment he clapped eyes on me, he went out; I immediately followed him, and brought him back.</p>

               <p>MR. ARABIN, as counsel for the prisoner, entered into an ingenious address to the jury, in his defence; and commened a good deal upon the prisoner's conduct, as neither being extraordinary, or remarkable.</p>

I am a constable; I was in the Back-lane, at about twenty minutes before five in the morning of the 6th of June; I saw the prisoner, and another man in that lane, resting two bags; they were bloody. I asked them what they had got, and the prisoner spoke civily, and said, geese; on examining them, I found that the geese were warm. I then told them that they were my prisoners, and the other man struck at me, and made his escape. The prisoner behaved very civily, and I thought it my duty to take him to the watch-house, as the geese were warm. He said they were his own, and that he lived on Barnet-common. The prosecutor came soon after to the watch-house, and owned the geese.</p>

               <p>JOHN SHERMAN. On the 13th of June last, I was opening my parlour door, and saw a man issuing from the area; he held his head down low as if to escape observation from the windows. I called the servants at the top of the stairs, but none of them answered. I then went to follow the person, and the prisoner walking very rapidly, with something bulky under his coat; I pursued him without my hat, not at all knowing what he had got. He turned his head round, and seeing somebody following him without a hat, he set off running, as fast as ever he could run; I run after him, but finding I could not gain upon him, I called out stop thief. Just as he turned the corner of Duke-street, that goes into Castle-street, he dropped something from him, which I discovered to be a leg of mutton. The prisoner was stopped. and brought back, pale, and breathless; I gave him in charge to an officer. This leg of mutton had been hanging in the area.</p>

In landing my trunks at the West India Dock Basin, the prisoner seemed very officious in assisting. I desired him repeatedly to desist, as I did not want his assistance. He left the place, and abused me exceedingly. As we were opening our trunks, and getting them ready for the inspection of the officers, my younger son put down the hat in question, with a cocoa-nut in it. After we had shut the trunks again, he missed the hat and cocoa-nut; at that instant a labouring man said there is a man has just ran up the lane with a hat, and my younger son immediately went after him, and secured him; it was the prisoner, and he had the cocoa-nut and the hat on him. A constable came, and I gave him in charge.</p>

I was induced to sit down by the road side, I fell asleep; the prisoner awakened me when a coach came up. I did not get into the coach, but I afterwards got into a waggon; the prisoner would not get in; after that I missed my money; I sent work back to Staines, and the next day the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

            , about four years and a half old. I saw that child with all its wearing apparel perfect, on the day in the indictment, at dinner time; my dinner time is between twelve and one. I came home again at nine o'clock at night, and then I was informed that the child had been almost entirely stripped.</p>

               <p>ANN SHIMMEL. I have a son; I sent him on an errand on the day in the indictment; he was gone a long time, longer than he ought to have been gone, and a man came after him, and said a child had been stript, and all the clothes had been found, except the hat. I told the man my son was not at home. I went to the prisoner's mothers appartment about ten o'clock at night, and found him there. When I first went to the house, the mother was coming to the door.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH PRINCE. I am a constable of St. Lukes. I went to the prisoner's mothers house, I found the prisoner there, and I acquainted him with my business; I told him I came to take him, for stripping Mrs. Buttres's child; he began to cry; he said he was very sorry for what he had done. I searched the place, and the mother of the prisoner, chucked the hat out of the window. I picked that hat up under the window outside, and it was claimed by Mr. Buttress, as his child's hat.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SHIMMELL, I am not thirteen years old, I know the prisoner at the bar, I have not known him long; I knew him for about a month before he was taken up. I know Mr. Buttress and his little boy. The prisoner asked the little boy to come along with him; the little boy was in a frock and trowsers. He took him into Brown-street, and into a new empty house; he took off the little boys clothes, and said he wanted to look at them; the little boy began to cry, and the prisoner said he would put them on again, for he only wanted to look at them. He then gave them to me to run across the road with them; he was to receive them again; I was frightened, and let them fall; there were some boys playing, and they run after me; I ran away, and the prisoner met me in Whitecross-street. I had nothing to do with the hat. I told this story to the officer.</p>

He then went directly to the door which was fast. He then got rather out of my sight, but got through a semicircle which was over the green-house door. We then heard the ratling of tools, and the tools in question were then thrown out; we picked the tools up, and when the prisoner came out, we seized him.</p>

               <p>GEORGE WOODROFFE. I was in the fair, on the 6th of June, at about seven o'clock in the evening; I observed the two prisoners, Marshall and Kite, very active for about hour and a half, in trying gentlemen's pockets. I watched them, and Kite, the middle prisoner, in passing Mr. Ward. pointed with his finger, and looked at Marshall; I thought that that signal meant there was a handkerchief there; Marshall immediately came up; the prisoner Rush was a little forward, and Kite beckoned him back. Kite then stood directly behind the prosecutor, with Marshall on his left hand, and Rush on his right; then with his right hand, he took the prosecutor's handkerchief, and put it under the flap of his own coat, I then took hold of Kite and Marshall, and Locke the officer who was with me, catched hold of Rush; Rush seemed to have been doing nothing but following them; I don't think he appeared to take any part in the transaction.</p>

He shoved the two little boys up against the prosecutor's pocket, and I heard him say, go it, to one of them; neither of the boys appeared to be nine years old; the boys seemed rather timid; and the prisoner seemed very angry, and kept shoving them. Then one of the boys, put his little fingers to the pocket, and raised the handkerchief. The prisoner then pulled the boy back, and got close up behind the gentleman himself; he then took the handkerchief out of the pocket, and clapped it into his own waistcoat. I immediately seized him, and the little ones run away.</p>

The two prisoners were travelling with me, between Dover and Canterbury, on the 2nd of June, about one o'clock in the middle of the day. I got very ill on the road, and Swaine said he would carry my haversack for me. I was obliged to go slow; we were on the other side of a Village on the road, and I gave him a dollar, telling both of them to walk on before me, to the first public house in the Village, I never saw them after that, until I saw them on the 10th of June, in a public house, in Spital-fields; there Swaine jumped up on the table. when I asked for my haversack, and said he knew nothing at all about it. I then perceived that Davis had one of my shirts on his person, and he said his own shirt had got dirty, and he thought it was no harm to borrow mine. They had the haversack with them, and I had an officer sent for. The haversack and the shirt, were all of the things I ever got back.</p>

            . I am a merchant. The prisoner came to my house, about six weeks back; he understood that there was a ship of my brother's going to America; he wished to go in her, and I told him what the lowest terms would be. He told me he had a very valuable watch, which he was endeavouring to dispose off; but he could not get any thing near its value for it. He shewed it to me. I asked him where he got it? he said, that instead of spending his wages, he had saved up enough to purchase it. I spoke to my brother about it, and then took, the watch to Mr. M'Laughlin, a watchmaker, near our house, who was to say what the full value of it was; he said, the watch was worth fifteen pounds. The passage money on board my brother's ship was to be thirteen pounds, and I gave the prisoner the difference of two pounds. The watch hung in Mr. M'Laughlin's window after that.</p>

               <p>HUGH M'LAUGHLIN. I am a watch-maker. I was asked the value of the watch. I told Mr. Fitzgerald he might safely give fifteen pounds for it. After that it hung in my window for disposal.</p>

I told him I would give him ten shillings, provided I knew that they were honestly come by; he could not convince me of that, and I would not give them to him. At nine o'clock at night, the other prisoner came, and wanted either the money or the bridles. I then had them both taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Read's Defence. Pullen employed me to go and sell them. I knew nothing at all of where he got them; he has been a backney coachman, and I thought they were his own property.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker, and live in Shadwell High-street. On the 6th of this month, Sherwood brought me the two watches, and told me they wanted repairing. I examined them, and told him that the gold one did not want any thing doing to it; I wound it up, and set it to time, and he put it in his pocket. He then asked how much the metal one would come to repairing; I told him fourteen shillings. He then produced four dollar pieces in gold, and wanted change. I told him he had better keep his gold, and pay for the watch when it was done. He told me he was steward of a ship. After some talk, he went away; I can swear to the watch.</p>
