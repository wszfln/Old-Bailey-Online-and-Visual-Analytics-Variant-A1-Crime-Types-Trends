I live at Isleworth—about 20 minutes past 2 on 25th March I was within 200 yards of the prisoner's house—seeing a crowd of people outside I walked up to see what was the matter—when I got into the prisoner's house I saw the prosecutrix stand<lb/>ing outside the door using abusive language to some persons inside—nothing was the matter with her, she was not bleeding—she gradually got into the shop, and was met by the prisoner's mother-in-law, I believe, and the prisoner's wife—there was a scuffle between them, and the prosecutrix was knocked out of the shop into the road—she then ran into the shop, pushed down the counter, picked up two paraffin lamps which were hanging up over the counter with glass globes to them, and threw them towards an inner door where the prisoners mother-in-law and wife were standing with the prisoner behind them—as she was throwing the lamps the prisoner's mother-in-law ran out towards the prosecutrix, pushed her down, put her knees on her chest, pulled her hair and scratched her—I don't know whether she had anything in her hands, but she scratched and marked her face as fast as she could—the prosecutrix got away, came out in the street, and said, "Look where I have been stabbed"—she was bleeding from a mark on the left side of her face—about 10 minutes after a policeman came up, went into the house, and eventually brought out the prisoner—as he was taking him away from the door Stobbs called out to the policeman, "It was not him, it was his mother-in-law who did it"—it is untrue what she has sworn to-day, that she saw the prisoner go and strike the prosecutrix—I saw no knife—the prisoner did all he could to keep the two women back from the prosecutrix.</p>

I live at Brentford—on 25th March I was in the room—when the fight commenced Clark came in and caught the prisoner's wife by the hair of her head, and she called out to me for God's sake to come down to save her—I was upstairs and then came down—she freed her hands out of her hair, and the prisoner's wife went away and left me holding her—she had hold of my apron with her teeth—when I got free she pulled the handkerchief from my neck—she got to the shop and broke the counter, and the prisoner told me to come away and said, "For she will give you a mark that you will carry to the grave"—she broke up what was in the shop, and pulled down the lamp to throw it—the prisoner would not let her come out, and when she did she was cut—she put up her hand to where she was cut and said, "I am cut, it was you, you struck me with the knife"—she got that cut by falling down inside the shop when she was pulling down the lamp; she fell on the counter and broke all the glasses that the man had his sweets in—she was not sober; she had been drinking all day with another woman from the morning till 10 o'clock—I was not with her all the time, but I know she was not sober—I did not see a knife; I cannot call to mind that I took notice of this knife—I am married and am a grandmother.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 581). I was called to the White Hart on the 8th March at 11 p.m.—I found the two prisoners in the front of the bar, and no other customers—Mr. Beckwith said "This man," indicating Mitchell, "has just passed a bad shilling"—he showed me this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found it was bad and said to Michsell "Have you passed this shilling?"—he said "I have"—I searched him and found on him two half-crowns, two shillings, two sixpences, fourteen pence, three halfpence, and a farthing, all good—he said "Let me look at the shilling"—I handed it to him, he threw it on the floor and said "D—the shilling, do you think I would do such a thing if I had known? I am as sound as a roach"—one of the barmaids then drew Mr. Beckwith back and spoke to him, and he came up and said to Chapman "Oh, you are the man that passed a bad half-crown on me on Saturday week, I remember you now my barmaid reminds me"—he said "What, are you going to bring me into it now?"—I said "Are you sure this is the man, Mr. Beckwith?"—he said "Quite sure, I remember him per<lb/>fectly now my barmaid speaks of it"—I searched Chapman and found on him three florins, a half-crown, five pence, and three halfpence, all good—I said "Shall you charge the man, Mr. Beckith?"—he said "Yes"—I got the barmaid to fetch another constable, and he took Michsell and I Chapman to the station, where Mr. Beckwith charged them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the half-crown—Michsell was abusive all through the affair to Mr. Beckwith, he was violent before we started to go to the station, but went quietly after that—they were asked for their addresses at the station—Chapman said "The only address I know is 11, Tweed Terrace"—Michsell said he knew of no other address than that, "I am staying with Chapman"—we went to 11, Tweed Terrace after the charge was taken, and found that was the house that had been burnt down about three weeks previously—we afterwards found Chapman was living at 11, Chameleon Road, which adjoins the house burnt down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Confidential Inquiry Department of the General Post-office—on 3rd April I received instructions with regard to the Northern District office—on that day I made up a letter and addressed it to Miss Bignell, 28, Cardell Street, King's Cross Road, London—it contained a half-sovereign, a shilling, and 19 penny stamps—I marked them all with a private mark, so as to be able to identify them—the date of the half-sovereign was 1842—I posted the letter at the Northern District office at 5.20 the same afternoon in the ordinary letter-box—I spoke to Mr. Carman, the inspector of that office, with regard to it—next day, 4th April, I saw the prisoner at about a quarter past 10 in the New North Road—I said, "Your name is Marston, I believe?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "You are an auxiliary letter-carrier employed at the Northern District post-office?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "I wish you to accompany me to that office"—he went with me—on our arrival there I said to him, "I am from the Confidential Inquiry Department of the General Post-office, and in consequence of numerous complaints of the loss of letters containing valuables passing through this office I have been directed to make inquiries; on Saturday afternoon I posted a letter in the letter-box at this office addressed "Miss Bignell, 23a, Cardell Street, New North Road, King's Cross, London;" it contained a half-sovereign, a shilling, and 19 penny postage-stamps, all of which bore my private mark; the letter was sorted before you, with others at half-past 5 this morning, and it is missing; have you any recol<lb/>lection of it?"—he said "No"—I said, "Have you about you any stamps or other articles which do not belong to you?"—he said "No"—I said, "Have you any objection to be searched?"—he said "No"—he was then searched by Police-officer Brooks, who was with me—he took from</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is no Miss Bignell that I know of, there is a 23, Cardell Street—I have been engaged in this particular class of work a little over two years—each man has his own private mark—there was nobody present when I marked the half-sovereign—when I spoke to the prisoner, he answered without the least hesitation; and when I suggested that he should be searched, he had no objection—there is only one letter-carrier that delivers in Cardell Street at that time in the morning—he is here—if a man finds among his letters one that does not belong to his walk he should throw it aside—there were people going up and down stairs from the place where the letters were sorted to where the prisoner was in the basement—the half-sovereign was marked back and front with the same mark—the prisoner was watched during a portion of his round, the person who watched him is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of the Northern District Post-office—the prisoner was engaged there as an auxiliary postman—on 3rd April, about 20 minutes past 5 o'clock in the evening, my attention was called to a letter posted by Mr. Kirby at the office—next morning I took it out of the letter-box and stamped it with the office stamp and put it before the prisoner with several others to sort; that was about 5.30—if the prisoner found it to contain coin he should give it to the overseer; if he did not discover it he should give it to Isaacs, the postman who delivers in Cardell Street—while the prisoner was sorting, I saw him leave his place in the office and leave the room; and while he was gone I went to his place and examined he letters and found the letter in its place—that was about 6.45—I saw him return to his place—he left the office about 10 minutes past 7 for his delivery, and I saw nothing more of the letter—the prisoner's wages were paid weekly, he would have been paid on the next morning, 5th April—he was paid on the previous Saturday, 29th March.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He began sorting his letters on the morning of the 4th, about 10 minutes past 6 o'clock—he went downstairs about half-past 6 o'clock, and he remained down about a quarter of an hour—when he came up he went on arranging his letters for going out, and finished sorting them about 7.10—if he had kept back any letters in his district the proper man to give them to is Isaacs—it is a common thing for a man if he finds a letter belonging to another street in his district to give it to the postman who he thinks is going to that street, without handing it to the inspector—I know that the prisoner is a tailor by trade—I did not follow him on his beat—he was not late in leaving that morning, all the men left about the usual time.</p>

Milne and McFee, and they denied all knowledge of him, he said he never said he had been their agent, that he had had no connection whatever with them—they ad<lb/>mitted he had connection with them as a casual customer buying burners—he said that after I had been there—he said he had been there buying stoves on commission—I afterwards got burners from Ruff, Hill, Lock, and the others—these were the burners I showed to the last witness.</p>

I am a surgeon of 3, Southampton Street, Strand—about a quarter to seven o'clock on the evening of 12th April I examined Mrs. Fitzgerald at the station—she had an incised wound on the top of the left side of her head about three-quarters of an inch long, and it bled profusely and went right down to the bone—she also had a lacerated wound on the left temple nearly an inch long and right down to the bone—they bled considerably—the wound on the top of the head was certainly inflicted with some sharp pointed instrument—the other might have been caused by falling against any tolerably sharp instru<lb/>ment, such as a chair, or the back of a knife, not the sharp part—her lower jaw was very much swollen and bruised on the left side—a kick would inflict such an injury—on the following Monday she was suffering from erysipelas all round the left eye, and the wound on the left temple was suppurating—there must have been very considerable violence used—I examined the prisoner—he was suffering from a lacerated wound on the right side of the under jaw—I concluded that was the result of a fall on the ground, because it was full of dirt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am perfectly certain that the wound on the top of the head must have been caused by a knife or some sharp instrument—she had lost a great quantity of blood from that wound—I found four or five slight bruises on her left arm.</p>

I am the wife of William Nicholson, a commission agent, of 165, Ossulton Street, St. Pancras—we were lodgers in the same house as the prisoner—he is a hair-dresser—he rents the shop and parlour—he has lived in the house about a year—on Wednesday night, March 26, a little after 10 o'clock, I was sitting in my room on the first floor with a friend—I smelt paraffin—I went down stairs and saw a light under the prisoner's back parlour door—I knocked at the door—no one answered—I tried the door; it was locked—I then went to the street door and saw the prisoner outside his shop—I told him I believed his place was on fire—he said "I can't help it"—the shop door was shut, I can't say whether it was looked—I asked the prisoner to open the door to let some one put the fire out—he said he could not open it—I then went upstairs to raise an alarm as there were other lodgers—there was an old lady 105 years of age, and I had three children in bed and asleep over the prisoner's shop—the prisoner's parlour door was broken open, and I saw the fire in the back parlour—the fire people came and the fire was put out—the prisoner did nothing to help put it out—I did not see what became of him—the next time I saw him he was in custody—he had no family there, he is not married.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Horse, Mead, and Son, woollen warehousemen, 19, St. Paul's Churchyard—Kemp has been in our service 16 years—he was the head of the pattern department—we had the utmost confidence in him, and allowed him to order pattern cards, which were delivered with invoices, which he had to tick, they then went to the counting-house for payment—we have never checked his dealings with Craddock in any way—between March 7th, when he was taken into custody, and March 20th, we made inquiries as to his conduct, and in consequence of what came to our knowledge we sent for Craddock, who came on March 20th—I knew him to be Craddock, the pattern maker, of Kingsgate Street, Holborn—I said to him "Do you know that Kemp is in custody?"—he said "Yes, I do"—I said "Have you any informa<lb/>tion which you think we ought to have respecting him?"—he said "I have not"—I said" Have your transactions with him been <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>?"—he said "They have"—I said "Have you ever lent him any money?"—he said "I have, on two or three occasions"—he mentioned the sums—two of them I believe were 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he said "I hold I 0 U's for those amounts"—I said "Have you ever given him any money?"—he said "I have, a trifle"—I said "How much in the course of a year?"—after some consideration, he said "Well, perhaps 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Are you sure it is not 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "I am sure it is not"—I said "Are you sure it is not 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "I am sure it is not 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Are you sure it is not 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "No, it is not 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Are you sure it is not 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "Well, it might be from 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Why did you give him that amount?"—he said "Because he asked me"—I said "Was it given as commission?" he said "Certainly not"—I said "Where did you give him these amounts?" he said "Generally in the warehouse, when I was taking orders"—I said "Have you made an entry of these amounts?"—he said "No, not at all"—I said "Have you a book in which any of them are entered?"—he said "Yes, some of them"—I asked him to fetch the book, but before he left I handed him the small card marked "A," which is for putting patterns of woollens on—I said "How much did we pay you for these cards?"—he said "21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—I said "Do you consider that a fair price?"—he said "Well, it might be done for less"—I said "How much?"—he said "14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—I said "Suppose we know that that is double the amount that it should be?"—he said "Well, I don't think that"—I showed him this estimate, which we had received from Messrs. Hancock, but turned down their name; it says "We shall be happy to supply you with show cards at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen the small and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen the large; we enclose you the cloth, which is superior to yours and stronger"—he read it and said "I don't understand it, the cards are charged less than they used to be"—he then left and returned with this petty cash-book and day-book—I looked through the day-book and found that instead of the prices being less, he had increased them from March, 1881—the prices formerly were 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for A and 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for B; the 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been increased to 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and in February, 1884, another 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was put on to B—I said "You remember you told me that the prices were less than they used to be, how do you account for that?"—he said "I can't account for that"—I said "How do you account for the increase from that date?"—he said "I was told to charge the amounts"—I think some of the invoices supplied to us by Craddock are in Court,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188404210033"/>
               <p>and they agree with the book—these are Kemp's ticks on them to the best of my belief—the payments are made on the statements if they agree—this is an invoice of February, 1883; the large cards are charged 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the small 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are six invoices in January and three in February; the items are ticked, but I cannot positively say by Kemp—this January, 1883, is a mistake, it ought to be 1884—there are five of January, 1884, and three of February, 1884, showing a rise from 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the same article—for the year ending 31st December, the total number of A cards was 121 1/2 dozen, and of the large cards 5 dozen, total 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—those amounts were paid—the invoices would go to Kemp and the monthly statement would go to his department; he should pass them as correct by ticking them—this if the counting-house tick on the right side—if the invoice and statement agree, the counting-house pays without further inquiries, but not without the tick—the counting-house would not make both ticks—turning to the petty cash-book I find various entries to the initial K; they are almost monthly; they vary in amount; here is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and so on, all to K—I asked him if the K meant Kemp—he said "Yes"—the dates are not in the cash-book, only the month; here is a full copy of the invoices supplied by Craddock; there were six or seven orders a month, and statements once a month—I called his attention to the payments being almost monthly and to the varying sums, and said "Does not that show that it is for commission?"—he said that it did not—I said "How do you explain the varying amounts?"—he said "I gave him what I had in my pocket, and not always what he asked me for"—I said "Is that the only explanation you can give?"—he said "It is"—I said "You had better think the matter over and come and see me again to-morrow morning," which he did—I then said "Can you give me any further ex<lb/>planation?"—he said "I cannot, but I should like to settle this matter; I have a lot of cards which I have prepared for you, which are perfectly useless to me, and I shall be glad to let you have them at your own price"—I said" At 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—he assented—I said "The matter is far too serious to be dealt with in that way," and I declined—the cards are useful to anybody in the woollen trade; there is no trade mark of ours on them—those charges are exclusive of lettering—we paid him about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year altogether—we had been ordering the same cards of others—I sent for an estimate to Wright's, and also to Craddock's, and received these cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are about the same quality as mine—Hancock's comes to 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Wright's to 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the total amount we have paid from July, 1880, down to 1883, on these two cards, is 232<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we pay roughly 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Kemp never said anything about in<lb/>creasing the prices from 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the first intimation we had of it was looking through his book; nor did he say anything of altering 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Joseph Mead, the stationer, is a cousin of mine; he has supplied me with envelopes some years—I cannot give you the price—I aid not take the contract for envelopes from him and give it to Mr. Wilson, of Cheapside—I got envelopes both from Mead and Wilson—I don't think the difference was something like 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. between them—Wilson did not supply them at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per 1,000 and Mead at 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know whether Mead charged 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or what Wilson charged; it is hot part of my business to know—it is impossible in a</p>

               <p>large house, to investigate everything—Mr. Wilson works for us now for brown paper; I cannot say about envelopes; the head of the department, one of the clerks, would give the orders—Mr. Wilson or Mr. Davis, they are not here, nor is Joseph Mead—he never sent me an estimate for pattern-books, I don't think it is his business—the invoices would go into the department, and seven or eight of the clerks would see them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEMP</hi>. I have dealt with Craddock since 1880, but I only knew it from his word—before that Lindsay and Craddock supplied us with goods—they charged us 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., just before Craddock commenced—I did not look further back—he did not say that old Mr. Lindsay had told him he was not charging enough—I asked Craddock when he took Lindsay's business—he said "In June, 1880"—I said at the Mansion House that Craddock said he was told to charge more by Mr. Lindsay, but on thinking the matter over I do not think so; I think that suggestion came from Kemp—Craddock brought me his books; I could not have got all the information without them, or that he paid Kemp a farthing except from what he told me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was not asked questions about envelopes at the police-court—Mr. Tattershall was present for Kemp, and Mr. Geoghegan was in Court—the entering clerks have no control over the heads of depart<lb/>ments—Kemp was the head of a department for these cards, and it was far away from the counting-house at the extreme end—Mr. Lindsay's charge never went up to 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Mr. Davies; my wife assists me and two barmen—I went to the Duke of Cambridge between 4 and 5 o'clock on Wednesday by Mr. Davis's directions, and found the prisoner outside the bar—he called for Mr. Amos, and a man came, who I should know again if I saw him—it was not the witness Amos—he said "I am glad you have come, for I want to get away"—I was asked into the bar-parlour, and he said "You come about the man's character here, George"—I said "Yes"—he said "He has lived with me eight months at the Clarendon"—I asked when he left—he said "About five weeks ago"—I asked the reason—he said "Through my selling the house, and there was a change"—I asked if he was honest, sober, and respectable—he said "Yes, during the eight months he was with me I had no reason to suspect him at all"—the prisoner came next day, Thursday, at 11.45, and brought the bag which was afterwards searched—he was serving till I went to take a rest about 2.50—Mr. Davis had come in about 2.30—before I went away I put five shillings and ten sixpences in the till which the prisoner was serving at—when I came down Mr. Davies called my atten<lb/>tion to the till, and said that there was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less than I had left there, but I did not see the till—I saw the prisoner giving change with his left hand and passing his right hand towards his waistcoat pocket—I was present when some coins were marked and put in the till; some of them were missed—two marked florins were put in, and I missed them in the morning, and at dinner time I missed some more and communicated with the police—before I went up to dinner I placed five shillings and ten sixpences in the till—some of the shillings were marked—I missed two of the marked shillings while the prisoner was at dinner, and sent for the police—I then told the prisoner I wanted to speak to him upstairs, and asked him what money he had—he produced a florin, and said "That</p>

I live at 15, Catherine Street, Strand, a dairy kept by my brother, Joseph Dalton—on or about 10th March the prisoner came in about 8 p.m. for two eggs, they were five farthings each—he took a half-crown, a florin, 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a shilling, and a sixpence out of his left trousers pocket, and held them in his hand, and then tendered the half-crown, which made me suspicious—I could see it was bad as he bounced it on the marble counter—I bent it very easily—I said "This is bad," and took it to my brother, who had witnessed it through a glass door—when I said it was bad, he said "Give to me to back"—I said "No, it is not the rule to give up a bad coin"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the half-crown.</p>

I am a widow, of 31, Hetherington Street, Fulham—I have no children—on the 25th January, Matilda Brown brought me a female child between 1 and 2 o'clock p.m.—I have taken in children before, and I undertook the care of this child—the doctor was sent for and he arrived while I was dressing it—everything on it was wet with its urine, and its napkin was used—the child had a dreadful cough and was very thin—the doctor told me to send for some medicine directly—I tried it with corn flour and condensed milk, and Robb's biscuits, and Melling's food, and then I gave it cow's milk and brandy, which was the last thing I gave it—the child did not retain the food, and it died at 6.30 a.m. on January 31st—Dr. Cooley saw the child every day.</p>

I was resident medical officer at Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital, Marylebone Road, at the time in question—Matilda Brown was confined there, and I saw the child there on the 28th, and from time to time till she was discharged on the 5th November—the child was healthy, and of the average weight, 6lb.—my nurse said the child got on well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Queen Street, Hammersmith—I went to Mrs. Alberta's on the 24th November to see the prisoner's husband, and saw the child there—the prisoner was sober—the child was perfectly healthy and cooing—I went again on the 26th to see the old man and found the prisoner drunk, and beating him—he had a black eye—that was about 2 o'clock—the child was on the bed—I did not go and Took at it—I went again on the 8th and 10th—the prisoner could give me very little information about the child—she seemed to have been drinking, she smelt of it—the child had a little bronchial catarrh, a little cold, and seemed badly cared for, and, from the woman's own statement, to have been improperly fed—it was dirty and seemed as if it had been always in the same clothes—she had been feeding it on lumps of biscuit and bits of soft bread, bread and water, and condensed milk, everything but the right thing—she said "I have fed it on rusks and biscuits, and bread, and condensed milk"—its proper food should have been one-third of good cow's milk, and two-thirds of water, or even condensed milk, but sweetened and properly warmed—I gave her minute directions, and to feed the child every two hours, and gave her some medicine for the bronchial catarrh—I observed the medicine bottle was nearly full, and I remonstrated with her and told her I should not call again, and asked her to communicate with the mother, as otherwise I should not care to treat the child, for I knew that neither she nor her husband would pay me, and I told her to call on the parish—I saw the child again on the 10th, it could not be expected to improve, and it had not—with ordinary care the bronchial catarrh would have got well—on the 10th the prisoner called on me 2nd asked me to attend to the child, and said it had improved—I declined, and told her to write to the mother—I called again on the 25th of January, in consequence of something that had occurred at Mrs. Pitman's—the child was being undressed when I saw it, the clothes were not those generally worn by infants, and were quite wet and sodden with urine—the child was dirty, thin, pale, and emaciated, and had an old, wizen look—it had bronchitis slightly, but was suffering from debility and exhaustion, so I at once pronounced the symptoms Very grave, and did not expect the child to live—I recognised it as the same child that I had seen before—I saw it again in the evening, and it had diarrhoea and vomiting—it had a peculiar acrid odour, such as is met with in people who die from starvation, or who are suffering from starvation—I attended it every day, and sometimes twice a day—Mrs. Pitman appeared to take proper care of it—at first it did not take its food, but latterly it used to go into its mouth and out again—at first it used to vomit it out—it died of exhaustion on the morning of the 31st, at about 6.30—I made a post-mortem examination, it weighed 6lb. 6<hi rend="italic">oz</hi>.—in December it weighed about 7lb. or 8lb., and in November it was about the same weight—in my judgment the cause of death was exhaustion produced by neglect and starvation—there was slight inflammation of the bronchial tubes—it did not die of bronchitis—the organs were all reduced in size and free from fat, but healthy—inflammation of the bronchial tubes was not sufficient to cause the reduction of size of the organs—the child had, as it were, lived on itself, and that accounted for the reduction—if it had had proper food, care, and attention, no doubt its life would have been prolonged.</p>

Children with bronchitis of that tender age do not lose their fat, nor would it have anything to do with the redaction—it is usual to have a peculiar acrid odour in bodies that die from starvation—I have been through the famine in India, and was there for eight years—the smell was present after the child was washed—it is a smell never to be forgotten when once smelt—I was in the north-west of India, in Rajpootana, where the famine was at its worst—that was in 1870 to 1873—the child had an insufficient amount of proper food and had improper food: for instance, sugar would produce starvation; it does not produce fat, and only gives warmth.</p>

I live at 11, Chenies Place, Somers Town, and am a signalman in the Royal Navy—on Sunday morning, 16th inst., I was on furlough, and walking up the Crowndale Road, St. Pancras, with Smith between 12 and 12.30, when two girls came up the road singing and dancing, and pushed against me—I pushed them away and walked on, and the girls walked on—immediately afterwards three men attacked me from behind, and pulled me down backwards; I struggled with them on the ground—when I regained my feet I saw the three prisoners; not till then—I then found Hopkins's hand in my pocket—I struggled, knocked his hand, and the money went on the ground—I had 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some coppers in the outside pocket of my overcoat, which I had on over my uniform—Hoskins ran away and escaped—I saw a constable coming up the road—I turned round and ran for him, and he arrested Southwood and Harding, who were standing on the spot talking—I saw Hoskins on going to the Cerkenwell Police-court—a policeman afterwards brought him into the courtyard, and I identified him—my face was scratched while I was down—I saw the three men standing over me while I was down.</p>

I live at St. Pancras Vestry Hall, St. Pancras—I was with the prosecutor in Crowndale Road on this Sunday morning when we were attacked by two girls—they began singing and dancing in front of us—my brother was also with us, he did not interfere at all—one of them pushed up against the prosecutor, he pushed her away and moved to go away from her, when, before I was aware of anything else the three prisoners rushed at him without any provocation and threw him to the ground—Harding, I am certain, ran at him head first, and caught him by the legs and threw him to the ground—he came sideways at him—I was on the kerb, standing sideways—the prosecutor struggled to his feet, and then I heard some money fall—the prosecutor then disappeared and came back with a constable and gave Hoskins and Harding, I think, into custody, the other one escaped—I went with them to the station—I can only identify Harding—the scuffle did not take five minutes.</p>

I am a hair-dresser, of 89, Marchmont Street; Burton Crescent—on the night of 17th March I went out leaving the house safe, securely locked up—I have a shop, a parlour behind the shop, and there is a side door which was locked—I left nobody in there—I came back about 1 o'clock on the morning of the 18th and found the side door open—I closed it and went to bed—about an hour afterwards I was awoke by a knocking at the street door; I went down and found a constable—the side door leads into a passage into which the parlour door opens—I found a portion of the parlour door had been forced away and the door opened—from the passage I missed a coat and a pair of trousers—in the trousers was this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of a workman's club in St. Pancras—this coat and pair of trousers are mine—the ticket was in this pocket—I saw the prisoner at Baker Street Police-station and charged him—he made various statements saying it wasn't him.</p>

Two soldiers fetched me from the barrack-room and told me I was wanted again by a policeman. I was then charged with stealing a watch and some money. I never saw the prosecutor in my life before.

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman cabinet-maker, and am now living at 17, Hartham Road—I was at the Fountain, public-house with Bacon, Barrett, Gibbs, and the prisoner—I saw this document produced—it was read in the hearing of Gibbs, and the prisoner put his mark to it—Gibbs was asked to sign it, and he and Barrett did so—I had been out with Gibbs and had had something to drink—I was moderately sober—I and Gibbs were not intoxicated—I was at the police-court on the hearing of the summons—I saw the document handed to the prisoner, and he was asked if he knew this paper—he said "Yes"—I was at the County Court on the 26th, when the action was heard between the prisoner and Bacon—I saw this document handed to the prisoner—after he was sworn he was asked if he knew the paper—he said "I do not, I have never seen it before"—he was asked "Do you know Mr. Gibbs?" and answered no at first, and then he said he did some months before—he was asked "Is this your mark?"—he said he had never put it there, and that he had only once in his life put a mark, and that was at Kingsland Eoad—the Judge directed the document to be impounded; I cannot say if he questioned the prisoner.</p>

I am a lecturer, living at 3, Grove Park Road, Tottenham—on 6th October a distress was put in my house by the prisoner—Bacon was the broker employed—I objected to the illegality of the distress—Bacon sent for the prisoner, who came to my house—he said he was the landlord of the place, that the rent was due to him, and he told Bacon to remove the goods—Bacon told him to be very careful what he was doing, and said "You must give me an indemnity"—the prisoner said he would have the goods removed if it cost him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he would give him an indemnity—they then left the house together—I summoned Bacon for an assault at the police-court—the prisoner was sworn as a witness—he was first shown the warrant, and he said he signed that, then he was handed the indemnity and was asked "Did you sign this in<lb/>demnity?"—he said "Yes"—at the time of the distress the defendant's</p>

I live at Vicarage Farm, Hounslow, and am bailiff to Mr. Phillips, whose farm it is—on the morning of the 21st March I missed a truss of clover hay which had been separated from the rick and tied up—I gave information at the station, and on the 22nd a constable came, and he and I traced the hay across the stack yard to a gate leading to the meadows, over which it had been thrown, and across two meadows—at the farther end of the second meadow there is a stile, and we saw traces of the clover being thrown over into the Green Lane, and about 50 yards down the lane into and across a turnip field to a large ditch which parts two farms—we saw heads and stems of clover where the truss had been thrown across the ditch; we went across another field into the Bath Road—I left the constable to follow it up, and returned home—these are some of the pieces found, and these are pieces from the stack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); they are the same sort of clover, only this is faded from lying on the ground—I had not sold or given the prisoner any hay.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are 21 stalls on one side, it is a very large place—three gas lamps were turned up—I was in the second stall when Hazels caught hold of me—he did not say when he first came in "What, do you mean to say that my horses are dirty?" or "have something the matter with them?"—when he said "Hands up, old man" he rushed at me, and I closed with him, and was disabled and fell, and I believe he fell on me—I was struck with a shovel, and kicked while I was on the ground—my boy came to help me, and took up a shovel to try to protect me, but he could not get near me—I have heard that Hazels's head was cut with a shovel while he was struggling—when I got up I did not see my boy and Hazels fighting with shovels, I should only have been too pleased if he could have chopped their heads off—I saw Wells with a shovel—I did not see them chopping each other—there was plenty of light—I was standing at the corn<lb/>bin and my boy by my side when the prisoners came.</p>

I live with my father the last witness at 7, Stamford Road, and am employed at the stables of the London General Omnibus Company—I was with my father, about 12.20, on this night—Hazels came in, came up to my father, and said "Hands up with you, old man," and he dashed at him, and closed with him—my father held him, and Wells came in with a shovel—my father fell, and he started kicking him—Hazels hit my father with a shovel several times—I tried to pull Hazels off, but Wells cut me across the head with a shovel and knocked me down, and said "If you offer to interfere I will kill you"—I got up again—I thought if I could keep Wells back my father would be able to manage—Hazels was wrestling with my father on the ground, and kicking him—I ran to the end of the stable and got a shovel, and Wells chased me—we struck at each other, but he was like a mad fellow—I could do nothing with him—I ran home first, and then for the police, and coming back Wells was standing by a gate—he ran after me, but</p>

I saw my father catch hold of the shovel Scott was using, and as I was about to assist my father, Wells, another horse-keeper, came in, and said to me, 'You b----, I will kill you.' He had a shovel in his hand, and he struck me on the head with it. I got Scott's shovel to protect myself. Wells chased me about the stable. I tried to use it as well as I could. He kept chopping at me, and I was obliged to run out of the stable. When I got into the yard, Wells went back. I afterwards went into the stable, and saw both Scott and Wells and my father struggling together. Wells was knocking my father on the head with a shovel. I went and tried again to assist him, and Wells again knocked me down with the shovel. I got up and he chased me up the Fulham Road. I went home and told my mother, and then went in search of a policeman. I saw Wells standing in Fulham Road, and as soon as he saw me he ran after me with a shovel again. A policeman came to my house and took my father to the hospital, and brought a doctor to dress mine and my father's head. Signed, Edwin Setter<lb/>field.")

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Turk's Bow, and am an unfortunate girl—on the morning of 9th April I was in George Street, Chelsea, alone; I met the prisoner, whom I aid not know before, with' his father and brother, he said they were—he asked me to take a walk with him—I said "I don't mind"—I called my friend, Elizabeth Noble, across and asked her to wait a few minutes for me—the prisoner's father put his arm round her waist—she said "You had better go home to your wife"—the prisoner turned round and said "That is my father, you had better mind what you say"—Noble said she would say the same whoever it was, and then the prisoner struck her two blows between the breasts—she fell to the ground—I saw the prosecutor and Thompson come across the road, and Maddigan picked her up—the prisoner said "If any one picks this woman up I will stab him to the heart"—that was before Maddigan had touched her—Maddigan immediately picked her up end put her on her feet—I next saw the prisoner and prosecutor pass into the middle of the road scuffling; a blow was struck, they both fell to the ground; the prisoner got up and drew his sword; Maddigan had got up—I then saw Maddigan's hand was bleeding at the wrist—he called a constable—the prisoner ran away, and the policeman went after him—I saw, nothing between the prisoner drawing his sword and the prosecutor's wrist bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was between 9.30 and 9.45—Maddigan and Thompson were standing opposite a side street, not on the same side as Noble—Noble had been on the same side, and then she crossed the road to the prisoner and his father, she accosted the prisoner—she was perfectly sober I think—I had left her five minutes before this hap<lb/>pened—I was with the prisoner, coming up the same street—Noble said she had known the prisoner previously—she did not appear jealous when she saw me walking with him—Noble lay on the ground, 10 minutes insensible—I swear the whole of this affair lasted 10 minutes,</p>

About 12.45 on the morning of 9th April I was on duty in White Lion Street, which is about thirty yards from George Street—I heard a noise up George Street, turned the corner, and saw the soldier and about twenty people—I went up; the prisoner's brother complained of being assaulted; he was bleeding at the eye—the next I heard was the prosecutor saying "Policeman, I have been stabbed by the soldier by his bayonet"—I turned round and saw the soldier; I said "Have you a bayonet?"—he said "Yes"—I could see no bayonet drawn—I requested Maddigan to show me his arm; he pulled up his sleeve and said "Here it is, you see where the blood is"—the prisoner walked away—as soon as I saw the blood I walked off after him and said "Stay a minute, soldier, let us see what is the matter"—as soon as we got into Pimlico he started running, I halloaed "Stop that soldier," and ran along Pimlico Road to Bloomfield Terrace, and then to Commercial Road and Gatcliffe's Buildings—I got the assistance of the landlady, and with a lamp searched Gatcliffe's Buildings—I saw the prisoner and said "Now then, come out"—he said "All right, police<lb/>man"—he then went out into the yard and waited while I went down the steps to him—he surrendered—I asked him for his belt and bayonet—he gave it up and said "I will go quietly to the police-station with you"—at the station I noticed there was a little blood on the hilt, and he said "They were fighting my brother and I tried to get them away; no doubt that might have come from the blood running, from his eye"—I asked him what he ran away for when I requested him to stay—he said "Of course I did not want to get myself into disgrace through my brother in the position I am now holding"—when the inspector had read the charge of wounding Maddigan to him he said "I deny the charge, I never used my instrument"—at the police-court he also denied that and said they were hurting his brother and he took his brother's part—his brother wanted to charge some one with assault—he did not summon either of them for assault.</p>

I am a pianoforte manufacturer with my son, in Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square—on 12th October, 1883, the prisoner called with a person that I knew some years before named Batley—he told me, and Batley affirmed that he had bought a house and had fur<lb/>nished it, that he had paid either 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the house, that he had bought 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture at Whiteley's which he had also paid for, and he had let it all well furnished, and that the lodgers wanted a piano—he also said that he had sold a quantity of materials for a rink at Islington and would I take a bill in payment for the piano—I agreed to do so—the bill was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he came next day and brought a bill for 48<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said he had sold extra goods to this party sine and he had taken this bill, and I could take it and give him the difference when the bill was paid—the piano was to be 35 guineas and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a music stool—on the strength of that, I sent the piano and music-stool to his place—a pawnbroker called on me and made a statement and gave me the number of the piano—in consequence of what passed between me and the pawnbroker, I sent three or four times to the prisoner to try and get back the piano—we could not get it, and I have never seen it or the money since, and the bill was returned dishonoured—I parted with my goods on account of his statement that he had purchased the property and paid the money—I considered it perfectly safe, and Batley assured me that it was a fact.</p>

I am a saddler, of 8, Little St. Andrew Street—on the night of 21st February, a little after 8 o'clock, I saw my two ponies safe in some stables in Clerke's Mews—early on the morning of the 22nd they were gone—I went at once to the police-court—on 18th March I went with some detectives to North Bourne, in the Isle of Thanet, between Sandwich and Deal, and there saw my two ponies in a shed—I saw a man named King there—I saw a cart, which I thought was mine, but it was so dark I could not see the colour then—I saw it about two days afterwards, and then identified it as a cart that I had lost the same night as the two ponies—it was a new cart, worth 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the harness was worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—one pony was worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had only had the cart about a fortnight—I saw a man named Spain—I had known him all his life; he lived at Ramsgate—he was taken in custody and discharged.</p>

Two men named Mansfield and Phippins stole Parker's ponies and brought them to my house about 1 o'clock on the morning of Thursday, and called me up and asked me if I could find a stable. They had the ponies with them. I told them to go to Jones in the Old Kent Road. Me and my brother took them to New Cross Gate, and my brother went on with them to Eamsgate to a man named Spain, who was to sell them. They returned to London, and my brother stopped there, and the ponies were sold to an old man named Teddy King, who has got a place between Sandwich and Deal. Now if you are sharp you may get them, as it was arranged with him to shut them up for three weeks. Spain is the son of a big jobber at Ramsgate, and he knew it was crooked. Do you know Joe, who lives close to where Parker's ponies stood? He put the thing up to Mansfield and Phippins. The reason I did not give you this information before was my own brother was in the case, and I did not want to get him into trouble, but when I was taken I thought it was time to tell the truth, as I have a wife and family, and he has none."—I took down this statement from his lips, read it over to him, and he signed it and I witnessed it.</p>

On 3rd April, about 6.15 p.m., I was at Keyes, and saw the prisoner standing in the road using filthy and obscene language—I said if he used that language again I should look him up—he did say it again—nobody was present—I took him in custody—he said "Don't handle me, I will go quiet with you"—he walked quietly with me for 400 or 500 yards, till we got to a gate, when he struck me on the right breast, saying, "Take that, you—, I am off"—that caused me to stagger into the road, and when I recovered he was over the gate—I had a parcel with me containing some watches and barometers—I overtook him in the second field and said "Come back with me"—he said "I am not going back with you—I will do for you, "and caught hold of me by the collar of my uniform—I caught hold of him in the same manner, my foot slipped, and I dragged him down with me—he drew my truncheon with his left hand, passed it into his right, and began hitting me on my head—I do not know how many blows I received on my head and arm—he said, "I will kill you, I may as well be hung for a sheep an a lamb"—the blood spurted into my eyes, I called out "Murder," and Southam came and pulled him off me—he struggled hard to get away, but I picked up my truncheon and struck him twice on the right arm; he then said he would be quiet, but he laid down on the grass and refused to walk to the station, saying "I may as well make a job of it now I have commenced"—I sent for a stretcher, upon which some constables took him to the station—I became faint from bleeding and went to a doctor, and next day I was attended by Mr. Roberts, the Divisional surgeon—I bad to keep in bed ten days, and am still unable to do duty—here are marks of blood on my</p>

I live at Hayes—on the 3rd of April I was in the High Road, opposite the Adam and Eve, and saw Loveland take the prisoner in custody, who was using most disgusting language—there was no one there, but he was standing there shouting so that anybody could have heard—I walked behind them and heard him say something, and then he jumped over a gate into a meadow—Loveland pursued him, I followed, and waited till they both went down—the prisoner was on the top of Loveland beating him with his truncheon over the head—he was in a sitting position, with his knees on Loveland's chest—I heard him say "I will kill you, you,—I may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb"—I said "Will you?" and caught hold of him and held him till Loveland got up—he was bleeding very much—I could not see his face for blood; he was very weak and exhausted—the prisoner struggled with me to get away, and Loveland hit him with his truncheon—he refused to walk, and Loveland sent for assist<lb/>tance and a stretcher.</p>

On the 4th April I saw Loveland at his house—his hair was matted with blood—there were four lacerated wounds on his head, one on the right side at the top, two inches long, and by its side another wound one inch long—on the left side at the top of the head there was a wound two inches long, and one one inch long on his left eyebrow—there was a severe bruise at the upper part of his right cheek, and a less severe bruise about his left eyebrow—the wounds had been stitched with a wire suture when I saw them, to draw the edges together; that is only done in the case of a deep and gaping wound; a superficial wound would not require it—the wounds might be caused by a blunt instrument such as a truncheon—he was in bed about ten days and is not fit for duty yet—I intend to recom<lb/>mend him for a month's leave.</p>

On 4th March, about 8.45, I was on duty in the Bath Road, Hounslow, and saw Richard Burnham, the landlord of the Duke of Cambridge, near his house—in consequence of what he said I stood outside his house with a constable—the house was in darkness, and I saw Burnham break the window with a stick, and directly after several beer bottles and bottles of beer were thrown through the window from inside—the crowd went back, and Burnham and Giffin approached the window, and a hand came out with some<lb/>thing in it which struck Giffin on the neck, and he said "I am stabbed; down to the toes I feel the blood running into my boots"—Burnham had tried the door before he went to the window—when I went to the window I saw the prisoner standing on the left with her daughter</p>

               <p>Ellen Blake on her right, and her youngest daughter at the window—the prisoner said "There shall be murder here to-night; if any one comes here I will murder them"—I went to Dr. Doyle's surgery, and found the man had a large cut on his neck six inches long—this scarf was given me cut in two, one piece was on the man's neck and the other on the surgery floor saturated with blood—he was taken to the London Hospital—the cut through the window was downwards—I could not see what it was done with—I was two yards from the window—I told the prisoner a man had been stabbed, and it might be serious, and to keep herself cool—it was in reply to that that she said "There shall be murder done here to-night"—the two Blakes and the potman were charged before the Magistrate—I ascertained that they and the prisoner were the only persons in the house—I saw one of them here yesterday.</p>

On the 4th March, about 10.15, Jones came to the station and made a statement, and I went with him to the Duke of Cambridge beerhouse, which was in darkness, and there were ten or twelve people in front of it—the doors were closed—I went to the step and put my lump over tho window—I was able to see into the house, the door being half glass—I saw the prisoner lying in the passage with her shoulder and head against the wall near the tap-room door, apparently asleep—this billhook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in her right hand, and her daughter Eleanor was behind her, lying in the same position, with this chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in her hand—I turned the lock and knocked at the door: they then rose up from the ground very excited, and came to the door with these things in their hands—I turned my light on and could see them—a woman's voice said "If you come in hero I will murder you"—I took it to bo Mrs. Burnham's voice—I said "I am an</p>

I am house-surgeon at the West London Hospital—the prosecutor was brought these on 4th March, about 11.30 insensible—I found an incised clean cut wound on the right side of his neck—he had lost a good deal of blood—it commenced about 2 1/2 or three inches below the ear and extended obliquely—it cut through the skin and divided several vessels, but no important ones—the jugular vein was not cut—it was not a dangerous wound in itself—he remained in the hospital for about 10 days, and was then discharged cured—I think the wound itself might have been caused by this instrument (<hi rend="italic">the billhook</hi>), but I think it scarcely could have cut through that handkerchief—a knife would have done it.</p>

After the prisoner was charged I said to him "What about the revolver?"—he said "I sold it for old iron"—I did not caution him—he afterwards said "It is at my lodging, 16, Ormsby Street, Kingsland Road"—he said next morning "How do you think it will go?"—I said "I don't know"—he said "The things I had you can get by going to that address"—that is his stepfather's—I went there on the 25th with Mr. Gould—I saw no one there, but the female prisoner went in and fetched out the revolver and the small box of caps and cartridges, and something belonging to the revolver—she went with us from the police-court—I cannot say that this is the revolver which he said he had sold for old iron—here are some screws and the trigger—she then took us to 93, Maria Street; an unfurnished back parlour—she said that she had taken the room that morning, the 25th, and took there two boxes and a large bag—I examined the boxes, and found these six pictures, nine books, a pair of pinchers, a screwdriver, bedwrench, hand<lb/>kerchief, and under-shirt—I went there again on the 26th with Mr. and Mrs. Gould; the room was occupied by the two prisoners, but only the female prisoner was there then—the pictures have been taken out of the frames.</p>

Where did you get these curtains from?"—I had them with me—she said "I don't know; a man gave them to me"—I said "What is his name?"—she said "I don't know, but he has been home with me two of three times"—I detained her—Hallmark went after the man, and shortly afterwards returned bringing Price to the shop—I said to him "Do you know this woman?"—he said "I do"—I said "Have you given her these curtains to pledge?"—he said "Yes; I have given her others to pledge for me"—I said "Where did you get them from?"—he said "An old shipmate of mine gave them to me and told me to dispose of them and give him half the money"—I asked him his name—he said "Fagan"—I asked him where he lived—he said "I don't know; he works in the docks"—I said "If you have to give him half the money you must know where he lives"—he said "I don't know; I might not meet him to-day and perhaps not to-morrow"—I said if he could point out Fagan I would go with him and give him the opportunity—he said</p>

On 12th March the last witness pointed the prisoner out to me—I said "I am a police-officer, you must consider yourself in custody for committing a bigamous mar<lb/>riage with Miss Steele"—he said "I know nothing, about it—I showed him the two marriage certificates which I had got from her—he said "Who charges me?"—I said "The girl and her father"—he said "Can I speak to her by herself in the next room?"—I said "No, whatever you have to say to the girl now ought to be said in the presence of the parents"—he said "Well I will tell you how it happened: I left home and got to work on the Wood Grange Estate, and my first wife came and saw me there, I asked her to stop with me and we would have a home together, and she would not, and she has committed adultery; I went home and saw sergeant Matthews, and he told me I could do as I liked; I married the girl I am willing to keep her"—I took him to the station, and he "was charged'—he had this discharge (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> On several occasions I wrote to my wife since I left her and got no answer, and I understood from her friends that she was dead. I afterwards found that she had had another child while I was away; she owned to me that she had done wrong, and was sorry for it, and I said that I would forgive her. She came to see me, and I said "Here I have a home for you, and can keep you." She said, "l can get plenty of men to keep me, all I want is for you to keep my child," and she pulled a paper out of her pocket and asked me to sign a separa<lb/>tion., I said I would sign it if the servant would witness it. I then thought I was free to marry again. I have committed bigamy, and am very sorry for it. I did not do it knowingly. It is very hard when a man is at sea and is keeping his wife that she should go with other men, and there is a child to prove it.</p>

I and others stowed ourselves away on board of her. Arriving at Plymouth we were discovered and put ashore. We were bound to New Zealand.

I wanted to get home as I am a licence holder, and have to report myself at Barking Police-station to-morrow. I did not know how they got pos<lb/>session of the horse and cart till we got some miles on the road. I got out of the cart at Poplar.

I expected you would be here before"—his mother spoke to him, he said "I will tell the truth about it. It was Snipe that stole it"—Snipe is Kingston's nickname—I took him to the Plaistow station—they were all charged, Wells apprehended Kingston afterwards.</p>

When I made the arrangement with him to go in as my caretaker he was out of employment, and I told him, if it was any benefit to him and his wife and children, he could go in for a few weeks until I could have the business completed with the brewer, and I would supply him with beer, and he could sell it and live on the profits—he never asked me to be allowed to be the manager, and I never suggested it—I was looking out for a manager, and I have one now; I had one on the 20th March—the prisoner is not out of the house now, he has no business there; he said he would give me all the trouble he could.</p>

Tustin and Rooke to the defendant; it is dated 28th September, 1873, for 30 years—also a mortgage to them by the defendant dated 29th September, 1873—also an assignment of the equity of redemption in the lease by the prisoner to Miss Ann Lock—also a letter, dated 17th November, 1883, to Mr. Lockyer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police sergeant in the Surrey constabulary, and the prosecutor in this case—on the night of 21st February I was on duty on the high road at Chelsham at 10.30—I met the two prisoners and a third man on the highway—they had two dogs with them, and one of the dogs had white about his neck—the men were coming in a direction from Ledger's Lodge; and as they were passing me Dumbrell said to me "Can you tell us where this road leads to?"—I said "Yes, it leads to Farley, Gilston, and Croydon; if you don't want to go there, turn to the left when you get to the bottom of the town"—I turned my light full on their faces thinking it was a curious question to ask me, and I have no doubt that I saw these two prisoners—the third man was close behind them and he came up and struck me on the back of my head and knocked me down—the two prisoners then commenced kicking me about my head and body, one hitting me with a stick, and I became insensible—when I came to myself they were gone—I searched my pockets, and found that my watch and chain were gone—I had laid there over half an hour—I had seen my watch safe about five minutes before I was attacked, I pulled it out and looked at it at 25 minutes past 10—when I turned my light on I saw that Dumbrell had quite a black moustache and I noticed that Fairman was cross-eyed—I got up and went to a cottage, and a woman washed me and bathed my wounds, and I had to stop there till about 5 a.m.—I gave a description of the men, inconsequence of which the two prisoners were apprehended.</p>

I saw the two prisoners eight days after the occurrence, at my house—I was in bed, and they were were brought to my house—no one else was brought—I did not pick them out from others—I was unable to get out of bed, and these two prisoners simply were brought to my bed—before I turned my lamp on I saw Fairman's face, because he brushed close to me—there were no lights in the road, and I could not see their faces to swear to them without my lamp—I stood there about two minutes looking at them with my bull's-eye, staring them in the face—as soon as they asked me the question I turned my bull's-eye on them directly—that was after they asked me the question—I told them the way, and immediately afterwards I was struck by a man on my eye—I mean to say that they stood there looking me in the face for two minutes; they seemed to be waiting for the other man to come up—I say that they walked by asking me the way to go—I also say that the man who I identify as Dumbrell had quite a black moustache and it was heavy—I am quite certain about the time, it was 10.30 within one minute—I am as certain about one prisoner as I am about the other</p>

I had seen the prisoners before that night—the spot where I was attacked was, as far as I can say, about five miles from the Brighton Road at Groydon—I mentioned at God-stone about Fairman being cross-eyed—I have not seen my depositions—I do not think they were read over to me before I signed them—I know that they are read over as a matter of certain practice chiefly, but I have no recollection of it—I was suffering from illness at the time I was examined—I had only been out of bed two days—the name of the woman to whose cottage I went is Richardson—I told her how I had been treated—I did not in the course of my statement to her say that I did not know the men—I have not seen her here to-day—I remained at the cottage till about 5 o'clock in the morning—the men had dogs with them; a great many people have dogs in the country—I told the Magistrate about Fairman's eyes—my watch was a silver hunter, and it had a steel chain; it cost me over 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I have had it over twenty years—I have not identified it; I have not seen it since—I know that it is usual to advertise in the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazette</hi>, but I have been laid up and unable to do anything—I gave information to the superintendent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of police for the Godstone division—I saw the two prisoners at Croydon in custody on Saturday, February 23, and conveyed them to Godstone—on arriving I read the charge, which was "Unlawfully and feloniously assaulting Police Sergeant James Bishop in the execution of his duty, thereby causing him grievous bodily harm; also stealing from his person a silver watch and a steel chain, value 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the highway at Chelsham, on the 21st of February, 1884"—they both said "I know nothing about it"—on Friday, the 29th, I spoke to Dumbrell at the cell door, and said "I see, Dumbrell, by the description you were wearing a moustache that night"—he replied "Yes, I had it cut off"—when I received him in custody he was wearing no moustache, his upper lip was clean Shaved.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. AVORY</hi>. It was on 29th February that I had that conversation; eight days afterwards—it was at the cell door—the door was shut and I spoke through the trap-door; my object in doing so was because the description did not answer—I thought it seemed strange that he should be wearing a moustache that night and the next day it should be off—it was no business of mine; I had no object—I mean to say that I did not do it for the purpose of getting something out of him—as to my discussing his identification with him I simply said "You had a moustache that night"—I knew that by the description which I had in my pocket—the description I had did not agree with the man at that time—the description I had agreed with the man who was in the cell except the moustache—I did not think I could reconcile the two by a little judicious conversation with him; as I said before, I had no particular object. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it was for the mere pleasure of having a little con<lb/>versation with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot give any other reason. I wanted it cleared up; and I wanted him to clear it up—it is not my practice in the country, when I want a thing cleared up, to go to a prisoner and get him to clear it up—I had cautioned the prisoner eight days before—what I said to him was "I see by your description, Dumbrell, that night you were wearing a moustache"—he said "Yes, I had it cut off," and I think he said to the other prisoner "I suppose I can't go to a barber without a permission"—when I made the observation to him about his moustache he did not say "My moustache would only be about a month's growth," but he did a day or two afterwards—that was not at the cell—I cannot recollect when it was—I cannot recollect whether it was at the cell, but if I speak rightly I think it was on the road to Caterham—I cannot swear that he did not make that observation at the cell, but I do not think so—I will not swear now that he did not make it at the cell on the</p>

               <p>occasion when I first spoke to him—I do not mean to swear before the Jury that when I asked him to reconcile those two things he did not say "Why my moustaches have only been about a month's growth"—I say that his answer was" Yes, I had a small moustache, but I cut it off"—I do not recollect anything about the month's growth—it was the prisoner Dumbrell himself who cross-examined me on that subject before the Magistrate, and I said in answer "I think you said 'My moustache would only be about a month's growth"—I did not say a word about that observation being made to me till several days afterwards; I was not asked.</p>
