                  </hi>. I keep the Fox and Knot public-house, in King-street, in the parish of St. Sepulchre. On Sunday night, the 6th of Novem<lb/>ber, I went to bed at twelve o'clock—my family consists of my daughter and servant—the prisoners came in for a pint of beer at half-past eleven o'clock that night, but they did not sit down—there was nobody in the house but my daughter, my servant, and myself—I did not see what became of the prisoners after they drank their beer—I was the last person up—the house was all fastened safe—the door was locked and bolted—it has a spring-lock—the window was fast for any thing I know—I know the girl fastened it at night—the till is a small drawer in the bar, which is always locked—I locked it myself that night before I went up stairs—there might be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I cannot tell to a shilling—I took the keys up stairs with me—about four o'clock in the morning the watchman came up stairs, and called us up, saying somebody had broken into the house—I got up, and went down to the bar—I found the lock of the bar broken open, and the till lock was broken open—I had locked them both be<lb/>fore I went to bed—the money was gone from the till; also seven tea-spoons from the till, and the sugar-tongs from the sugar-basin—the prisoners had their beer in the tap-room—I saw them go out of the house, and when they went out I saw my servant fasten the door—I found the door just as it was when we went to bed—it had not been unfastened at all—it was a spring-lock—it was locked and bolted—the key was not left in the lock—the parties must have come in at a side window, as I found it open when I came down stairs—I think that was fastened when I went to bed—my servant always fastens it—a snuff-box and a dial were taken out of the parlour, and two shawls of the servant's from the kitchen—the dial was on the chimney-piece when I went to bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman of St. Sepulchre's. I was on duty on the night of the 6th of November; and at four o'clock, as I was coming round the corner, I observed the side door of Mrs. Pettinger's house open—I went in, and found the bar door open—I turned out, and called my brother watchman to my assistance, and called Mrs. Pettinger up—the lock was wrenched off the bar door—I left my brother watchman in possession, while I went to the watch-house to inform the inspector.</p>

On Wednesday, the 2nd of November, I was walking in the Park to find a few chestnuts—the prisoners came up to me, and Smaills said to me, "We must have your chestnuts"—they were all together—they began searching me—I said, "Let me take my money out of my pocket first"—Smaills searched me—the other two were with him at the time—I took my money out, and held it in my right hand—it was a sixpence and two penny-pieces—and then Smaills snatched at it—Philpot and White were with me—when Smaills snatched at it I put the money into my left hand—Heather then threw me down, and Smaills held me—Heather twisted my wrist round—Smaills then kicked my wrist, and they forced me to open my hand, and I dropped the money—Heather picked up the money and threw it a little way—Smaills then picked it up, and ran away with it—while I was down, Giles tried to take my comforter off, but he did not get it—they all ran away—Giles was standing by my feet when Heather threw me down, and Smaills took my money—my companions ran away from me a little way before I was down, and then came back again—I am quite sure the prisoners are the boys.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a soap maker and tallow chandler, and live at No. 65, Rosemary-lane, in the parish of Whitechapel. On the 17th of Novem<lb/>ber I went to bed about half-pastten o'clock—Gilbert was the last person up—in the morning by a private watchman—I got up, and found the shop door wide open, and 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of halfpence and pence, which had been tied up in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. papers, gone, and the till, and a great quantity of coppers besides, which were loose in it—the till had been locked, but it was so heavy it could be opened by being drawn down—I examined the premises, and there is a little back-shutter right up under the ceiling in the kitchen, which was done to admit air—it is about nine feet from the ground—I found that open,</p>

               <p>and by foreing it open it had stopped the clock at half-past one—I suppose that was the time it was done—I did not observe whether that shutter was fast the night before, but the cracks round it had been stopped with paper, to prevent the cold coming through—there was a button to it, but I do not know whether it was fast, but it was quite closed, with the paper round it, and it would take a smartish push to get it open—that shutter communi<lb/>cates with a little yard of mine, which leads into another yard, and then into a cow-yard—we traced footsteps from that shutter across into the cow-yard—there were marks of two naked feet down the wall into the cow-yard, where we found an old pair of shoes—they were prints of naked toes scraping down—the policeman was with me.</p>

On the 31st of October I had been very ill in bed for some time—I do not know any thing about the fastening of the house—about two o'clock in the morning I was sitting up in bed, and heard a violent knocking at the door—shortly after, my young man, who sleeps below in the shop, came and knocked at my bed-room door, and gave an alarm—I could not get up, but desired him to take the keys of the shop—there was a knocking at the outer door—the keys were in my room—he took and went down, and was down stairs about an hour</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable in the service of the St. Katherine Dock Company. On the 27th of October, about one o'clock, the prisoner came into the Dock for a chest of indigo—he left his horse and cart opposite the gate, and turned to the right, which leads to the quay—he returned in about ten minutes from the lower end of the warehouse, and moved his horse and cart about twenty yards, which caused my suspicion—I kept my eye on him—he stooped under the cart, took his hat off, and put something into the bag which was under the axletree—I went to him, and asked what he had got in the the bag—he said, "Nothing"—I looked, and found this indigo in it, which weighs 1lb. 10ozs.—I then asked where he got it from—he said a person gave it to him in the street—I asked if he knew the person—he said only by sight—I took him to</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the indigo depart<lb/>ment. I saw the prisoner on the 27th, coming on the indigo floor—he came up the wrong way—the office to which he should have gone was at the western end, but he came up the eastern end, which caused him to go along through several rooms of indigo, in one of which were about two hundred chests of indigo, which had been shown to the trade, and they had a bag nailed over them, to keep them from the dust—after the pri<lb/>soner was gone, Baddeley came and told me what he had found—I went the same way, and in the room through which the prisoner must have passed. I found a bag torn up from a chest of indigo, and a quantity of it was drawn—the indigo in that chest agreed exactly in quality, and the brand-mark, with that found on the prisoner—I had seen it safe before, and there was just the vacancy which this would have occasioned—Bad<lb/>deley came to me again, and said he had found another quantity of indigo, and I found this had been taken from another chest, which has a different mark on it.</p>

Division, and he and I searched about London a long time, but could not find any thing—he examined Connelly, about eleven o'clock, in the bar—he asked her a great many questions—she got into a violent ill temper—he said. "You are telling me a whole tissue of falsehoods"—she had remained in bed, I believe, about an hour, or an hour and a half—but her mistress had been talking to her in the bed-room, or the room where the box was lost from—she came down to the bar about the o'clock or half-past—she appeared so ill we thought she could not be guilty—we went over to the cooperage, and she got her bonnet and shawl, and went off down Holborn—my little boy come and tole me so, and we followed her to Saffron-hill.

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Bow-street. On Thursday, the 4th of November, I arrived at Castlebar, and found the prisoners and Finni<lb/>gan's daughter in custody at the gaol there—I received the brooch, which has been produced, without the stone in it, from Short, of the Dunmore police, and the other three brooches I received from the constable of the same place—I took the prisoners into custody, and showed the brooches to the prisoner Finnigan—I asked her if those were the brooches which were found in her box—she said they were, but they ere her own pro<lb/>perty, and the one which had no stone in it had been made a present to her daughter about two years ago, and the others she had found wrapped up in a small handkerchief, and had had them all there in her possession up<lb/>wards of two years—I went to Finchley with Finnigan's daughter—she showed me a field, and pointed out a spot under a hedge—I there picked up some pieces of paper—I got the outside of the writing-desk from Batchelor, and the loose pieces belonging to the inside from Carter.</p>

I received informa<lb/>tion in consequence of which I went to the spot where I was directed, where the hay was scattered in a field—I went along several meadows, and into Mr. Peto's ground—I put a bit of the hay in my pocket that was scattered in the meadow, but I did not go close up to the prisoner's premises that day—I traced the hay to the prisoner's between within one meadow—on the next day I traced it still further between nine and ten o'clock—I was able to trace it across the other meadow, right up to the back door—it was scat<lb/>tered all long the meadow, right up to the water-course—I, and Mr. Peto, the hay-binder and my brother officer went up the garden into the pri<lb/>soner's stable, and into the loft—they had left the traces of it in the hedge as they went along—before they got into the meadow they had to go along a lane, and then to the prisoner's garden—there was a water-course there—there was hay scattered there—when we got to the loft, the hay was open, and some of it was very wet—I have seen hay opened like that—I should think there was about four trusses—Mr. Peto in the first place identified the hay as his—he caught a bit up, and said,—"This is mine," then he said to the hay-binder, "You look for your bands," and he found one, and said "This is my band"—I put it into my pocket—here are four bands that were found in the loft—they are straw bands—I was not present when the other three were found.</p>

The prisoner was his servant of all work for about six months—she came in May—she is between nine<lb/>teen and twenty years of age—I have no reason to believe she is married—in consequence of the appearance she presented, I taxed her once or twice with being pregnant, and I had done so about a week or a month before the 19th of September—she denied it—she had received a month's notice to quite Mr. Jeffery's service, which expired on Saturday the 19th; she was to leave that evening—I saw her between seven and eight o'clock, I believe, that morning—she used to be up sometimes at six o'clock, and sometimes after—she was sitting in a chair in the parlour when I saw her, not able to do her work—I asked her what was the matter?—she said she had a pain in her back—she was so ill, she was obliged to go up to her own room—she went up by my advice about eight o'clock—in consequence of this, I men<lb/>tioned what had occurred to my mistress—I went up to the prisoner about nine o'clock to her bed-room—I am not certain about the time—I opened the door, and saw her standing in the room dressed, packing the things in her box—I asked her if she was getting ready to go—she said yes—nothing more passed, and I went down—I afterwards went up again, and found her still standing near the box, the door was not fastened—I saw stains of blood on the floor, just close by the door, about where I stood, and a very little way from where she was standing—close by the window—I ob<lb/>served nothing unusual about her—I asked her what was the meaning of the stains, and she said something had come from her—I went down stairs</p>

               <p>the middle of the room, with a box open under the window, and a broken pot on her left hand near the table—I said to her, "Jane, what are you doing?"—she said, "I am preparing to go away"—I said, "You do not seem fit to go away—you appear ill"—she said, "No, I am not ill—I am well now" (<hi rend="italic">Here the witness stated the particulars of his examination of the prisoner's person; after which, he charge her with having been deli<lb/>vered, which she denied two or three times.</hi>) I said, "I insist on knowing where the child is, what you have done with it, or where you have put it"—I believe her answer was, "I have not put it any where"—I told her I knew she must have put it some where—I said I insisted on knowing and would send for the police if she did not tell me—she hesitated some time, and said, "If I tell you, will you tell any one else?"—I made no answer to that—she waited two or three seconds, and then said, "It is under the bed"—I looked under the bedstead, but perceived nothing, and said, "You have deceived me, it is not under the bed"—she said, "No, you mistake me, it is under the bed, not under the bedstead; you will find it at the foot of the bed, under the bed"—I then went to the foot of the bed, turned up the quilt and the blanket, I believe, and saw a substance—a large package of something in a brown stuff wrapping, but completely under the bed, so as to be concealed but partially—the brown stuff was not entirely hid from view—no part of the child was to be seen—it was entirely covered—it was only partly under the bed; a very small portion of the bed was over it—I took off the woollen covering, and under that was a linen wrapper; I removed that also, and immediately discovered the head and face of a child—it had entirely covered the head and face—I saw nothing till I removed the second wrapping—the face was uppermost—I do not think the head was under the bed—I saw a gash in the neck of the child—I did not notice any thing else at that time—I asked her, I believe, how she could do such a shocking act—she made no reply—it almost made me shudder to look at it—I did not feel the child, to know whether it was warm—there was no appearance of blood from the wound in the throat—I only unwrapped it as low as the neck, and did not touch, the child at all—I have no doubt it was dead—a policeman was sent for, and came in a quarter of an hour—I remained in the room with the prisoner—I begged the policeman to fetch another, which he did—I then told them to take particular notice of the room, and to go to the bottom of the bed, and see what was there—they brought the child on the table, and uncovered it—I examined it—the limbs were quite flexible, and there was no unna<lb/>tural coldness about it—I could not judge how long it had been dead, not having seen a circumstance like it before; but from the time I was called in, and knowing the previous circumstances, I suppose it must have been dead half an hour at least, within or about that period—after the exami<lb/>nation, I said to the prisoner, "Now, Jane, you will save these men a great deal of trouble and inconvenience, if you can tell where to find the instrument with which you did it," she said, "It is there under some box or basket," I am not sure which"—I believe she pointed somewhere—they searched, and found a knife—I did not take it into my own hand, but I saw it in the policeman's hands, and said, from the appearance of it, "I think you have wiped the knife since it has been used"—she said, "No, I did not"—there were appearances of blood on it, but not so much as I should have expected—I then left the room—on the Saturday I examined the placenta, and found it healthy and full there was not the smallest portion of the <hi rend="italic">umbilical cord</hi> attached to it—that did not</p>

               <p>appear to be cut, but to be torn or rent—on the Monday following I examined the body—it appeared in every respect, a healthy, full-grown child—there were five spots on the face, one on the neck, and a bruise at the back of the head—the hands were clenched, and, the tongue visible between the lips—its weight was 2lbs. 7oz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the nature of the spots on the face? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were three on the left side, one on the right, and one on the lip, which was like a bruise—I apprehend they must have been made by pressure, and probably by the hands or fingers—I thought they might be caused by the grasping of the hand—there was a little spot on the back of the head—the incision about an inch long, like an indentation—I cannot account for that at all, and I do not think it of any consequence—the child falling on the ground would be very likely to account for the bruise at the back of the head—the incision on the throat was an inch and three quarters long—I proceeded to examine that when Mr. Robinson arrived—we made a very minute examination of it, and that could not have caused the death of the child—we could form no opinion whether the child was alive or dead when that wound was given—we minutely examined all the internal parts, and found them perfectly healthy—no disease in the chest, abdomen, or brain—we cut the lungs—they were remarkably small, and weighted an ounce and a quarter—their appearance was purplish—they were quite in the upper part of the chest, the chest in all the other parts being hollow—I perceived this before we proceeded to dis<lb/>sect—I then thought, from their appearances, that they had inhaled very little air—my impression was, that they had not inhaled any—we dissected the lungs—I did not perceive any air in the lungs—Mr. Robinson had them in his hand—he separated them from the heart—they were afterwards sub<lb/>mitted to the test in water, and floated—we afterwards cut them in several parts, and something like air seemed to escape from them—it was then my opinion that the child had breathed—that is merely from the fact stated by authors, that lungs which will float have inhaled air—I never dissected so young a child before—I merely give my opinion from reading—we dissected the lungs up to the wound in the throat, and were satisfied that that could not have caused death—it was merely a superficial wound—I have attended between 700 and 800 women in their confinement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known instances of children inhaling air, who have breathed and cried, and yet died before they came quite into the word? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly—I have never known a child cry—I have known a case where there was no doubt of its having breathed previous to exclusion—my opinion from the circumstances is, that this child had been perfectly separated from the mother alive—I should attribute its death to violent expulsion from the mother—the bruise on the head, and the probable rapidly wrapping it up in linen, would prevent life continuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it would die from suffocation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, certainly—I think the appearances of violence on the body, conjointly were not sufficient to account for death, except the bruise—I am not competent to speak of that—we examined the bruise—it was two inches in diameter—all the blood remained settled in the scalp—I cannot say whether the bruise might produce death without producing internal injury to the brain—there was no appearance of injury in the substance of the brain.</p>
               <p>(The witness was then examined at considerable length, and stated his opinion to be, that the prisoner had been delivered in a standing position,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183611280086"/>
               <p>which had caused the rupture of the <hi rend="italic">umbilical cord,</hi> which would ac<lb/>count for the blow in the head. On his cross-examination, he stated that if the child had fully breathed, the cavity of the chest would have been filled, and instead of being purple, it would have been a bright red—the marks in the face were quite unimportant—a pressure on the nose would have impeded breathing in part—the prisoner might have unintentionally injured the child in attempting to relieve herself—he had heard that the test of the floating in water had been long since exploded—his own ex<lb/>perience did not enable him to say that they must sink if they had never breathed, and he considered the test fallacious—the cut in the neck was superficial, it was through the integuments, and about 1-8th of an inch deep—no vessel was injured—supposing the fingers of a hand to be placed on the spots on the face, the flat part of the hand would not cover the mouth—the size, weight, and situation of the lungs were similar to those which had never inhaled.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in to assist Mr. Drayton in examining the body of the child—I have heard Mr. Drayton's evidence—mine would be only a repetition—I concur exactly with him regarding the appearances, both external and internal—every thing was apparently such as is always the case in a child born at the full time, both as to weight and length—when I first opened the chest, my impression was similar to Mr. Drayton's, that the lungs had not been fully inflated—I could not form any opinion when I first saw them, whe<lb/>ther they had been inflated to any extent—they were a purplish colour—when lungs have been fully inflated, they present a more florid appearance than these—on dissecting them, a few bubbles of air escaped—I afterwards submitted them to the test in water, any they floated—I should say there must have been some air admitted to cause them to float, because the spe<lb/>cific gravity of the lungs themselves, if they have never had air admitted, would cause them to sink—that is my judgement in all cases, except where putrefaction has taken place—in the absence of any thing of that sort, it is my opinion that lungs which have not been inflated would sink—the child had never taken a full inspiration.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an appraiser, and live in Great St. Andrew-street, Seven-dials—Morgan has lived in the house about five months, with a per<lb/>son named Adams, who I let my apartment to—she was taking care of the room for Adams, who was in the hospital—I have seen Collier there—on the evening of the 1st of November, about half-past seven o'clock, she came there with Morgan, and staid for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I did not observe whether they had any thing with them—they then went out together, and I saw no more of them till next day, in custody—after the examination before the Magistrate, I went into Morgan's room, it being left unlocked, my wife turned down the bed, and out fell a bundle of clothes—I went and told the prosecutor.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 1st of November, at about eleven o'clock, I went to Collier's apart<lb/>ment, and met Morgan coming down stairs from the second floor as I went up—Mrs. James said, "That is one of the women"—I stopped her, and turned her back into Collier's room, and took them both into custody—I went and looked at the prosecutor's door, and found the box of the lock</p>

               <p>forced off, and one of the screws broken in the middle—in consequence of what Mrs. James said, I asked Collier's husband for the tool which had been spoken of—he produced a screw-driver from a drawer, very much bent—I tried it to the door of the room, but could not see no marks to correspond with it—there were several marks of blunt instrument—I went to the fire<lb/>side, lifted up the poker, which was very much bent, and asked the pri<lb/>soner Collier how it became bent—she said it had been bent before, but on it I found a portion of paint which corresponded with a portion of paint which was off the door-post—I compared the poker, and it cor<lb/>responded exactly with the marks—it is my belief they were done with that instrument—I searched Collier's room, but found nothing—I went next day down to No. 5, Great St. Andrew-street, and there found the property—it was tied up in this shawl.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Herefordshire. On the 17th of October I was returning home, and called at the Duke of York public-house, at Han<lb/>well, to get refreshment—I cannot say how long I remained there—I was waiting for a conveyance to take me further down the country—I inquired for a bed, but the landlord could not accommodate me, and I left about nine o'clock—a man in a flannel jacket followed me out, and said "Old man, I can furnish you with a bed if you will go with me"—that was William Spinks, who has been tried for this—I went with him about twenty or thirty yards, and two men joined us, who said they were going the same road—they appeared to be in dark clothes—they walked a dis<lb/>tance behind, and I did not notice them much—I was taken across some fields till we came to a hay stack, when the prisoner seized me by the throat, and I was thrown down—I begged them not to injure me—the pri<lb/>soner</p>

               <p>said "If you don't lay still, you old b----, I will kill you"—they felt all over my body, and took every thing away I had about me—I had four handkerchiefs and a collar in a bundle, and a shirt and cotton waistcoat was wrapped in another parcel—I cannot say which of them rifled my pockets—they kept me down—I saw the prisoner at the time I was pushed down, he was upon me by the hay-stock, holding me down—the left hand cuff of my great-coat was torn—they were pulling my boots off—I begged them not to take them—they then left me with a threat, that if I moved from there before morning they would come back, and kill me—I believe it was the prisoner who said that—it was the same voice—I had seen the prisoner at the public-house in the course of the evening—I have no the least doubt of him.</p>

On the night of the 17th of October, I saw the prosecutor at my house, he had been waiting there all day—I told him he could not sleep there, and he went on the road for the purpose of getting a lodging—he left about nine o'clock—there were several persons in the tap-room—Spinks was in the tap-room—he had a flannel jacket on, to the best of my recollection—I cannot speak to any body in particular who was with him—the prisoner was in the tap-room in the course of the evening,—he was in the habit of frequenting the house—he and Spinks were acquainted—the pri<lb/>soner is a native of the place, and Spinks had lived there six or seven years—he was working on the rail-road, but the prisoner was not—there were several others with the prisoner, who are in the habit of using the house—the prisoner was there about two hours—I did not see him leave—I saw him there perhaps from six to nine o'clock—I am sure I saw him there as late as eight o'clock—he lives just by my house—I cannot say how he was dressed, whether he had a fustian coat on, or the brown coat he has now—it was a dark coat—I saw the prosecutor go out—I had taken great pains to get him out two or three times—he said he had lost the silver out of his waistcoat-pocket before he left house—there might be between twenty and thirty people in the house—the prisoner did not come in or go out with Spinks—I did not see him at all with him—I did not attend to that room much—the prosecutor came back to my house next morning, and said he thought he should know the one in the flannel jacket again—he said nothing more to me.</p>

The prisoner was my clerk—I am agent to Mr. Bishop, of Exeter—the pri<lb/>soner was authorized to receive money due to me or Mr. Bishop, and pay it to me at the time, or else the same evening, and to send to me at the same time an account of all business done, and a part of that would be the money he had received and paid—he had a general authority for receiving money—on the 16th of March he gave me no account of the sum of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—nor did he mention the transaction—on the 2nd of August he gave me no account of any sums of money received from Messrs Clark and Metcalf—nor any account of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received of them on Mr. Bishop's account—I discharged him on the 2nd of November, this year—up to that time he had made no statement at all of these sums—I knew nothing about the receipt of them at that time—I have an account of them in the prisoner's hand-writing, given to me since—neither of these three sums have ever been paid me—I am the general agent of Mr. Bishop—I transact all his business—I receive money for him, and pay it—this paper was given me by Mr. Homerton, who recommended the prisoner to me as clerk—and there I find the prisoner had received several other sums, independent of these—Mr. Force was a clerk to Mr. Bishop, and he had been a clerk to me in January last—he was employed as my clerk, to collect accounts due to Mr. Bishop—the prisoner had no authority to re<lb/>ceive these sums of money from any one but me—Mr. Bishop delivered me a book, which contains these sums, authorizing me to receive them—I had the list from him—there were two sums of Clerk and Metcalf, of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were due to Mr. Bishop—the prisoner had access to that book, which was delivered to me by Mr. Bishop himself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner render you an account of money received in May and August? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and that account was checked every night by myself, and the balance paid over to me, whatever it was—the items in this indictment were never brought to account.</p>

I had lent him some time before, and part of which was due to me; and as he left me on the Tuesday I thought it was better to take as acknowledgment from him—the receipt was for the wages—I did not owe him any wages, they were due on the Saturday, and leaving me as he did I considered he was not entitled to any—this is the receipt—1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was the salary for that week—I owned him no money on the 2nd of November—I never told him I would not prosecute—Mr. Force did not act as autho<lb/>rized by Mr. Bishop to receive his money—he is living at Exeter—Moon sat in the same room as the prisoner—Force never received accounts for Mr. Bishop which he was not obliged to account to me for—I never asked for any bill of exchange of the prisoner, nor authorized any body to ask it—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—I was under no engagement, but I have occasion<lb/>ally given him cast-off clothes—I cannot say whether any person while Force was in the office, came and paid any of Bishop's debts to Force, and the prisoner—I did not allow Force any salary—he was an articled clerk—I had this book from Mr. Bishop himself, to receive the sums—this letter was delivered to me by him to receive the sum of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had a letter to receive every sum in this book—I cannot show any authority to receive the sums mentioned in the indictment, because the prisoner has taken those letters, and called on the persons for the sums—I have had those letters withdrawn from my drawer, to which the prisoner had access—the parties would not have paid without some authority—the prisoner never to my knowledge paid any sums of money collected by him, to Force for Bishop, when Force was in the office—Force left in January last—this letter is an authority—there is no signature to it, but he had so many to collect (<hi rend="italic">reads.</hi>) "Sir,—Above I send you the Under Sheriff's charges, which I will thank you to pay to Mr. William Harris, 5 Stone-buildings Lincolns Inn, as the delay in payment of these small bills occasions great inconvenience, your early attention will oblige,—Sir, your most obedient servant"—I received in each case in which I was to obtain money for Bishop, a special authority from him—I have asked the clerk of Metcalf and Clark whether he had any letter corresponding with the one I put in—the prisoner paid no money to Force by my desire or to my knowledge—Force has paid me no money on account of Mr. Bishop—I know he has received money for him—that was when he was in my office—he accounted to me for it, but did not pay it to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was this book given to you by Bishop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some time at the latter end of January—I believe most of these items are Force's—this was put into my hands by Bishop—since that no other person has received authority to receive sums for Bishop, but myself—when I receive a debt, I go with this in my hand, to show I am the regular agent of Mr. Bishop—I show no authority—I have a general authority.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, and live at No. 79, Shadwell. On Monday morning I went to Stebbings' house with Ellis and Mr. Webb—I saw Stebbings before they did, and asked him if he could let me a horse and van on hire—he said he could—he said, "What sort of goods do you want to convey, household or other sort of goods?"—I said that was immaterial; I wished to ask if he had let his horse and van on the Friday previous—he said he had—I said, "To whom?"—he said he did not know—I said, "What sort of description was the man?"—he said, "Rather a stout man"—I said, "Was he fair or dark?"—he said he did not know, for he was a perfect stranger—I said, "Of course if you did not know the person you let the van to, you sent some of your servants what it?"—he said he did not—I immediately went out and fetched Mr. Webb and Ellis—Ellis said it was strange he should let his horse to a stranger—he said he had known the man—after some talking together, he said he had known the man by seeing him in public-houses—he did not say how often, in my hearing—I afterwards went and examined the van—I had seen part of the casks the prosecutor had purchased, at his own residence—I saw the floor of the van, and observed fifteen distinct marks of the bottoms of casks—I measured the diameter of the marks, and found</p>

               <p>they corresponded with one of the casks which I had at home, with some of the same description of butter which I had bought, and which came out of the same ship—I gave Mr. Webb the measurement of the rings in the van—I went to Coxson's house on the Thursday following, in company with Ellis, and saw some better—there was Leer firkin standing at the door—I examined it, and found the butter quite a different quality to Leer butter, and difficulty packed—Leer is on the borders of Prussia—I found it was Mecklenburgh butter in a Leer cask—behind the counter there was a Sligo Keg of Mecklenburgh butter—it was precisely the same sort as that in the Leer firkin—I weighed it afterwards, and the two together made within 2lbs. or 3lbs. of one cask—I asked Coxson where he had bought the butter—he said, the fact was he should not answer that question—I asked him if he had a bill of parcels—he said he could not find it—I said, "Of course you have bought it recently—you will tell me where you bought it?"—he did not answer me; but Ellis put the question, and he said he bought it of Harben and Larkin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale cheesemonger, in partnership with Harben and son, in High-street, Whitechapel. I have been thirty years in the trade—Coxson dealt with us—on the 24th of October he bought a firkin, and keg, of Leer butter of us—I did not sell him any Mecklenburgh—the butter produced, I think, is German or Danish, it is not Leer—I am not a sufficient judge to say whether it is Mecklenburgh—it has been re-packed—it is not Sligo butter—it is not the butter I sold him—I do not think I have sold him any Mecklenburgh for the last twelve months—there is not a considerable resemblance between Leer and Mecklenburgh, but when butter is crushed, and put down in that state, it is impossible to tell—I am persuaded it is not the butter I sold him.</p>

On the night of the 18th of October, before twelve o'clock, I went to Mr. Denton's public-house, at the end of Plough-alley—I pulled my outer door to, but the spring-lock did not catch—I returned in about three mi<lb/>nutes, and found somebody standing in the alley at the corner of my step—he was going to speak to me, but I did not answer him, and went in—I carried what I had got up stairs to my lodger, and fetched some coals afterwards, and returned to the kitchen—I then heard a rattling noise in my passage—I went to see what it was, and found a man leaving my par<lb/>lour door, and going to the street door—I had not fastened the door after me—I asked him who he wanted—he said he did not know—I asked what business he had there, and who he wanted?—he said, "A neighbour"—I said, "Do you live her? for I don't know my neighbours"—he said, "No"—I said, "What is the person you want?"—he said, "Betty and Kitty"—I said, "It is not here"—I shut the door after him, and he went away—I am positive the prisoner is the man—as soon as he was gone, I found the parlour door wide open, and missed a counterpane, blanket, sheet, dressing-glass, and tray—I gave the police information, and after<lb/>wards went to the station-house and saw the prisoner—I know him again.</p>

On the evening of the 3rd of November I was called from dinner, and found the prisoner in my passage, charged with stealing a Macintosh cloak from the hall—he said if I would forgive him he would confess the whole—I said I should hear nothing under a promise of forgiveness, because the thing was too palpable—he then said he would tell me who had sent him to seal it—I said I could tell him—he asked me who?—I said Thomas, who had been a clerk of mine—he said it was so, and that he was waiting outside to receive it.</p>

On the 28th of November, I met the prisoner Downes in Broad-street, St. Giles's, and went with her to a public-house in Drury-lane, about a quarter before 11 o'clock—she took me to a house in Charles-street, Drury-lane—I understand it was No, 2—we stopped a while in the room—she then lighted me down stairs—when I came to the street door I met Magner—my money and watch were quite safe then—she asked me to treat her, and I went with her to a public house round the corner—I then returned to the same room with her, and stopped some time—I did not undress then—she asked me to allow her to go out for a little gin—I said yes, and in her absence I looked at my watch—it was twenty minutes after five—she returned with the gin, and we drink it—after a short time, when we were partly undress, she said she was very thirsty, and asked me to let her go out for a pint of porter—I said yes—she requested me to go to bed, and she would return immediately—I went to bed, she stopped in the room backwards and forwards till I was in bed, and she then went out for the beer—I laid in bed about as hour and three quarters, when Gray came into the room and said, "who the b----h----is in my room?"—I said I was—he asked who brought me there—I said a young woman—he told me to get out of bed instantly, or he would break my neck down stairs—he took my clothes and threw them from one chair to another—I heard two persons speaking outside the door, and then both the female prisoners came in together—Magner spoke to Gray, who then pulled a clasp-knife out of his pocket, and said he would run it into the b----guts of any body that con<lb/>tradicted him—I put on my trowsers—I found my watch and purse, containing my sovereigns, were gone—I did not wish to say any thing then, being in fear—I took up my waistcoat, where I had eight shillings in silver, and two watch-keys, and found them gone—I dressed, and then he kept saying if I did not leave the room quickly he would break my neck down stairs—I went down, and met a policeman in the lane—I asked him how I was to act, and showed him the place—the light was still in the room—he got a brother officer, put him at the door, and took me up stairs—he three prisoners were still in the room—he commenced searching, and found my watch, two keys, and 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver on Gray I believe.</p>

               <p>"Sir—It is with the humblest sense of gratitude I thus presume to address you. Your kindness to me on Wednesday, in giving me the money, exceeded my expectation so far, that I cannot find words sufficient to express my gratefulness. The task I am now performing, believe me, is a very painful one; and more particularly when I reflect and expect my fate is sealed. I sincerely assure you my sufferings since this day week have been of a very severe nature: my conscience is in such a state that I cannot rest day nor night; I begin to find I am a lost man. All my future prospects depend entirely upon your generosity. Indeed, you and Mr. and Mrs. Mosley are the only earthly friends I can appeal to. It is you alone that can mitigate my punishment; therefore I trust you will consider my very unfortunate situartion, and allow me this once to implore mercy at your hands. If you should extend the had of compassion towards me, God and myself only know the debt of gratitude it will incur on me. I cannot well make an appeal on the part of my poor wife; my heart is too full, and more particularly when I know her innocence;—therefore I will leave it with you; it is too painful for me;—her sufferings have been great. Should I at any distant period receive my liberty, this will be such a lesson that I shall be another man. This is the first act of the kind I ever was charged with, and I trust in God it may be the last. No one but myself knows my feelings. In conclusion, allow me to intrude myself upon your generous consideration. At the same time, if you should feel disposed from the memory of your very obedient and humble servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH PERKINS</hi>.</p>

               <p>"Newgate, Nov, 29, 1836.</p>
               <p>"Sir—I humbly trust you will excuse my solicitations. Believe me, I am the most wretched man in the world. The more I reflect, the more it aggravates my misery, and increases my torture. I saw my poor unfortu<lb/>nate wife yesterday; her altered appearance harrows up my very soul. Still I cannot claim your good word; but, alas! if it were possible for you to know my sufferings, I think it would in some degree soften your ven<lb/>geance. Indeed, under a sense of my lost and ruined condition, hope seems to have quite flown; everlasting punishment suggests itself to my mind; I anticipate nothing but perpetual misery, without any prospect of the least mitigation. Let me humbly entreat you to take my case into your serious consideration. and, perhaps, as the last request of your unfortunate peti<lb/>tioner, you will be kind enough to recommend him to the mercy of the Court, which may probably ease the dreadful sentence which I know I shall shortly receive. I leave myself to your mercy, and at the mercy of that Being who never deserts the unfortunate; and I trust, if you have one spark of sympathy, you will extend it towards the unhappy being who is addressing you. Would to God I could see the last twelve months over again! I should be a different man;—but, alas! it is too late. Then, let me beg at your hands in this world; and may that Being, who knows my miserable heart, reward you in the next is the next, is the prayer of your very humble servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">JOSEPH PERKINS</hi>."</p>

The prisoner was in my em<lb/>ploy as a carpenter, and was at work at a public-house in Petticoat-lane—in consequence of information, on the 28th of November I went to a house in Wentworth street—I found there a deal board thirteen feet long—I took it to a house in Petticoat-lane, where the prisoner was at work, and compared it with two other boards there which were cut off the same plank, and found they corresponded both in the knots and in the cut—I asked how he came to take the board to the house in Wentworth-street, instead of bringing it to the job—he said, "I dont, know"—I gave him in charge—this is the board—I do not know whose house it was found in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, James-street, Ball's-pond. On the 3rd of December I saw the prisoner at Mr. Storer's shop, and saw her throw five pairs of boots down—I am sure it was her—I picked them up and took them into the shop, and she ran into the road, and left these boots and her cloak against the door—I saw the other woman run away as soon as she saw the prisoner brought back by Maidens.</p>

A communication was made to me of the loss of the duplicate on Saturday morning, the 26th, and about ten minutes after, the prisoner Alexander came into the shop, produced this duplicate, and applied for the gold chain to which it refers—it was pawned for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was worth about three guineas—he asked for the chain, and said he wanted to take it out—I said nothing to him, but immediately sent for the officer Roche, who came in, and then Alexander said he had bought the ticket of Johnson, and gave directions where Johnson might be found, and the officer found him by that direction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a broker and ship-owner, and live in George-street, Tower-hill. In August last I took Henry Eason into my employ—before that I had a lad named Green in my service—I had a large quan<lb/>tity of papers in three boxes in my counting-house, on a shelf over my head, and also some books—I have since seen two "The Devil's bridge, and Tris<lb/>tram Shandy," which I got from Mr. Snelling—Eason continued in my ser<lb/>vice till Saturday the 5th of November—I did not discharge him then—I told him to return early on the Monday morning, but he did not—on the</p>

               <p>14th of November, in consequence of information, I examined my boxes—I found the first box empty—and little or nothing in the other two—the papers were of considerable importance to me—I have lost altogether, I should suppose, not less than 6 cwt. of paper—I also missed fifty or sixty books, bound and unbound, and old bills of lading old letters, and old paid cheques—I examined my ledgers, and found cut out of one of them, the letters G. and H. from the index—I went the same evening with Lee the officer to look for Eason—I found him at his father's house in bed—he was brought down to the parlour, and I asked him some questions—he denied the charge, and after that confessed it—in consequence of his statement, I went to the premises of the Palmers, in Swan-street, about 200 yards from where I live—they keep a kind of stationer's-shop—there was a good deal of books and papers of different sorts about—when I first went in I saw old Palmer—I asked him if he was in the habit of buying waste paper?—he said he was—I asked if he had bought any lately?—he said he could not tell—I asked if he had seen any with the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> steam-packet on it, or the name of Linder—he said no, he had not noticed it—I said there had been some thing of that sort—he said if so, it must be his son—his son came in, and I asked him—he said he could not recollect any thing of the sort, and did not know that he had bought any—I said "The fact is, I have been to a house where you sold a quantity of paper, and have taken 14 1/4 lbs. out of that quantity which has not been used"—I said they had better recollect themselves, as I should take further steps, and bring an officer to see about it—I went to the police-office the same night, saw Lee, and told him what I had discovered—I saw from 60 to 90lbs. of paper at Lambeth-street, the day following—the greater part of it had the name of "<hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> steam-packet" on it, and my name—I saw some of the cargo books, and the two I have mentioned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I accompanied Mr. Linder to Eason's father's on the 14th of November—I got this bundle of account-Books from the younger Palmer on Wednesday the 16th, and this bundle of papers on Monday evening, the 14th, from Mr. Gorton, a cheese<lb/>monger in king-street, Tower-hill—I went to Palmer's house the night I saw Eason, but found it shut up—I went to some almshouses in Cooper's-row, near Crutched Friars, and saw them both in a room—I asked if they were in the habit of buying waste paper—they said they were, in small quantities, three or four pounds at the time—they bought and sold it—I told them that Mr. Linder had lost a great quantity of paper, which had been stolen by two boys, and some of them were very valuable to Mr. Linder, being ships' papers—that some of the paper had been traced to them from a shop which they had sold it to, and asked of they could give me any assistance in recovering any more of it, as the papers were of great con<lb/>sequence—they said they could not say exactly whether they could or not—they thought they should not recollect the two boys who had sold it—that they were in the habit repeatedly of buying and selling over the counter, and could not recollect persons who came in—I requested them to recollect as much as they could about the paper by the next morning, and told them it would be necessary for both of them to appear before the Magistrate at one o'clock next day—on the Tuesday morning they ap<lb/>peared, and said they had given 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the paper, and sold it for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they appeared again before the Magistrate on Wednesday, and the younger prisoner said he had discovered two persons who had part of the papers—that he had some from Mr. Martin of Somerset-street, and had it at home at his shop if I would call for it—this book is part of what he gave me—his father was present in the office—he then said there was a larger quantity at Mr. Catchpole's, in Cable-street, Rosemary-lane—I went there, and brought away this quantity of paper, which seems principally to relate to the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> steam-packet—it weighted fifty-nine pounds—Mr. Catch<lb/>pole produced this bill of parcels, which he states he received from Palmer—Palmer saw it before the Magistrate—they neither of them said from whom they received what they sold—they said Eason had frequently been with paper, but denied all knowledge of Morant—Eason was not in cus<lb/>tody then—they did not mention his name—but pointed him out at the office—I heard Morant say he was not at all in Mr. Linder's counting-house, he never was further than the parlour door.</p>

The prisoner was in a respectable employ in Panton-street—I know the firm in which he was employed—he came on the 15th of August to purchase a watch, and paid me for it in a few days—on the 15th of September he came again—he said the other watch he had formerly had had given so much satisfaction to the lady, that a sister of hers would like to have one precisely like it—I</p>

               <p>showed him three or four, and he ultimately took away three, and said, "If you will let me have them I will bring them back again almost directly"—I said, I must have them back the same day, or an answer about them, which he agreed to do—he was to pay me for the one selected by the lady, and return the others—he went away, and came back on the second or third morning, and said he had not been able to see the lady, she being out, and he had left them—I told him I was uneasy about them, and must have an answer—he called again next morning, and brought once back, which he said was not likely to be kept—the other two he had left, but he had not seen the lady—in the course of the second morning after he called again, and said he was very sorry the lady had locked them up in her desk, and gone to Brighton, and he was sorry he left them at all—I pressed him to return me the watches directly—he kept calling constantly till the 3rd of November—he said the lady had kept the one similar to the one she had at first, but it was fortunate he had left the other, for a younger sister of hers had taken a liking to the other, and he would bring the money on the 5th of Novem<lb/>ber, when the lady was to be in town—he called on the 5th of November, at half-past one o'clock, stating he should see the lady that evening, and I might depend on having the money; and if he did not see the younger sister, would it do to have the money on Monday?—I said it did not much difference, but certainly I must have the money—he said if the lady kept the watch would I give him a bill, to show that the lady did not give him more than she would give at the shop? I did so—I had no inten<lb/>tion of giving him credit for it.</p>

I know the prisoner—early in November I went to the prisoner on business for the firm—he said, "I have a lady, a friend of mine, who wants a gold watch; it is not in my way, if you can get me one I will sell it"—I said "If I do I must have the watch or the money the same day"—he said, on the 2nd of November "I shall see the lady—to morrow morning if you will let me have them I will let you have the watches or money before night"—I let him have four watches which I got from a wholesale house on my own account—I said I would pay for them or return them the same evening—he did not same that night, and the following day I went and said to him "I must have these watches back," he said I might have one back which was not finished in the dial plate—I went to him almost every day or night and could not get them back—every time it was, the lady was out, or had left them locked up in her desk—I went on Saturday evening and determined not to leave the house without them—he was not at home, and his wife said he was gone to the Alpha cottages, to see the lady—I said I would wait—he came in in a great fluster, and said, "It is all right, I have brought you two back, and the money you shall have on Tuesday"—I said I must have it on Monday—I went again and again, and on Friday I said "I shall come tomorrow night, and will not leave the place without it"—on that Saturday night he came to our door, as our young men were shutting up, and said, "It is all right, you shall have the money in the morning"—I said it is no use, I shall be at your house and will not leave the house without—I went and was there, he said he had not got it—I said I would wait till he went for it—he said he would have a crust to bread and cheese—I waited, and he went out, came back an said the lady was out and he could not have it, but the should have it in the morning—I said I should not come then, but I should have it one Monday—I have not got it—I found the watch at the pawnbroker's</p>

                  </hi>. I kept the Sun Dial public-house, in Goswell-street. The prisoner came to my house on the 4th of December—Bonnell and Anderson came first, and while they stood at the bar the prisoner went</p>

               <p>up stairs and called for a glass of brandy and water, and told the waiter he should he glad to speak to his master—the other two called for a bottle of wine, and went up stairs—they asked me to bring it up drink a glass with them—I went up and drank a glass or two with them—they asked me if I had any objection to play a game of cards with them—I said, "I had none in the house, and did not allow card-playing"—one of them went out, and bought a pack—Anderson said, "If you choose to play, we are respecta<lb/>ble men—I am a wine merchant," and the prisoner represented himself as a partner in the firm of Napier and Co., Scotch ale brewers—Bonnell repre<lb/>sented himself as a cigar-merchant—the prisoner sent his card down to me, to state who he was—I came up with it in my hand, and he said, "That is my card"—I thought myself in the company of gentlemen and tradesmen from their address, and manner, and we sat down—Anderson said, "If you will sit down to play, merely to make up a game, I will hold you free from any loss whatever, merely to make a fourth"—I sat down and played a game at whist—I and Anderson won it, nothing was bet on the first game, only a bottle of wine—after that they said, "Come, landlord, we may as well play another"—I said, I had rather go down stairs—I was very busy—they said, "Play another game," which I did for another bottle of wine—I was to be free; and as soon as the cards were dealt out, Anderson, my partner, said, "I shall bet on the odd trick, will you do it? I have got a good hand"—I said no, I would bet nothing, he said, "I shall bet for you"—I said, "Do as you please, but if you bet and win, or lose, I have nothing to do with it"—he threw down the shilling—we won the game, and, of course, the odd trick—he threw the shilling to me—I refused to take it, saying I had nothing to do with it—he attempted to put it into my waistcoat pocket—I put it on the shelf, and said, "There it is, I will have nothing to do with it"—I was then called down stairs—they rang the bell, and requested me to come up again—when I came up the glasses were charged—they said they were going to drink my health, and prosperity to me in my new house—I thought them very kind, and drank with them; and my firm belief is there was some<lb/>thing in the wine, for I felt very strange after it—they then asked me to play another game—I said, "No, I will play no more"—they said, "Play this one game; it shall be the last;" accordingly, I sat down to play the third game—the cards were dealt out—as soon as I looked at my cards I found I had most extraordinary hand—I think Spades were trumps—I had the four honours, and the ten and nine of trumps—the ace and queen of Hearts and the ace, queen, and king of Diamonds—I thought it an extraordinary hand to have—and smiled at it—the prisoner said, "Why I suppose you have got a good hand; you are smiling at it?—I will bet you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that we win with all your cards"—I said, "You may offer what you like, buy I shall bet nothing, though I am convinced I have the odd trick in my hand"—my partner said, "Never mind, bet them, here is my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you make up the other; and if you lose the game with the hand you have I will make it up to you"—I did not bet a farthing—the prisoner then rang the bell, and said, "Waiter, go down to your mistress to lend your master 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, Bob you need not go, I am convinced Mrs. Tennant will not lend me any thing"—the prisoner said, "Go and do what I tell you"—the boy went down, and came up, saying Mrs. Ten<lb/>nant would not lend me a farthing—the waiter then left the room—the pri<lb/>soner said, "I have hit on the trick now"—he rang the bell and said, "Go down and tell your mistress to send your master change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183611280195"/>
               <p>brought up five sovereigns and put and them on the table—the prisoner snatched it up and gave it to my partner (Anderson) who put it into his poc<lb/>ket—I said, "Now hand me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said, "No, I will give it to you presently"—he insisted that he would not give me the money unless I played out the hand—he said, "I have staked my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I know you have got the game in your hand"—I said, "I will not—recollect I have nothing to do with it"—he said, "Well, play the game, and so help me God you shall have it back, win or lose"—and on those conditions I played the hand out, but most astonishingly we lost the odd trick—I played six tricks and then he laid me a Club—I had not a Club in my hand, and the trick was lost—the moment it was over he snatched up the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was down on the table, which my partner had put down—they then took their hats, and said, "Well, we shall wish you good night"—I said to the prisoner. "No, you shall not wish me good night till I have the five sovereigns you have robbed me of; I insist on having my money;" and I put myself against the door—the prisoner said, "Nonsense, we will call again to-morrow, and you shall have your 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or if you are in want of money, this gentleman shall write me out a draft, and I will lend you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you come down to my counting-house to-morrow"—Bonnell drew it out, and the prisoner signed the name of "Hall" to it—he had given his name as Wells before on the back of the card—when I saw the name I was satis<lb/>fied they were swindlers and robbers—I persuaded them to stop and have a bit of supper—they wanted to go away, and said, "No; we must go, we cannot stop"—I said, "Stop; it won't be many minutes"—I opened the door, called to the waiter, and told him to tell his mistress to send up the cloth and supper directly, and whispered to him to tell M'Craw, the officer, to come down directly—they wanted to be off directly—I said they should not leave till they gave me my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—they said, "Sit down and have a bit of supper, and we will settle it all"—they did, and had supper, but were a very little while about it—they were then the going—I persuaded them to have some cheese, expecting the officer to come—I said, "Now, gentlemen, you have robbed me of my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and give it to me"—they got up, and Ander<lb/>son said, "I have an appointment, I ought to be there now; I will call on you to-morrow, and take you down in my chaise to show you some wine, and I hope you will purchase of me"—I said, "I am to have my 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before you leave the room"—they were forcing their way out, and at that moment the policeman and servant came into the room, and said, "What is the matter?"—I said, "These men have robbed me of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Anderson looked at him, and said, "I know you very well," and the prisoner said, "I know you"—M'Craw said, "Yes, I know you too"—Anderson had his two hands in his breeches pocket, and began shuffling—M'Craw said, "What are you shuffling there?"—he took one pack of cards out of his coat poc<lb/>ket, and another pack from between his thighs—he looked on his finger, and there was a gold ring—he said, "Where did you get that gold ring?"—he said, "What is that to you?"—he then searched Bonnell and the prisoner, and altogether took from them upwards of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but before he commenced searching, the prisoner said to me, "Well, you are a d----paltry fellow; will you take 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>?"—I said, "No, I will not take a farthing less than the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you have stolen from me"—he said, "Then d----you, there it is"—M'Craw put his hand on the money, and said, "I shall take this, and I shall take you afterwards in charge"—they then began to beg to be let go, and offered M' Craw money—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is better in your pocket than for us be locked up; you are a man of the world, and</p>

               <p>we will satisfy you"—but he took them to the station-house, and on the road there Bonnell offered all the money they had if M'Craw would let them go—they were taken before the Magistrate next morning, and were committed—they found bail in two sureties of 40<hi rend="italic"/>., and ran from their bail</p>

I caused an advertisement to be put in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> on the 3rd of September, offering a <hi rend="italic">bonus</hi> to any person who could procure a situation—I have not got it here—I received a letter on the 5th in consequence of that advertisement—I now produce it—in consequence of that I waited on the prisoner, at his office, 41, Devonshire-street, Queen-square, Bloomsbury, and on an interview with the prisoner, I told him I called in answer to the letter he did me the honour to address to me on the previous day—I produced the letter to him (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"41, Devonshire-street, Queen-square, Bloomsbury, September 5th, 1836.</p>
               <p>"Sir—In reply to your advertisement relative to a situation, in the <hi rend="italic">Chron<lb/>icle</hi> of this morning, I beg to inform you that if you will favour me with a call to-morrow, between two and four o'clock, I make no doubt of being enabled, in a personal interview, to furnish you with what you require, through my connexion with influential parties.

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> On producing this letter, the prisoner informed me he could procure me a situation in the Treasury, at a salary commencing at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per annum—I am sure he said that—he said he was an agent in the transaction, but previous to the negotiation being opened, I must deposit 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as a sort of cement to the bargain—I cannot swear he used that word, but that was the idea—I told him I was disinclined to pay any thing—he informed me if I did not deposit the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that nothing could be done—I left him, and told him I would think it over, and he said if I would call the following day, at twelve o'clock, his clerk would draw up an instrument, which he called a letter of agreement—he used the word instrument—I called on the following day, and saw the prisoner, and he produced a copy</p>

"It was I that did it'—(the corporal was not then present)—I had not said any thing about stealing the hay—he said "I have the key"—he did not show me any key—he said nothing more about the key—I said I must make a report, because the property was all littered about the place, from the door—I reported it to Serjeant-Major Bollin—I had been in this stable two days before—we have got two trusses here—I first saw the hay in Burley's shed in the Marsh—I went there on the Monday with the Sergeant-Major—he asked him if he had any hay there, and then we saw some in the shed, part of which is here—it is part of what we missed from the stable—I bound it up myself, and have no doubt of it—I saw it on Friday—I saw about nine trusses at the prisoner's which I had missed form the stable.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you any conversation with the prisoner Blagg on the subject to which that key or list referred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw him again about eight o'clock the next morning—he led me to a yard in the possession, as I understood, of Burley, and there was some hay—I saw Burley there—he did not deny it—he took me to stable—I had no reason to doubt that it was Burley's yard—he came out after I entered the yard—I asked him where the hay was which he had purchased from Blagg—he said he had purchased no hay—I said the prisoner had confessed bring<lb/>ing some hay there, and also had led me to the place—he said he had not purchased any, but he found three trusses there on Sunday morning—I asked where it was—he pointed to a shed and said it was there—we found there two trusses of hay—I asked him where the third truss was—he said he knew nothing about it—I then asked him if he had a stable—he said, "Yes" he went and opened the door with a latch—he went in, and there was a horse feeding at the rack—I took a portion of the hay out of the rack, and said, "I suppose this is part of the third truss?"—Bombardier Wilson went further into the stable, and found part of a truss—he called to me and said, "Here is part of the truss"—this was all in Burley's presence—he then went into a loft above the stable, and began counting some other trusses—I got upon a kind of hurdle, so that I could see into the loft, and he counted, in the stable and loft, eight trusses, including the broken truss—I then left a sentry in charge of it, while I went and communicated it to the commanding officer—I did not go again—Burely came to the barracks and asked me whether he could see Colonel Jones—I said he was gone to the office with the reports, but I was going there also, and would let him know—I said he was very foolish for trafficking with a soldier in any such way, or something to that effect—he then said he had been troubling him</p>

               <p>since last winter, and he would rather pay any thing than it should go before the public, as he had been between twenty-five and twenty-six years a resident in that place, and had not a stain on his character—I told the commanding officer, who told me to give him into custody—I have ex<lb/>amined the hay found in his stable and place—it is exactly of the same description as that in the barracks—the trusses are here—Burley has nothing to do with the barracks in any way—he was not in the service that I am aware of—Blagg has to be at the stable, when he is on guard, every third or fourth day—he ought not to have had access to the place, but he had the opportunity.</p>

On his premises there is a tool-house, where apples and things of that sort are kept—it is within the fence that encloses the ground—you can go to it from the house without going outside the fence—on Saturday the 26th of November, I fastened it myself, about five o'clock in the evening—the apples, walnuts, and baskets were all safe—I went the following morning about ten o'clock, and found some persons had entered by taking a pane of glass out of the casement, that would enable them to force back the lock of the door—it appeared that that had been done—I missed from seven to nine bushels of apples, two sacks, some seed peas, some walnuts, and a gathering basket—these apples are the same kind that were lost—I know this sack by the particular way in which the mouth is torn—I had used it a day or two before—there is the other sack—I know it by being a very large one—I am certain it is the same—the apples correspond with what they left—I have got a sample of them.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's pre<lb/>mises, and I saw the way the tool-house had been entered—I observed foot marks, and covered them over—they proceeded towards the place that had been entered, and towards a wood—they were plainly visible, and I covered them over—I afterwards went to the wood in company with the gardener, and found these two sacks of apples—they ware concealed in the wood, and covered over with the branches—there was a gathering-basket close to the sacks—I remained there from half-past five o'clock till about a quarter-past ten o'clock at night, when the prisoner and another man came—it was a very moonlight night—I had an opportunity of seeing the men—I am certain the prisoner is one—I and the other offered laid down, and the two men took each a sack on their backs—we got up, they ran away, and threw down their sacks of apples—we heard them fall—they made their escape—I took the basket, and left the other officer in charge of the apples—I went along the Woolwich-road towards the turnpike, and coming back I met the other man who had been with the priso<lb/>ner, coming out of a cottage where the prisoner lived—in consequence of what he said I went towards the White Horse, Charlton—I followed him, and just as we got between there and Lord Howick's I saw the prisoner and the other man coming along the foot-path together—that man went to meet the prisoner, and they returned together—five or six yards before they came to me the prisoner, left him, and went to the other side of the road—I bid them good night, and walked on—I then returned to the turn<lb/>pike-gate and met a young man who went with me into the wood—we were going to where I had left Smith—I heard two men talking in the garden of a cottage adjoining the wood—Smith held up his cutlass, and said, "Be quite"—the tall man that made his escape, came up a ladder, and put a dog</p>

               <p>into the wood—and followed him—Smith laid hold of him, and took him at that time—I saw the prisoner at the foot of the ladder, and pursued him down the walk of the garden—he ran—I came back and put the hand<lb/>cuffs on the other man—the prisoner left his hat, which I took up—he afterwards owned it—I after that went into the cottage, and saw the prisoner—I told him I should take him—he seemed rather con<lb/>fused, and said, "What apples?"—I said it was no use making any resistance, they should both go together—I looked about, and under the bed I picked up these shoes, they were wet and muddy—I asked whose they were?—he said they were his—he then said, "Stop, let me see"—he said, "No, I do not think they are"—I threw them under the bed among four or five old pairs—, "Now, said I look out your shoes," and he looked out the same pair again—when I went down to the cottage Smith brought the other man down the foot-path—I found the cottage fastened—the other man said "It is no use, open the door, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>—we then went in—the next morning I went to the wood again, and found these other two sacks of apples—the sacks I found first were not Mr. Farquhar's, but those I found on the Monday morning are his—I found them close by the gap that leads from the garden to the wood, with some sheeps' feet and part of a skin and head—the walnuts were in the sack where the apples were—I afterwards compared these shoes with the marks I had previously covered over—they went into the footmarks as completely as possible—they could not fit better—I am certain they were made by them—the gardener also tried them—I conveyed the prisoner to Newgate last Tuesday—he said it was a bad <hi rend="italic">job</hi>, but they could not give him more than fourteen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the White Horse, within half a mile of this place. On Sunday night the 27th of last month, I recollect seeing the prisoner at my house—he was there about three o'clock in the afternoon, and staid there till ten minutes before eleven o'clock—that was the time he went—I went into the tap-room between eight and nine o'clock, he was then asleep—when I went in at ten o'clock he was in company with one or two more, drinking some beer—at half-past ten o'clock I took him in a pot of beer—he said, "I shall not pay you for it, I did not get my money on Saturday night—I shall receive my money from Mr. Ledger, at Deptford"—at ten minutes to eleven o'clock he came to the bar to my wife, and asked what beer he had had—he said he would pay to-morrow—I went into my tap-room, and it was ten minutes to eleven o'clock—I shut up at a quarter before eleven o'clock—I am quite positive that between a quarter past ten o'clock and ten minutes before eleven o'clock the prisoner was on my premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Basing-place, Waterloo-road, in the parish of Lambeth. On Monday night, the 16th of October, I was the last person up—I went to bed at eleven o'clock—I fastened the house up entirely—I was alarmed about half-past six o'clock in the morn<lb/>ing by an opposite neighbour knocking at my street door—I came down stairs, and missed the articles stated, from the parlours—I had seen them all there the evening before—I found the street door wide open, and also the staircase window—the persons must have entered by the staircase win<lb/>dow, by getting over the side wall from the street—it is a sash-window—I cannot say whether it was fastened over-night, but it was shut—there was no appearance of violence on it—if it had been left unfastended a person outside could have thrown it up—I have seen all the articles, and have no doubt they are my property.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is an egg-merchant, and lives in Agnes-street, Waterloo-road, On Monday morning, the 17th of October, at a quarter be<lb/>fore six o'clock, I hear footsteps under my window—I live opposite Mrs. Luton—the street is about twenty yards wide—I threw my window open, and saw the prisoner Barnes—it was quite daylight—I had never seen him before—he removed from the window to the end of the street looking into Waterloo-road, and a few minutes after I saw Brown open Mrs. Luton's street door, and whistle—Barnes then crossed the road, and Brown came out of the house with two bundles, one was in a red cloth,—they looked up at the window and saw me, and then Barnes ran up the street—Mrs. Luton's staircase window was open, but the blind was down—Brown returned into the house—I went down and awoke Mr. Hancock, My land<lb/>lord, suspecting it was a robbery—I then returned to my window again, and staid there till exactly half-past six o'clock, when I saw Brown and Williams come out of the house—I feel certain of Williams as well—Brown had a small bundle, and Williams a hearth-rug and fire-irons—they left the door wide, open, and I asked Mr. Hancock to knock at the door, which he did—Mrs. Luton came down, and in half an hour she fetched me over to her house, and complained of missing several things—I did not know her before—I said before the Magistrate I felt certain that these two were the prisoners, but could not swear to them—I think Williams to be the man I saw with the fire-irons.</p>
