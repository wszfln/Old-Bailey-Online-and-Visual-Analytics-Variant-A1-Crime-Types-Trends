I attend at Mr. Chick's dining-rooms, Long Acre—on 1st February, at 10.30 p.m., the prisoner came in alone—I served him with two 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pies—he handed me half-a-crown—I saw it was bad, spoke to the waitress, and she took it from me, and said to the prisoner, "This is a bad half-crown; you have been here before"—he ran away—I had seen him before, on 28th January, between 10 and 11 p.m., and served him with two 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pies—he gave a bad florin—I gave it to Mr. Chick in the prisoner's pre<lb/>sence—he bent it, and told him it was bad, and gave it back to him because he said he knew where he got it from—he paid with a good shilling.</p>

She did not say anything to me before she went through the door. The mistress came rushing out and tried to detain me at the door, when the man who was in the shop with me rushed out. I tried to follow him, and pushed up against the mistress accidentally. The cabs being so thick outside the door, I lost sight of the man that had given me the half-crown.

I am a sailor, and live at the Sailors' Home, Wells Street—at 6 p.m. on Feb. 12th I was at Euston Square Station with some of my shipmates, and we went into a public-house and had a glass of beer—I saw Anderson there—she said, "Will you treat me?"—I demurred at first, and said that I did not know her, and she said. "You might as well treat me to a glass"—I did so, and took out half a-crown to pay for it—I had 12 sovereigns and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of 2nd Battalion of Scots Guards, stationed at Kensington Palace—I marched the relief sentries off at 4 o'clock a.m. on 21st February from Kensington Barracks, and the corporal posted them—the prisoner went out at 4 for the purpose of being posted, and returned at a few minutes past 6—it would take about a minute to inspect them, and march them off—at the latest they would be at their post 10 minutes past the hour—I visited the post a little after—I found the prisoner on the alert, and he challenged correctly—as a rule, men on duty, especially at midnight, carry a handkerchief with them for wiping their accoutrements,</p>

               <p>bayonet, and so on—I do not know whether the prisoner had one or not—it was not snowing when I sent the guard off at 4—it was snowing very heavy a little after 5, and slightly about 10 minutes before 5—there was no snow on the ground when the prisoner went to be posted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is no certain spot for the corporal to march the relief off; anywhere in the square is sufficient—there is no sentry-box in the square—the sentry would stand close to the entrance to Devil's Square and challenge the relief, and the relief would be posted close to where he stood—a sentry would not leave his post until I relieved him, or he would send a policeman to me to tell me—I dare say it would be possible for a man to get into the square when the sentry was posted if he had light shoes on—it may be that there is a gate open all night at the other end of the avenue—I have never been up there at night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> A man might get into the square unobserved if the sentry was standing at ease, and if he did not make much noise it would be possible for him to raise the window and drag the cream-jug out and go away—there is a boarding or a wall of some kind—it is not shown on the plan, and a man passing there would be under cover, and the sentry's back would be turned to the window then, and he could not see him without turning right about—if he were standing where he could see the entrance, then he could not see the window, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>—no one but the policeman and sentry had any business by Major Chaine's window.</p>

I am housemaid to Major Chaine, of Kensington Palace, this cream-jug belongs to him—I put it in the scullery lobby on 20th February, about 6 p.m., about four feet from the window—I left it there by mistake—there was no plate under it—there was a dirty dish about two feet from it—the window was shut when I went to bed, between 10 and 11—I think the last time I noticed the jug was about 9 o'clock—it was put in the lobby by mistake, as we do not keep silver there—the window is four or five feet from the ground.</p>

I challenged him, and he said 'All's well,' as usual. He left, and I saw no one else till 5.15, when I saw Constable 121, who said it was snowing. He went away eight or ten minutes, returned, and remained with me till about 6.5. No other sentry went on then. I left the constable there. I never saw anything of the jug. The same as Private Baker says, I never noticed it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner received a good character. He produced a written defence, stating that the policeman never went to the place in question at 4.15, not till 5.15. He had mid it took him an hour to go round his beat, but that he came twice while Baker was on duty in one hour; that he said that the jug was on a plate, and the housemaid had sworn it was not; and positively denied the charge.</hi>

I stood still a moment to know what to do, and I picked it up, and a man passing I asked his opinion what I should do, and he advised me to have nothing to do with it. I said I should take it to the station, and being Sunday night I didn't like to carry it openly, and put it under my coat, and at a stone's throw from the station I met the constable, and he asked me what I had got, I said what was that to do with him. He took me by the collar and said that I had something that did not belong to me, and not knowing he was a policeman I resisted him. He said then that he was a policeman, and I said I was going to take the thing to the station, but as he was an officer I would go with him, and I went. At the station I told them I picked it up, and said nothing about a man giving it to me."</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of Brentford—on 8th January I saw the deceased; she was suffering from bruises on the abdomen and side of her face, and from shock—there was a large bruise to the right of the navel; that was the only bruise on the abdomen—she was very weak and in danger for some days; she partially recovered, but subsequently took fever, from which she died—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found one bruise on her abdomen and two on the side of her face—the bruises had nearly healed, and there were no signs of inflammation from them—she vomited a great deal before she died; that was due in the first place to the blow on the stomach, and in the second place to the fever—the bruise was about two inches to the right of and below the navel—the prisoner was not present on the first day I saw her.</p>

I told Ginies he was in conspiracy with Tracy, and that the delivery order was no good; he said "Oh, it is not my fault, it is the fault of De Tracy"—the Magistrate at Thames Street Police-court, on the 13th January, dismissed the case—Ginies gave me the sampling order in the defendant's office—I went with him to the defendant's office after that—I have perhaps seen this writing two or three times.

About 1 a.m. on 16th February I was at Buckingham Gate, and heard the smashing of glass in James Street—I went there; it is about 200 yards distant, and leads into Buckingham Gate—I found the scullery window in the area of No. 28 had been broken—I found this coat lying under the window—the bars were straight in their place—they were 61/2 inches apart and inside the window—I rang the bell, and McAuliffe came to the door—before that, I had com<lb/>municated with another constable—I and McAuliffe and the other constable went through the house and made an examination—there are some stairs leading from the kitchen into the passage, and a door at the top of the stairs was open—on the handle of the kitchen door we found marks of blood—there is another door at the end of the passage, on the handle of which we found blood; also on the handle of a door leading into the garden, and in the scullery where the window was broken—there was a spot of blood on this; duster (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which was lying on the table near the window—I after<lb/>wards received a communication from the police-sergeant, and went to the station with McAuliffe—the prisoner was in custody; he had no coat on—I found no implements for cutting glass on him or for housebreaking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman B</hi> 163). On Sunday morning, February 16th, I was in Catherine Street, which runs at the back of the houses in James Street—Catherine Place has access to the public thoroughfare, and the backs of the houses in James Street open there—I went into Catherine Place, received information from another constable, and remained there—the houses, in James Street skirt Catherine Place—the backs of Catherine Street lead, to the backs of James Street—the backs of James Street are on one side, and on the other of Catherine Street—the two streets are parallel, with Catherine Place between them—I heard a noise at the backs of the James Street gardens, like some one climbing walls—I then heard the back gate of 12, James Street tried—I secreted myself under a wall in Catherine Place</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030028"/>
               <p>I heard a paling snap, and then saw the prisoner in his shirt-sleeves upon a wall about 12 feet high in Catherine Place; the back-garden wall of No. 12 James Street—he made a spring into the back garden of 5, Catherine Place, about six yards from where I stood—the wall runs to the back of Catherine Place—there is no street between the two gardens; the wall runs between them—I apprehended him upon the spot, and said, "What have you been doing over the wall?"—he made no reply—I called out for assistance—another constable came, and we took him in custody—while I was single-handed, he pulled himself away from me, and then I called for assistance—we took him to the station, where I saw a large cut on his right hand—it had been bleeding—shortly afterwards, McAuliffe and the constable came to the station together, bringing this coat—the pri<lb/>soner, when being examined before the Magistrate, said, "May I have my coat, your Worship?"—he pointed to the coat lying on the table, which McAuliffe had brought to the station—that was said about the middle of the case—the Court was not draughty; I did not feel the cold.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant B</hi>). I examined the premises at 28, James Street on Sunday morning, 16th February, about 10.30—in the scullery window in the area the glass of the second pane had been removed, and the entry was effected by a person getting in between the first and second ban—the interval between the bars was 61/2 inches—they are 4 feet 2 inches long with no centre-piece, so that with pressure they would give to the body by a person entering feet first—at the back I found marks on the wall of this house—the top bar of the window is fixed outside—the remaining five bars are inside—the width between them is 6 1/2 inches, but the pane is 2 feet 2 inches by 12 inches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The broken window was totally out—there was a mark as if a knife had been inserted—the putty was taken out and there was broken glass—I found no instrument—the bars would bend or give; I tried them myself—I did not get through them—when the prisoner was locked up he had two great-coats given him by the inspector because he was wet through—at the police-court he was in his shirt-sleeves—the pane of glass had been cut from the outside—an expert man could get out there as well as he could get in.</p>

I live at 14, Claverton Street, and am a clerk in the Admiralty—on Tuesday, February 25th, I was standing near the National Bank, at the corner of Northumberland Avenue, opposite the new hotel, at about 7.15 p.m.—there is an open space there, and adjoining that is the National Bank, at the corner of the Avenue, opposite the new hotel—I heard the clattering of wheels coming down Cockspur Street—I was facing that way, and saw a large two-horse van and a one-horse van going down the street at a very rapid pace—the two-horse van was nearest to me—I did not see the deceased, I was watching the vans—the foremost van, the two-horse ran, received a kind of check, and apparently paused for a moment or two on the crossing, and between the two refuges which are in the middle of the road, and in a line with the path—the crossing is from the end of the Strand going down to Whitehall—it is stone pavement; the wood pavement meets it there—the van-driver appeared to attempt to pull up at the crossing—I then heard shouting, and a crowd collected—I went up; I saw the deceased on the ground, and Lovell holding him—the van had gone about 20 yards down the Avenue—I followed it, went up to the driver, and said, "Do you know what you have done?" or something to that effect—he said that the blame was to be attributed to the other van, and that we were to look after that—I do not recollect his exact words—he also told me not to have so much to say—a policeman came up a few moments after—I did not hear what was said between the policeman and the prisoner—it was dusk at the time—the lamps were lit—there was plenty of light—there was con<lb/>siderable traffic—the traffic is very dangerous there between 5 and 7 o'clock to the foot-passengers crossing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was a mineral water van—I did not see whether it was loaded with empty boxes—they made considerable noise when they approached, and that attracted my attention—there are two refuges there—this occurred almost exactly between them—the roads might have been slippery, but I did not notice it—I believe I said at the Coroner's inquest, "I should think it was very likely the stones were slippery"—the incline does not appear to be in the direction of the Avenue—there is a heavy incline towards St. Martin's Lane—I think the van was crossing the incline, not in the full force of it—I cannot say whether the second van passed through the Avenue, I lost sight of it as it got almost to Taylor's van near the corner, and saw nothing of it afterwards—it disappeared mysteriously, and we none of us saw any more of it—my impression is that it went down Northumber-land Avenue, but I did not notice which way it went—I do not recollect saying before the Coroner that I believed the driver or drivers trying to pull up prevented me—my recollection is perfectly clear, I believe, as to every word I have ever said on it—I cannot attribute the van not being pulled up to be in consequence of the incline.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor—I employed the two prisoners—they had no business in the front shop at 6.45 a.m., nor with the key of the metal warehouse—this zinc is mine—I gave them no authority to take it—to the best of my belief this letter is in Lane's writing—I received it on 7th January—I had communicated with the police prior to January 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My orders were so strict that the prisoners would have reason to believe that I should blame them for going into the shop at that time, and especially if they took the key and went to the warehouse—there were 7 tons of metal in the front shop, without their going into the ware-house for any. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "H.M. Prison, Clerkenwell. To Mr. F. W. Banks. Dear Sir,—I write to you these few lines praying you to be lenient towards me and Jim, for our sin is not so bad as I have been told you think it is. Of course, what Nixon or others might have to answer for we cannot say, Sir. I hope you will not press the charge against us, if only on account of our wives and poor children. I was in hopes, and still are, of working for you for many years to come. I am very sorry, and humbly pray you to be lenient towards us and give us a fresh start, and then I do not think you would ever have cause to regret being lenient to two who are now as miserable as it is possible for them to be. I must now conclude with my best respects, to you from your humble and penitent servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">ED. LANE</hi>.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective attached to the Criminal Investigation Department—on 2nd January, in consequence of instructions, just before 7 a.m., I placed myself in the police-court opposite Messrs. Banks's premises, watching, and at 7.15 I saw Champ go to the front door of the shop, and then to the door leading to the warehouse; I then saw him leave the yard with a roll of zinc over his shoulder—I followed him over Deptford Bridge through Mill Lane into Friendly Street; when he turned the corner I was close behind him, because it was not light, and as I turned he was resting—I had another man</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030034"/>
               <p>with me—Champ went into George Street and Nelson Street—he then stopped a minute or two, went on again, and had three or four rests—he then put the zinc down outside the Clarendon public-house, went in, and came out again in three or four minutes, took up the zinc, and when he had got a little way down George Street I stopped him, and said "What are you going to do with that?"—he said "What is that to do with you?"—I said "I suppose you know I am a policeman?"—he said "I don't care if you are"—I said "What are you going to with it?"—he said "Take it back to Mr. Banks, where I brought it from"—I said "Oh, why did you bring it away?"—he said "That is my business"—I said "Yes, and it is my business as well now"—he said "Well, I brought it to decide a wager to see how quick I could carry it there and back again"—I said "It does not appear so, as you have had a great number of rests on the road; I shall take you to the police-station now"—I took his there and he was charged—Lane had then been brought in by another constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was formerly employed in the police as a warrant officer—I have had considerable experience—I was within six or seven yards of Champ as I turned the corner—I did not see Mr. John Banks there; I saw him when I arrived at the station, but not during the whole of my course—I took Champ because he did not go where I expected he would—he had to pass the police-court—it was a very heavy load, about 1 cwt.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am a zinc-worker, and live at my father's premises, 40, Blackheath Road—he stores a considerable quantity of metal in his warehouse—Nixon was a retail zinc-worker in Oscar Street—it is a little over a quarter of a mile off; there is a front and a back way there—I have known Nixon two or three years—Lane has been in my father's employ two years—I knew Nixon before Lane came into the employ; he first recommended Lane, and we took him in consequence—he also mentioned him to my father and mother—we missed zinc for some time previous to 2nd Jan., and communicated with the police, and detective Fox came—on 2nd Jan., about 8.45 a.m., I waited round the corner at the bottom of the street, and eventually followed Fox and Barnes and saw Nixon; he was not up, he came downstairs as I arrived—the constable told him he had come to search his premises, he said "Very well, you are quite at liberty to do that"—I went and looked, and found 16 sheets of zinc which I identified as my father's and they were taken away—four of them had a cross on them made by me—in April last our premises were inundated, and we had two feet of water, which went to a certain height on the metal, and that which was lying down was stained all over—each sheet is stained, and four of them have the mark I have put on—Nixon has not dealt with us for 18 months, and what we did for him was bending zinc and forming gutters—that was not entered in the books; we never book bending work—he paid when he took them away—these 16 sheets weighed 2 1/2 cwt.—I marked them, as I had missed metal—we always gave him a bill for money paid—if any one comes for a sheet of zinc I give him a bill for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not ask the Jury to believe that a sheet of zinc is never sold without an invoice—I have not seen Nixon on the premises—I conduct the business for my father; he attends to it very little—I recognise the zinc by the marks in the corner in French chalk, which state the weights, and by the chalk marks—the marks were not mine—when I was recalled on January 9th I swore to the zinc by the cross and stains—this was two months ago—the zinc is worth 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the water in April flooded all the lower parts of Lewisham and Deptford as far as the bridge; I did not hear of any one else's zinc being stained—zinc is not generally sold by weight but by the sheet—I wrote the weight on it myself—Nixon said at the police-court that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030037"/>
               <p>had spoiled some gutters for him—we did not supply the material; he brought his own, and we charged him so much per length for the work done, but I have had nothing to do with him for the last 18 months—there were not proceedings through a dispute about the workmanship—I did not order lames on 20th November, 1876, to bring back a piece of lead 12 inches long and a screw boss; my brother gave them to him—I had no conversation with him about them, nor did I make any complaint; it was all my fault that he left—he was discharged—my other brother who he has been working with is in the Broadway in a separate business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> His discharge was because at 11 o'clock I asked him to go to a job and he wanted to go to his dinner; I said that the job was more important, and he declined to go—this is the cross I put on the zinc, and the water-line is on the same piece; this was standing on end, and the water came up to here and stained it, and left the rest perfectly clean.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beershop keeper, of 68, Vauxhall Walk—at the end of October last I received some instructions from Mr. Arthur relating to the Brewers' Public-house, 10, Gibbon Street, Deptford, which was then empty—I went into occupation of the premises early in November—the house was then fit to carry on business in; the windows were in, the sign-boards up, the bar fittings in order, and the metal top in its place—the first floor above the bar was supported by an iron standard; that was in its place, and there was a panel cabinet separating the bar parlour from the bar—the gas-fittings were in their places—I put Chapman and Wood in possession—on 20th November I received a telegram, went to the premises, and saw my two men outside and a van there loaded with the fixtures and fittings from the inside, with a carman in charge of it whose name I do not know—I examined the premises when the van left, and found everything was removed; the house was completely gutted—this photograph (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents the premises as they are now—everything was pulled to pieces recklessly, torn out; the gas-fittings were torn away, the partition between the bar-parlour and the bar torn down, and the sign-boards taken away—I then followed the van, stopped the carman, and said, "Where are you going to take the things?"—he said, "I am going to take them to Mr. Harris's house"—I had a policeman with me, who took the carman's name and address—I never had any conversation with Harris in reference to the destruction</p>

I am surveyor, of Coleman Street—on 11th November I inspected the Two Brewers, which was in a condition for carrying on business, though dirtyafter 20th November I inspected the premises again, and prepared this sketch with care, according to the best of my skill—it would take about 345<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to put the premises into the same condition as they were before the injury was inflicted—the windows had been wrenched out with a crowbar, the partition between the bar and the bar-parlour had been dragged down, the signboards had been taken down roughly, the gas-fittings were gone, they had been taken down any<lb/>how; the iron stanchion was gone, that placed the building in jeopardy; it was the main support of the cross-beam.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had noticed the condition of the house on 11th Nov., because Mr. Tustin asked me to go and see how much it would take to put it in decent order, and my estimate was between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a pork butcher, of 353, Rotherhithe Wall, which business was assigned to me by Mr. Harrer, at Easter, 1877—the defendant was then a customer—he paid for one order under the other—in October, 1877, he owed me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was the last order he gave me—I sent my son for it, and applied myself—he said "When I pay you, I shall owe you nothing"—in November, 1877, I took out a County Court summons, and when it came on I was non-suited—I took out a fresh sum<lb/>mons—that was heard on 3rd February—the defendant was sworn, and said he did not owe the money, and that I charged him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a <hi rend="italic">lb.</hi> more than Mr. Harrer used to, and that he paid Mr. Harrer, and the daughter receipted the bill behind the counter, and he produced this receipt marked F.—the Judge gave judgment for the defendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was Mr. Harrer's man for 10 or 12 years before I took the business—the defendant was a customer of his for more than that time—he paid cash regularly—for some time he used little bills bike this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and that would be receipted when he bought another supply of meat—if he called without the bill a receipt might be given on another piece of paper—before I took over the business, sometimes Mrs. Harrer would take the money or Miss Harrer—I did not alter the name over the shop—after I took over the business Miss Harrer came occasionally on a visit to my daughter—my daughter never took large bills, but merely trifles, behind the counter—I never saw them behind the counter together—I did not pay. a sum to Harrer for the business, but I pay him so much a week for the use of everything—I pay the rent and taxes—Harrer comes there occasionally—I took possession on April 3, 1877—Harrer took his book with him—I do not know whose writing this is on this paper, between "33<hi rend="italic">lb.</hi>" and "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is not mine—I would not swear it is not my wife's—I may have sent in some bills to the defendant which Harrer left me—I never gave receipts on blank pieces of paper—the meat in respect of which I sued was supplied on October 17, 1877—I sued him in December because he ceased to deal with me—I do not know why—that was merely the complaint he made in Court, that I charged him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per 1<hi rend="italic">b.</hi> more than Harrer used to—I believe the defendant has been highly respected in the neighbourhood—I have not heard anything against him.</p>

These 19 sixpences are all bad; four of 1871 of the same mould; three of 1874 from the same mould; 12 of 1878, seven from one mould and five from another—in the absence of the moulds I have seen four good sixpences, one of 1871, one of 1874, and two of 1878—those are the patterns that we used for making the moulds from which these coins came—these five shillings are also counterfeit—this battery is incomplete; it wants a copper-wire and a screw—there is a ladle—these clamps are for holding moulds—this same copper-wire might be used for the battery—plaster-of-Paris is used for making the moulds; it is mixed on pieces of glass or tin—here is a mould for spoons; it has not been used—I would not say that the basin of sand produced contains lamp-black—sand is used for scouring the coins after they come from the battery—all the coins have been through a battery—they are cleaned by the sand, and then darkened by some black substance to deaden the brightness—I had to rub most of it off to compare the patterns—they were perfectly black—lamp black with grease is generally used—then they are wrapped up in paper, and before they are passed the black is wiped off—on the ladle there is some white metal of the kind used for coining.</p>

I live at 27, Red Lion Square—I was for many years a lithographer, and have a thorough practical knowledge of the business in all its branches—I have seen the lithographic apparatus produced by the police—I saw it put up at Scotland Yard as it would be for working—it was complete, and had been used—the tubes of colour would be used for printing what are called tints, not for opaque colours—I have seen all the Russian rouble notes in these packets taken from Szumowski; they are lithographed—if a person wanted to make those notes he would require a lithographic press and lithographic stones—all these in the packet "GR" are from stones and from the same stones, and the same in both packets—I have seen what would be a makeshift for a copperplate press; it was not made for one—it could be applied for taking transfers of small pieces such as these, because these might be engraved on a separate plate, and then a very small press would do to take a transfer and put them together, but I do not know whether it has been used for that purpose—another application to which it might be made would be for glazing the papers when finished—I have examined the eight lithographic stones produced by the police, and numbered them as I examined them—on stone No. 1 there are tints from the printing of six one-rouble notes—the border and the corner of the note I could trace very distinctly—I am perfectly certain that is the same kind of border and corner as is used in a genuine Russian one-rouble note; it is an exact counterpart, the same size and length and breadth—I could not, of course, trace the fine design, that would be impossible—on stone No. 2 I found the lettering of these one-rouble notes—I could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030058"/>
               <p>trace all the letters of line 5, letter for letter—the formations of each are peculiar; in lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 the type was similar—I could not trace the individual letters except by the space that they occupied—the ornamental Fin line 1 I can swear to—then on stone No. 3 there were six impressions or designs for the back of a rouble note, that is, for six notes—I could see distinctly the devices between the tablets containing the figure 1, and I could see the 1 inside—I could see them sufficiently to measure that there were the same distances between—the border was the same size, and there was the small type beneath the tablets, which I could see occupied the same space and was the same lettering—on stone No. 4 there were only three impressions—they were all different—all I could see upun them was the border of the back of a one-rouble note—it is my belief that those three were the originals from which other transfers were made, so that they could be renewed—all these four stones, 1, 2, 3, and 4, had the old work not merely ground off, but they were quite clean and nicely grained, and in a fit state to receive new work; you might have drawn a portrait upon them—No. 5 was polished fit for use—I could not discover anything upon that; it was merely polished—the first process in rubbing a stone off is to take coarse sand or pumice stone—in this instance pumice stone had been used—there may have been something upon it before, because a new stone would not be delivered in that state—I can tell the difference between a new stone and an old stone—this had been used, and the process of taking it off had been gone through—stone No. 6 was grained ready for use—I was not successful in tracing what had been upon it, but it had been used; I am certain of that; it had been polished down and grained—sand is sifted through a sieve, generally from 90 to 120 to the square inch, it would be the finest of these, and it would be absolutely necessary to put ink work on such a face—the sand is all one size—it is thrown over the stone, and another small piece of stone with some water is rubbed over it very carefully—that is called graining—a good grainer com<lb/>mands good wages—sea sand is not sifted at all—it is merely to cut it down—there is great danger of the work coming up in the next printing, and you may sacrifice 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of work—sea sand is used to take sufficient surface off the stone before beginning the graining—I used myself to take a very coarse instrument and make a gash across the stone, so that I should be sure the old work was ground off—graining is a delicate process of preparing the surface for the next work after being ground down—I do not think that sea sand had been used on these stones—stone No. 7 any one may see has been used for a black slab to spread black printing-ink upon it—No. 8 appears to have had three tints—those tints were rather larger than the one-rouble note itself, but it ia necessary they should be larger—in a one-rouble note the tints extend beyond the paper—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the back</hi>) it extends right over to the outer edge of the paper—it is necessary the tint should be larger than the note, and the paper is larger when first printed than in its present state, so that when the edge of the paper is trimmed you cut the margin clean—you could not print it if it was the same size; it would be always spoiling the next note—they are cut after they are printed—the paper produced is exactly the size to allow for the cutting; just a little larger than the notes—it would require to be a little larger; you could not print exactly to the edge; it would always be slipping, and spoil the next note it came over—stone No. 8 is only polished, and in a dirty state—the quickest way of erasing the impression is with a piece of pumice stone; the most effectual way is to grain down with sand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On Nos. 1, 2, and 3 the impressions were of a one-rouble note—Nos. 5, 6, and 7 I cannot tell whether they referred to a one-rouble note or not—No. 7 was only an ink slab—No. 4 was the back of a one<lb/>rouble note; there were three different impressions, one the back, one the front, and the other something else—I can swear that one was the back—5, 6, and 8 I could not distinguish—6 and 8 had been used—black ink would be necessary for making the notes; no black ink has been found—varnish would be necessary, but none has been found—there must have been black ink, or there could not have been the black ink slab—there was no palette knife or scraper—I missed a great many necessaries—the material for printing a perfect note were not all there, but a very long way towards it—I cannot say that any of the notes produced were made from the stones I saw, but the stones had been used to produce notes exact facsimiles of the Russian one-rouble notes—there is no doubt about that—the paper that might be made into a ten-rouble note is larger than the note—it might be used for anything else—I cannot tell the exact size of paper for a ten-rouble note—if the same size as a one-rouble note the same size paper would be required.</p>

"I went again on Friday, January 17, about 11 to 12 o'clock, and saw him where he works, and took cheques for sick pay—I called him out of the shop, and we went to a neighbouring tavern—I said, "I suppose you know what I have come about?"—he said, "Yes, I guess"—I took the cheques out of my pocket and showed them to him—these are the cheques for members entitled to those payments—he said he was very sorry to say he was not in a position to meet them—I asked him if he could meet a portion of them—he said he was sorry to say he could not, and that we should have to get the money from the general treasurer—I told him if he could not meet them that was where I was going—I said, "It is a bad job; when can you make it convenient to meet me to balance the accounts; could you do so on Friday"—he said no, his wife was ill—I said, "Saturday"—he said no, he would endeavour to come to my house on Monday—Green said, "Then I suppose you mean to say you have misappropriated our money?"—he said, "Yes, I am very sorry to say I have"—he went through the books with me on the following Monday evening—the balance was signed for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., after giving him credit for everything he had paid—he acknowledged it—he saw me again on January 20—between September 14 and the next meeting on January 4 he honoured cheques to the extent of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we drew 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and he has a receipt for it—that was before the account was made up—on January 20 I told him the matter had been reported to the committee, and he asked me to forward the letter marked B to the chairman: "To the Executive Committee of the London Union of Basket Makers, January 20, 1879.—Gentlemen,—Having received an invi<lb/>tation from Mr. Hiscock to meet the committee respecting my cash account, over which I have unfortunately had no control during very adverse circumstances I am sorry I cannot attend, but Mr. Hiscock is the bearer of a communication from me which I hope you will kindly consider. I am very sorry that it should have occurred just at this time, but I hope in a short time to recover myself and make all right. Yours respectfully, G.H. Berry." He put this I O U inside the letter: "I O U, the Treasurer of the London Union of Basket Makers, the sum of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I will agree to pay the same by instalments of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per month or more, if circumstances will admit. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE H.

I am an American—I was the cook and steward on board this vessel, and had been three voyages in her—I was on board on the voyage from Philadelphia when we went into the Tagus—I did not go on shore with the captain—I saw Boltenstein and Stobie down in the hold about 2.30—I saw Stobie strike Boltenstein down in the hold—I was sober—Boltenstein was afterwards called on deck by the mate, and was bleeding from the nose—when on deck the mate (Cook) told him to wash his hands and keep quiet—he then went forward and halloed out to the other vessel for help—the mate went forward and asked him if he was quiet, and took the man's shoes that lay on deck and led him aft, and struck him on the back of the head with the shoe—he then asked me to get him a pair of irons—whilst I was in the cabin I heard some words between them, but could not say what they wore—when I came out I saw the prisoner strike Boltenstein with the iron belaying pin in the forehead; that was before he was fastened to the stanchion—the effect of the blow was to knock him over the hatch—he did not move; he lay for two or three minutes insensible—the blood flew all over the hatch—when he came to, the prisoner put the handcuffs on him and fastened him round the stanchion with his hands behind him—he told the boy to go and wash Boltenstein's face, and the boy said he would not do it; he had nothing to do with obeying his orders—he was my boy, the cabin-boy—the mate asked me for a pan of water, and I gave it to him—he went aft and washed the face of the man in irons, and he made a kick at the mate, but did not kick him—he did not get a hold of him—he was going to wash his face—I believe Boltenstein called him a coward; that was when he was fastened up—when he made a kick at him the mate struck him in the groin with his fist—he then got hold of him by the hair and washed his face—that was a little after he had kicked at him—the sailors generally wear knives in the sheath—the prisoner took a knife from the sheath of one of the men—the man had told the second mate to knock off from abusing the sailors—Waldgren and Edwards both spoke to the prisoner, and asked him to knock off, for God's sake, from beating them</p>

               <p>—it was Stobie the boatswain they spoke to—the chief mate took the knife from the man down in the hold while they were speaking to Stobie—I did not hear the prisoner say anything when he took the knife—the man was not using the knife; it was in his sheath—he was speaking to Stobie at the time—I was sober—Boltenstein was worse for liquor, and Stobie was drunk—the prisoner was sober—shortly after this the captain came on board—Boltenstein was kept fastened to the stanchion about half an hour—the Portuguese police-boat came before the captain—then the captain sent him to the hospital, and he sent the prisoner and Stobie on shore for the Consul to deal with the case—I am quite sure all that Boltenstein did when I was present was when after he was in irons he kicked at the prisoner—before that he had not struck the prisoner or used any weapon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see Boltenstein struck with the shoe after he was in irons—I was sober, because I do not drink—the seven able-bodied seamen were all foreigners; the only one not a foreigner had left—all except one were taken on board in Philadelphia and had gone to Lisbon with us; that one was shipped in Philadelphia the voyage before—Boltenstein was not mutinous that I know of, nor refusing to work; he was a very quiet man—Edwards and Waldgren seemed to be sober; I could see no sign of liquor on them—I am not sure if Edwards was one of the men that had been on shore—I do not know whether Edwards and Waldgren had been drinking out of the bottle—I can swear that no knife or threat of knife was used by Waldgren—I cannot say why the prisoner took the knife from him—he was asking the second mate to knock off from abusing that man—he said, "You will be sorry for this after you are sober"—Boltenstein and the boatswain were both the worse for drink—Edwards and Waldgren did not threaten the boatswain; they said, "We will not work any more while the beating is being carried on"—that was when the prisoner told them to go to work—he had not then committed any assault—he was in command of the vessel, and responsible for the management and control of the vessel in the absence of the captain—Boltenstein and the boatswain had a bit of a scuffle, but he did not put himself in a lighting attitude—the boatswain made a strike at him—I was there when Boltenstein came on deck—the boatswain struck him, and then Boltenstein put himself in a fighting attitude—when Waldgren came on deck Stobie knocked him down, and then he knocked Stobie down—that was before any assaults by the prisoner—Edwards did not put himself in a fighting attitude—he was knocked down soon afterwards, but not before the prisoner had committed the assault—Edwards was struck in the forehead by the mate—that was not because Edwards had attacked him—he did not attack him—he was sitting on the bar with his arms folded—he refused to work—the mate went up to him and said, "Will you work?"—he said "No"—the mate then took up a belaying pin and struck him twice on the head—Edwards is a Russian—this was before the assault by the prisoner upon Boltenstein—Boltenstein was not putting himself in a fighting attitude—there was no fight in him—he was told by the mate to go and wash his face—he told the mate to wash his own face first—then the mate struck him with the belaying pin—the boy was told to get the water, but would not go—I went—the boy is under my orders—I am under the orders of the cap<lb/>tain—I do not know whether or not I am under the orders of the mate when the captain is away—stewards of vessels are their own "bosses"—they do their own work without any interference from any one except the captain—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030067"/>
               <p>there were only two men on deck—the men all stowed themselves away, they were scared to death—they were all sober so far as I could see—I gave the prisoner the water out of the galley on deck—I was about two minutes getting the water—the prisoner struck him in the groin once after he was lacked at—I got the irons—it is the custom to put men in irons who are violent and refuse to obey orders—I considered I was doing my duty in getting the irons—I considered myself under his orders—I did not consider it a fit and proper case in which a man should be put in irons—I went because I told the mate he was taking the law in his own hands by putting the man into irons in port when we were rather more than half a mile from the shore—another vessel was about a couple of lengths from us—I did not see that Boltenstein had a knife—it is customary for sailors to carry a knife—Waldgren had a knife—I cannot say if Edwards had one—I swear I did not see it—when I heard the cries I came to the hatch—Cook was there, Stobie the second mate, and Boltenstein lying down and Stobie kicking him, and also Waldgren and Edwards—that was about half a minute after I heard the cries.</p>

                  </hi>. I am staying at the Sailors Home—I was a seaman on board the British ship Fanchon—I remember her being in the Tagus on the 29th January—I did not go ashore when the captain went, I remained on the vessel—when the boat returned I remember Boltenstein being down in the hold—Stobie and I were there—Stobie knocked Boltenstein down and kicked him—his nose bled—I went to Stobie—the prisoner and Stobie were both in the hold—we all wore knives, I was wearing mine—the prisoner took it from me—I do not know why—I had not drawn it and did not intend to draw it—I told the boatswain (Stobie) to knock off kicking the man because they would be sorry for it—as he would not knock off, I said "I am not going to stop here any longer," and went up on deck—my knife was taken from me before I said this, when down with Stobie—Cook took it from my sheath—we all went on deck—I was on the sailors' forecastle, the fore part of the ship—I only saw what took place between the boatswain and Boltenstein, and not between the prisoner and Boltenstein—I went down the hold again and I heard some one crying out—I cannot tell who—I was sober—Boltenstein was not sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not on deck when the captain returned—I was on deck shortly after, and the police boat came—I heard the captain say to Boltenstein, "That serves you right"—Cook was down in the hold when the disturbance commenced between Stobie and Boltenstein—he was by the side of Stobie—I did not see him at the commencement—I know he was there when I was speaking to the boatswain—we were all working down there, both officers and crew—he was down there because he got a drink at the bottle—he was not sober; that is my opinion—I was sober—Cook was not very drunk; he was going to fight every man on board the ship—I do not think he was fighting the steward—the steward was on board—I was in Court while the last witness was examined—I did not hear him say the prisoner was sober—the prisoner was going to strike me when I was going into the forecastle, and he struck another man—you did not ask me that before—I was going to defend myself—I said at Bow Street</p>

               <p>"I pushed my officer to defend myself"—Edwards and myself were not struggling with Stobie—Edwards had hold of the boatswain's arms, I had not—I can swear that Edwards had not hold of Stobie, and that I did not attempt to draw my knife—I said nothing, and can give no reason for his taking my knife—I only said to the boatswain "Do not strike that man, or you will be sorry for it"—I was standing by him, and did not touch him—I only said "You are not going to strike him any more"—I did not hear Cook call to the steward to fetch the key of the forecastle, and did not know that he did fetch it—Cook did not say he would allow no man there until the place was cleared—I shoved him down to defend myself—I was not at the head of any men—he had not assaulted Boltenstein then—he insulted me and told me no son of a w—should go into the forecastle to-night—he had my knife in his hand—I said "I will go out from this so long as this fighting goes on"—I did not like to see the blood flowing all over the place—I said I was going on deck—I said "I will not stay here"—I did not refuse to go to work—the boatswain told me to go to my work, and I went to my work—I had a shovel in my hand when working in the hold—the carpenter is Gustave Grandfast, a Dutchman—I saw him with an axe in his hand—I was standing 'teen decks, close to the ladder—the ladder goes from the hold to the deck—I did not see Edwards sitting on the spar with his arms folded—I was in the hold working—I did not see Cook strike any one, I only heard him cursing and swearing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was working with the shovel—the carpenter was split<lb/>ting wood down in the hold with the axe—I heard a disturbance on deck, and I ran up—the boatswain was standing with a large belaying-pin in his hand—after the knife was taken from me, Cook had my knife in his hand, and he said "No son of a who—shall get into this forecastle to-night"—I said "I will get in, I want a chew of tobacco"—he would not get away, and I shoved him aside, and he fell down—the boatswain came out and told me to get to my work, and I went to my work—it was after this I was in the hold, and heard the disturbance.</p>
