               <p>to bed, and some were smoking their pipes—the prisoner did not in my hear<lb/>ing complain that I had done him any injury, or kicked him in the private parts—about five or seven minutes after my raising my foot I was in the act of turning to get into the barn, and the prisoner gave me a stroke in the neck with a book—he said nothing when he struck me—I called out to my brother, who was close by—I picked up the hook and examined it—I had no handkerchief round my neck, and no jacket on—I was taken to the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital. Timothy Harty was brought there early on 20th Sept.; he bad an incised wound on the neck five inches long, and an inch and a half deep, extending from behind to a little below the ear—it was a very severe wound, and was dangerous; his clothes were saturated with blood—several of the principal muscles and one or two arteries were wounded; he was much exhausted—I think the injury will partially impede the action of bis neck, as it has caused a contraction of the muscles, and they are not elastic as they origi<lb/>nally were—he remained in a precarious state two or three weeks—the instru<lb/>ment went to the bone—this reaping hook would be likely to produce such an injury—I saw blood and hair on it at the police court—the man was sober when he was brought to the Hospital; that might be the effect of the wound—I saw him first between 2 and 3 o'clock—the wound is perfectly healed, but he is in a state of considerable debility, and must be for some time.</p>

               <p>took the basket from my arm—I told him he had no business to follow me, I was a married woman, and did not want him—I did not ask him to go home with me—I should have a gentleman if I have any, and not a man like that; I never ask gentlemen to go home with me—I was not brought up to that; that does not come to my turn yet—the prisoner did not desire me to go away from him—(<hi rend="italic">Emily Abbott called in</hi>) I have seen her—I say again, the prisoner did not tell me to go away—he ordered me to go away, when he took my money—when he saw the people coming, he said "Go away"—he did not ask me to go away; he never desired it—I told him to go away.</p>

On 18th Nov., about twenty minutes to nine o'clock in the morning, I was looking out of the window, and saw six men walking backwards and forwards in front of Mr. Moscrop's house, which is a private house, opposite; they appeared to be in deep con<lb/>sultation, and then two separated from the rest, and rung the bell at Mr. Moscrop's area gate; they stood a little while; there were no persons in the house, they had gone to the Duke of Wellington's funeral, I believe; nobody answered the bell, and the shortest of the men, I believe, unlocked the gate; they both entered and went into the area; they very soon returned, and locked the gate after them—they then went to the front door, which they forcibly opened; they appeared to use some instrument, and wrench it open, and then went in and closed the door—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards I saw one man, in dark clothes, on the roof of the house; he came and looked over—there were hundreds of persons at that time in pursuit of the thieves, but they could not get in at the door—to the best of my belief the prisoners are the men; I could not distinguish their features, but I believe them to be them by their figures.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 22, St. George's-square, Pimlico, and am a private gentleman. On the morning of the Duke of Wellington's funeral I left my house with no one in it, but quite safe—there is a patent Chubb latch, which fastens on being pulled, and has a latch key-hole outside; a person could open the door with a latchkey—there was no bolt shot—when I came borne I found the door had been forcibly opened by an instrument, apparently forced into the door from the outside, and prized open—these pocket handkerchiefs are mine, and were in a drawer of my dressing table; this bracelet, and these two brooches are my wife's, and this watch is mine—they were all left in the house.</p>

I was working for Mr. Cox, on some unfinished houses in St. George's-square, and saw Masters with a ladder, coming along Lucas-street towards Mr. Moscrop's, which is at the corner of Lucas-street and St. George's-square—I heard a trap door on the roof suddenly, and saw Britton come out first, and Baker followed him—Britton went across to the back, to a chimney, and Baker went round to the front; I went, to prevent them from getting down through the empty houses—I am sure of Baker; I saw his face—I received this ring (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) from William Little, one of my work boys.</p>

I went on to the roof of an empty house about half-past 8 or 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoners both running away from No. 22, on the roofs; they both had their waistcoats undone—Baker was on No. 16, and Britton on No. 22; Britton had a ring, which he threw down—I picked it up; this produced is it—they both ran towards the houses which were unfinished.</p>

I beard a noise on the roof, and went into the attic; I opened the door leading on to the roof, and saw several men; the foremost of them was Britton; he asked me to let him come into the house, and see if anybody was there—I told him no thieves were there, and I should not let him in—he said he should have the police—our house is next door to Mr. Moscrop's—Mr. Cox brought me the property to take care of; I took it into Mr. Cox's house, and gave it to one of his men; it was this watch, bracelet, and brooch.</p>

From information I received I went to a coffee shop, in Dean-street, Holborn, on Sunday, the 21st Nov., about half-past 1 o'clock in the morning—I saw Wright there in bed—I told him I apprehended him on suspicion of committing a burglary in Milman-street—in the room there was a small child's chaise, and on it was some clothing—I asked Wright if it was his clothing—he said, "Yes"—it con<lb/>sisted of this pair of boots, and other articles of clothing—I saw the other officer find this hat, in the same room, at the same time—I went, on Monday morning, the 22nd, to Lincoln-court, Drury-lane; I saw Devonport—I saw ten duplicates there—one is for an umbrella, and another for a coat, pawned for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these boots that were found in the prosecutor's yard belong to Wright—a week or ten days before that there was a robbery at another place, and Wright was suspected, and then I saw these boots on his feet.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at No. 19, George-street, Blackfriars-road; my husband was Dr. Wood; he died at Christmas, 1850. I knew the pri<lb/>soner previously, and after my husband's death he called on me, commise<lb/>rated my situation, being without friends, and offered his services to befriend me in any way he possibly could, which I gladly accepted—I was entitled to 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a policy of insurance, which my husband had effected at Glas<lb/>gow—the prisoner received that for me; I authorized him to do so—my father was a member of a merchant's house at Glasgow, and I tried for an annuity of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. under the merchants' fund—I never exactly knew whether I was on the funds of that house, the prisoner told me at one time that I wife on, and at another time that I was off; but he enclosed me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the last quarter's money, and until then I never knew positively that I was on the house—I cannot say whether he has paid over the whole of that sum to me, for I never could get a reckoning with him—he has given me money in small sums from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I cannot swear altogether what he has given me, but from 3rd Jan., 1852, down to 5th Oct., when he sent roe 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from the merchant's house, I have received of him 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was the last money I received of him—I was also entitled to some pro<lb/>perty in Bishop-street, Glasgow; it was coming to me from my grandfather and father; I was unwilling to sell it, as I did not know whether my brother was dead, not having heard from him for three years—the prisoner seeing that I was in such poor circumstances said that if I would sell the property and purchase an annuity with it, it would add considerably to my small income—I told him I would not do so, as long as I did not know that my brother was dead; and some two or three months afterwards he sent me a little scrap of paper, in consequence of which I afterwards saw him, and he said I could now sell the property to purchase an annuity—that was the sense of what he said; I cannot exactly repeat the words—he said he saw a person in the Strand, who told him he saw my brother die in New York—I think he said that by word of mouth—I arranged with him to sell the property; he said the likeliest person to buy it would be the person who held two-thirds of it already, and he sent a note for me to go to his chambers one day to sign the deed of sale—I went to his chambers, signed some documents, and 214<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid over to me by the person who went away with the papers—after he went away I rolled up the money, and was putting it in my reticule to take it home, until he could look for an office for me to get the annuity—he said, "Oh, don't do that; it is very unsafe, you may either lose it, or the house may be on fire, or anybody might know you had so much money"—I said, "What shall I do with it?"—he said, "Put it into the bank;" he recommended the Commercial Bank; I went there with him, 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was lodged there in the joint names of Wallace Harvey, and Cathe<lb/>rine Wood; and 1 kept 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my immediate use—he said it must be secure,</p>

               <p>because he could not take it out without my signature, and I could not take it out without his, and it would be my whole subsistence to depend on—when we came to the Temple gate we bid each other good bye, and he asked me for the loan of one sovereign, which I lent him—I gave the prisoner no authority to sign my name to any checks; I knew nothing of his withdraw<lb/>ing the money till I went to the Bank—the signature "Catherine Wood" to this check is not my writing; I never authorized the prisoner to sign my name to that check—this ft a good imitation of my writing—(<hi rend="italic">the check being read—dated "31st July</hi>, 1851—<hi rend="italic">Drawn on the Commercial Bank of London, in favour of ourselves or bearer for</hi> 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Signed, W.

My dear Mrs. Wood, I received your letter on Tuesday afternoon last, and would have left on Wednesday, had it not been that I thought by staying a day or two I should be able to settle your affairs. I have been sadly put about for the last two days, by Andrew Tennent having told me on Wednesday that he would be obliged to charge a professional account, for the business he and his brother has done for you and Dr. Wood. I told him that both from what he himself had told me previously, and from what Dr. Wood and you bad always under-Stood, nothing was to be charged for any business of the sort, and that it would be a cruel thing to deprive the widow of the slender means which were now left to her. I have consulted one of the chief writers here to day, and I have taken certain steps which will prevent Andrew Tennent from getting payment from the Insurance Company, of any money which he might charge in the way proposed. There is one thing which I advise should be done at once; with an authority from you I could get the Insurance Company or Dr. Mackenzie to make an advance of as much money as would enable you to pay the debts which are standing, owing to Mr. Self, Dr. Beattie, Mr. Griffiths, &amp;c., and if you would send me this authority by return of post <hi rend="italic">without fail</hi>, I would bring the money to London on Monday night. If you do not do this, I fear that Mr. Andrew Tennent, when I go away, will try some scheme or other to defraud you of some portion of the money; but if the Company first makes an advance to you of a portion of the money, then Tennent can do nothing. You had better ask a third of the reversion, namely, 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; for you will require something considerable to pay off the various sums you owe and have something remaining, and it is better to get as much as possible from the hands of the Company at once. As to myself, I will never charge you anything for any trouble I hare been at in doing anything for you; and I can assure you that everything which I have at any time done for your husband or yourself has been done out of the purest feelings for your welfare. I shall try and bring the title-deeds of the property in Anderston also with me. I can tell you you have no one here who would do anything for you but myself. I have got your name put on the Merchants' House list of applications for a pension, and I have got some of the first merchants here to speak for you, and you are certain of getting on, at the first meeting, on the 5th of March, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. I found it unnecessary to send you any papers with reference to it. I shall go to-morrow to Oswald-street to look after the old lady you mentioned. You must sign the enclosed, and forward it to me by return of post, <hi rend="italic">without fail</hi>, else I shall be obliged to leave this, without any money for you, and you will not get it yourself by writing.

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Harvey, I have been in his service three years last Oct. In March, 1851, I remember Mrs. Wood coming to Mr. Harvey's house—I was present when she came—it was in New Weston-street—Mr. Harvey rung the bell—I answered it, and he told me to tell my aunt to come up, and be a witness to what passed between him and Mrs. Wood, and I was to come up too—I fetched my aunt, and we came into the parlour, and Mr. Harvey then said, "This is a bank letter that I have received from Glasgow"—he then signed his own name to this letter—and he signed Mrs. Wood's name too—he then wiped the pen, and gave it to Mrs. Wood, and told her to trace the dry pen over her name; she did so, and she remarked to my aunt that trouble had made her so nervous that she could not sign her own name, and that she had given Mr. Harvey power to sign her name and receive any moneys that came for her, and that Mr. Harvey was going to allow her an annuity of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; and that she was going to lend him her money—she mentioned the sum 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she said she was going to lend him 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and she said she wished it was thousands instead of hundreds, for his being so kind to herself and her husband; and that had it not been for him they should have starved—I remember Mrs. Wood calling on Mr. Harvey in Sept., 1851; it was at his chambers.</p>

I suppose you want some money?"—I said, "Yes;" he then said to Mrs. Wood, "Lend me one of those sove<lb/>reigns to give to Charlotte, and I will go back to the bank and draw out 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—Mrs. Wood said, "Very well"—she gave me the sovereign, wished Mr. Harvey good bye, and went down Middle Temple-lane; Mr. Harvey went upstairs; I went up to fetch a basket, and saw Mr. Harvey sit down and write something in a book, and tear out a leaf and put it in his pocket—I returned the sovereign; I went over to Mrs. Wood with it the same afternoon—we were living at Chiswick at that time—it was my custom to come down to him for money if I had none at home, and I had to go to Mr. Harvey to bring some things down to Chiswick.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1846 I became housekeeper to Mr. Harvey—I had previously lived as cook and housekeeper in various families; in noble<lb/>men's families—I remember about 1849 Mr. Harvey becoming acquainted with Dr. and Mrs. Wood—I knew the habits of Dr. and Mrs. Wood as regards temperance—I knew Dr. Wood personally—I have frequently seen him—I have known Mrs. Wood from that time—I have seen them very frequently come in an intoxicated state to Mr. Harvey's, and likewise in Essex-street, Strand—I have repeatedly seen Mr. Harvey supply Dr. Wood with money and food in 1849; that was very frequent—the girl was employed to take it, but I frequently made the parcel up—I have only taken it myself on one occasion—I remember about a sum of money of about 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming to Mrs. Wood; I always understood it was 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mrs. Wood has spoken to me of Mr. Harvey's kindness to her—she told me that but for Mr. Harvey they would have been starved, and she particularly requested me to give her Mr. Harvey's mother's address, that she might write and say what a good son she had to keep them from starving, but I did not do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever had conversation with Mrs. Wood about some money that she had lent or advanced to Mr. Harvey? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have; it was in the Temple—it was about three weeks after I went to Chiswick, which was on 9th May, 1851; it was about the commencement, or sometime in June; I cannot speak exactly to the date—she told me she had lent Mr. Harvey her money; that she had placed it in his hands to act as he thought proper with, and he was going to allow her 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week as an annuity, and when he failed to do that he was to return her the 210<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nothing more passed at that time—she was always speaking of his kindness towards her, and so forth—the property she was entitled to was at Glasgow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember at any time being called by Mr. Harvey to witness any signature? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do; that was in Weston-street—I know it was in March, and it was after Dr. Wood's funeral; and Mr. Harvey then went to Scotland—I perfectly recollect that it was in March, 1851—the young girl, my niece, and myself were called into the little back parlour—Mrs. Wood and Mr. Harvey were there—Mr. Harvey said, "I wish you, Mrs. Heffer<lb/>man, to be a witness to a transaction between Mrs. Wood and myself;" he then produced a letter, and wrote her name in it—he then wiped the pen, gave it into her hand, and said, "Now, Mrs. Wood, trace your name over what I have written"—she did so, observing to me at the time, "Mrs. Hefferman, the troubles I have had has made my hand shake so, and so nervous, that I cannot write;" and she said, "From this time I give all my affairs into Mr. Harvey's hands, as I consider it safer in his hands than in any one elses"—he then said, "Charlotte, you and your aunt are both wit<lb/>nesses to this."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said you are his housekeeper and servant; when did you last receive any wages from him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, that was a matter I always trusted to Mr. Harvey—he has given me money as I have required it, to purchase clothing, but I always believed in Mr. Harvey's honesty of intention towards me, that when he got on in his profession he would pay me for all—I was constantly in the habit of receiving money from him for clothing and food, up to the very morning he was taken—I have never had any regular wages from him—I have received some pounds from him; I always left it in his hands—it was an understood thing; I was not pressed for money exactly—I received some money from him on the very day before he was taken into custody; that was for food and clothing—I have received pounds and pounds from him, in the course of six years—I have not been in the habit of lending him money lately; not within the last six or nine months—I have not had it in my power, if I had, if it was thousands, I would have lent it to him or given it to him—I have not lent him money within the last twelve months—I have applied to him for money within that time, when I required it—I repeat the answer, that if I had thousands I would lend it to him, or give it to him, if I had it at this moment.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell the policeman that it was because you refused to sign a paper for him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was just that—I offended him, because he made out a lot of scribbling papers and said, "Sign this" and I said, "No, I will sign no such stuff, put it in the fire"—it is possible I might tell the police<lb/>man that—I did not tell him that was the reason I was struck, and my bonnet broken—I certainly did not tell the policeman that the reason why I had been assaulted and my eye blackened, and my bonnet broken, was because I had refused to sign some papers which the prisoner wished me to sign—I could not say such a thing—the night before this occurred he pushed me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you mean, then, by saying just now that there was a parcel of papers which you would not sign? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I say a few—nothing but papers of our own; it was wages and his own affairs, and he was writing all this stuff down, and I accused him of cruelty—I was certainly angry, because he pushed me—I refused to sign a paper about my wages.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Some time in March last year, 1851, when the prisoner was living in Weston-street, did you go to his house, and in a room in which Mrs. Heffer-man and the girl Charlotte were present, hear the prisoner say to you, "This is a bank letter I have received from Glasgow," and sign his name to the letter, and yours too: and did he then wipe the pen and give it to you, and tell you to put the dry pen over the name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never was in Weston-street, nor were those women in my presence in any business transaction with Mr. Harvey.</p>

On the night of 10th Nov., I went to bed at a little after 12 o'clock—before going to bed I examined the house—I went round to the outer doors; they were all bolted—I cannot say whether the water closet window was closed—I did not open the water closet door—these coats are mine—when I went to bed they were hanging in the passage upstairs—I was the last person up—this hat was in the passage—this dress was in the parlour—it belongs to my daughter—she was working at it that evening, and left it in a chair in the parlour—I have no doubt this toast rack belongs to me—it was usually kept in the kitchen—this pipe I believe is my son's—he had one, and he has lost it—this axe I can identify—it was kept in the safe under a shelf, and I saw it the next morning in the kitchen—I should say the value of these things altogether is about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the policeman brought Rogers upstairs, and gave him into my custody while he went about the house—he brought up three pairs of shoes—Rogers was without shoes, and he said, "Let me put my shoes on?"—the officer said, "Which are your shoes?"—he turned round, and pointed, and said, "These are mine."</p>

I was on duty, and was talking to Spratt when the prisoner came up and said, "You are the b—r I have been looking for; you attempted to rob me, I shall take your number"—he put his hand in his pocket, took it out, struck him, and ran off—I followed, and was half-way across the road; the prisoner took a bottle from his pocket, and struck Spratt to the ground; and when he was down, he struck him one, two, three; one after the other, and kicked at his head while he was down—I did not see him kick him more than once—when he had done this he ran down a passage—the first thing I did was to go and pick up Spratt who was bleeding profusely—I set him against the wall, went after the prisoner, and overtook him three parts of the way down the passage; I attempted to take him—he set his back against the wall, and put himself in a fighting attitude—after some considerable resistance, I took him in custody—I got him out of the passage, along Oxford street as far as a public-house, where another constable came to my assistance—as soon as the other officer put his hand on the prisoner's shoulder, he put his foot between his legs, threw him down and hurt his shoulders very much—I saw these pieces of a whisky-bottle picked up by a female close by where the blow was given—as soon as I had secured the prisoner I went back to Spratt—he was not sensible—I attended upon him until the medical man came—he remained insensible for some hours, and has not been on duty since.</p>

I was called to see Spratt on the 22nd. about 2 or half past 2 o'clock in the morning—he was just returning to his senses; I could make him answer questions by speaking loudly—I found a lacerated wound on the side of his face, both above and below the eye—he had bled a great deal—he is still on the sick list, and under my care—when I first saw him there were symptoms of concussion of the brain—the cut was not dangerous, but any blow that produces unconsciousness must be considered dangerous—another medical man had seen him before I did.</p>

                  </hi>. This is my dwelling house, and is in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate—I am a tobacconist—on 26th Nov. I went to bed at a quarter past 11 o'clock—I was the last person up—the windows and doors were then all shut and bolted—there are three windows, which open on to the leads on the first floor, and one more especially, which is the kitchen window—any person getting on the leads could get in there—I was awoke about half past 2 o'clock next morning, went downstairs, and found all the drawera under the counter drawn out, and the kitchen window open, which had been shut the night before; I had left 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and some halfpence in a small bag in the till in the shop, and about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of halfpence in a bowl—the inner sash, the enclosure of the shop window, was drawn aside, and the contents apparently all gone—I suppose there were about thirty bundles of cigars, worth about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., gone from the window; but I found them afterwards, tied up in a bag, against the private door—I saw my servant fetch this hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from off the leads.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Hodge; we are book-binders—Gorman and Mould were in our employ as errand-boys—on 25th Nov., in consequence of information, I went with the policeman Green to a shop in Shoe-lane, kept by the prisoner Jenkins's father—it is a news agent's shop, and I think they sell cigars—young Jenkins was in the parlour, and was called by his father into the shop; and Green, in my presence, said to him, "Have you bought, or had left with you, any books by any of Mr. Leigh-ton's young men?"—he answered, "No." Green then asked me the names of the two boys; I was unable to give them at the time, and went to ascer<lb/>tain them—I came back to the shop again, and Green then asked the prisoner Jenkins whether he had bought any from, or had any left by, Mould or Gorman; he said, "No."—I think the question was repeated two or three times, and each time he answered "No"—Jenkins's father then said he was afraid something of the kind was going forward; he had been in ill-health and unable to attend to the shop himself, and, in fact, be thought he had been robbed himself, and said "If you know anything about this; if you have got any property, any books, why do not you produce them? you have no business to associate with that boy, Mould, he belongs to a bad lot"—he then produced a copy of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" which had never been sent home to the publishers, from under some papers in the shop-window; I believe it was covered over; I had looked in the window and did not see it; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it is our binding—we have bound many thousands of this edition, but only 208 with gilt edges, which this has; and this has not got our label as binders of the book, which every book has when we deliver them to the publishers, and there is no mark of its ever having been there—I have examined the book, and find two of the 208 deficient—Green then said, "I know this is not all; you have got something else?"—he said, "No, I have not"—his father said, "If you have anything else, produce it?" and he then produced this "United States Exploring Expedition" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from under the counter—it is our binding—I have missed five copies of it—I cannot say that this is one of them; but I swear it is our binding—Jenkins was then removed to our counting-house; and in the presence of the other prisoners, he said, pointing to Gorman, "That is the one I had the books of, but the other one was with him" (that was Mould)—Gorman said he bad not sold him these books.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Galway-buildings, Bath, my husband is a mason there; the prisoner married my daughter Ann, in June, 1851; previous to Mon<lb/>day, 15th Nov., I received a letter from my sister, in consequence of which I came to town from Bath on Monday, 15th Nov.—I went to No. 76, Sun-street, Bishopsgate, where the prisoner and my daughter lived—I do not think it was 6 o'clock when I went there, I am not sure—my daughter was there, nobody else—Mrs. Roe, my sister, was with me—the prisoner came in about ten minutes after I went, to the best of my knowledge; he came in and said, "Well, mother;" I said, "Well, Henry, how are you?" he said he was very ill; I asked him what was the matter with him; he said, he had got a pain in the chest—I said. "I do not wonder at it, on account of your using poor Ann as you have"—I think the next words I said were, "Well, I am come to-night for Ann"—he said, "Wait a bit, and I will tell you"—I said, "I have waited long enough"—he said, "if you won't wait to hear what I have got to say, I will leave the room;" and he put on his hat—I said, "Ann, my dear, make haste and come with me, come this night with me, you knew that I was coming for you?"—I do not think the prisoner was more than ten minutes gone; he came back with sergeant Dixon, and a policeman named Brown—sergeant Dixon said to me, "You must go from here;"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "You are come to break the peace"—I said, "I am not;"—he said, "You are forcing a man's wife away, from what he says?"—she got up then, and said, "Oh, no, sir, it is not my mother who is forcing me, I wish to go myself"—sergeant Dixon said, "Do not you wish to live with your husband?" she said, "Not unless he will keep his hands off me; because it was decided between me and my husband,</p>

               <p>three weeks ago, for me to leave him, on account of his pledging all my clothes and selling all my goods"—the sergeant said, "These are family affairs, I do not know anything about them; you need not go to-night unless you like to;" and then he left—nothing else was said, to the best of my knowledge, before he left—after the sergeant left the prisoner took his wife by the hand, and said, "Come here Ann, my dear, are you willing to leave me?"—she said, "Yes, Henry, unless you keep your hands from me"—he said, "I never <hi rend="italic">hurted</hi> you, did I?"—I said, "How can you say that, when it took a woman or two to rescue your hands from her neck, and bruised it black?" she said, "Oh, Henry, I never told mother anything, it was not I that told her; "<hi rend="italic">no more she did not</hi>—he said, "I never bruised your neck black, did I Ann?"—"Henry," she said, "I never <hi rend="italic">runs</hi> from my word; yes, my neck was bruised black"—then he said, "Oh, Ann, the policeman told me you should not go home to-night without I liked; you shall not go home to-night"—she said, "Mother dear, I have neither money nor clothes to come home"—I said, "Never mind that my dear, for if you have health you can get more money, and I can pay your passage home; come with me to-night as I have got a return ticket to go back this night?"—he said no, she should not come to-night, "to-morrow," he said, "I will take her clothes out of pledge, and you shall have her by 10 o'clock"—there was a trunk in the room; she had put her things in it, and packed it up before he came in at first—all this time she was sitting on his lap—she said, "Henry dear, you have got no money?" "Oh," he said, "I can borrow some money on the bank book"—she said, "Mother, stop all night, and I will make you up a bed?"—the prisoner said, "No, there is no room for mother"—she said, "Yes, I could make you up a comfortable bed; do stop?"—he said, "No, the bed is not large enough, you could not be comfortable,"—then he said, "No, do not stop to-night, mother, come to<lb/>morrow morning, and have a cup of coffee with us?"—I said, "Henry, I do not consider my daughter's life safe in your hands this night, neither should I think myself safe to have a cup of coffee with you to-morrow morning"—he said, "Do you think that of me?" I said, "Yes, I do"—he said, "What do you say <hi rend="italic">of</hi> that, Ann?"—she made no answer to that—he said, "You shall be sure to have her to-morrow morning, at 10 o'clock"—I desired him again to let me have her that night, and to go borne, as my family would be uneasy about me, expecting to see me home the same evening; but he said, "No"—I think I wished him "Good night," and said, "Shall I have her to-morrow?" he said, "Yes"—he held her right hand in his left hand all the time—I said, "I do not know where I shall go to lodge;" he said, "Go over the way; somebody will tell you where you can go to lodge;" I said, "I am so strange here"—I came out, and met the same two policemen who were in with me—in about ten minutes afterwards I went back again, and called a great many times before either of them answered me, and my breath was so short, and I was very excited with them not answering me—I asked her to lend me some clothes, and I got a lodging for the night, and left about ten minutes to 7 o'clock—it was nearly half past 10 o'clock, or not quite so much, it might be a quarter past, when I returned in the morning; I am not sure—I went upstairs and called for about ten minutes, and there was no answer, but at last I heard him getting off some<lb/>thing, I do not know what, as he stepped down—the room door was fastened—he said, "That is Mrs. Rogers"—I said, "Henry, where is Ann?"—he said, "She is all right; we are happy now, <hi rend="italic">ain't us</hi>, my dear?"—I said, Ann, my dear, if you are there, why don't you answer me?"—he said,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185212130065"/>
               <p>She is here, and we are happy; "I said, "Well, open the door, then"—he laid, "There is no hurry"—I said, "Will you open the door, Henry; let me see her, that is all I want; if you don't open the door I shall go for a policeman"—I went downstairs and got a policeman, came back with him, and found the prisoner down in the passage—the policeman said, "Where is your wife, Horler?"—all <hi rend="italic">as</hi> he got out of him was, "She is right enough, and we are happy enough"—he appeared to be tipsy—the policeman said, "Well, tell me where she is; let us go upstairs and see where your wife is"—he said, "I need not go unless I like to; if you will come out with me, I will show you the spot where I left my wife this morning at 6 o'clock, kissed her, and parted with her in happiness"—I said, "If she is out of her own house she is in the river, or in some water, for you have certainly murdered my daughter;" I said, "Police, don't you let him go, for he is a murderer"—we all three went out then on pretence of his showing where she was; there was sergeant Dixon, and me, and the prisoner—the prisoner did not go anywhere, and I said, "Sergeant, don't you listen to him, because he is only leading us a <hi rend="italic">dance</hi>;" and at my request the sergeant took him into custody—the sergeant then went back to the house, but I did not—I saw my daughter's body on the next day, Wednesday; she had on the same boots and frock that she had on the Monday evening when I left her.</p>

               <p>—the prisoner was present, downstairs in the passage—Mrs. Rogers said, "I have come for my daughter to go home with me, according to arrange<lb/>ment made over night; I have been upstairs and knocked at the door several times"—she said that the prisoner said, "Who is there, is that you Mrs. Rogers?"—that she said, "Yes, Henry, open the door"—that he said, "Do not be in a hurry"—that she went again, and said, "Ann, Ann, why do not you open the door to me, and let me in?" and that she came down to get a policeman—she said all that in his presence—I said to him, "Why not tell Mrs. Rogers where your wife is?"—"Oh," said he, "she is all right, I slept with her last night, and left her this morning at 6 o'clock"—the mother remarked, "You have <hi rend="italic">drownded</hi> my daughter"—I said, "Why not say where your wife is; is she in the house, or is she not?"—he said, "It is all right"—the mother remarked, "You villain, you have murdered my daughter"—I said, "We will go upstairs, and see if she is in the house"—he said, "I shall do as I like about that;" and objected to go upstairs—he said, "I will take you and show you where she is"—we went out together, followed by the mother—I then said, "Where are you going to take me to?"—he then said, "She is all right, and I loved her; I worked hard to make her comfortable and happy—we should be very happy and comfortable together, were we not interfered with by her relations"—I said, "Where is this place you are going to show me, where your wife is?"—to which he made an evasive answer, and said no more—I then said, "You must go with me to the station house," and charged him with being drunk, and on suspicion of making away with his wife—he was intoxicated—I searched him, and on his person I found a key, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 5/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in money, and a boot-closer's knife—I left him at the station, and returned with Balchin to the house—we went up into the attic he occupied—there was a bedstead near the window, covered over with a counterpane—I went to it, and on removing the counterpane saw the body of a female with her throat severely cut; the windpipe severed—she was lying on her back; her right hand in a reclining position, and the left hand straight down by her side, her head rather on an incline to the left,—she was dead, and cold—there was a good deal of blood on the clothes—they were saturated with blood—her clothes were up to her middle, and her private parts exposed; my brother officer pulled her clothes down—I immediately sent Balchin for a doctor—I searched the place, and on the top of the head of the bedstead, which was a shut-up one, a sort of bureau, I found a work box, in which was a razor—the bedstead stands about a foot from the floor, when let down—everything was very clean—there were marks of blood on the razor; it had been partly wiped—the handle was all stained with blood; it was closed, and the lid of the box was shut down—the prisoner was taken the same day before the Alderman, and remanded—in going to the Compter from the Mansion-house he began to relate it—he said, "I will tell you;" I said, "I will caution you in what you are about to say—I shall put no questions to you, neither shall I answer any"—he said, "I know, I know"—he said, "After the mother and aunt went away on the overnight, we had some conversation together, respecting her leaving in the morning, which I believe she did not want to do; we did not undress, but we mutually agreed to destroy each other; she took a knife, and I took a knife; I was on the top of her, having connec<lb/>tion with her, and said, 'Remember Ann, this is the last time we shall have communication together;' I was then about to apply the knife, she said, 'Stop Henry, I will tell you where your razor is, with which you can do it much quicker, and put me out of my misery the sooner; do it quick, but do not <hi rend="italic">put</hi> me to much pain'"—that was all the conversation; I had no other con<lb/>versation</p>

I went into the station, about a quarter to 12 o'clock, and saw the prisoner—I told him he was charged with the wilful murder of his wife, by cutting her throat in an attic at the house, No. 76, Sun-street—he said, "The occurrence took place this morning at half past 6 o'clock"—I said, "What occurrence?"—he said, "The dreadful occur<lb/>rence between me and my poor wife, they had been giving her a quantity of drink"—that was all that took place.</p>

I had purchased some furniture of the prisoner; I saw him on Monday evening, 15th Nov.—he came to me about 8 o'clock, as near as I can guess; between 7 and 8 o'clock—he said he thought he was going to sit down comfortably, but his mother-in-law, and his aunt, had come from the West-end, and they had upset him again, and they seized him by the throat and threatened to murder him, and turned him out of the room, and he had come to me to know what he should do—I said, "Go to the police station, and get assistance"—he said, "Will you go with me?" and I went with him to the station, and I was asked some questions by sergeant Dixon about the furniture, which I answered—I went back to the house with the prisoner and the policeman; I saw his wife there—that was about half past 8 o'clock, when I went with sergeant Dixon; the prisoner was then in the passage—I then went home, about a quarter of an hour after, the pri<lb/>soner came to me again; that would be between 8 and 9 o'clock, as near as I can recollect—he stated that his mother had threatened to transport him, and would I go and have the money turned over in my name at the bank, and when he wanted it he would send to me for it; I agreed to do it—I then left him, and went out, and he went too—he did not go with me, he went out at the same time as I did, or directly after; I went to the station with the bank book, and then went to the bank and had the money turned over to me; the prisoner said that he should go to America, and take his wife with him, and then he should be away from them all—he afterwards came to me again with two coats, a pair of boots, and two waistcoats, and I had got a boa there that he had left there some time before, and he gave me some pledge tickets—he said, as he was going to America he should not get them out, and I might have them if I liked—he said, if he called for them I was to let him have them, and if he did not I was to keep them—he did not say anything more that night—I did not see him again until next morning—he left my house at 7 minutes past 11 o'clock on the Monday night—he was then perfectly sober—I saw him on the Tuesday morning; he came to me about half past 8 o'clock, as near as I can guess; he was very much intoxi<lb/>cated, and remarked that I must excuse him because he was intoxicated—I told him to go home, and he went away—he had not said anything to me on the Sunday previous—at the time be sold the furniture to me, he stated that his wife wished to part with the furniture, and if I liked I should have the first offer; I said to him, "Does your wife wish to part with it?"—he said, "Yes;" I said, "I will come over and look at it;" I went over, and said to the wife, "Do you wish to sell your things?"—she said, "I do; if you do not have them a broker shall;" that was about the 3rd Nov., in the fore<lb/>part of the month, about a fortnight before this occurrence.</p>

               <p>that they had the power to do it—I said they could not do it, and he said, "Fortune-tellers can do anything;" he appeared really to believe that they had the power to transport him, and I could not persuade him otherwise; I tried but could not—I said, "They can't do such a thing as that, Henry;" he said, "They can; they have got a doctor, she stated to me that she had bribed a doctor in Bath to come up and swear that I was no man; and if that was not enough, she would get my own father;" and he said, "What can I do?"—I said, "They cannot do it;" he said, "The doctor I dare not refuse;" I said, "You can have a doctor on your behalf," and he sent my wife out of the room, and there exposed himself to me—I could not convince him that they had not the power to transport him; he still believed they could, and I could not persuade him otherwise—he said that they wished to get his money, and that was the reason why he wished to have it turned over to me, that they should not have it—it was turned over to me late on Monday evening, after the bank hours—he was so anxious to have it turned over that it was done after the bank hours, because he really believed that they could transport him—he said that his wife's mother had said to his wife, before him, "Give him a pill if you wish to get rid of him, as I did a party at Bath, and kept him lingering for four months, and no one will talk about it;" he said that his wife's mother said that in his presence—he said nothing further about what they threatened to do to him; I have told you all he said about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Dyas; I am now in the hospital; I live at No. 2, Three Herrings-court. This happened on a Monday night, about 1 o'clock in the morning—it is fire weeks ago last Monday—had gone to bed, and was asleep—I was awoke by a noise, and a kicking and knocking at the door—I got up and opened the door—I saw a mob of people outside, and I saw the prisoner—I spoke to her, and told her that as soon as the policeman came into the court, if she did not get away, I would give her in charge; it was she that made all this noise at the door, and she was making a noise at that time—she pot her-hand behind her like that—(<hi rend="italic">putting her right hand behind her</hi>)—then I saw the blow coming, but I could not stop it—she gave me a blow with a chopper, and cut my nose quite across—the blow knocked me down, and I did not know what more happened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> She came to me that morning, and said, if I did not go and take some things for her to pawn, she would have her revenge. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, I did not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> On that evening I was coming up the court with my daughter, and this woman came and struck at my daughter, who had an infant in her arms; I put my hand up to save my daughter, and this woman struck me; I have got the wounds on my head now; my face was all blood. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> That is not true—I did not strike her.</p>

My daughter and this woman's son lived together; they were coming home from a raffle; there was a <hi rend="italic">mob</hi> of people, and they had a few words; I went to get my daughter away, and we were coming towards our own home when Mrs. Dyas came out of her own passage with a piece of stick; she made a blow which she intended for my daughter; I went to prevent her, my daughter having a young baby in her arms; she struck me two blows on the head, which set me in a gore of blood, and her youngest daughter does no more but goes in her mother's room and comes out with a shovel or chopper, I can't say which; she struck a blow at me; I drew myself back, and her mother caught the blow; they got a policeman, and gave me in charge.</p>

I was passing the door of the prisoner's house—I heard a scream of "Murder!" which proceeded from the parlour—the shutters were open, and I looked through the window—I heard the wife scream—I knew the prisoner and his wife before, by their living in the street—I did not hear the prisoner say anything—I saw him knock the woman down—he struck her across the head, and in the face, with a piece of iron—I did not see him do anything else—I went away—I saw her fall from the blow—at the time she fell, the prisoner was by the drawers in the room—I did not see her fall anywhere else before I went away—when I went away she was indoors, lying down by the drawers—I did not see any blood—I went away—I went upstairs, and was called down again, and assisted to take her to the doctor's—she was covered with blood, on the pavement, against her own street door, lying senseless—my dress was very bad with blood in car<lb/>rying her—the policeman helped me to take her to the doctor's.</p>

I took the prisoner on this charge—I assisted in conveying the prosecutrix to a surgeon—I found her lying on the pavement, in a quantity of blood, near her own house—she was bleeding from the back part of her head—her face was swollen, so that I could not see her nose at all—her clothes were so torn, that I was forced to get an apron from a young man before I could take her away, for decency's sake—the prisoner was standing outside his own door, about a yard from her—I asked him how he came to do it—all the answer I could get from him was, u take her away;</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. I saw this woman on 13th Nov., when she was brought to the hospital—she had two lacerated wounds on the back of her head, and several contusions on her head and face—her eyelids were closed, she could not see—the upper part of her chest and left side, and just at the point of her shoulder were black afterwards, but did not come black immediately—they were contused wounds—her clothes were all torn off—she appeared sober, but of course was a good deal excited—I never saw a woman's face so knocked about before—I examined the wounds at the back of the head—they were parallel to each other, and were about two inches apart—they might have been inflicted with any blunt instrument—all wounds on the head are dangerous—there was danger of erysipelas, but it did not come on—she was in the hospital from the 13th to the 30th, and was then discharged.</p>

I would have nothing to do with it, because I knew I should be seized up, and flogged next morning for it—I never saw the coloured men undoing his arm—it came undone itself in the bunk where he laid; I saw the coloured men looking at it, putting the bandage on, but not taking it off—I recollect the captain going on shore at St. Helena; he ordered the sails to be furled, and the ship scrubbed round—when he came back the sails had been furled, and the ship partly scrubbed by the Europeans on board—he did not order the black men to do anything which they refused to do; it was late at night when he came back, he did not see the men that night—I did not hear him complain that the ship had not been prepared—the captain was obliged to get men from the shore to prepare the ship for sea, but that was when he had the coloured men confined in irons—they were confined because they refused to work until they saw a Magistrate, or an officer from the <hi rend="italic">Penelope</hi> man-of-war, which was lying there—I gave one of them a letter to take; the waterman gave it to the captain, and I was flogged for it afterwards; I am only now getting well from it—I had thirteen lashes across the thick of the leg, but the captain counted twelve only; the first blow the boy gave me, the captain said, "I will give you two for that," and he took the gutta percha whip out of the boy's hand and gave it me across the thigh, and said, "John, I believe</p>

               <p>name; in consequence of that the prisoner was brought to me in about a quarter of an hour, and I told him that a sailor had been, and laid a very serious charge against him for robbing him of a sovereign—he denied any knowledge of it, in fact he said he had not been out of barracks—I said it was a very serious charge, not only disgracing himself, but the corps; and if he had taken it he had better see the man, make amends, and settle the matter—he said, "If I have done anything wrong, I am willing to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I can't see why I should pay for two"—I cannot say what he meant by that, except that I have since learned that two of them were in company, and that they divided the spoil—he was apprehended about 10 minutes past 3 o'clock the next afternoon.</p>

               <p>to her I sometimes was not able to obtain an answer for some minutes—I have put a question to her about two or three times, before I have got any answer—she said she could not talk, she was not herself—if I told her a thing, and spoke to her about it shortly afterwards, she did not recollect it—she had no memory, and could not recollect—the nurse, Mrs. Davis, made a communication to me about what she thought was her state—Mrs. Davis is here—in consequence of this low and desponding state of mind it was thought best that she should live apart from her husband; which has been the case six or eight weeks, since the latter end of Sep.—after the separation from ber husband she appeared to grow worse; more desponding—I do not know that her memory was worse, for it was dreadful bad in the summer—after the separation, she spoke to me several times of communications she had from God—she did not say she had any communications or commands from God, but she said God would not let her die—she slept in the same room as me, and whenever I awoke she lay awake, and she said she never slept, and I do not think she ever did soundly—one evening, a short time before this melancholy affair happened, she went out with the child—I went with her—she did not go to any particular place;' she walked up one street and down another, near the Waterloo-road—she was very cross; more cross than ever I had seen her before—that was about a month before the death of the child—she appeared to have no purpose in walking up and down—I offended her by saying I thought she had not fed the baby—she put her things on and went out, and I followed her—I tried to prevail on her to come in, and succeeded—she continued in that state down to the day this happened—I thought she was worse on the Sunday evening, before this Monday—I could not get her to speak at all—I said, "It is so dull, I wish you would talk;" and she said, "I cannot"—she continued to suckle the child as far as she could, but she had very little milk indeed.</p>
