                  </hi>. I keep the Bald—faced Stag, at Finchley. On the 21st of May, I missed a copper boiler from a shed in the yard at the back of my house—I had seen it safe in the course of that morning—the prisoner Powell was in my employ at the time as a labourer, and had been so for about two months—I suspected him and taxed him with having stolen it—he denied it for some time—I did not say it would be better or worse for him to confess—a man was there who had been at work in the same shed, and he said to Powell, "I will not stand by and allow innocent people to be charged with what they have not done; it is no use, Powell, for you to deny stealing it, you did steal it, and sold it half an hour ago, for half a crown"—Powell then said, "Well, I have stolen it, Sir, and I sold it for half a crown"—I sent for the patrol and gave him into custody—he then described the man to whom he had sold it—I took one of the patrols <hi rend="italic">with</hi> me, and went to the <hi rend="italic">prisoner Burton's house</hi> at Holloway—I saw Win there, and asked if he had been to Finchley—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had been to my house—he said no, he had not—he persisted in saying so for some time, but at last acknowledged that he had been, and said he had bought the copper boiler of a man who had a cast in his eye, for half a crown—I then gave him into custody, and found the copper boiler in his back parlour—it was then damaged and defaced—there were two large holes cut in the side, and the brass cock was broken off it—it was not in that state when I missed it, but I am sure it was mine—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I am not aware whether the prisoners knew each other—Burton's house is two or three miles from mine.</p>

We began taking stock on the 30th of December and finished in January—before we had completed it, the prisoner, who was in my master's service, said to me, then were three coat lengths that he had taken out to sell, which he would return the same night or the money for them, if I would put them down as being in the house—I made the entry as he requested, trusting to his honesty—I frequently afterwards spoke to him about them, and he pro<lb/>mised me they should come back in a few days or a week, or so on—they were not brought back—I told him on the 18th of April, that if he did not bring them back, I would tell my father; but J had told my father of it—the prisoner said he would bring them back the same night or the next morning, and if I would be there at a quarter before nine o'clock the next morning, I should see the goods—I was there the next morning—they were not there, and the prisoner was gone—I told Mr. Maclean of it on the 19th—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—it was his business to be at the warehouse at half-past eight o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of police. On the 9th of March I was tioned at Uxbridge—the new police had been established there not more four or five weeks at that time—I knew the prisoner before that—he was the owner of a stable in the town of Uxbridge—I found him in that stable at a late hour, a few nights before, in a very indecent situ<lb/>tion, and I aroused him—on the 9th of March I saw the prisoner stand<lb/>ing close to the Bird-in-hand beer shop—I observed several persons round the door of that house, making a noise, and Latham, who has been con<lb/>victed was knocking at the door for admittance—I was coming up the middle of the road—there were about twenty persons at the Bird-in-hand—I did not say or do any thing to them—I did not interfere with them at—as I passed, the prisoner Pearce came out from among the men, and said to me, "What business had you in my stable the other morning?" holding his fist up to me; he could have reached me if he had liked—I said to him,"Now, my good fellow, I don't want to have any thing to say to you, you know under what circumstances I was in your stable"—he bad been drinking and was unsteady—we were followed by the prisoner and Latham up to the station-house gate—as they went along they called out, "You——y police b——rs, we will do for you—we will drive you out of the town—we will make this town too hot for you"—when I got to the station-house gate, I attempted to open it—Pearce came in front of me, and put himself in a fighting attitude—I immediately caught hold of him to take him into the station-house—Latham threw himself round Pearce, as I sup<lb/>pose to prevent me taking him—we got them into the yard, and from there into the little room called the charge-room—Fortnum helped me—they, being drunk at the time, both fell down on the floor—I and my wife kept them down on the floor, while Fortnum went to unlock the strong room, which joins the charge-room—during his absence, Latham rose up on one knee, drew a knife from his pocket, and made several stabs at my person—I received one wound inside the left thigh, and another nearly through the calf of the same leg—I called "Oh God! the villain has stabbed me"—</p>
               <p>Pearce immediately called out, "That is right, give it to the b r, go it"—</p>
               <p>Latham got up on his legs and made another plunge at me—I drew my staff, and struck him at the side of the head; had I not done so, I believe he would have killed me—I stepped back into the yard, followed by Latham—he still kept thrusting at me with the knife—I received seven cuts in my clothes; but only two in my flesh—the station-house gate at this time was burst open by a mob, and the two prisoners rescued from my custody—I then went to my apartments, and could go no further through loss cf blood—a woman named Ann Clements took a very active part at this time—I bled very much indeed—I at length succeeded in getting the mob out of the station-house, and fastened the gate—from that time, till lately, I have not been able to apprehend Pearce.</p>

               <p>persons round the Bird-in-hand, making a great noise and disturbance—I heard Latham calling "B—y police," and "Down with the police"—I and Cooper walked towards the station-house, followed by Pearce and a mob—I cannot say whether Latham was with him at that moment—I heard Pearce calling us b——rs, and half starved, and that they would do away with us, and so on—I saw Cooper take hold of Pearce—I did not see what Pearce did to Cooper before he took hold of him—I was getting the gate open—when Cooper caught hold of Pearce, Latham hung on Pearce to try to rescue him—I assisted in getting them both into the station-house as far as the charge-room, and both Pearce and Latham fell down together—Cooper was rather pulled down with them—I went to get the key of the strong room to put them in, and while they were on the ground, Latham rose him<lb/>self on one knee, and made two thrusts with something which shone, and said "Take that, you b——r"—Cooper said he was wounded—I do not recollect that Pearce said any thing at that time—I went to fetch more po<lb/>licemen—I knocked them up out of their beds, and on returning to the station-house, found Cooper bleeding very much in the passage—there was a great number of persons outside, and stones were thrown, and the windows were broken—the gate had been burst open previously, and there was a great mob outside—both Pearce and Latham were rescued—Latham was taken again the same night, and Pearce got away.</p>

On the 19th of May the prisoner came with note to Mr. Hughes—I took it up to Mrs. Hughes—I was up about four minutes—Mrs. Hughes found it was a begging letter, and told me the knew nothing of him, and she could not think of relieving him—if she had, she would have relieved him—he came again at nine o'clock with an<lb/>other letter—I went up stairs with that, and as I was going up the stab, I went to ring a bell to call one of my fellow-servants to take it into the drawing-room, and saw the prisoner unhook this cloak from the hall, and go off with it—I followed him—he threw it down an area in York-street—I still followed, and took him.</p>

The prisoner was engaged at their house as a dresser of gloress—in consequence of something I heard on the Friday before the 10th of June, I sent for a policeman who came—(the prisoner resides within two doors of our factory at Battersea)—Mr. Fousse asked the prisoner for him key, and he gave up one key, which I believe was the key of the sitting room—the other key he rather objected to give up—I am not sufficiently acquainted with French to know what he said, but be appeared to object, till Mr. Fousse said he insisted upon it, and he then gave it up—he was taken into custody, and Mr. Fousse and the policeman went away with the two keys—this was about ten o'clock, and we had to appear before the Lord Mayor at twelve o'clock—they returned at that time, and brought with them forty-seven dozen of gloves which I have examined, and the I are the property of my employers—Mr. Fousse and the policeman went away again on the Saturday, but no more property was produced that day in my presence—it was on the Tuesday morning after—I have heard the prisoner speak of going to America.</p>

               <p>was never asked whether he had taken gloves from time to time to his house for the purpose of dressing them—I did not see any part of the property found at the prisoner's—the greater part of this property requires to undergo the process of dressing—they are cut at Battersea, sewn at Torrington, and then come to us in Aldermanbury, to be dressed for sale—there were two Englishmen employed as dressers, besides the prisoner—I am not able to identify any of this as property that has been missed—we could not miss any—we manufacture about four hundred dozen a week, and without we take stock, we could not miss any—we have taken stock si nee this, but have not missed these articles—it is impossible to tell what we lose—we cannot tell whether we have lost any.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Inspector of the <hi rend="italic">B</hi> division of the Police. On Sunday, the 15th of April, at twelve o'clock at noon, Manning came to the station-house, and told me that two of the lodgers, Edensor and Lucas, who had her front parlour, had been absent the whole night, since be<lb/>tween seven and eight o'clock the previous evening—she said she wanted to get into the room, knocked at the door, and found that the key was in<lb/>side—no person answered, and she believed there was a man inside, and she was very much frightened, that whoever was there had no business there—she wished the police to go and see who it was—I sent Fowler there—on the Monday morning I went to Mr. Eastwood, and there found the deceased—I searched his person and found a purse, containing three duplicates and three bits of paper, which I produce—on one piece was written, "Frederick John Spring, 47, Stafford-place, Pimlico"—I shoved that paper to Spring, and he said that was his handwriting—I went that morning into the front parlour at No. 2, New-court, between nine and ten o'clock, and saw Lucas, Edensor, and Spring there at breakfast—while I was there Manning came down stairs—I cautioned each of them, before I asked any questions, to be cautious how they answered me—I did not tell them it would be better to confess, or worse if they did not—I told them the man who had been in that room was dead, and asked who brought him to that room—Edensor and Lucas both told me they had left their room on the Saturday, between seven and eight o'clock together—I said, "I asked who brought the man there?"—there was no answer made to that—both said they left the room between seven and eight o'clock—Lucas said she did not return home again till twelve o'clock on the Sunday night, and she had never seen the man—Edensor said she returned between fix and seven o'clock on the Sunday evening, and saw the man there for the first time, and whoever had brought him had to get in with a false key, as she had the key in her possession—(she afterwards told me at the station-house that Ca<lb/>roline had the key part of the time—I think Lucas was present, but I am not certain—I had taken them all there together)—Spring said he was in company with the deceased on the Saturday night, but that neither Edensor nor Lucas were present at all—that was said in the presence of Lucas and Edensor, and they said the same as him, that they were not present—I found a wine<lb/>glass in the parlour cupboard in their presence, it smelt strongly of cloves—I asked what the liquor was brought in—Edensor said, when she re<lb/>turned home, between six and seven on Sunday evening she saw a glass and jug on the table, and that they were not there when she left on the Saturday, and how they came there she did not know—I asked first where the jug was—Manning said her husband threw it backwards somewhere—Edensor went out and brought this jug, which I produce—I then took</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">the younger.</hi> I was married to the prisoner, at Shoreditch church, on the 1st of March, 1829—I had been married to his brother six months and four days when he died—I had been a widow seven years, within a month, when I married the prisoner—I knew him living with his first wife at his father's and mother's—I took tea with them once, I believe—I have heard from him that the name of his first wife was Elizabeth Hale—I saw them repeatedly—Elizabeth Hale took the care of my infant when I went out to work, several times—he paid his addresses to me more than a month—I had got some household goods, and a good business—I worked at upholstery for the most respectable families in Camberwell, and round there—I had four rooms of goods, and every thing I could wish—they were worth about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we were about insuring for that sum at the time—I had heard two years before he paid his addresses to me, that hit wife was dead—my sister spoke to him about it, and he said if we were dissatisfied about that he had got a proof of it in his pocket-book, and he produced this paper—in consequence of that I agreed to marry him, but not without the advice of his father and mother.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear you did not ask him to live with you within the last six weeks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did ask him—I did not tell him if be would act live with me I would prosecute him for bigamy—he told me if I could do it, it would be doing him justice, as he should get rid of the pair of us—I accused him of bigamy six weeks ago—it was commonly reported in the neighbourhood and in the family two years before I married him that his wif was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in the service of William Patten Donkin Chubb, landlord of the King's Head, Dolphin-court. On the 19th of May, I opened my master's shop—the first thing I did when I came down stairs was to go to the coffee-room door, and see what o'clock it was—it was ten minutes to seven o'clock—I saw the clock safely fixed in the wall in the coffee-room then—about half past seven o'clock the three prisoners came in together—they called for a pint of half-and-half—they drank of it together at the bar—I am sure these are the three men—Honeyman then went into the coffee-room—he came out again, and whispered to Hill—I</p>

               <p>saw him—I was at the bar after that—Hill went into the coffee-room—while he was gone, Honeyman asked me to oblige him with a glass of cold water, that was kept at the back of the bar—he drank it—it was a large glass—Hill then came out and whispered to Honeyman, and Honeynman then asked me if I would oblige him with another glass of water—I said "No, here is the glass, and there is the water, go and help yourself"—Honeyman went for the glass of water, and drank it, and then Hill whis<lb/>pered again, and Honeyman said to Hill, "She is looking"—I came out of the bar, and went to the coffee-room door, and saw the clock was down—it had been taken out of its place where it had been fixed, and was behind the door, partly covered with two handkerchiefs—I asked them which of them took the clock down—they said they knew nothing about it—I went to the street door, and hallooed up to the bar-maid, and she came down as quickly as possible—there happened to be a person in the tap-room who heard me, and he came out to ask what was the matter—from the time I saw the clock fixed, till I saw it unfixed, no person entered the coffee-room but the two prisoners, Hill and Honeyman—Page came in with them, he talked, and drank with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. William Thompson, a baker, in Great James-street, Lisson-grove. The prisoner was his journeyman for about seven months—on Wednesday morning I got up about half-past six o'clock—I had occasion to look under the weighing-machine, and found a sack warm—I opened it, and found a two-pound hot loaf—I laid it there again—after that I saw the prisoner place it at the bottom of the barrow, and place his other bread to serve his customers on the top of the barrow—next morning I saw another loaf there, and he again put it at the bottom of his barrow—he took the same quantity of other bread, which is fifty 4lb. loaves, the same as the day before—on Friday I got up at the same time, and saw another loaf placed in the same manner—I told my maiter of it then, and he told me to watch him more closely—on Saturday I got up at the same, time, and saw two 2lb. hot loaves in the same sack, in the same manner as before—I saw him take them and place them at the bottom of the barrow, as before, and place the other bread over them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Little Corim-street Russell-square. On the 3rd of May I had finished a job in the country, and was returning to my lodging, with four sovereigns which I had re<lb/>ceived—the prisoners accosted me in Thorney-street, St. Giles, and Beaz<lb/>ley said they had a penny, and if they had another they could get a pint of beer, for they had had nothing since the morning—I had known them by sight before, but never spoke to them—I took them to a shop in Broad-street, St. Giles's, and changed a sovereign—I treated them to some gin and bitters, and then to some shell-fish—I spent 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was with them about three quarters of an hour—I took out my purse to pay and the landlord gave me half a sovereign and the silver, which they saw me</p>

               <p>put into a purse in my trowser's pocket—after treating them again I was going home towards my lodging, and coming up Thorney-street again, they swore I should not leave them unless I gave them some money—I then put the purse into my coat pocket and buttoned it up—Rowley seized me, threw the flap of my coat up, and Beazley opened it, put her hand in to the pocket, took it out, and they ran away—a man stopped me and asked if they had robbed me, and said, "It is no use, you will not catch them"—that detained me and they escaped—I gave information to the police, and next morning Rowley was taken up—she had held me while Beazley put her had into my pocket and took the money—Rowley was remanded for a fortnight, and Beazley was afterwards taken—I have not a doubt about their persons—I have seen them together frequently for years.</p>

I have a build<lb/>ing adjoining my premises, within about twenty feet of the dwelling-house where the cricket-bat and things are kept—you cannot get to it without coming within the wall of the house—it is surrounded by fences entirely, or by a wall all round—a person, to get to the premises, must not only pass over our wall, but the neighbours'—the cricket-bats, balls, shoes, and skaites were in the building on the afternoon of the 5th of June, and be<lb/>fore seven o'clock the next morning I heard they were gone—I went into the out house and found the window of the upper story of the out-house</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Bevan, adjoining the pro<lb/>secutor's premises. On Tuesday, the 12th of this month, I was at work at master's garden, at West-green, Tottenham, and saw the prisoners Webb, Newland, and Jenkinson in a footpath adjoining the field of master's person mises, with two others who I do not know—I saw them go to the gate of the field, and after a short time I saw Webb get into a ditch, and after he had thrust something up the arch of (he ditch, they all came round to the gate, and remained there for about ten minutes—there is a wall near the foot path—the other four appeared to stand behind the wall, out of my sight while Webb was groping in the ditch—he appeared to get something out of the ditch—I asked him whether he could not get it out—he said no—I said, "Let me see"—I got down to the ditch, but could not see any thing—I asked him what was there—he told me a bird's nest—Hooked into the ditch, but could not see it—it was not a likely place for a bird's nest-a neighbour came up—I told him I was apprehensive something was wrong and asked him to wait—Webb, at last, told me it was of no use to try and get it, for he had put some blackbirds inside there an hour ago, and could not get them out—Griddlestone came up, a rake was procured, and I got out of the ditch a cricket-bat without a name, and then another—they were in the place where Webb said he had put the blackbird's nest. <hi rend="italic">Newland.</hi> I was not leaning on the gate—I merely saw the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I live next door to the Refuge for the Destitute, at Hoxton—I am the assistant superintendent of the establishment. Dr. Lushington is a member of the society—he acts as trustee of the society—I believe his Christian name is Stephen—James Searle is the superin<lb/>tendent of the male establishment—the society consists of a number of an<lb/>nual and other subscribers—they have not any charter nor act of parlia<lb/>ment—John Searle lives in the house, and is responsible for the care of all the property there—it is an establishment for the reformation and protec<lb/>tion of houseless persons, and those who have been in custody for minor offences—the prisoner Timbrell has been in the house since November, 1886; Davis has been there ten months or a year; Shelton about eight months, and Cormack about six months—they were all employed in the shoe department, learning the trade of shoe-making, and all slept in one on the third floor of the building—they slept in hammocks hung on beams in the room—on the night of the 3rd of June they went to bed be<lb/>tween seven and eight o'clock—I locked the door of their room myself—I saw all their hammocks occupied, but I do not recollect seeing either of the prisoners except Timbrell—they must all have been present at tea-time, or I should have missed them—when I fastened the door, the shoe-room was safe,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183806180098"/>
               <p>but I did not enter the room—between two and three o'clock next morning I was awoke by Beckley, the policeman—I got up, and went to the pri<lb/>soners' sleeping-room—I found the door open, the bolt of the lock out, and the box of the lock loosened—the door had been forced—I missed the four prisoners from the room, and two others who are not in custody—I went into the shoemaker's-shop, which is on the same landing-place, opposite the sleeping-room—I found the lock of that shop apparently unin<lb/>jured, but the lower panel of the door was out—it appeared to have been cut with a knife—either of the prisoners might pass through the panel—the lock was still locked—the cutting-room is divided from the workshop by a wall, and in that wall there is a window, which I found open—I went through the window into the cutting-room, as the door was fastened as usual—all those rooms are on the same floor—there is a glass case againit the wall of the cutting-room, containing the shoes and other articles—that was wide open—it was only kept buttoned—I saw that boots or shoes had been taken from one of the shelves—there is a window in the cutting. room, which looks down into a court belonging to some alms-houses—I found that window open, and a hammock hanging out of it—the ring of the hammock was fastened to a post in the room—on pulling the ham<lb/>mock I found four hammocks fastened together, which would enable them to let themselves down out of the window, which is about twenty-four feet from the ground—they would more than reach the ground—they are seven or eight feet long—I suspected the other persons were in the alms-house-court—I went there with a policeman, and in a privy at the end of the court found Shelton, Cormack, and Davis, and I found two pairs of new shoes, one fustian jacket, one pair of fustian trowsers, and one fustian waistcoat—we found at the station-house that Cormack and Davis had on new shoes belonging to the institution—there was a ham<lb/>mock in the privy also—the shoes were in the privy, but the other articles were scattered about the door—it is the property of the institution, of which James Searle has the superintendence and care—I asked the boys in the privy what they had been about, or some trifling question—I do not recollect their answer—I gave them into custody—the lock of another bed-room was injured besides the one they slept in, but I cannot say it was done that same night—the hammocks had been taken from the room they slept in—we found the bed clothes lying there without the hammocks—the property is worth about 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found a short piece of iron about eighteen inches long and bent at one end, on the landing, between the bed-room and workshop—I think that would have effected the breaking I have described—the building is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—Mr. Searle sleeps in the building, under the same roof as the rooms I have described.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 217.) On Monday morning, the 4th of June, I was on duty near the Refuge for the Destitute, about a quarter-past one o'clock, and saw the prisoner Timbrell in company with another boy running from a wall close by the Refuge—I immediately pursued them and overtook Timbrell with a bundle in his possession—the other boy got away—I secured Timbrell in Queen-street—he hid him<lb/>self up in a doorway—I asked him what he had been doing—he said he had made his escape from the Refuge—I took him to the station-house and examined the bundle, which contained one pair of trowsers, one waist<lb/>coat, two odd women's boots, new, tied up in an apron; and in a pockets of his coat I found a quantity of shoemaker's tools—he had two shirts on, and a pair of nearly new shoes on his feet—I gave notice to Melvine, and accompanied him to examine the premises, and with him found the other three boys in the privy at the bottom of the court, with the other property there—I then went and examined the state of the premises—I found the lock of the bed-room door forced open—the box had been forced nearly off the door-post—the bed clothes were lying about, and five or six hammocks were gone—on the landing we found a piece of iron, and across the landing, at the shoemaker's workshop, the lower panel of the door was cut out—the prisoners could have got through there—Mr. Searle unlocked the door, and we went in—the window in the wall was open wide enough for them to get through into the cutting-room—the glass case was open, and Mel<lb/>alms-houses vine missed property from it—a window looking into the court of the was open—a hammock was fastened to a post in the cutting-room, the other end of the hammock was hanging out of window, and three or four more were tied to it, which would enable them very easily to get out of window into the court—I went out into the alms-house court, and in the privy at the end I found the other three prisoners—there were two pairs of new shoes inside the privy, and other articles of apparel lying about, some inside and some oat—Melvine said something to the boys, and they said they found the property there—Cormack and Davis had each a pair of new shoes on their feet—the prisoners were all dressed, besides the apparel I found loose.</p>

I am the wife of William Tyler, he lives at No. 3, South-row, Carnaby Market, St. James's, Westminster, and is a tailor—the shop is part of the dwelling-house, and we occupy it. On the 1st of June I went to the next house, leaving nobody in the shop—I left the door closed—it has a spring lock, with a handle on both sides—it was fastened—you could not open it without turning the handle—there is a bell attached to the door—I heard the bell ring and looked out, and heard a man at the door say "Make haste"—I then went to our shop and saw a person standing at the door, with his hand on the door, which was half open, and as I got to the door I saw a man inside the shop with his hands on a piece of ker<lb/>seymere—I can positively swear to the prisoner Monington—he was inside the shop—I heard the man outside say, "Make haste Tom, or Bill, or Jack," or something, I do not positively know which—I then went into the shop, and Monington had his hands on the kerseymere, which he had</p>

I laid hold of the lock and tried it—nobody came in after that—the bell I suppose was struck, for the door was slightly ajar—I am quite certain about where I left the kerseymere—my husband was up-stairs at work—I was not absent above a minute and a half—I found the kerseymere standing I on its end on the floor, and the prisoner's hands on it against the counter—I had left it on the ground against the wall—there had been time to go land move it before I was alarmed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Park-street, Grosvendor-square, and am a baker. The prisoner was in my service in April last—Charles Tibby, the deceased, was also in my employ, and Lid been so a fortnight or three weeks—on the 26th of April Tibby came into the bake-house, soon after one o'clock—there was nobody there besides me—he took off his coat, and I sent him out with dinners—it was usual for him to take them out with<lb/>out his coat—he returned shortly, and was going to take a tin dish from a cupboard outside the bake-house—the prisoner was either coming into the bake-house or going out—Tibby was taking the small dish out of the cup<lb/>board—the prisoner said, "Don't take that dish; I shall want it"—I saw them close together at that time—Tibby took the dish—I sent the prisoner out with some dinners—he returned in about five minutes, and I left Tibby and the prisoner together in the bake-house—(I did not know of their having any quarrel then)—in about ten minutes afterwards I heard a bit of a noise in the bake-house—I distinctly heard the prisoner's voice in a crying kind of a tone—I had just sat down to dinner—I jumped up, and was going to run down to the bake-house—when I got to the shop, at the top of the stairs leading to the bake-house, I heard one of them commence run<lb/>ning up stairs—I was going to call out, "What to heaven is the matter with you?"and just then Tibby made his appearance, with his arm bleeding, which he showed me—I told him to go over to Mr. Elsgood, the doctor—I gave him a kind of linen bag to cover his arm with—he went, and I ran down into the bake-house, and saw the prisoner sitting on the trough-board eating his dinner—I said to him, "Good God, what have you been doing to the young man? do you know how you have cut his arm?"—he said, "I was sitting on the board, eating my dinner—he went to strike me, and he struck the knife,"or "ran against the knife,"I cannot say which he said, I was so flurried at the moment—I left him then—the prisoner has lived with me about two years—he was as inoffensive a young as never entered a house—I never saw him disposed to quarrel with anybody—they were both quite sober at the time—I never saw the prisoner tipsy—I consider they were on good terms—I never saw any thing to the con<lb/>trary—I went over to Mr. Elsgood, who advised the deceased being sent to St. George's Hospital—I fetched a coach, and took him there my<lb/>self.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of St. George's Hospi<lb/>tal. The deceased was brought there on the 26th of April, about half-past two or three o'clock in the afternoon—I found a wound, about five inches in length, in his left arm, nearly to the bone, about three-fourths of an inch deep—I dressed it immediately—it had been dressed previously, but was still bleeding, and I dressed it again—it went on favourably for the first four or five days—it then sloughed, or, as it is called, mortified—he lost a large quantity of blood at that time—I was called up as many as five times in two nights to him, as he was bleeding—it was necessary to ✗mputate the arm on the evening of the eighth day—afterwards, secondary depo's formed in the knee and shoulder joints—he died on the 18th of May—his body was opened—I examined it the following day, and found it generally in a healthy state—there were no traces of disease but in the knee and shoulder joint—there was a small abscess in the lungs, but not of great importance—the immediate cause of death was the formation of the secondary depo's, and the constitution being much pulled down by loss of blood—I was informed he had been in the habit of drinking—the remote cause of the secondary depo's was, no doubt, the injury of the arm—his King addicted to liquor would add much to the sloughing—the wound in the arm would have an effect on the shoulder and knee joint—it is a common thing after a wound has closed for depo's to take place, which may be as much in one part of the body as the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe what you mean by depo's is an accu<lb/>mulation of matter in different parts of the body from the circumstance of the mortification? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was no appearance of that till he under-went amputation, which was on the eighth day—the appearances that I saw after death confirmed the reputation that he had of being addicted to drink—that would make him a bad subject to overcome an acute injury—I never saw the prisoner at the hospital—Maria Frost was a night nurse in the charge of the deceased, together with an extra nurse, whom I ordered, as his was a dangerous case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From the situation of the wound, and the length and depth, can you undertake to say, as a matter of certainty, that the injury might have arisen from the party receiving the wound attempting to strike, and striking his arm on the edge of the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot undertake to say whether it might not have been inflicted in that way—it was a wound from which I should have expected a healthy man to recover—I have seen hundreds recover from much worse wounds—the pre-disposition of the man's con<lb/>stitution contributed very much to the fatality which happened.</p>

About two o'clock in the day-time, on the 26th of April last, George Gray, a baker, in the employ of my master, and I had a few words about a tin dish; Gray got off the trough-board, where he was eating his dinner, with a carving-knife with which he was eating his dinner, in his hand, to fight with me. I was leaning against the oven. I had used no violence towards Gray. Gray made a blow at me directly he got near me: at first I thought it was the handle of the knife, till I saw the blood gushing out of my arm, and then I ran away to a surgeon's directly. The quarrel about the dish had lasted about five minutes. George Gray had been eating his dinner, and making use of the carving knife all the time we were quarrelling. George Gray was very jealous of me; and two or three days before this threw an upset at my head, and threatened he would send me to St. George's Hospital. On the day I was stabbed, George Gray and I were both per<lb/>fectly sober."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the nurses at St. George's Hospital. On Saturday, the 28th of April, I found the deceased in the Winchester ward, in which it was my duty to attend—I attended to him in the manner pre<lb/>scribed by Mr. Chappell—on the first night I attended him he wished to be talking, and I checked him—on the following night, Sunday, when I went on duty, the deceased asked me what I thought of his arm; if I thought he was likely to lose it—I told him it was not for me to answer those ques<lb/>tions; but referred him to the house-surgeons in the morning—he wished to ask me several questions, and I said, "Was it an accident?"—he told me it was an accident through a quarrel with his fellow-journeyman, in con<lb/>sequence of a tin which ho wanted to got from him (the prisoner)—that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183806180105"/>
               <p>would have his dinner, and wished to use the tin before the deceased used it—the deceased told him he would not allow him to use the tin be<lb/>fore be used it himself—a quarrel ensued, and he told the prisoner, rather than he should be master, he would lose his life—a quarrel ensued, and while the deceased was attempting to get the tin from the prisoner, the de<lb/>ceased rushed against the prisoner, and the knife cut the deceased's arm—ore by accident than for the purpose—that was positively the language used on the Sunday night—I put the question, if he took up the knife purpose—he told me, no; that he was taking his dinner with his knife I said, be must have been very irritable, or he would have given up the, and then this would not have happened—he said, he was irritable, and aggravated—he said, if he had not aggravated him to have done it, he did not think he would have done it, and that he freely forgave him—he told me three or four times, that the prisoner came to see him, that he was very glad to see him, and he was very happy to think they were such good friends—he forgave him freely—he repeatedly spoke of the attention and kindness of the prisoner's friends to him—he said he was sure he should not want a friend in Mr. George, if he lived to go from St. George's Hos<lb/>pital—he told me, about two nights before he died, that he might thank his arm, his irritableness, and the tin, for what he was come to, and he freely forgave poor Gray, who was in prison; and he hoped he would soon come out safe, for he was the aggressor.</p>

Between seven and eight o'clock on the 18th of June, I was outside minding the shoes—the prisoner came in and asked if I had a pair of new shoes Inside that would fit her—I told her to walk in—she asked my father what would be the lowest price he could let her have a pair for—he said, "Half a crown"—as she was going out, I saw her take a pair from outside, and put them under her shawl—I told her to put them down, and she took them from under her shawl—my father gave her in charge.</p>

John East, the pot-boy, brought home a lot of pots; among them was one with the prisoner's name on it—here are five pots in all, with the prisoner's name on them, "William Bennett," but which were my father's, Henry Dodd—the prisoner keeps a beer-shop—my mother now keeps the Horse and Groom, at Ealing—the prisoner lives near us—here is one pot which I can swear to—I have others to match with them—I can dis<lb/>cern where the name of "Oliver" has been erased—my father succeeded Oliver—here are three which I can discern, and there is the broker's mark at the bottom—some of them were found in the prisoner's possession by the officer—when he was in custody, as we took him to Brentford, he said to me, "Dodd, if it goes against me, don't be too harsh, you shall lose nothing by it"—the policeman was present when that was said, but I believe he did not hear it—he bad just got out of the cart.</p>

Hunter—these are the veneers—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they are worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are thirty-six of them—in consequence of the discovery I made, I went with Attfield to the house <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the prisoner Cowland—he and Francis were acquainted—Cowland had purchased some little articles at our shop once—after Cowland was taken I went to the yard, and took Francis—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> Cowland is taken into custody for having sold veneers to Mr. Reader cheaper than we could sell them at, and Cowland says he bought them of you"—Francis denied it, and said he did not—I said, "Well, if you are innocent go forward and prove your innocence," and we took him into custody—I after<lb/>wards went to the station-house—Cross the officer searched Francis, who said, "You may as well let me search myself; I shall very soon put some more policemen to work"—and he pulled out several papers—these were papers which are generally sent out from the saw-mill—they are in Court—and he said, "You understand these papers, Mr. Clampitt, just look at them; these deals have never gone to Messrs. Hunter at all, they have been sold"—he said "deals" or "planks," I will not be positive which—we took the papers—he said, "I "have sold them and spent the money"—he said that a man of the name of Devonshire, Cowland, and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> had drawn him into it when he was drunk, and he had been carrying on the <hi rend="italic">game</hi> for some time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 32, Church-street, Bethnal-green, and am a cabinet-maker. I had no acquaintance with Cowland before—I knew him, as I had been to his yard, to inquire the price of sawing, and seen him at work—on Saturday, the 19th of May, he called on me about eight o'clock in the morning—he said he had a bundle of veneers, and did I want any—I said I was not particularly in want of veneers—I asked what kind of veneers they were—he said, "Firs"—he said, "I have a bundle for sale"—I asked him where they were—he said, "Lying in the bar of the Porto Bello public-house"—that is just at the back of my premises in Tunrille-street—he took me there to look at them—when I went there, they were lying on a seat under the window—I saw them—there were thirty-six—they are the veneers which have been produced—he asked a sovereign for them—they were cheap at that, and I bought them—I hesitated, on the principle that I really was not wanting them, and on the other hand I was not, strictly speaking, prepared to pay for them—I finished, by purchasing them at a so<lb/>vereign—when I was hesitating, the prisoner said, "It is no consequence—I can take them somewhere down the road"—but where he said I know not—I did not ask him where he got them from—he told me he was in the habit of going to a saw-mill to measure timber, frequently in the morning, that he bad been that morning, and had received these veneers for his morning's work—I appointed him to call at my house for the money that day after two o'clock—he called between two and three o'clock—I gave him the sovereign—we went to a public-house, and had some beer over it—he said he would not make a dry bargain—he offered me some other veneers—he said he had some he could sell me for less than I was giving for them—I told him the price I had paid Mr. Hunter for some veneers, which he, on that day, or some day previous, had seen—he told me he could sell them cheaper both that day and at the public-house—they were what we call "rowey wood," which has a strong feature all the way down the pattern—I never had a specimen, I showed him the wood I was working, some was worked and some not worked—in consequence of this conversation, I agreed to meet him on Monday, and go with him to Limehouse, to buy some waste timber—after I had left him, I reflected on this circumstance, and went to Mr. Hunter on Monday—I do not know Matthews—I never saw Devonshire till that Monday, when I went to meet Cowland at the Swan public-house, to go to Limehouse—I found the prisoner Cowland and De<lb/>vonshire there, and Cowland said that his friend in the bar was in distress, and as he had been offering planks to me at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, eighteen in number, he said, "Will you, in order to assist my friend, who must be at Somer<lb/>set house at four o'clock this afternoon, advance me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account?"—in the bundle of veneers, I purchased of Cowland on the 19th of May, I discovered on the 2nd of June part of the name of Hunter in chalk—it was on a waste veneer which had been outside, but it was placed in the centre—I could distinctly discover the letters "unter," but the "H" was partly obliterated—I showed it on the evening of the same day to Mr. Hun<lb/>ter's foreman, and delivered it up with the remaining portion to Attfield.</p>

I knew the deceased William Norris—he was about twenty-five years of age, and appeared a healthy man—between ten and eleven o'clock on Satnrday night, the 9th of January, I was at the Two Blue Posts, Gray's-inn-lane—Norris and Cunningham were waiting there for me—we had one pot of half-and-half, and a quartern of gin-and-peppermint between Cun<lb/>ningham and I, and the deceased, my wife, and sister—the prisoners were in the tap-room—the deceased went into the tap room to light his pipe while we stood at the bar—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> occurred between the deceased and the prisoner—I did not see it begin—I saw Norris standing with his back leaning against the wall when I opened the tap-room door, with his nose bleeding—there were seven or eight of them stood before him—I ran in and jumped on the seat, ran over the table and got by the side of him—he said, was there nobody there to take his part—I said I would take his part as far as I could—some fell about me and some fell on him, and we were Pushed out of the tap-room door—I do not know that Linford shoved me out but they were all shoving—I do not know Soulter—I did not see any thing</p>

               <p>more occur to the deceased after that—Linford struck Norn's, and I struck Linford—I did not see Linford strike Norris—he struck him before I came in—nobody saw him struck—Cunningham carried Norris out of the room.</p>

About half-past two o'clock in the morning of the 10th, I was called in to the deceased—I examined his body, but found no visible external marks to prove he died from any injury—I had an order from the Coroner to make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion, and, on the 12th, I removed the skull-cap—I found no fissure—I found two fractures at the back part of the brain, and an extended state of the vessels, but the ruptures of the brain might arise from excessive drink—no doubt, the man died from the injury, from the internal hemorrhage which arose from concussion, from fall, probably—I cannot tell whether he was struck, I was not present to see.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You searched him accurately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Hare-street is a little better than a quarter of a mile from Goodman's house—I do not imagine that it is half a mile—I found no watch nor chain—I found a brooch belonging to himself—I found no breast-pin, nor any thing that the prosecutor claimed.</p>

               <p>kitchen dresser, also my child's beads, which hung upon a nail overnight, and wme shells from the shelf—Maslin searched the prisoner in my pre<lb/>sence, and found a kind of glazier's knife ground down like a chisel—I saw Maslin compare that chisel with the kitchen window, and it corresponded with the impression where the glass had been removed to a hair's breadth—I afterwards saw a boot which was taken from the prisoner's foot com—pared with impressions under the kitchen window, and they tallied exactly, particularly where a seam had been across the sole—I had dug the ground under the window the evening before, and it was soft, which made the im<lb/>pression full.</p>

I had known the prisoner about twelve months by seeing him about, but had not been familiar with him—I am unfortunate—on the 11th of June I met him at the Golden Anchor—he went home with me at his request in the first place, and I consented—my house is at the back of the Golden Anchor—we went to bed at twelve o'clock—it was up one flight of stairs—the prisoner fastened the door inside—it was locked and bolted—I am sure of it—he had not given me any money in my house, but he had before given me two six pences, and that was spent before I went to bed—I had a five shilling piece, six shillings, and two sixpences of my own—he was to stay with me all night—my money was put into my box in my room—that was safe before I went to bed—the prisoner saw me count it—I had some halfpence, and I put them into my box—I cannot say that he knew how much I had—awoke between four and five o'clock, and the prisoner was gone I found the door bolted and locked as it was when I went to sleep—nobody could have been in the room but himself—my chamber window was open, which</p>
