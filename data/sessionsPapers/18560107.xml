                  </hi>. I am buyer and manager of the Birmingham and Sheffield department at the prosecutors—I never sold these forks to the prisoner—they are plated, they are worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eight years—the prisoner was there before me—Mr. Hyams is here—when I first went into the employment, it was the constant practice of the servants of each department to sell to each other—they were all allowed to buy from the establishment—I believe that has been going on down to the time of the prisoner's apprehension, although lately not allowed by our employers—I have occasionally purchased things—I have things at my house now that I have purchased—I have not been in the habit of purchasing goods to sell again, I may have done so once or twice, but I have not been in the habit of doing it—I do not know others that are in the habit of doing so, many of them may have done so—as far as my knowledge goes they have not been in the habit of doing so, they have occasionally done so as well as myself, but it has not been a recognised thing among us—I have bought things to sell again; it was kept quiet, it was understood it was not allowed, it was done to accommodate one another—I heard something of some night lights being consigned to Messrs. Davis, which were not sold—I did not take a sample of those night lights, I am quite sure of that, I am not aware that any persons in the employment took samples of them at the request of Messrs. Davis for the purpose of seeing whether they could get rid of them—I am not aware that Mr. Davis asked the prisoner to try and sell them, it is possible he might have done so—I am quite sure that no one, to my knowledge, took a sample away—I never sold the prisoner these forks, nor any plated forks—I may have sold him a set of knives and forks, I think I have on one or two occasions—he has not bought forks of me of this descrip<lb/>tion for the purpose of selling again, he has ordinary knives and forks—I have no book here—these forks were in my department—I was not present when the prisoner said he had bought them from me, I first heard of it on the Saturday morning following—my employers have not blamed me at all since this has been found out for disobeying the orders of the house—I have sold forks, not in the establishment that I know of, I do not remember—I cannot swear that I have not—when I did sell it was usual to make out a bill, and call the cashier to take the money of the purchaser—that was the case throughout the establishment, either when we sold to each other or to any other customer—I have not been a witness here before—my employers have prosecuted several of their servants, and unsuccessfully, except in one instance—ours is a very miscellaneous business, we sell a great variety of articles—we do not keep spirits to give customers to tempt them to buy, we occasionally have a glass of wine, or ale, but not spirits—we take a glass of wine with them occasionally, we are not compelled to do so—we do not</p>

               <p>invite every customer, only our bettermost ones that come from a distance—I am not aware that the prisoner need to bay to sell again—we were intimate in business—I have visited him at his house once or twice, and he has visited me on one occasion—when we made out the bills for one another we did not always put the name—we do not always put a name, we have so many customers that we do not know the names of—we do not generally put names for small customers, either for customers, or fellow servants, not unless there is an entry made—I am not aware that the prisoner or any of the servants have had things on approbation for sale, I should say not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it is understood in the establishment, is it, that servants should not purchase? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but they have done so occa<lb/>sionally—as far as I know, when they have purchased they have paid—they always had an invoice if the amount exceeded 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was not the custom for them to take the invoice to the cashier and pay for the goods, the cashier would be called to take the money—that would be the case whether it was a servant or an ordinary customer—there is no other person named Millington in the house but myself—I did not sell these forks to the pri<lb/>soner, nor to anybody that I am aware of—I think I had not sold any forks that day at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to the prosecutors, in the musical and lamp department.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

Two or three days before the prisoner was apprehended, I saw a box of night lights in a cup<lb/>board of the prisoner's—immediately he was taken into custody I went to the cupboard, and it was gone—a day or two afterwards I looked into the prisoner's drawer, and saw some slate pencils tied up in paper; I tore the inside wrapper, and looked at them—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know the wrapper by the tear—I opened them at the time—that was before he was taken—I (poked into the drawer again next morning, before he went to his dinner, and they were there then—I looked again directly after he had had his dinner, and they were gone—that was before he was taken—I communicated to my employers what I had seen.</p>

I was recommended to him by Dr. Thompson, and my son could prove it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a japanner, of Rutland-street, New-road. Between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, on 26th Dec., I was in Leman-street, Whitechapel—I was suddenly seized from behind by two or more persons—I was severely beaten, and my watch and guard were stolen—I was thrown down, and became insensible—when I came to myself, the first thing I saw was a policeman, who had the two prisoners—my watch and chain were missing—I had the watch only the moment before the attack was made on me—it was in my pocket, and fastened by a chain round my neck—this is my watch—the chain has not been found—a button was missing from my shirt collar—I did not see the face of either of the persons—one of them had a jacket on resembling the jacket that Williams has on now.</p>

I think you have done a very pretty thing, to put your money and things on the stairs"—at the same moment I pushed the door open, and looked in—I saw the baby lying on the bed—I saw blood on the bed—the prisoner was concealed behind the door—I do not remember seeing her at that time—when I saw the blood on the bed, I directly dropped the cash box, went to the street door, and called across to a milkman, who was the first person I saw—he would not come—I then saw a policeman, and beckoned to him—he came—I told him what had happened, and showed him the room—he went in first—I followed him in, and saw that the two children, George and Edwin, were both dead—the third child had been taken into the country about a month previously—the prisoner was taken into custody by the policeman, and taken to the station—when I returned from the station, I saw a razor lying on the bed, and a case belonging to it—it was my razor—I kept it in a box, locked, in our kitchen—after the razor was found, I went down stairs, and found my box unlocked—I after<lb/>wards saw a key brought out of the prisoner's room—I cannot say whether it was taken off the drawer or out of the drawer—it fitted my box—some short time before this, I found that a razor which I kept in a case in the kitchen drawer, along with a comb, and brush, and other things, had been meddled with—it had been turned round in the case, and put in the wrong way, twice within a fortnight—I was determined to find out who had done it, and I spoke to the children and the servant about it—I then named it to the prisoner—she said she had not done it.</p>

I was on a barge by the side of the pier—it is one of the dummies which the people go on to get on to the pier—it is in the middle of the pier: I mean across the end of it—you go down steps from the end of the pier on to the dummy—I suppose it may be nearly 100 yards from the shore, or not so much—while I was on the dummy, I heard the cry of a child, apparently in the water—I ran off from the pier, took the life buoy and a little boat hook, and got over the rails into a boat, and proceeded to where the sound came from, and just below the Cricketer's Causeway I picked up a child—that is up the river—I suppose it was about 200 or 300 yards from the barge on which I had been standing—I picked up the child from the water—it was the young one, eleven months old—I suppose it might have been about sixteen or eighteen yards from the shore—I took it to the Magpie and Stump, and delivered it to Thomas Holmes, to take into the house—I did not see more than one child in the water.</p>

I am a waterman's apprentice, and live at Chelsea—I was walking along Cheyne-walk, coming from Battersea-bridge, on this evening, about a quarter to 6 o'clock, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I was then about forty yards from the pier, on the side nearer to Battersea bridge—I immediately ran down some steps there, and got into the water as far as I could safely go—I had to catch hold of the banisters to save myself, it being so foggy I could hardly see—I went down the steps nearest but one to the pier—they are steps where boats come to—I felt a boat that was made fast to the railing of the stairs, loosed it, and got in—it was about a quarter of an hour before high water, the boat lay right athwart the river—she was lying still, it is all an eddy there—there were other boats there, but out of my reach—none of them were touching the steps, I should say they</p>

               <p>were about three yards from the steps—when I got down the steps I heard the splashing of people in the water, and crying, and struggling—I could not see anything, it was so foggy and dark, it was impossible to do so—the crying was that of a child—I made towards the sound, and picked up the boy of three years old—he was just going down underneath my boat's bow—I got him out—I heard the noise of others going out, but did not succeed in getting out any others—I only heard one other voice at that minute, but it appeared that I heard three voices in the water before I went out—I had no sculls in my boat, but I paddled on shore with the stretchers—after giving up the child I went back again, and found the cap of the boy that was drowned—I came up to the younger child, but another man had saved it—the one I saved was, I dare say, about sixteen yards from the shore, as near as I could judge—it was floating up towards Battersea<lb/>bridge, what tide there was, there was not much tide, it was nearly high water.</p>

I was directly opposite the Cadogan-pier with my cab, about half past 5 o'clock—while I was there I heard a scream from the water—there were two screams—I should say they were the screams of two children—they seemed to be different voices, one was a much louder voice than the other—a man came by at the time, and I went with him over to the water and listened—after looking for a minute, or a minute and a half, I saw something dark floating on the water, and still heard the scream—I should say it was about five or six yards from the pier, up the river—I called out very lustily for help, for watermen, and police—I ran to some steps that lead down to the shore from Cheyne-walk, and got wet in running down—they were the steps nearest to the Cadogan-pier—there was a gate at the top of the steps, but it was fastened—I had to get over the rails near the gate—I got on to a dummy which was there—I saw a little child floating past the dummy, within about half a yard of my arm's length—I was unable to reach it, and it floated past me—I could not see more than one child in the water, but I heard the screams of the second further out in the water—when I first saw the child in the water I was looking over the wall near the Cadogan-pier, I was standing, perhaps, about eight yards away from the level of the pier, by the side of the wall which bevels out, and the child was coming, it might have been about six or eight yards from the pier—it was floating from the pier at the time.</p>

Sarah, where is Willie, where is Willie?"—she made no answer—he said, "And where is the baby, Sarah?"—she said, "Have you got the baby?"—he said, "I have, Sarah"—she said, "Where is my baby?"—the baby was not then in the house, it was with a nurse—she said, "I will have my baby; where is my baby?" why can't I have my baby?"—that was her continual cry—Mr. Allen kept continually asking her the whole of the morning concerning Willie, but she made no answer, she only wanted her baby—I remained there the rest of the morning.</p>

               <p>diseases, and have paid great attention to those matters—I have seen the prisoner, and had conversations with her—my first visit occupied perhaps half an hour—I was then quite satisfied that she laboured under a delusion which is not of unfrequent occurrence in persons of high nervous sensi<lb/>bility—she stated to me that her children had suffered from a scrofulous disease, that their foreheads projected, and their eyes were starting from their heads, all that I could say was futile, and of no avail, she still persisted in her delusion—I saw her about a week afterwards, and the opinion that I had formed of her case was more than corroborated—I extended the period of my visit—I was most anxious to form a correct view of her case—she still persisted in the delusion—I called her attention to a work which she had been reading, and which has been produced to-day, and I believe the reading of that book very much strengthened the morbid view she entertained—she still labours under it—these are cases of a very protracted nature—sometimes the delusion does vanish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, residing at Hackney; I am surgeon to the South Hackney district. On Sunday morning, 23rd Dec., the male prisoner came to me, at 7 o'clock, and told me that one of his children was dead, and the other dying, and asked me to go to his house—I went with him—as we went along, he said that if his children died he should say they had been starved to death—he told me that he had had an order to go into the workhouse—I told him, if he was in such distress, he was very silly not to do so—I do not recollect that he made any reply—I went into the back room on the ground floor at No. 13, Brunswick-street, and there found the female prisoner and four children—the eldest girl was nursing the infant in one part of the room, and the two children who have since died were lying in another corner of the room, on a mattrass—the girl was dead, and the boy was in a dying state, nearly dead—he died in a few minutes, while I was in the house—they presented the appearance of extreme emaciation—there were two old chairs and a table in the room, and this bed on the floor in the corner—that appeared to be all the furniture—on the chimney piece I saw a little paper with some oatmeal, and another paper with rice in it—the female prisoner told me that there was 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of oatmeal in one paper, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rice in the other—I made a <hi rend="italic">port mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion on the Tuesday morning, by direction of the parish authorities—I first examined the girl—I found all the organs of the body quite healthy, except that they were entirely devoid of fat—there was no fat about the body at all—I found no food of any kind in the stomach, only a little liquid feculent matter in the lower part of the intestines, and one or two little pieces of stick, which the male prisoner said might have been taken in the oatmeal—I made the examination at the house—the prisoners were not present during the whole of it—I called them in to account for the pieces of stick—there was also a fish bone in the intestines of the girl, which the female prisoner accounted for by saying that they had had a herring the day before—she also said they had eaten a hearty supper the night before—I should not have thought it at all likely that the stomach would present the appearances it did if they had had a hearty supper the night before—in my opinion, the children died from the long continued deprivation of proper and sufficient food—I took away the stomach and intestines of the boy, and next day those of the girl, sealed them up, and took them to Dr. Letheby.</p>

I received from Mr. Vinall the stomach and intestines of the female child on 29th Dec.—I examined them—I found the stomach slightly red<lb/>dened on the interior coat; and the intestines and stomach were perfectly empty, excepting a little feculent mucus—that was in the intestines both of the boy and girl, but more particularly in the boy's—I also found in the stomach of each some pieces of fish bone, which I produce—I did not find any small pieces of wood—I carefully examined the remains of nutriment, to ascertain whether there was the remains of a meal—I searched particu<lb/>larly</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Looking at the state of the stomach and intestines, and assuming that the body presented an appearance of great emaciation, what inference would you draw from that state of things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That starvation had been the cause of death—there was not a trace of fat in the intestinal canal, which is very unusual—if a person is deprived of food, the system lives as it were upon itself, until all the fat is consumed—I should imagine that the exhaustion of the system had been a lingering one, from the whole of the fat being absorbed—I think it could not have been any sudden matter; it must have been progressing for some time—there was some redness on the inner lining—I found nothing deleterious—the redness was probably owing to the mechanical irritancy of the fish bone, and the pieces of wood on the coat of the stomach—that appearance has been observed before in cases of starva<lb/>tion—I attribute the death to a lingering deprivation of food, going on for some time.</p>

I keep a school in Orchard-street, Hackney—I saw the two children, Harriett and William, after their death—they were in a remarkably emaciated state—they came to school on 24th Sept, and con<lb/>tinued for about three weeks in Oct.—the child was in a very depressed and quiet state, and saddened, I may say, and remarkably thin—we could not tell whether it was in a starving state, or in a state of rapid consump<lb/>tion—we have given them food, and have seen them eating food which they have taken from the other children—their appetite appeared to be very ravenous, and they appeared to wish to conceal their eating food from the other children—I complained to the children themselves about their eating other children's food; I did not complain to the prisoners, I never saw the prisoners until I saw the children dead—it was a day or two, or, perhaps, a week after I complained to the children, that they discontinued coming—when I went and saw them dead, I said to the female prisoner, "Are these children yours?"—she looked across to the male prisoner without answering—I then asked him, "Are these children yours?"—he said, "Yes"—I then turned to the woman, and said, "Are you this man's wife?"—she said, "I am sorry to say I am not"—I then said to the man, "These children being yours, by whom are they I"—he said, "By my wife"—I said, "Where is your wife?"—he said, "She is dead; she has been dead two years, or two years and a half"—I said, "The youngest child cannot be hers," it did not appear to be above eighteen mouths old as I saw it then in the woman's arms, but he said it was two years and a half old—it had a very diminutive appearance, beyond description—I saw that it was a very distressing case in appearance, and I gave them half a crown, and a friend of mine, who had been there just before, gave them some bread tickets—that was the cause of my going there—there was every appearance of very great destitution in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the assistant relieving officer of Hackney Union. I know the prisoners—on 16th Nov. the man applied to me at the work-house for relief, on account of want of work—I gave him an order to come into the house with his family, and likewise two quartern loaves of bread to take with him, to eat before they came—they did not come into the house at all—on Tuesday, 18th Dec., the woman came for relief, her husband being out of work—I told her if that was the case, her husband could come him<lb/>self—I gave her on that occasion a quartern loaf, and a quart of oatmeal to take home with her, and told her to send her husband—she came again on the Wednesday, before the Board, and said the same thing—the Board told her that she must send her husband—she had no food given her on that occasion—next day, the 20th, the male prisoner came—he said he had no work, and wanted relief—I told him I could give him work, which I did—I gave him an order to go to work in the stone yard, and a quartern loaf, and a quart of oatmeal to begin with—he could earn from 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day in the stone yard, according to what he did—he did not come to work—he is a bricklayer—it is work that any strong able bodied person can do; lads and young men do it—neither of them made any complaint to me of the children being ill.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Ray.</hi> In the morning the male prisoner applied for relief, and had a note given him to go in the evening; I applied, and was denied relief; the witness said he would not give me a bit of anything; I remained there a long time, and said I was not pleading for myself, but for my starving chil<lb/>dren, and I would not go home without; and at last I had two quartern loaves given to me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> At the time I gave her the loaves she did not say that she required them for her starving children—she did not men<lb/>tion the children at all, she said it was her husband's being out of work—I never gave her two loaves at once, I gave her one loaf and a quart of oatmeal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. George's Hospital. On the morning of 2nd Dec. I was called up to see Daley—he was perfectly sensible—I found he had a scalp wound over the left eyebrow—on putting my finger in I found he had a compound fracture of the skull—the skin was cut through, and the muscle and the bone had been broken also—it was a dangerous fracture, at least we thought so at the time—I saw his hand was bruised—I found nothing else at that time—the nurse afterwards said to me that there were two or three little scratches on the head, but they were of no consequence—I could not tell whether they were scratches, or done with a chopper—they were small wounds at the back of the head—he remained in the hospital till the 26th Dec.</p>

Q.</hi> You see this fire iron, would a blow from this pro<lb/>duce the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, some parts might—some of the injury might be caused by a very hard fall against a piece of flint—if two persons were struggling against a wall, and they fell, it would depend on what the wall was composed of whether it would have caused the injury—a smooth wall would not, but a sharp wall composed of flints might—it must have been done by something sharp—it was rather like a wound by a cutting instru<lb/>ment—the skin was broken, and the different tissues were cut—it was not</p>

On Sunday morning, 2nd Dec., I heard the cry of "Murder!" worn that court—I went up and saw Daley lying on the pavement in a pool of blood, with a severe wound on his fore<lb/>head, and two others at the back of his head—I inquired who did it, and they told me, and in consequence I knocked at the door of No. 3—the pri<lb/>soner refused to admit me—I told him I was a policeman—I burst the door in—another policeman, Woodbridge, was with me—when we got in, the prisoner stood in the middle of the room, with this fire iron in his hand; he was making use of very violent language, and threatening to knock the first person down that should attempt to take him—the other constable and I rushed in upon him, and took the iron out of his hand—he continued to resist, and became very violent—I was obliged to get the assistance of four or five other constables to take him to the station—I found this chopper in the room of Warwick, another lodger in the same house—I did not observe any marks or wounds about the prisoner, he made no complaint—there was some blood on him—I found this other part of the fire rest when I came back to where Daley had been.</p>

I live at Stratford, and am in the service of Howard and Kent as one of the grinders—in my judgment, this is the property of my masters—I have seen the prisoner once on our premises, where we grind the bark—I should think it is between three and five months ago; he was talking to Clements who was then in our service—I saw Clements take some bark once, between three and five months ago—I took one parcel of 3 1/2 lbs. away from him—I saw him take it more than onoe—I was down below, under the stores, and I heard some one up stairs—I went up, and saw him putting a parcel into his trowsers pocket—I asked him what he was after—he said he was mending his pockets—after he was gone, I went to the place, and I could see where he had taken it from—on another occasion I saw him take a parcel, and I took it away from him—I gave information to Mr. Howard, and he was discharged in Nov.—I have seen him once since he left.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 5, Lauderdale buildings. The prisoner came to lodge with me about let Sept—at that time he had no moustache—I know Clements from his coming to Beckley—he came mostly on Saturday night, he used to bring a basket with him—it was always filled, I could not tell with what, only on one occasion—it appeared full, and he said he was tired—one Saturday night he came, and Beckley was not at home—I was going out as he came in—he inquired for Beckley—I said he was not at home, and he said, "I shall be over at the White Bear"—I went back to tell my children—I then went with him to the public house—he there put his basket down on the settle, and I saw a largish sized square brown paper parcel—a sort of heavy purple colour seemed to be on the parcel—there seemed a powder on the top of the parcel—I have seen Beckley and Clements together very frequently—I saw Clements on the Sunday after the Wednesday on which Beckley was taken—I met him in the street, he had his whiskers shaved off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, and reside in Greet Marylebone-street, Portland-street. On Sunday, 1st July last, a relation of my wife's came to tea with us, and in the afternoon I accompanied her to Park-street—she lived at No. 115 at that time—I left my house at a quarter to 6 o'clock—how I know the time is, because, she wanted to be at home by 6 o'clock—it was perhaps a trifle past 6 o'clock when we got to Park-street—I might have remained at the house a few minutes—after leaving there I went up Park-street again, in the direction of Oxford-street—Park-street runs from Oxford-street, parallel to the Park, Perk-lane, and crosses Grosvenor-street at right angles—there was a crowd of perhaps about 300 persons at the crossing of Park-street and Grosvenor-street—I know Lord Robert Grosvenor's house—I believe it to be the house at the corner of Grosvenor-street, looking into Park-street—I did not know it at that that—I have heard so since—the crowd I speak of was at the corner near that house—I walked through the crowd, and all at once I heard an outcry, and there was a kind of rush—I stood on one side to let the crowd go past—they did pass me, and I saw, I should think, from fifty to sixty policemen pass me, after the people—I was then standing at the edge of the kerb, in Park-street, on the left hand side of Park-street, near Lord Robert Gros<lb/>venor's house, on the same side, the Park-lane side, the west side—I had not then passed Grosvenor-street—after the persons had passed me I was in the act of going on towards Oxford-street, when I received a tremendous blow in the back—I turned round as Well as I could, and had just time to say, "I am only a casual passer," and was struck in the mouth by a police<lb/>man's fist—I cannot tell what it was that struck me on the back—I should not think it Was a fist—I do not know who the policeman was that struck me in the mouth—there were several other policemen about me at the time; to the best of my belief five—I received ft succession of blows, both with the fist and the truncheon, until I was struck down in the street—I received several blows from C 84 (<hi rend="italic">the defendant</hi>)—he struck me several blows in the face with his clenched fist—the other persons who struck me were all policemen—I was struck with the truncheons repeatedly, between the shoulders—I had three blows on the head, several between the shoul<lb/>ders, and the lower part of the back, and also a hurt in the lower part of the stomach—I do not know whether that was from a blow with a truncheon, or whether it was a kick when I was on the ground—I believe I received a kick—I was on the ground when I received the injury—I could not pretend to say how long I was on the ground—I was on the ground very shortly after the assault first took place—perhaps it was not above a minute after, or not a minute—I could scarcely judge of the time—I believe I was struck down on the ground by a blow on the heed—I was beaten severely while I was on the ground, with truncheons I believe,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070052"/>
               <p>until persons from the balcony and doorways cried out, "Shame! Shame!"—at the time this was going on I recognised C 84—I did not take his number myself—I recognised the man—I am rather near-sighted—(<hi rend="italic">the witness left the witness box, and went close to the defendant</hi>)—I have no hesi<lb/>tation in my mind in saying that is the man—I could not say how many of the blows I received were given by him, but I have no hesitation in saying that be gave me the black eye—when the people called out "Shame!" I was partly raised from the ground by the police, and partly by my own exertions; and I was again beaten, and dragged back from a doorway, where I endeavoured to go up, and called on some persons who were standing there for protection—I was dragged back on to the pavement from the door, and into the road, I could not say by whom—I then received more blows, until I became stupified—I have an indistinct remembrance then of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> passing, it being called by some one, and my being put into it, and their accompanying me—the back was torn out of my coat as I was being lifted from the ground, and also torn again as I was being dragged out of the doorway—I have the coat here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—it is in exactly the same state as it was that afternoon—no attempt was made to take me into custody—no one made any charge against me—when I became a little more collected, I found I was in Oxford-street, and I ordered the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to drive to Marylebone police station, to lay a complaint—I think it was a young woman who first stopped the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had no friends with me—some strangers got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> with me, and went with me afterwards to the Marylebone station—there were no policemen with me—no charge was made against me at the station—I charged two policeman—I had a yellow walking stick with me on this evening—I did nothing with that stick—I never raised it, nor had the opportunity of raising it—I was attended by Mr. Curtain, a surgeon, in consequence of this, for about ten weeks—my teeth were loosened, I believe by the first blow that was given with the policeman's closed fist—the blow in the back I feel at times severely now—my mouth was a good deal cut—I had three blows on the head, but nothing of any particular consequence—the hurt in the lower part of my body I felt for some considerable time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say a word about C 84 before the Commissioners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—Mr. Ellis put a question to me respecting it, and he told me it would save some trouble to state that C 80 was not there—I charged both C 80, and C 84 on the same night the assault took place, and also before the Commissioners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever say anything about another policeman doing this violence to you until Mr. Ellis told you that C 80 was altogether in a different part of London at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly, I charged from the first C 80, and C 84, and in my letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—I am not to be bamboozled out of the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 19, Lower-street, Grosvenor-square. On 1st July I was in Hyde-park, and from ten minutes to half past 6 o'clock I proceeded up Park-street to Grosvenor-equare—I know Lord Grosvenor's house—I saw Mr. Stephens there, on the opposite side, the North Audley-street side of Park-street, as I was coming down the opposite side—he was in the act of stepping on one side to let several policemen pass him that were going after some people, he stepped on one side to the centre of the path to let the police come off the kerb—I saw a police constable run up to him, holding his staff in this manner (<hi rend="italic">one end in each hand</hi>) and struck him with the centre of it, across the lower part of the neck, or the top of the shoulder, holding it cross ways; that sent him running a short distance, head down, he turned to see where it came from, and as he turned the policeman struck him two or three blows in the face with his clenched fist—at that particular time there was only the one policeman, but when he got into the centre of the road, from the man striking him, several others came up; but one in particular I noticed who struck him a blow in the face with his fist—I did not take the other policemen's numbers, but he was knocked down by other policemen, and while he was down he was struck across the back, and across the loins, and kicked in the side—the blows when he was down were struck with the truncheon—while he was down in that manner, one policeman laid hold of, him as if he was in the act of</p>

               <p>pulling him up, and pulled the back of his coat right out—with that he was assisted on his feet, and passed lower down the street—I saw no further what passed, because a gentleman on a balcony called on me to take the numbers, and I took the numbers of two, one I took correctly, but I was mistaken in the number of the one I took second—I took C 84 distinctly—while he was leaning over the man striking those blows, I stood over him and saw him all the time—the defendant is the man—I also took the number of another policeman, the number I am confident of, but I was mistaken in the number of the one I took second—I took C 84 distinctly—while he was in the act of striking Mr. Stephens, and I was calling, "Shame!" to him at the time—I noticed who kicked him, it was this man, C 84—he kicked him on the right side, down towards the hip, when he was on the ground—I saw nothing whatever in Mr. Stephens' hand—I called on Mr. Stephens next day—when I got down to Marylebone-lane from where I live, I saw Mr. Stephens coming out, and I went in and gave evidence of what I saw; he had been to make a complaint—he was an entire stranger to me, I had never seen him before the Sunday to my know<lb/>ledge—this was about a quarter of an hour after I left—I spoke to him at the station house, and gave in the numbers and what I saw—I next saw the defendant at the Court of Exchequer, before the Commissioners, he was then produced, and likewise C 80, who I at once said was not the man—I recognised C 84 directly—I saw Mr. Stephens next day, he called on me, and I went to Marlboro'-street with him—I saw the state he was in—I saw him get up, and his mouth was bleeding, and his eye was bruised; but next day his eye was black, and round his loins.</p>

               <p>I am sure he had it, but he struck with his fist—I cannot say which fist, it is not likely in an affair like that—I was looking at the ill usage that the man was having, the man was running to the middle of the road.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, 1st July, I was coming down Park-street, towards Oxford-street, going towards Piccadilly—I do not know Lord Robert Grosvenor's house, but I believe it is on the left hand side, coming from Oxford-street towards Piccadilly—as I was going down Park-street I saw a crowd near Grosvenor-street, they were standing still—when the police came by I saw them move off all ways, towards Oxford-street, Piccadilly, and towards the Park—I believe they pretty nearly all dispersed—the police came from Piccadilly towards Oxford-street, up the street—after the crowd dispersed, I saw Mr. Stephens on the left hand side of Park-street, coming down from Oxford-street, the side furthest from the Park—when I first saw him he was at the corner of a street—I cannot be certain of the name of it, but I think it was North Audley-street—he was on the opposite side of the street to me, nearest to the Park—he was walking along towards Oxford-street when he was accosted by three or four policemen, who came from the other end of the street—they attempted to drive him away by hitting him on the back with their staves, and pulling him about—he got away from those policemen and advanced a little farther towards Oxford street—policeman C 84 came from the other end of Park-street, Piccadilly, and took hold of Mr. Stephens when he was behind him, turned him round face to face, and then struck him three or four blows in the face with his fist—he was holding him with one hand by his collar, while he was striking him with the other—Mr. Stephens then was, I believe, knocked down by him with his staff, but that I cannot say as I had to more off, and did not see him on the ground—I was about five yards from them at the time Mr. Stephens was struck, but I cannot be certain—I next saw Mr. Stephens in the gateway of a private house in Park-street, on the left hand side of the way, and while he was at the gateway, policeman C 84 struck him with his staff on we back—I did not see Mr. Stephens go to that gateway, he was there when I returned—I came back down the street, and the policeman was then at the gateway<lb/>after he had struck Mr. Stephens at the gateway, I believe he tore his coat—I saw the coat torn afterwards, and I believe it was done by that blow—I had again to go away, and after I returned I saw Mr. Stephens getting into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the policemen had not all gone away then—I believe some of them were still there—I went with Mr. Stephens to the station in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I gave information that night against some policeman—I saw policeman C 84 before the Commissioners in the Court of Exchequer—I do not recol<lb/>lect</p>

I have attended Mr. Stephens professionally some years—I saw him on the evening of 1st July, and found him suffering from blows on his head, face, and back—I attended him nine or ten weeks for those injuries, and then ordered him into the country, and there he was six weeks—he had a blow on the right side parallel with the navel; that and the injury to the back, which appeared to be three or four blows, were the most severe injuries he had—they might be occasioned by blows or kicks—I know nothing of the transaction more than I have described to you—I had only just arrived in town, and did not know that there had been any disturbance.</p>

On Sunday, 1st July, I was attached to superintendent O'Brien's detachment of police, which was kept in reserve at Stanhope-gate—the defendant was also attached to that reserve—he has been in the force about two years and a half—I have also been in the force about that time—about 6 o'clock the reserve was sent for to go from Stan<lb/>hope-gate to Grosvenor-street—there were fifty constables in the reserve—when we got there, there was a very large mob there, I should say between 2,000 and 3,000, at Lord Robert Grosvenor's house—we came from Stan<lb/>hope-gate along the Park, to the small gate opposite South-street, through the gate at South-street, and across Park-lane, down South-street, and turned to the left up Park-street, up the centre of the street—Lord Robert Grosve<lb/>nor's house is not at the corner of Park-street and Grosvenor-street, it is near the corner; there is one house at the corner, and Lord Robert Grosve<lb/>nor's house is next; it is in Park-street, on the left hand side coming from Piccadilly—the people were making a very great noise, shouting and hooting—and when we came up they were throwing stones at the police—I was in the extreme rear of the police; Madgett was on my left, next to me—we have no particular places to fall in when we march in that way, he was marching on my left hand side—Hawkes and Holliday were there also—Murrell</p>

               <p>him, I know—I could not say how many of the number hit him—I do not suppose he was struck more than three or four times altogether—he tried to get up, and his coat was torn in three or four places on the hack—I believe that was with the people trying to get him up, or his trying to get up, and the policemen hitting him—I then caught hold of him, and assisted him into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he was not dragged from the place before that—he had tried to get up some steps, the police did not follow him—that was when they first knocked him down—he tried to get up some steps, to a crowd there, and before he could hardly get up, the policemen came and knocked him down again, and it was then I helped him to get into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not see where the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came from—it was in the middle of the street, so as to be seen by anybody—it was near where he was knocked down—I should say we had walked twenty yards—I told him I would walk along the street with him if he would take a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—while this was going on, there were several gentlemen calling out "Shame!"—that was loud enough for the police to hear, and for any one to hear that was there—I took the number of the policeman as "80"—I did not trouble about taking his division, I did not think it would be required, but I noticed the man more than I did the number—the prisoner is not that man, he is nothing like him—I would not swear to any one of the six or seven men that were about him and beating him, because there was such confusion it would be impossible to do so.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector C.</hi> On Sunday, 1st July, I was on duty in Park-street—I had some sergeants and men there under my command—in consequence of the increase of the number of persons round Lord Robert Grosvenor's house, I sent for the detachment reserved at Stanhope Gate—at the time the reserve came up there was a great crowd—they were violent, hissing, and throwing stones—I did not myself see any stones thrown—at the time the reserve came up I was standing at the corner of Grosvenor-street and Park-street—that is the side on which Lord Robert Grosvenor's house is situate—there was a great crowd following the reserve as they came from Stanhope Gate—when they came to Reeves's-mews they halted—a portion of the reserve went back after the crowd that was following them, and the others came on towards me, dispersing the mob as they passed—there was room for the crowd to pass on the pavement—the police took the centre of the street—some of the crowd passed up Grosvenor-street and Park-street, and got away as well as they could—a portion of the reserve</p>

               <p>went up Park-street, beyond Grosvenor-street—when I say a portion, per<lb/>haps some half dozen men, finding there was a halt at the corner of Park-street, that is the opposite corner of Park-street and Grosvenor-street, the Oxford-street corner, went over to disperse that crowd, and went a little way up Park-street—there is a house on the right, further up Park-street, with a balcony—some of the men went up as far as that, but not the main body—to the beet of my recollection, the rear, that is those that went back to the crowd that was following them from Stanhope Grate, did not return further than Reeves's-mews—I saw Madgett—I saw him at the corner of Grosvenor-street and Park-street—that is near the corner where Lord Robert Grosvenor's house is situate, about opposite there—I saw him strike no one—he bears a good character in the force, as a man of mild, good tem<lb/>per—I have had an opportunity of seeing him—he lives in the station house, with fifty others, and I have had an opportunity of watching his conduct—I believe him to be a man of good temper, and a mild, inoffensive person, more so than many that live in the same house—I did not see him strike any one—I did not see him further than Lord Robert Grosvenor's house—there was a great deal of excitement—my opinion was then, and is now, that had not the reserve come up at the time, and taken the step they did, the windows of Lord Robert Grosvenor's house would have shared the same fate as others did—there were a great many thieves and vagabonds about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that when that was called out, no blows were being struck by the police? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must consider I was at the corner of Grosvenor-street—that is nearly opposite Lord Robert Grosve<lb/>nor's house, and where this occurred was some seventy yards from me, I should think; I mean where the people were crying out "Shame!"—it was from a balcony at the opposite corner of the street—it was a corner that would command a view of the mob in front of Lord Robert Grosvenor's house, and near enough for me to hear the cries of "Shame!"—still there were people between me and the police—I did not see what caused those cries; I could not see—there were a great number of persons between me and them—I did not see any truncheons lifted up—I saw truncheons drawn</p>

                  </hi>. In July last I was a waiter at a public house near Temple-bar. On the afternoon of 1st July I was in Hyde-park—I some<lb/>times go there on a Sunday, I am not in the habit of doing so, I go occa<lb/>sionally—about 4 o'clock I was near the Serpentine, on the other side of the drive, the further side from the Serpentine—there was a very great crowd—I saw an old man struck by some policemen, upon which I cried out "Shame!" and the great majority of the persons in the crowd did the same—at the same time something went by close to where I was standing, I do not know what it was, I did not throw anything, I did not see that it struck any one—I turned my head round to see from whence it came and I was immediately seized by the collar by A 398, the prisoner—I did not have time to recognise his number then, but he is the man—he did not say what he seized me for—I was about to remonstrate with him for taking hold of me, but I was immediately struck down by a blow on the left side of the head with the priaoner's staff—it was a blow sufficient to render me partially insensible—when I recovered my recollection, I found myself being placed in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was very much covered with blood, my waistcoat, shirt, trowsers, handkerchief, hat, and everything—the blood came from my head and streamed down the side of my face—I had done nothing to the police<lb/>man before he struck me, after he took hold of my collar—I had not struck him or raised my hand against him—I did not see him till he seized me by the collar—he was by himself, and the crowd began to close round, and I believe they tried to pull me away, but I could not be positive—the prisoner went with me to Vine-street station in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and there charged me with throwing stones and assaulting him—I was kept there till about 12 o'clock at night, in a cell along with about forty more, I was then taken to Marylebone lane that same night—on Monday I was taken to Marlborough-street to go before the Magistrate, but I did not go till Tuesday—I was then discharged—I was kept in custody till then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am second master at the Philological school, New-road. On Sunday afternoon, 1st July, I was in Hyde-park; I was there till between 3 and 4 o'clock—I think it might have been 4 before I left—I remember being near the railings of the drive, on the north side, the grass side, near the east end of the Serpentine—there were a great many police in the drive, some arranged in single file close to the railings on both sides; and also bodies of police in different places in the centre, standing irregularly—there was a crowd along the side of the railing for a long way—I was at first behind the crowd—I saw parties of the police rush towards the crowd, and order them away from the railing; they seemed to me prin<lb/>cipally to stoop and come under the railing—the crowd behind, as soon as they saw the police moving in their direction, prepared to run away up into the grass—on one of those occasions, as the crowd settled back again, I happened to get down to the railings in front of the crowd—I was told by a policeman to stand back—I said it would be impossible to stand back while there was such a crowd behind me; that man seemed to think I was perfectly justified in saying so, and passed on—I also said it would be better to request the persons behind to stand back, and then those in front would be able to move back from the railing—the next policeman in this single line by the railing then spoke to me, and a gentleman who was standing with me—he spoke rather roughly, and said, "You must stand back;" and pushed at my friend with his staff—we then made a united effort to stand a little way from the railing, trying to push back the persons behind us—I said to my friend, "What can be the objection to standing with one's arm on the railing, when there is a crowd of people for half a mile doing the same?"—upon my saying that, or some words to that effect, a policeman that I had noticed before among those who stood in the centre of the roadway, called out, "Is not he satisfied?" and turning round to those that were standing near, he said, "Come on"—they then rushed in the direction where I was standing, and getting under the rail, or over it, in whatever way they could, they seized hold of me; the one who had called out to the others, caught me by the collar, and struck me on the arm with his truncheon—others seized me on the other side, and one by the collar at the back of the neck, and at the same time struck me several blows—the blows which I first felt were those on the arms—as soon as possible I said, "What is it for?"—they pulled me about, tore my coat open, and tore my waist<lb/>coat, and I received several blows on the back and shoulders—the man who said, "Is he not satisfied?" was D 20—the defendant is the man—I have seen him since, and recognised him in the street—it was the same man that said, "Come on"—he said it instantaneously, "Is not he satisfied? come on;" and it was the same man that first struck me with a truncheon—he was the first who collared me, and the first who struck me—he made no charge against me whatever—he did not take me into custody—as soon as they had struck me they let me go—I called out to 20 D, "20 D, I shall remember you, I shall remember your number"—he shook his staff at me, and mimicked my voice, and said, "Ah!" very angrily, because I had called out his number—there was a gentleman named Horton present at the time, among a great many others—he gave me his address, and wrote down the number of the policeman on the same piece of paper—that was immediately after the police left, in the Park, there and then—I have not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070066"/>
               <p>got that piece of paper now, I thought thisaffair was all over after the com<lb/>mittee of inquiry, after I had been before the Commissioners, and so all the papers I had have been destroyed—it was only by accident that I heard of Mr. Horton again, or I should have had no witness—I left the Park within a very few minutes after—I suffered very much from the blows that I received on the arms, and back, and spine, and shoulders—some days afterwards I was in Wigmore-street, with a friend, a clergyman named Randall, and saw the defendant standing at the comer of Marylebone-lane, talking to some one—when I was within about fifteen or twenty yards of him, I said to my friend, "That is the man that struck me in the Park"—I then went up to the defendant, and walked round him to see his full face, and his number, and when I came on the pavement again, he said, "Do you want me?"—I said, "No, I do not"—he made some allusion to my looking at him—I said, "I suppose it is not illegal to look at you," or something of that sort—he then became very abusive, and said something to my friend for walk<lb/>ing round him; he spoke in a loud voice, so as to draw a considerable crowd—I said, "I hope you are not going to strike me again, as you did last Sun<lb/>day, with your truncheon"—he said, "I never saw you before;" and then in speaking to Mr. Randall, he said that he had walked round him also—Mr. Randall told him that what he said was untrue, or false, and that he was a clergyman—I took no part with those who were making a disturb<lb/>ance in the Park on 1st July—I usually go into Hyde-park on a Sunday afternoon, and that afternoon as I saw there was a crowd near the road, I went towards the Serpentine, towards Kensington-gardens.</p>

I happened to be with Mr. Floyd in Wigmore-street on the Saturday after 1st July, and saw the defendant—when we were about ten yards from him, Mr. Floyd said, "There is the very man that ill-used me so in the Park"—he was standing at the corner of Marylebone-lane, talking to another man—Mr. Floyd having made that remark to me, I particularly noticed his number, that it was D 20, and also gave just one look at the man, which enabled me to identify him to-day, the moment I saw him in Court—as the policeman stood, his side face was to us, and, as we walked up in order to get a front view of him, I suppose, to see if he was correct, he walked round—I passed on into Marylebone-lane, and paid no more attention to the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 396.) On Sunday, let July, I was on duty in the carriage drive, in the Park, near the east end of the Serpentine, to and fro, some distance on this side, and some distance up the Serpentine in the drive—I know the receiving house of the Royal Humane Society—it was right at this end of the Serpentine where I went, not near the receiving house at all—I was under the direction of superintendent Hughes, and Bewlay was my sergeant—we went into the carriage drive about half past 2 o'clock—I remained there till somewhere about 5 o'clock, as near as I can guess, when I left to go with a prisoner to Vine-street—I took a prisoner into custody for throwing stones, and took him away to Vine-street station, along with another constable—with that exception, I remained in the car<lb/>riage drive the whole of the time—my duty was in the carriage drive—I cannot exactly say how far I moved up and down, somewhere about twenty yards—we were posted to keep the carriage drive clear near the end of the Serpentine, a little distance this side, and a little distance up towards the receiving house—we were across the crossing—I looked to Bewlay for orders during the day—I kept my eye upon him the whole of the time, in case he should have orders to give me—I saw him once on his face on the ground, with his face towards the Serpentine—as near as I could judge, that was somewhere about a quarter past 4 o'clock—he was in the drive—I saw the head of a wooden hurdle lying by his side, on the ground—it was about a foot and a half or two feet long, and about a span round—I should not like to have had a blow with it—I went to him, and asked him what was the matter—he told me he had been knocked down by that piece of wood—after he got up he looked round, and said, "There is a man making his way</p>

               <p>through the crowd; I have no doubt that is the man that threw it"—he crossed the carriage drive (he was on the side near the Serpentine), and got over the rails—he attempted to get through the crowd, by putting his arm over the people's heads, with his staff in his hand, but he was unable to do so, the crowd pressed him back against the rails; he came into the drive again—he never left the carriage drive on any other occasion during the afternoon but that once, and during that time he was not out of my sight at all—he had no power to get away—I cannot say exactly how many men were under him; about ten, twelve, or fourteen, I think—I never saw him make a blow at any one, but whether his staff hit any one after he got over the rails, I would not swear—that was after he was knocked down—he never left my sight at all, he was not able to proceed any distance from the rails, not above two yards—he was forced back immediately by the crowd and the spectators that were there.</p>

On 1st July I was in Hyde-park for about three hours, and saw stones thrown at the police—I saw the mob with stones in their hands, and there was a great deal of shouting and hooting; they were attempting to frighten the horses as they came down the drive, and they succeeded in doing so—I have known Bewlay twelve years, and always as a discreet constable, acting with temper and mildness—I saw him in the drive that afternoon, but cannot say whether I had him in my eye every minute of the time—his clothes were dirty, as if he had been on the ground, and from that time up to half past 5 o'clock I might have lost sight of him, but only for a minute or two—after that time he did not use his staff about the person of any one; if he had done so, and had had a conversation which had lasted three or four minutes, I must have missed him, but I do not think I missed him for so long, as he was in the habit of passing with his men where I was standing—if he had said, "Come on, then," or any<lb/>thing of that kind, I think I must have heard it—the stones were thrown from the north side of the drive—I was not examined before the Commis<lb/>sioners, but I read the report in the newspaper, and believing Bewlay was not the man, thought it my duty to come forward on his behalf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, of No. 54, East-street, Man<lb/>chester-square. On this Sunday I was in the Park—I saw Bewlay there, walking up and down, and clearing the drive—he appeared to be in com<lb/>mand of ten or a dozen men, who were patrolled from the crossing at the east end of the Serpentine to sixty or seventy yards away from it—I saw him knocked down, I suppose it was with a portion of a hurdle; it was a log of wood seventeen or eighteen inches long—I saw him attempt to get into the Park after the person who did it, and he was forced back into the drive—I remained till nearly 6 o'clock—Bewlay did not leave the drive while I remained there; if he had struck any one with his staff, or remained in con<lb/>versation with a person two or three minutes, I should have seen him—he did not do so—I read the report of the Commissioners about Bewlay in a newspaper, and came forward in consequence—I have known Bewlay up<lb/>wards of five years, in his capacity of a police officer; he performed duty often at many public places—I have seen him in that capacity, and never</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070075"/>
               <p>saw him exceed his duty, or use any violence—I have known him nearly six years, and therefore have no doubt that the man I have spoken of was Bewlay.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police inspector D.</hi>) On 1st July, I went into Hyde-park, on duty, about a quarter past 1 o'clock, and remained till 10 o'clock at night—the crowd began to assemble rather before 3 o'clock; and in the next two or three hours upwards of 50,000 persons assembled—the part of the Park between the east end of the Serpentine and the Park keeper's lodge, near the receiving house, was very much crowded—the mob was very riot<lb/>ous indeed for some hours, and a great number of stones and pieces of wood were thrown at the police; and the hurdles which mark the roadway were broken up and thrown at the police—upwards of thirty of my detachment were injured, and seventy odd, thieves taken—there was a pretty good sprinkling of thieves in the mob—the horses were being frightened by the mob on either side—Bewlay was a sergeant under me—I do not know a man of better temper, or of greater control—he has been speci<lb/>ally employed on many occasions in matters where temper and self<lb/>control are extremely desirable, where mobs are collected, and there is likely to be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I saw him at intervals during the whole of that afternoon; I may have lost eight of him for ten minutes at a time—I never saw him commit any act of violence—while I had my eye on him, he conducted himself with good temper and judgment—we were obliged to dear the drive at first to prevent the horses being frightened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, of No. 14, Grove End-road, St. John's Wood. On 1st July, from 4 to 6 o'clock, I was on the north side of the drive, Hyde-park—I remember seeing Mr. Floyd there, per<lb/>fectly well—the police were walking up and down at that part of the drive, and I heard two of them request Mr. Floyd to move—the first one spoke in a good tempered, civil tone, and told him to stand beck from the rails—he was on the Park aide of the rails, the north side of the drive—the next one used similar words, but in a rough, sharp voice—Mr. Floyd said that he could not got back, for the crowd was so thick behind him, and I believe he made a similar remark to the second one—he was there before I arrived</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070076"/>
               <p>but there was a large crowd behind and on all sides of him; he was in the front rank—after that an attempt was made to force those people back from the railings—I did not see Mr. Floyd struck—I firmly believe that Bewlay was not one of the constables who made a rush at that time—I went to the Court as a matter of curiosity, and recognised Mr. Floyd there—I told him I had seen him on 1st July, in the Park, and had heard the remark made by the first policeman, and had afterwards seen them rush under the rails, and drive him and others back, but with regard to identi<lb/>fying the policeman who attacked him I told the Recorder I could not do it.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The evidence given by the defendant was read at length: it was in sub<lb/>stance to the following effect</hi>: that when he (Moens) first called on Bremer with Linderaan, in 1853, he introduced Lindeman as his clerk and traveller, and that he never stated he was a partner; that he first knew of the letter dated 23rd Nov., 1853, from Bremer to Lindeman after he (Moens) was arrested, in the early part of 1855; that he was not in London, either in the months of Feb. or March, 1854; that he only saw the vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> once in England, viz., in Nov., 1853; and that he was never on board that vessel in Jan., Feb., or March, 1854; that he wrote a letter to Bremer in Feb., 1854, and sent it by the <hi rend="italic">John Russell</hi>, of which he pro<lb/>duced a copy; that he did not receive an account current between himself and Bremer, showing a balance of 2,297<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in favour of Bremer, in May, 1854, or Oct., 1854; that he did not receive an account of charges on a vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, in May, 1854; and that he did not receive such account until the latter end of Aug.; that he never engaged or authorised Lindeman to engage the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> after 14th Feb., 1854, to run on his own account; and that he never knew, until he got from Bremer, his account on 30th Oct., 1854; that he (Bremer) had charged thirty-six weeks hire of that vessel; that before the preparation of a certain agreement some con<lb/>versation took place at the office of Mr. Hollams as to the amount to be inserted for freight, or for the hire of the ship, and that the sum of 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not filled in; that Hollams asked what sum he was to insert; that Bremer said he and Moens had not spoken about it, and that it was of no consequence because he was quite sure to get the remainder of the money; and that</p>

                  </hi>. I am a German. I have been forty-one years in England, carrying on business as a ship broker in London, under the firm of Sack, Bremer, and Co.—I was for five or six years the sole owner of a ship called the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, on my own account—in June, 1852, we had two letters from Muntz and Co., of Harliugen, and in May, 1853, the prisoner called on me with Mr. Lindeman—I never saw either of them before—they wished me to send my steamer, the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, to Harlingen—she had been there, and they wished me to send her again, which I declined—it was Mr. Moens, the prisoner, who proposed it—I declined doing so, stating it had been a losing concern upon the previous year, and at the same time I mentioned that we had had letters from Muntz and Co. to the same effect—to which Moens replied, "It is all the same concern, we are all three partners"—he had not introduced Lindeman to me before—he did not tell me what Lindeman was, nothing else but, "It is all the. same concern, we are all three partners"—I did not make any proposition or agreement; nothing particular—they wrote to me subsequently, inquiring the draught of water, and the price, and I named 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had conversation with them after<lb/>wards, they frequently called at the office—the contract was made to pur<lb/>chase the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> for 10.000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were to pay me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as deposit, in cash, but they gave me a bill—I made the agreement myself, but Mr. Hollania drew out the contract—there was no agreement made at that time for run<lb/>ning the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> in the meantime—I had her employed in the Oporto trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said afterwards by Moens about hiring the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A second contract was made, the first bill not being paid—the acceptance was refused—I agreed to take 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they made the second contract for the purchase, and they brought me 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more as a deposit, making 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but when the time expired they had no cash to pay the remainder; the contract was at an end—I could have kept the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but I did not—the final contract was made on 30th Aug., 1853—I gave them credit for the whole 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—in Aug., 1853, when the contract was entered into, Mr. Hollams was not present—he had made it out, but was not present—on 30th Aug. I entered into a fresh contract—they brought me 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for purchase or hire, according to the new contract—that 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. included the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a sum was agreed to be paid, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for twelve weeks, or at their option to purchase the ship—(<hi rend="italic">This agreement was here put in and read, dated 30th Aug.</hi>, 1853, <hi rend="italic">between M.

Moens had paid</hi> 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to M. F.

               <p>for the first twelve weeks—Moens did not pay for the ship—a second agreement was then entered into, and that was signed by Lindeman, for Bernelot Moens, and Co.—I saw Lindeman and Moens Very frequently together—Lindeman never acted as a clerk—on the contrary, he proposed that we should keep the 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Moens objected to that, and said we ought not to be hard, and I yielded to that, and gave them credit for the whole—in Nov. the second agreement was entered into—on 23rd Nov. I wrote to Moens—this is the letter—it is directed to Lindeman—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "23rd Nov., 1853. Mr. T. H W.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you had conversation with Moens about the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he went down with me to see the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> previous to my writing this letter—he requested me to get an estimate for raising the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> three feet—he went over the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> in Nov., 1853: no, Oct. it must have been—I cannot say exactly—Lindeman went over it also—it was in consequence of the conversa<lb/>tion about the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> that this letter was written by me—I received this letter—I believe this is Lindeman's writing—it is the Dutch original of the answer, in Linderaan's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Harlingen, 29th Nov., 1863. To Mr. M. F. Bremer, London. Dear Sir,—Your esteemed favour of the 23rd inst. duly to hand. Mr. Lindeman being obliged to leave yesterday morning for Amsterdam, to attend a meeting regarding the railway, so he requested me to answer your letter. He thinks 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is quite money enough, as the ex<lb/>penses for the intended alterations will be rather heavy. As regards the remittances, we'll, within short, be able to mention the amount to you after next week, as Mr. Lindeman and I intend to go over ourselves. I remain, dear Sir, yours most sincerely, Henry Moens."—After the receipt of this letter on 29th Nov., Moens was here again in Dec.—I saw him in Feb., certainly on the 22nd—Lindeman is an older man than Moens—I spoke about remittances—that was in reference to the purchase of the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>—the were agreements respecting the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>, decidedly I had no other to make—there had been a conversation about the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>, and heightening the deck three feet—I had agreed for the sale of the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, and 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in my hands for the purchase and the freight—at that time the contract was existing for the purchase or hire of the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>—the new contract had just been entered into—there had been a treaty for the purchase of the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>—they had asked 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and reduced it to 4,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I thought they would take 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to purchase the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> for them—in Feb., 1864, I saw Moens; I went with him and Lindeman on board the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>, on 22nd Feb., they measured the ship, and put down the length and breadth—the ship was in the East India Docks—I have a letter, dated 16th Dec., it is in Moens' writing, and is signed "Bernelot Moens and Co."—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>)—some time after, I wrote word that the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> was still for sale; and after that they came over in Feb., and visited the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>, and took measurement—we were on board the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi> two or three hours—they were very particular—I talked to Moens about the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>—we were on board the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>—Mr. Lindeman was to write to Mr. De Wit to come and see it, and if he approved of the alterations, Lindeman was to remain here and purchase it—I saw Moens after that, he arrived on the 22nd, and called on me repeatedly—De Wit</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070080"/>
               <p>came over to examine the vessel; he came to my office with Lindeman, and said it was a good ship, it could be altered—in consequence of what De Wit said, I concluded the purchase, by direction of Lindeman, with the Herne Bay Company, on account of Moens and Co.—I had at that time in my hands unexhausted 1,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 2nd March I paid a deposit of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the Company agreed, in consequence of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid down, to take 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the vessel was duly transferred to Holland, and Liudeman went over with her—Lindeman paid me 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 20th March, and of the 21st I paid the remaining 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving due to me 2,297<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when Moens and Lindeman were over on 21st Feb., I entered into a fresh agreement about the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>—I agreed with Lindeman, and I saw Moens subsequently on it—I agreed with Lindeman to let them have the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, at 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, weekly, till they had another ship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about the preceding twenty-four weeks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Lin<lb/>deman came, and said, "If you exact the whole 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for the back time, I shall have nothing but my coat and my shirt," and I agreed to reduce it—I saw Moens on it, and he expressed his gratitude that I had reduced it from 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said I would make him a pre<lb/>sent of, and Moens expressed his gratitude for it—on 25th May I enclosed an account current and a freight account to Harlingen—I enclosed them both in one envelope—I posted it myself, and directed it to Bernelot Moens and Co., Harlingen—this is the copy of the account current, and this is the copy of the freight account—this is the letter in which they were both sent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you receive any letter disputing this account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I received a letter acknowledging the receipt of these accounts, and that they were correct—I booked them accordingly—this letter, 25th Sept, is Moens' writing—("Harlingen, 25th Sept., 1854.

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Marten, Thomas, and Hollams. I was attorney in the actions of Bremer against Moens, and Moens against Bremer—the action of Moens against Bremer was tried first—I received instructions from Mr. Bremer in presence of Mr. Moens respect<lb/>ing the agreement—it was ultimately drawn from those instructions—when it was said the terms were 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, it was not spoken of as a nominal sum, never—the terms were not discussed before me—they merely told me the agreement they had made—it was prepared in my own office, and I read it over in presence of Moens.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you came to where the amount of freight was filled in, was it filled in before you read it over? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was—it is not true that it was not filled in—it is not true that I asked what I was to fill in for the amount—Mr. Bremer did not say that he had not spoken about it—nothing of the kind—he did not say that they had not spoken about the amount of the freight—Mr. Bremer did not say it was no consequence, because he was quite sure to get the remainder of the purchase money, no such conversa<lb/>tion took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "Suppose we put 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; is that fair? or any sum you like?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing of the kind—no conversation took place at that time, and nothing was said about the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being a nominal sum—the arrange<lb/>ment between themselves was not discussed in my presence—these matters were all put into my hands, and afterwards 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week was charged—I put that down—I was present at the trial, and heard Mr. James open the case—I heard him read the letter reported to be sent on 21st Feb.—I after<lb/>wards saw this book put into the prisoner's hand, and heard the evidence he gave—the book was passed by me towards him, and I took the liberty to see that the letter was in the order of date—I believe the prisoner had the book in his hand, and I heard him make the statement he did—I heard the verdict given—it depended upon certain principles, and the figures were adjusted by the Chief Justice—I heard the prisoner state that he was not in England on the 22nd Feb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a letter produced written by Lindeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak to that, at the time of the trial—it was produced before the arbitra<lb/>tors—it was directed to Bernslot Moens and Co., Harlingen; it is dated "London. 21st Feb., 1854"—it is from Lindeman to Moens—here is an in<lb/>dorsement on it—"Letter, London, 21st Feb., 1854; R 23, R. 25;" meaning</p>

               <p>received on the 23rd, and responded to or answered on the 25th—this in<lb/>dorsement is the prisoner's writing—the letter appears to have gone by the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>—it was written in Dutch—this is a translation: ("London, 21st Feb., 1854, per <hi rend="italic">Queen.</hi> To Messrs. Bernelot Moens and Co., Harlingen. Gentle-men,—I have seen to-day, Mr. Bremer, and according to your orders com<lb/>municated him that you decline to renew the agreement, as you think there is no chance to find the necessary funds to make up the purchase money for the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi>, and that you do not feel inclined to keep the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> on the station for your account, on paying hire. It appeared, however, that Mr. Bremer was very well satisfied with the freight made this week by the steamer, and he is decided to run the boat, for instance, a few voyages more to Harlin<lb/>gen, for his own account and risk. With regard to the hire for the twenty-four voyages or weeks, I had also a conversation with him; and although he must confess that the hire stated in the agreement cannot be of any con<lb/>sequence, he would not take less than 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week. I gave myself much trouble to have this enormous high price reduced, but Bremer's mind was not to be altered upon this point. I am sorry that you decline entirely upon this steamer mentioned to you by Mr. Bremer, in his letter last week, as it appears to me to be very suitable. Even if you would, the boat is not to be purchased now, and the chance lost. By the accounts of sale, you will perceive that the cattle dealers have lost this week much money. The market was very dull; my opinion, however, is, it will be better next week. Within a few days I hope to write you more about the other matter, and remain with kind respects, your obedient servant, J. H. W. Lindeman")—The original is indorsed in the handwriting of the prisoner, "London, 21st Feb., 1854, J. H. W. Lindeman; R 23, R 25"—from hearing what Moens swore, with reference to the 22nd, 23rd, and 25th of Feb., I caused inquiry to be made, and having learned the facts which have been deposed to to-day, I caused the hotel keeper to be subpœnaed—when the case was called on the next time, one point was referred to Mr. Davidson; and there was one that the Lord Chief Justice was to determine, that was the purchase of the <hi rend="italic">Herne</hi>—that would turn the verdict either way—I was present when Moens was examined before the arbitrator—the books were produced, and amongst them were these two books—while Moens was being examined, I examined this book (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—Moens objected to my looking at the books, more particularly these two books—the prisoner more than once complained that I was looking at matters which did not relate to the trans<lb/>action—there were some letters which in my opinion had reference to this transaction—there were several in Dutch; I said I could not read Dutch, and I wished I could—that was heard by the prisoner—the books were retained by the arbitrators—when I saw this book again it was not in the same state in which I had examined it before—a great many letters had been torn out—some of them undoubtedly were letters to which I had called attention in the presence of the prisoner—one letter which I had remarked, but had not called attention to, still remained—it is in the handwriting of Moens—it is in Dutch, and is dated the 4th of Sept., 1854—I looked carefully at the dates—this hole in the paper was not there when I turned over the letters.</p>

I saw the prisoner Waghorn there with a van—he came for twenty-four sacks of wheat—I helped to load the wheat—the distance between the wheat and the beans might be three or four yards; they were on the same platform which was continued between them, bat there was other grain between them—when Waghorn came with his van, he backed it up to the platform, so that we run the sacks with what we call a hand truck—I did not assist to put the whole twenty-four sacks in, I helped to put four sacks in—my fellow servant said, "What do you want to make four <hi rend="italic">riders</hi> for? why do you leave this space at the back of the van? why do you not put one more sack in behind, instead of making four <hi rend="italic">riders?</hi>" (<hi rend="italic">riders</hi> are sacks that lie on the top of the sacks that stand up)—Waghorn said that his van load would be too heavy behind, or words to that effect—when they were all loaded, the space behind was still left—I went to sign for delivering them, and Cormack went to his work—I went to No. 10 platform, which is, very likely, fifty yards from the van—Waghorn came shortly after me, he signed for receiving them—he went away—I saw no more of him.</p>

I have always borne a good character before"—pointing to the bill, A, he said, "I told him when he brought the first bill that I would have no more of it; it is done now, let it go; we divided the money between us."</p>

I have not had any oats"—I said, "It is a serious charge, and I should advise you to be careful what you say, as I may have to make use of your words for or against you"—he said, "Well, there are a few oats in the bin which <hi rend="italic">they</hi> brought"—he went with me to the stable, and showed me the oats, and they corresponded—there were from three to four bushels—I told him that I must take possession of them, and asked him where the sack was—he said that he did not know, but he would lend me a sack to put the oats in—when we had got about two bushels in, he said to his wife, "Let us see, how many were there in before these were shot?"—she replied, that there were "<hi rend="italic">a goodish few</hi>"—I told him they appeared to be the same oats, and that I should take possession of the lot, which I did—I took him to the station, and asked him what he had given for the oats—he said, "Nothing;" nor was he to do so that he knew of—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a sample, they are rather a particular sort of oats.</p>

I am foreman to Mr. Frank Clark Hills, a manufac<lb/>turing chemist and druggist The prisoner has been employed at Mr. Hill's upwards of two years—I know this piece of lead—it is Mr. Hill's—it is what we call a socket syphon—I did not miss it—I might have seen it a fortnight before the 20th Dec.—I cannot say exactly, because we have more of them—we perhaps should not have missed it at all, because such a quantity as is taken into the warehouse, it would be almost impossible to tell—I have seen this other lead, part of it has been melted out of lead we had—some parts I could not positively swear to—the value of this one article</p>

On Monday afternoon, 10th Dec., I was passing along the Wal<lb/>worth-road between 3 and 4 o'clock, and somebody came and begged of me—it was broad daylight—I just turned my head round and observed that it was a man of colour, I am certain of that—I unbuttoned my coat, and felt in my pocket, but had no halfpence, I felt in another pocket and gave him a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—I fancied that black men are persons who cannot get employ<lb/>ment, he was shabbily dressed, and I thought he was out of work—I had then about one eighth of a mile to go to my gateway, and nothing attracted my attention till I was stooping to pull the lock of my gate, when I was struck on the back of the neck from behind, and knocked down insensible—I did not see any person—it must have been with something more than the fist, as the back of my head was swelled up with two large lumps—I recol<lb/>lect nothing from that time till I came to myself on the sofa in my parlour, and missed my watch and chain, which were safe when I opened my coat and gave him the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the chain went through a button hole of my waist<lb/>coat, and of my trowers also—I was quite sober, and had been looking over some old houses in West Smithfield—I saw the prisoner at the station a day or two afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butter boy, in the employ of Mr. William Carter, and live at No. 17 A, Trafalgar-street, Walworth. On that after<lb/>noon I was going along Brunswick-terrace, towards Groavenor-park, and saw the prisoner and four others in Brunswick-terrace—I was on the left side, and saw one young man go up to Mr. Towell, of No. 18, Brunswick<lb/>terrace, and try to trip him up—they were all following the gentleman—one of them wanted to shake hands with Mr. Towell, but he would not—he had one ring on his finger—I saw it distinctly—neither of them was the prisoner—Mr. Towell would not shake hands, and he said that it was all right, and turned back—Mr. Towell was proceeding on his journey home, and the next thing I saw was the prisoner on the left hand side of the road, making a urinal of the wall—the other lads left Mr. Towell, and when he had got about ten yards I heard a violent fall—(I had passed Mr. Towell on the opposite side of the way, facing him on his left)—I turned round, and saw a young man rifling the prosecutor, who was on the ground, of his watch—it was just opposite his own door: I have repeatedly seen him go in—one young man took a watch away from him, but this is not the man—I distinctly saw the watch in his hand—the other four were hanging about</p>

               <p>on the other side of the way, about twenty yards from the one who took the watch, and on the same side of the way as I was—the lad who took the watch ran up between the others, and they all decamped as hard as they could, hustling the watch between them from one to the other—I distinctly saw the man who took it, pass it to the prisoner, but did not see him pass it to anybody else—I have known the prisoner by sight seven or eight years, and am quite sure of him—I went across the road, and a milkman was passing, and we helped Mr. Towell up—I then left my basket at the gate, and ran after the lads, but could not see anything of them.</p>

               <p>six times prior to 21st Dec., and on one occasion I spoke to her, and she said that she was very stubborn, and very dirty, and would not do by fair means—the child appeared a pretty behaved and a well spoken child—she died on Friday, 21st Dec.; and about a week before that, I was in my room, which is on the first floor, over theirs, and heard the child crying dreadfully, and I heard as if her head was being knocked on the wainscoting—I heard her distinctly say, "Oh, mother, I will be a good girl!"—that was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the day, and I believe the father was out—I told the mother a day or two afterwards that she really made my flesh creep, to hear the child cry, and to hear its head knocked against the wainscoting—she said that it was her little brother who knocked her head—the little brother will be five years old in March—there were several knocks, and they must have been violent for me to have heard them so distinctly—I can almost be positive that the father was out, but one morning before that) the children were both walking up and down the passage crying dreadfully, and I took the little girl by the hand and said to the father, who was in the shop, "Father, let this little girl come to the fire, she will be good now"—he took her kindly, and the little boy was then turned into the wash house by the mother—that was the only time I knew the father to be present—I did not see the mother beat the child, but I heard her; she slapped it—that was in the parlour—there is a communication between the parlour and the shop both ways—on Friday morning, 21st Deo, about 12 o'clock, I was in the wash house, and the prisoners were in the back room—the father brought me a pan which belonged to me, and said, "I thought we should have lost the little girl in the night"—I said, "What a pity you did not call me"—he said, "I wanted to call you, but my wife would not let me"—I asked how the child was—he said, "We have not looked at her this morning"—I had not seen either of the prisoners that morning till the male prisoner came with the pan—the wife was not present then—(they were in the habit of getting up between 11 and 12 o'clock)—I then heard a knocking at their parlour window, which looks into the wash house, but saw no one—that was when he was there, and he then went and opened the parlour shutters, which open from the outside—I saw his wife beckoning, and I went into the parlour after him, and saw the little girl lying on two pillows which were on two chairs, right opposite the fireplace—there was not a bit of fire in the grate, and there could not have been any for many hours—the child had on a man's old flannel shirt, but I could not see of what length, as it had some dark covering over it, which I think was old moreen curtains, and they appeared to be doubled over the child, but her chest and arms were quite naked—it was very severe weather—by the side of the child's head lay a pool of wet blood and matter, or blood and water, as large as my hand—I did not see where it was coming from, and thought she had been sick—I said, "Dear me, this is enough to kill the child to be laid in this cold place, right in the draught of the fireplace"—the father said, "We left a fire when we went to bed, and we thought it would be the warmest place," and that they had put it in a warm bath over night—I took hold of it's hand and said, "The child is quite dead"—I told the father that he ought to have called in a medical man—I then went up stairs to give my husband his dinner—I had been there a minute or two when the husband came up, and said, "Mrs. Sands, if you have got a kettle of water, we will put the child in another warm bath, as I think she is still alive"—I got some water, made it hot, took it down to them, and the mother put it into a pan, and put the child into it, but it had no effect on it—the husband went for Dr. Challis—the</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. M. D. I reside at Bermondsey. On Friday morn<lb/>ing, 21st Dec., just after 12 o'clock, I was at my dispensary, in Crucifix-lane, the male prisoner came and said that he wished me to see a chad of his that was very ill; he said that he thought it was suffering from cold—I asked him how long it had been ill—he said, the night before—I told him to place it in a hot bath, and I would come in a few minutes—it is about 200 yards from my house—I went in about ten minutes, and found the child in a pan of water; it was dead, and from the temperature of we room my impression is, that it had been dead more than an hour; the hands were getting cold, and the features set—I examined the body; for being informed that it was very ill, I was surprised to find it dead—it was rather emaciated, but not excessively so—I saw a bruise on it's head, several on it's forehead, and about two table spoonsfhll of bloody serum on the pillow, oozing, appa<lb/>rently, from the child's ear; that quantity would make a considerable stain on the pillow—the prisoners were both in the room—I said, "There has been an oozing of blood and matter from the ear"—the female said that the child was accustomed to pick her ears a great deal—it had come from the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070112"/>
               <p>internal part of the ear; there was no sore behind the ear—I asked how the bruise came over the left eye, on which the male prisoner asked the female if the child had not had a fall from the bed; she replied that it had, and my impression is, that she said that it was the night before, and by the swelling I judged that it might have been—I did not notice other bruises so minutely then; I discovered them more particularly afterwards—that bruise might have been from a blow or a fall—the child was quite naked—I lifted it out of the pan, and placed it on a chair—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exa<lb/>mination three or four days afterwards—the external appearance was rather emaciated, but not more than many children of that age are—there was a bruise on the left leg, and one on the forehead—there were six or seven dis<lb/>tinct bruises—there was another violent bruise over the right eye, not the one to which my attention had been called—that over the left eye was not severe in comparison with the other, but the integuments were completely darkened down to the bone—the brain was healthy, there were no marks of concussion—the chest was perfectly healthy, with the exception of a alight congestion of the lungs, which in all probability arose from cold—the in<lb/>ternal organs were, generally speaking, those of a healthy child—the stomach and intestines were healthy, and all the organs—there was no ap<lb/>pearance of any organic disease—there was about a table spoonful of a greenish fluid in the stomach; I did not expose it to the microscope, as I detected a husk of wheat, so that it appeared to be vegetable matter—I should say, from the appearance of the body, that the child had not had suf<lb/>ficient food—it must have suffered from the bruises—I do not think the bruises alone would have caused death, but looking at the condition of the body, that it was not extremely emaciated, the death could not have been occasioned from absolute want of food, neither from the slight congestion of the lungs, or from absolute exposure to cold; but I consider that injuries such as it must have received, upon a weakened frame, and that frame ex<lb/>posed to a very low temperature, such as the night of 20th Dec. was, those combined causes are quite sufficient to account for the child's death—the place where it was placed on the chairs was the coldest part of the room, close to a large old fashioned fireplace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You believe that the cold that may have been experienced by that child in the night, supervening on a weakened constitution, caused the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was no other cause—I should imagine that the blow just above the forehead, on the right side, although it was not trans<lb/>ferred to the brain to show any permanent result, yet it must have nearly stunned the child, as in a child in that condition the vitality is very slight, and I believe that it was by those injuries made more liable to succumb, more likely to be killed by cold; life would be half knocked out of it, and it would be pretty much the same with respect to food—if it had been well fed, it would have been less likely to be affected by cold, but probably the in<lb/>juries would have had a worse effect on it if it had been well fed—the prisoners seemed poor—there were marks of poverty, but not of extreme distress.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You have told us that the bloody serum proceeded from the interior of the ear; are not children frequently in the habit of picking their ears and causing a flow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and there is then an ex<lb/>udation of bloody serum from the interior of the ear—I am quite unable to say whether the bruises were occasioned by a blow or a fall, but children do not generally pitch head foremost, without protecting themselves with their hands—there was nothing like congestion of the brain—my impres<lb/>sion is, that not one of these causes singly was the proximate cause of death,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185601070113"/>
               <p>but it was the combined causes—I do not think the stomach being in a healthy state would negative the impression that the child had been starved—in cages of children who have died from starvation, the stomach is un usually red, from the gastric juice feeding upon it, but that was not the case.</p>

CAARTEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the picking of the ear; would you expect to find two table spoonsful! of matter from it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never saw so much—a blow on the head, or the side of the ear, would be very likely to cause a swelling inside, which would occasion a discharge—I mean a blow struck, or a blow received by a fall—any injury to the head would be likely to cause it—an injury such as I saw would.</p>

I am a surgeon, and am medical officer for Bethnal<lb/>green parish—I attended the female prisoner by the parish order—I put her to bed with the present infant on 8th Oct.—I examined the deceased child, Emma, on the same or the following day—she was very much attenuated, exceedingly weak, and had the appearance of having been very much neglected—I discovered no marks of violence—I spoke to the father on the same day, in the mother's presence, and told him the report I had</p>

               <p>heard, and the reason of my examining his children, and that my opinion was, that they were suffering from want of sufficient food—he said that he was a poor man and was out of work, and the children fared as he and his wife did; that they had animal food once or twice a week, and in the intervals lived chiefly on bread and butter—I told him he should provide more food for his children—he said that he could not afford more, and I directed him to apply to the workhouse for relief—he told me that he would, but on my next visit, on the following day, I found he had not, and asked him why; he replied that he thought he should be asked too many questions—I immediately went home, being early in the morning, and wrote to the relieving officer, stating the case, and he came down and brought food with him for the family—they only received food that once—he subsequently told me that he had been down, and had been examined by the parish authorities, who questioned him about his mother; that they wished him to write to his mother, who lived at Chatham or Rochester, who was very well off; keeping a bookseller's shop, I think it was in Chat<lb/>ham—he said that he would write to her, and would not receive relief from them, for he had no doubt that his mother would supply him with what was necessary for his family, and he afterwards called on me with a letter which he said that he had received from his mother that morning, and that she promised to supply them with whatever they needed—I saw the outside of the letter, but not the contents—I was not present at the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I have heard the evidence of Dr. Challis, and my opinion is, that the shock of the blow on the head, to have produced such effects, must have produced concussion of the brain for a time, and that the concussion, after a few hours, would leave no trace behind it; the effects would be entirely evanescent, and I think that the shock to a system already reduced by in<lb/>sufficient food rendered it so far susceptible to the influence of cold, that the cold would produce death.</p>

After put<lb/>ting out this fire, I made an examination in the kitchen of No. 24, and found a copper built against the plaster of the brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>—I believe it was a stone floor—there was a common fireplace under the copper, above one foot and a half deep—the wall was composed of brick and timber—there was a hole at the end of the flue, about a foot from the ground, caused by the wood work breaking away—by the flue I do not mean the chimney—the flue runs right round—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of the wood work of the <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>—I have no doubt that the fire commenced at that part of the wood work, by it's catching fire by the flue—I have seen many coppers set, but they always cut the wood work out first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer and builder, and have been so forty-three years next June. I examined this kitchen—the front of the flue was covered with flat plain tiles to form the front of the chimney, the chimney having been cut out to form the flue at the side of the copper—in taking these tiles down, I found that the inside of the chimney had been cut out, and I found one of the quarters of the partition between Nos. 24 and 25—it probably had been an old kitchen, and had been filled in with brick work to keep the cold out—by the partition, I mean the brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>, and it was par<lb/>tially burnt away in the upright flue, leading into the kitchen chimney—there was a fireplace under the copper—it was about two feet nine inches from the door to the back, and from the front of the copper to the brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi> was three feet—the depth of the fireplace was about two feet—the copper was set on the floor—where the flame caught the back part of the flue there was another quarter which had only plaster to cover it, and the flame beat against it; it was where the fire went into the furnace—the fireplace is what I call the furnace; furnace is the proper name for it—the mouth of the furnace is eight or nine inches square—if a person was putting up that copper, it would be his duty to see what he was putting it up against; he ought to have ascertained that by taking off the plaster—merely tapping it would not be sufficient to ascertain whether it was brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi> or not—it would be enough to tell him whether it was wood or bricks, but not enough to enable him to tell what description of wall it was—the whole of the</p>

               <p>plaster ought to have been cut away to ascertain—it is not uncommon for walls to be composed of brick <hi rend="italic">noggin</hi>, especially old houses, but it is very dangerous—a person who has had experience in setting coppers would know that fact.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist at Richmond. On Saturday, 8th Dec., the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco; he gave me in payment a crown—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—for a minute he remained there; he lighted his pipe at the gas, and <hi rend="italic">left</hi> the shop—I had put the crown in the till—after he was gone, I looked at it two or three minutes afterwards—when the next customer came in he offered me half a sovereign; I was going to give him the crown which the prisoner gave me, and when I opened the till, I had no other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece there—I had taken no other, and had no other in the house—when the other party came in I found this 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was bad—I marked it, and locked it in the shop desk—on the following Tuesday I saw the prisoner again; he came about the same time in the evening for half an ounce of tobacco—he gave me in payment a half crown—I knew him instantly—the half crown he gave me was bad—I told him I suspected it was a bad one—I went to the door of the shop to look for a policeman—I could not see one—I asked a friend of mine to look at the half crown—the prisoner ran away—I ran after him nearly a quarter of a mile—I did not lose sight of him—I gave him into custody with the half crown, which I still had in my hand—I gave the officer the half crown.</p>
