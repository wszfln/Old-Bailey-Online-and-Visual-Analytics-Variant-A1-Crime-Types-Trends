               <p>Rev. Dr. ROBERT HAMILTON sworn. - On Wednesday the 10th of March, about three o'clock, I was to the north of the <placeName id="t18010520-2-crimeloc7">Serpentine-river, in Kensington-gardens</placeName>

                        targets="t18010520-2-off4 t18010520-2-crimeloc7"/>; I saw the prisoner at the bar standing in one of the alcoves, or by one of the alcoves; I suspected an ill intention from some motions I saw about him, and I returned back by the way by which I came; the prisoner at the bar ran after me, upon which I stopped to receive him, and in a determined tone, asked him what I was to understand by that behaviour; he pleaded distress; after remonstrating with him some-time, upon the impropriety of his conduct, I gave him a trifle, as a relief from his distress, a sixpence, or a shilling, he looked at it a considerable time, and told me it would not do.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at the prisoner at the bar? - A. That is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure? - A. I am sorry to say I am certain; he then threatened my life, and demanded my money; he had a heavy stick in his hand, it had been torn off a tree, with the bark peeled off; I then gave him my money, to the amount of about 28 or 29s. in a guinea and silver; there was no person in sight, nor within a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a dull or a bright day? - A. A gloomy day; he then demanded my watch, which, after some pause and remonstrance, I gave him; he then ordered me to return the way I came; he said, if I turned round to look back, he should follow me, and would kill me; I then returned the same way without looking back; I immediately went to Mr. Forsyth, his Majesty's head gardener, with whom I am acquainted, and told him of it; he went with me to Bow-street, and gave information; I saw no more of the prisoner till the Monday following; he was apprehended nearly upon the same spot; I saw him in the guard house at Kensington, near the barracks, I am certain he is the same person; I knew him again immediately, I was looking at him for five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I see, by your wearing spectacles, you are near-sighted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your spectacles on at this time? - A. Yes; I always wear them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you see distinctly with them? - A. Yes. WILLIAM ANTHONY sworn. - I am one of the officers of Bow-street: On Tuesday, the 10th of March, Dr. Hamilton lodged an information at our office; I made enquiry, but could not get any information of the prisoner till the Monday following; I went to Kensington, and found the prisoner in the guard-room as a deserter, in the custody of the serjeant of the guard; I apprehended him, and told him what for; he positively denied that he had committed the robbery; I took him to Bow-street, and Dr. Hamilton came and immediately pointed him out, and swore that he was the man; the prisoner said he had been at work by Bayswater at a cow-keeper's, and he could bring several people to prove where he was on that day.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did Dr. Hamilton immediately recognize the prisoner at the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Dr. Hamilton. I had previously seen him in the guard-room, and then I went to Bow-street for the officer.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WISE sworn. - I was in Kensington-gardens at the time of the robbery, I do not recollect what day it was:

No; two gentlemen asked me if I had seen a soldier with a red jacket and blue collar; and afterwards, I said to him, how those two gentlemen looked at you; he said, if they had said any thing to him; he would have knocked them down with a stick; it was an elm stick, and was not quite dead; he fenced the stick about my head, and said it would fetch any body a good knock; he said, they would not tell of it in a hurry, and then he walked away.</p>

               <p>Q.Look at these skins? - A.They are all marked F C, and F C upon the horns also; I am certain these are the skins and horns of my sheep.</p>

M'Cormack desired me to go with him to get some mutton; being hungry, I went with him to Jones's, and Jones gave us the mutton; I saw the skins upon the floor, and he told me it was his own property; as we were coming home, these constables took us, and I told them where I got it.</p>
               <p>Jones's defence. These men called me up, and M'Cormack told me he would give me two shillings if I would kill four sheep for them, which I did; Kennedy brought them in with his own hands.</p>
               <p>M'Cormack's defence. I am a plasterer by trade; Jones desired me to go down on Thursday morning to fetch some meat, and to bring another man with me, and I took this man; I told Jones that it was dangerous for us to carry them, if he was sure they were not his own, and he said they were his own.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did he walk away? - A. Yes, he walked away; I saw him brought back in about a quarter of an hour; I am sure the person that was brought back was the same man that dropped the spoons.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM TURNER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a plasterer: On Friday the 1st of May, I was in York-place, Portman-square; I heard an alarm, and pursued the prisoner, Goodman was with me; he was thrown down by a labouring man a few yards before we came up to him; when we came up, the prisoner put his hand to his right-hand pocket, I seized his hand in his pocket, and pulled his hand out with one of these spoons in it; I put my hand into his pocket and found another; upon which, Goodman searched his left-hand pocket, and found another tea-spoon, and a salt-spoon; we took him back to Mr. Solly's house, and searched him again, but found no more; then Lord Portsmouth sent for a coach, and he was taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at all appear to be out of his senses? - A. No. (The spoons produced).</p>

               <p>Q. Have you found, that the general state of his mind was that of an insane man? - A. Yes; it is often the case, that persons in that situation have more scheme and artfulness than others.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And, perhaps, you have known them sometimes pretend to be mad when they are not so? - A. I did not know him before these four or five months; I attended him between three and four months.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At Bevis-Marks, St. Mary-Axe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live? - A. I attended him; at one time, in Red Lion-street, Spitalfields.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he no lucid intervals? - A. Very little or none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you particularly versed in this disorder of the human mind? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are what is called a mad doctor? - A. It is not my particular profession to attend persons under that complaint; I have attended them; we call it the mania.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recommend his relations to call in some person whose particular profession it was? - A. I cannot say that I did; I recommended them to send him to St. Luke's, or some private place.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200008"/>Mr. Bevil. Q. A man who is deranged will sometimes act like a man in his senses? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You have heard that this man dropped some spoons upon the area steps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it often happened to you to hear of a madman stealing spoons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is more likely for a man to do it in a lucid interval than in a moment of insanity? - A. He could do it in the paroxysms of the mania.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given evidence here before? - A. I believe I have; is that any matter of consequence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Bevil. Q. I believe you are a physician to a jew charity? - A. Yes; and the Societies at large.</p>
               <p>HENRY MARKS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bevil. I am a silversmith, in Hyde-street, Bloomsbury: I have known the prisoner a year and a half; about four or five months ago he came to my shop, and wanted to give me an order for some goods; he wanted so many dozen table-spoons and tea-spoons, and different articles; I asked him who he wanted them for; he said he wanted them to go abroad; I asked him how he came by these orders; and he made different excuses; I looked upon him to be out of his mind; then he wanted some embroidered clothes, which was out of my line of business, and I took no manner of notice of what he said; about three weeks, or a fortnight after, he came again; I asked him what his pleasure was; he said, be so good as lend me a shilling; I was quite surprized when he asked for a shilling, I gave him a shilling, and I waited in my shop I dare say four or five minutes before he took the shilling; he spoke several things, but I did not take any notice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then his behaviour was evidently the behaviour of a man deranged? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>GEORGE GOUGH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am the servant of Mr. Thomas Willan; the owners of the horses are Thomas Willan, John Willan, and William Smith; Barney and Lediard were employed under me: On the 4th of May I found the prisoner holding a horse, while Lediard was cutting the hair off; I asked what they did it for, and they said, to make a fishing-line; I found eight horses served in the same way; I found a quantity of horse-hair upon Lediard, between his shirt and his skin, (produces it); there is better than a pound and a half of it; it is worth a shilling a pound; every one of the horses was disfigured a good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it lowered the value of the horses very much? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had no concern in pulling it off, I only looked on; the horse had got a very thick mane, and he cut a little off, and took a few hairs out of the tail; it is very common in my country; I did not know any harm.</p>

               <p>HENRY JACKSON sworn. - I live at Beckenham, in the country of Kent; I saw the China bowl on Friday, the 1st of May, in the possession of the prisoner; I met him in Cloak-lane with it in his hand, in consequence of which I applied to the Lord-Mayor for a search-warrant; I challenged the bowl as mine; he said it was not, I was mistaken; I did not take him into custody, I took the bowl from him, and lodged it at a person's house, Mr. Schroeder's, upon College-hill; on Monday, the 4th of May, I went with a Marshalman and a search-warrant to the prisoner's lodgings, in Bow-lane, Cheapside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner in those lodgings? - A. No; I found there a shirt, two neckcloths, a cravat, two handkerchiefs, four waistcoats, a pair of knee-caps, and a night-cap.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long is it since this man was in your service? - A. In December last.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose it is usual with you, when your servants leave you, that they should give an account of every article in their possession? - A. I did not look over his linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Not his own linen, but you expected him to give an account of every thing that passes through his hands belonging to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep several servants? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened that other servants have been accused by you of similar transactions? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who lives with the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a woman lives with him? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The night-cap and the waistcoats, where did you find them? - A. The Marshalman found them in his boxes; the waistcoats I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor the bowl? - A. There is a certain chip in a very particular place that I can certainly venture to swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. You have occasionally given this man some old clothes? - A. I have, but never linen.</p>
               <p>THOMAS PARROTT sworn. - I am one of the Marshalmen: On the 4th of May I went with a search-warrant to No. 31, Bow-lane, a widow lady keeps the house; in the back room, at the up per part of the house, I found these things in a box. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>ISAAC NEWSOP sworn. - I was with the last witness; I know no more of it than he does.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Jackson. Q. When was it that you had the bowl from the prisoner? - A. Friday, the 1st of May; I took it from Mr. Schroeder's on Monday, the 4th.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had the bowl for six years; the person who saw me buy it is dead, and therefore I cannot bring him to prove it; when that bowl was cast. I should think more than that one would have been cast at the same time, and Mr. Jackson ought to be particularly careful before he takes an affidavit to it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him. a good character. <rs id="t18010520-12-verdict65" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Are you responsible for this property? - A. I conceive so, in some respects.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. You have partners, have you not? - A. Yes; but this is a consignment to me only.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the consignment here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the duty of the prisoner to bring cloth for the purpose of mending the bags? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And if they find there is more cloth than is necessary for the business, they carry it back again? - A. Yes; or charge me with it.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came back very willingly, did he not? - A. Yes; he threw himself upon his knees, begged for mercy, and interceded as much as a man could do; I desired he would not make any consession to me with a view of mercy, for I should certainly prosecute him.(Charles Rowley, the constable, produced the property).</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawkes. I cannot swear to the cotton, it is impossible, I saw him pass my window, coming from the premises; I did not see him come out of the door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What is the distance between that window and the premises? - A. Not more than twenty-five yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I stand in a predicament I never was in in my life before; It is worse to me than death to think of it; twenty-two years I have served my King and Country, and been in ten actions; a thing of this kind has been always beneath me. <rs id="t18010520-14-verdict75" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>GEORGE DANIELS sworn. - I am a cabinetmaker: About two months ago, the prisoner brought me this board; I had the board in my possession, but had not an opportunity of taking the prisoner till last Wednesday; the prisoner offered it for sale at my door for eight shillings; I immediately measured the board, and found it contained seven feet of mahogany, worth half-a-crown a foot; I asked the prisoner some questions, where he lived, and how he came by the board; he told me he lived in a court in the Minories; I told him to leave the board with me, and I would enquire and endeavour to learn whether he had obtained it honestly; I stopped the board, and made enquiries, but could hear nothing of him; the prisoner did not apply for the money till after I had given information at Worship-street; he applied for the money when I was in the country, and I had not an opportunity of taking him till the 13th of the present month; he asked me if I was the person belonging to the shop, I told him, yes; I knew him again immediately, and called down one of my men; the prisoner then said, what you mean to keep me then; he then went to the door, looked up, and said, it looks like rain; I told him he had better stop, and see if we could do any thing with the board; he immediately went out of the house, and into a public-house at the corner of the street where I lived; I followed him up Old-street, and pointed him out to the officer; it was with some difficulty that the officer secured him; the officer is not here; I saw him in about two minutes after he was secured; I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MOORE sworn. - I am a headborough belonging to St. Luke's: On the 13th of this month I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner at the bar; I found him at Mr. Daniels's house, in Old-street-road. (The board was produced and identified by Stocks).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is eleven weeks ago since I carried the board to Mr. Daniels; I bought it of a carpenter and cabinet-maker; I did not immediately want it; I kept it some little time, and then I carried it to that gentleman to dispose of it.</p>

               <p>Q.What is the value of them? - A.The full value of them is not more than 1s. or 1s. 2d.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SHAVE sworn. - I am apprentice to Mr. Tweed; I fastened up the shop window on Wednesday, the 27th of April, in the evening, in the usual mode of fastening; my master was the last person up; I was called up by the watchman about two o'clock in the morning, and found the shutter, between the bar and the window, broke; the shutter was not forced at all; I saw the shoes in the watchman's hand; I only know them to be my master's by the look of them.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'CARTY sworn. - I am a watchman: On the 28th of April, about two o'clock in the morning, I was sitting upon a butcher's stall, and heard some glass fall; I stood up, looked round me, and presently heard another piece fall; I looked across the way, and saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Tweed's window; I ran across, and when I was a most half way to the door, the shutter dropped down when the shutter dropped, she rather sell back from the window; I do not think she saw me till I laid hold of her, for I had no light; it was moon-light; she drew forward again towards the window before I laid hold of her; I laid hold of her, and seeing her hand all over blood, I said, good woman, you have been doing a nice job; she said, what did I mean, and asked me if that was Mr. Tweed's house; she said she knew Mr. Tweed very well; she asked me if I did not see three men pass by; I told her I did not; I called the patrol to my assistance, and we called Mr. Tweed up; when I took her to the watch-house, she was searched, and she dropped the bolt of the window,(produces it); there was nothing else found upon her; these shoes were found close to her upon the pavement, but I did not find them upon her, (produces them); here is her own handkerchief, (produces a pocket-handkerchief stained with blood); she pulled cut a shilling, or a sixpence, I cannot say which, and said, here is something for you to drink, and let me go about my business, but we detained her.</p>
               <p>Tweed. I had a great number of little shoes in the window; I believe these to be mine; they have no mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Between twelve and one I was coming home from Stepney-green, and when I got to Mr. Tweed's window, there were three men standing; one of them struck me with the pin of the window, and my hand was very much bruised; I immediately called for the watchman, and then one of the men hit me immediately on the side of the head, and ran away; I took up the pin of the window, and offered to give it to the watchman, but he would not take it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty). Did she call out, watch? - A. No; no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she make you any offer of the pin, and did you refuse it? - A. Not in the least; it drop ped from her at the watch-house.</p>

               <p>RICHARD BOURNE sworn. - I live in the house of Monsieur De Loyade; I was going out to India; I was a pupil of his, and had my boxes at his house; I missed a great number of articles out of my trunk; I had one in my own room, and one in the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she say whether they were brought at different times, or at one time? - A. She did not say; I told her whatever there was she had better give me, and she brought me the bundle from behind the bed; in the same room I found some linen which he claimed.</p>

             at Witney? - A. I know him very well, he lives at a little village near Witney; these blankets were in my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your warehouse connected with the dwelling-house? - A. The dwelling part of the house is over the warehouse: On the 7th of May, I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock; that part of the warehouse was perfectly secure at that time; I got up about a quarter before seven in the morning, and discovered that the second room was broke open; there are four rooms on the lower floor, all of which contained blankets the night before; it was a room next to Arthur-street, the window-frame seemed to be forced in, it laid upon a pile of blankets, about three yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a sash-window, that lifted up and down? - A. No; it was a fastened window, all the glass was broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wood-work broke also? - A. Yes; it was all forced in together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that make such a hole that any man could get in? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the blankets? - A. I cannot say as to that; I don't know what quantity of blankets Mr. Sellman had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. (Counsel for Margetts.) Q. Is the rent of the warehouse paid by Mr. Sellman? - A. The rent is paid by the company, at Witney; it is the dwelling-house only of myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The part of the house that you occupy you pay the rent for of course? - A. No; there is no separate rent paid.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to ascertain whether there is an internal communication from the warehouse up to the house, or only a communication to the street? - A.There is a door-way, or what you call a gate-way; there is a communication from the warehouse to the other part of the house.</p>
               <p>THOMAS ROSE sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Sylvester: On the 7th of May, I secured the warehouses about half past seven o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the warehouses at the time you secured them? - A.These blankets, which I saw at the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that these blankets you saw in Margett's house were in that warehouse over night? - A. They were; the next morning, about seven o'clock, I discovered that the warehouse had been broke open; I found all the shutters up secured as I had left them over night but one, which was unkeyed within-side, which surpized me; I went round the warehouse to let the shutters down, and as soon as I let the shutters down, I saw the win<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200015"/>dow bursted in, and the frame lying, I suppose, three yards from where it was bursted in, it laid upon a bundle of blankets; I informed my master of it, and he went to Worship-street; Armstrong, Ray, and two more officers came, and I went with them to a house No. 6, French-alley; between eighty and ninety yards, or thereabouts, there are some ruins at the back of the warehouse, and French-alley lies at the back across these ruins; the back of Margett's house looks into the ruins.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in that house? - A. The prisoner, Margetts; we found ninety-eight blankets there, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What would be the value of those blankets? - A. Forty pounds; we found all the blankets in one room, but in different parts of the room. (The blankets produced).</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those blankets, and tell us if you know them? - A. I am sure they are the same, they were in the house the night before; I have not doubt at all about it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SELLMAN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a blanket weaver, at Witney: I saw these blanket in Mr. Sylvester's warehouse on the 7th of May, at night; I saw them again the next day at Margett's house, they were the same that were at Mr. Sylevester's the night before; and I have seen some of them to-day; they are the same, I am sure they are the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I understand you contribute towards the rent of this warehouse in town? - A. The master of the company pays it; we are a company of blanket-makers, sixty or more.</p>
               <p>Q. These blankets are sent from the country to be disposed of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Sylvester acts as an agent, or servant for you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Sylvester is answerable to you for the deposit of these goods? - A. If they are lost I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Niether you, nor any of the sixty that you speak of, ever slept in that house? - A.I never did.</p>
               <p>WIILIAM HUMPHREYS sworn. - Q.Do you produce any thing? - A. There was a ticket I wrote put upon the blancket, and one of the officers shewed me the same ticket again at Margett's house; I shall know the ticket when it is produced, Masou has got it; I had seen the blankets over night in the warehouse, and I saw the same blankets again at Margett's.</p>
               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Worship-street: On Friday the 8th of May, I went to Margett's house, I believe it might be a quarter, or twenty minutes, after ten o'clock, I had before been at Mr. Sylvester's house and seen the window broke in; I then went to No. 6, French-alley, and knocked at the door, softly, the woman prisoner came and unlocked the door, and Ray and I got in; Mason and Vickery were gone round, Mason to the side, and Vickery to the back part of the house; she said, yes, he was; she then opened a side-door, there is a passage that leads into the lower room; I went in, and there was Hall and Bowman sitting on one side of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Hall before? - A. Yes, I did; and I have seen Bowman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knwo Margett's? - A. I have seen him, but I don't know him so well as the others; Margett's was sitting in a chair the opposite side of the room; I then went up one pair of stairs, and on the tester of a bed laid this house-pistol. with the handle outside, I drew three slugs out of it, it was prined; in that room I found all the blankets that are now here; I then observed the prisoner, Bowman and Margetts, their clothes were all over covered with blanket-wool, as if they had been carrying blanckets; on Hall's coat there was not that appearance, but across his shoulders there was a parcel of white.</p>

               <p>Hall. I was sitting against a white wall at the time.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. It appeared to me as if he had been getting through a hole, or it might be sitting against a white wall; I then searched a cupboard in the room where the prisoners were, upon the ground-floor, where I found these three crows, and these three picklock keys, and two other pistols, loaded with ball, and primed, a dark-lantern, and a bottle of phosphorus; and in the same room a centre-bit. I then went up stairs into the garret, and in this bag were those twenty eight picklock-keys, and a ripping chisel, (producing them); the prisoners were then secured and brought to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass that was material? - A. Margetts said he had no lodgers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. (Counsel for Hall and Bowman.) Q. Hall and Bowman do not live in this house? - A. I do not know; I found them there, and the door locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Margetts keeps the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had these men's coats the appearance of any thing more than a poor man's coat would naturally have from laying it upon his coverlid? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with Hall and Bowman? - A. I don't think I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Hall say to you when you came into the house? - A. I believe Hall said, it was unlucky for him that he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to Hall's lodgings afterwards? - A. Yes; I went to where he said he lodged, but I found nothing there.</p>
               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was with Armstrong: I went up stairs after the prisoners were secured, and I saw the blankets in the room; then I went up stairs into the workshop, it appeared to have been a silversmith's shop;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200016"/>I went to the fire-place, there was no grate fixed, but with a stick I tried the bricks, and found one of them move; I immediately took the brick out, and put in my arm as far as I could, and found this horse pistol, and a great number of keys, some of them picklock keys; and these picklock keys, in this bag, I found lying upon the work-bench; two of them appear to be quite new, just made.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that either of the prisoners said any thing at the time they were apprehended? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them before? - A. Yes, I knew Hall very well; I did not know Margetts; I had seen Bowman; I afterwards went to Hall's lodgings, and found a jacket and a brush lying close by it; Margetts and Bowman's coats were very much covered with blanket wool; Hall's coat upon the shoulders was covered with white.</p>
               <p>PETER MASON sworn. - I am one of the officers belonging to Worship-street; I went with Armstrong and Ray, to No. 6, French-alley; in the room below, where the prisoners were sitting, I found a bit of paper. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Humphreys. This is the paper that was put upon the blankets; it is my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Sellman. This is the paper that I put upon the blankets; the top of it is my writing, and the other is Humphreys's; he is my nephew.</p>
               <p>Mason. Hall and Bowman's coats were covered with wool, the same as mine is now I have been carrying the blankets; the same day, I went with Vickery to Bowman's lodgings, and there I found a dark lantern, two centre bits, a small crow, several keys, two latch keys, a spike gimblet, a spring-saw, and a key that is partly manufactured into a skeleton key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Do you not know that he is a carpenter or chair-maker? - A. I saw some chairs in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not these instruments necessary in the business of a carpenter or chair-maker? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Were the men standing still, or walking? - A. Two of them were walking, they passed me, as I passed them; the other was standing still a little further on, in the court, quite close to the warehouse.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gleed followed on the same side.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Sylvester.) Q. Are you a married man? - A. Yes, and have seven children.</p>
               <p>Q. And a servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they all live in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200017"/>Q. The lease of this house is in the Company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. They pay you a consideration for your agency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And part of that consideration is the house you live in? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Baron Graham. If hereafter any doubt should occur upon the reconsideration of this subject, the prisoners shall have the benefit of that doubt, but, at present, as far as my own judgment will guide me, I am clearly of opinion, for the purpose of sustaining such a prosecution as this, that this is certainly the dwelling house of Sylvester; for though true it is the rent is paid by this Company in the country, and though it is persently true they have a lease of this house, yet it would be quite perverting the use of common language, to say this is the dwelling-house of the Company, because, most evidently, the only use the Company make of this house is, for the purpose of furnishing a dwelling to their agent, and a warehouse for the commodities there deposited; that being the case, it strikes me as precisely the same thing, as if they paid Sylvester as much more as the rent of the house would amount to, and he, in point of fact, paid the rent; but the bargain happens to take another shape; they prefer paying the rent, and giving him and his family a dwelling towards that salary which he was to receive from them; it strikes me, therefore, that it is essentially and truly the dwelling-house of the person who, with his family, occupied the house, and that certainly comes within the law of burglary; for it would be absurd to suppose that that terror, which is of the essence of the crime, can be carried to Witney, in Oxfordshire; I shall, therefore, leave it to the Jury with this provision, that if my brothers should entertain any doubt about it, I will put it into a state of further adjudication.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose I am of opinion, it is absolutely necessary to justice, that this house should be considered, in point of law, as the house of Sylvester, but if, for any reason hereafter, we should be induced to doubt, it will be perfectly right there should be another indictment, for the country are extremely interested in such a case as this being brought before a Jury. I wish to know whether it has not happened in this place that a prosecution has been commenced for a burglary, in breaking open some of the halls in this city, in which, undoubtedly, the Corporation do not live, but in which their clerks generally live.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. My father, as your Lordship knows, was clerk to the Haberdashers' Company, which was broke open, and there the Court held it to be for that purpose my father's house.</p>
               <p>Margett's defence. I am innocent of the crime; a ledger, of the name of Joues, who had left my lodgings the night before, came to me, and said he was under disagreeable circumstances, he expected an execution in his house, and wished me to let him bring these things in; he left them between four and five in the morning, and said he would take them away at dusk, and while I was at breakfast, the officers came; I am a silversmith by trade.</p>
               <p>Hall's defence. I am totally innocent of the robbery; I called for a box that he had to mend.</p>
               <p>Bowman's defence. I went to Margetts's to fetch a table to mend, and while I was there, the officers came and took me.</p>
               <p>Margetts called three, and Bowman four, witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What Magistrate was it? - A. I do not know,(produces a paper); I understood he was a new Magistrate on the bench; they put the trail off from time to time, and I attended the Court here two Sessions; I saw him every time that I came here.</p>

After Mr. Scott had me in custody, they left me in the tap-room, and went into the parlour; I staid, and the constable said, Mr. Scott and I have fettled it, but you must give Mr. Scott half-a-guinea; I said I could not think of doing that, as I was innocent; then Mr. Scott said, if I would not give him the money, he would prosecute me; upon that I was taken before the Magistrate, and committed to Clerkenwell, where I was bailed out; Mr. Scott then wanted to make it up for five pounds, he would not take less than five pounds; and I have a witness here now, that carried all the money that I could raise, and he said that would not do; the Sunday following, there came a man from Mr. Scott to Thomas Frost's, the place appointed to know what I could raise; I told him I could not raise five pounds; Mr. Scott said, give me the money you have got, and I will go to Mr. Scott, and see if I cannot settle it without any further trouble, I think Mr. Scott will take it of me; he said he was obliged to pay the whole money when he stole a pig, and he would not take less than the whole of me.</p>

Gordon; I think that was his expression; he said he would go there, or wherever I pleased; he was upon the run when I came up to him, as well as he could with so large a piece of beef upon his shoulder; I suffered him to proceed, not knowing what piece of beef it was that was lost; about three quarters of an hour afterwards, I went with the journeyman in search of the prisoner, and found him in Cow-cross; I then asked him to go to Islington, where he described that he was going; he went along with us a few yards, seemingly contented, and then several times attempted to make his escape; he got away, and I pursued him, and saw him taken by a constable, I never lost fight of him; the boy was shewn into two rooms, and very much cautioned, and then he came into a dark room, where the prisoner was, he immediately said, that is the man that stole the beef; the prisoner said he was not, and used very abusive language.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see neither of the prisoners take it at all? - A. No; I had a suspicion from seeing then cloaks entangled.</p>

               <p>Q. She put the child upon the counter, did not she? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that she put the child upon the counter, and that was the way she drew the print off the counter? - A. No; she had the child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if she had her arms occupied with the child, as she has now, how could she have taken it? - A.I cannot say how that was.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were serving in the shop? - A. One, besides Mr. Tuther.</p>
               <p>Q. And neither of them are here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>COBBY SALTER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I went with Mr. Fraser, on Saturday, the 2d of May, about eight in the evening, to a butcher's shop in Grazier's-alley, Wellclose-square; then we went to Mr. Marsh's, a public-house, in <placeName id="t18010520-38-crimeloc204">Wellclose square</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you know him? - A. No; he told me his name was Smith; then we set down, and had a pint of beer; Fraser took out his watch to see what o'clock it was, Levy then made a snatch at the watch; seeing that, I took Fraser's watch from him, to take care of it, and put it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Fraser sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. Yes; I very often had his watch, he is my nephew, we missed our piece of meat, and we stayed near about half an hour; Levy was in the house all that time; Fraser and I went out of the house together, and at the end of Wellclose-square, there is a lamp, where we fell in with Burk and Levy, that was about ten minutes after we came out; Levy clapped Fraser on the shoulder, and said, so you are going home; upon that, he said they were going our way, and they would see us part of the way home; then we all went together along Ratcliff-highway to the corner of St. John's-hill, where we were going to turn down; directly upon turning the hill, I had the watch in my hand in my pocket; it was wrenched out of my hand; I struggled as long as I could, and the glass was broke; it was either Burk or Levy, I do not know which; there was nobody else near; upon that I screamed, murder, saying, Fraser, your watch is lost; he was about three or four yards before me, he walked faster than me; upon that, they both stew, they were gone in a moment; I have never found the watch since; on Monday morning, between twelve and one, I went to the Magistrate, and the prisoners were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt at all that the two prisoners were the persons who were in the public-house, and were afterwards with you at the corner of the hill? - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You went to this public-house, after having been at the butcher's, and had a glass at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the first you had had that day? - A. I had had nothing before I went in, without it was a little porter in the course of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no liquor in the course of that day?</p>
               <p>- A. If I had been drunk. I should not have remembered these particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were quite sober? - A. I was sober and sensible; I knew what I was about.</p>
               <p>Q. At the public-house you had gin and beer?</p>
               <p>- A. A glass of gin, and three pints of beer; and three or four drank of that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you stop there? - A. About an hour, or an hour and a half; I had missed my meat.</p>
               <p>Q. You were an orderly good kind of woman; were you not rather noisy? - A. I was merry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you sing a song or two? - A. I might sing a few verses of a song.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not so noisy and drunk, that the landlord would not draw you any more? - A. He was going to shut up; it was twelve o'clock, or between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, if you will not, I will go to

               <p>Q. Then with great difficulty you got fifteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200026"/>yards in ten minutes? - A. It might be thereabouts.</p>

               <p>Q. You, yourself, employed an attorney? - A. Mr. Fraser did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that? - A. There is an attorney employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he is employed by either of you? - A. I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath is he not employed by the Police officers to get the reward? - A. I suppose I must pay him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that Burk was present at the corner of the hill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear before the Magistrate that he was one of the two persons at Marsh's? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear it as positively as before?</p>
               <p>Court. It is too bad, she swore before the Magistrate that she was not certain that Burk was one of the men in Wellclose-square; this is the way in which counties are endeavoured to be robbed of their money by rewards; there is no doubt but the attorney has been employed for the purpose of obtaining. 80l. reward.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. All hot bread, marked with an iron W, would be the same as that? - A. Yes, but I never saw an iron marker before.</p>
               <p>Q. But other bakers may have iron W's? - A. They may, but I never saw one.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street: On the 25th of last month the prosecutor came to me; I went with him to his house: I went down into the cellar with the prisoner, I wanted to look into his box; he said, I should not; I told him I had got a search-warrant, and I would break it open; then he told Mr. Ross some of his property was in his box, an begged for mercy, for God's sake; he said, if he sent him to jail, he would transport him; Mr. Ross said, he was taking every step to get him into a jail, robbing him every day; then I again desired him to open his box; he took the key out of his pocket to try to open it, but he could not open it; I took the key from him, and I could not open it; Wright, the witness, got a picklock, and opened it; I found in it five half-quartern loaves, and four sixpenny loaves, all new bread, it was not warm, and seemed to me to have been baked the night before; this was about two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you quite clear in your recollection that the bread was not warm? - A. I don't think it was warm, it might, because I only just handed it out of the box; I think it had been baked the night before; he said he was going to take it to his wife and family, because he was to leave his place that night; I then took him to the office, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The key produced by the prisoner did not open the box, but you were obliged to resort to a picklock? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether it was warm or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by adding that it appeared to you to be baked the night before, it could not be warm then? - A. I mean that it might have been taken out of the oven about four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it when you went to Ross's? - A. About two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. That was time enough for it to have cooled? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS WRIGHT sworn. - On the 25th of April last Mr. Ross desired me to come to his house; I found a constable there; the prisoner was in the bake-house; I went down stairs, and I was desired to open the lock, which I did, with a picklock that we use in our business; I found in the trunk five half-quartern loaves and four cakes; Kennedy took out the loaves, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am as innocent of the cause for which I stand here, as any body need to be; the Monday before my master and I had some words about a batch of bread, and he said, you villain, I will six you, you have got bread in your box, you carry bread out in your pockets; he said, you villain, I have put you in trust, and you are robbing me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him an excellent character. <rs id="t18010520-43-verdict233" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Serjeant, next door to Mr. Thomas's; I sleep in the summer-house: I was alarmed between eleven and twelve o'clock at night on the 11th of May, I was half undressed, going to-bed, that there was somebody getting over the fence; I heard first of all a lock or a latch list up; then I went up to the fence, where I thought I heard it, and then I stopped about five minutes; it is a fence between the walk and Mr. Thomas's garden; I saw the prisoner get in at the window of the summer-house; as soon as he got in he struck a light, and brought a tumbler and teaboard, and put them over the pales, and then he got over the pales back again into the next garden, and then he got on the top of the fence to get over the walk back again, and then he saw me; he ran back again down the garden, and over a wall, into a place where there was no thoroughfare; I went round about sixty yards, and stopped him at the corner; I took him to the watch-house, and gave the property to the watchman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Cliston. Q. This was a very dark night, was it not? - A. No, it was a very light night; it was not moon-light, but it was star-light.</p>

               <p>Q. You were within a dozen yards of him, saw him go in at the window, and did not attempt to stop him? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Who is that woman? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the solemn oath you have taken, did you take that handkerchief out of your bosom, and put it into the man's pocket? - A. No; I will be upon my solemn oath I took it out of the man's pocket; the officer has the property.</p>

               <p>Did you follow up that accusation, by taking him up before any justice of the Peace? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that charge was it before you made this charge, and got the present warrant? - A. That was on Monday, the 11th, and on the 14th I took him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the 11th to the 14th you did not make any complaint before any Justice? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make this complaint till after he had, by his attorney, served you with a writ for defamation? - A. I did not mean to hurt him, because I could not swear to the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you served with a writ, at the suit of the defendant, for defamation? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any charge, before any Justice, till after that writ was served? - A. No.</p>

               <p>EDWARD SMITH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I searched the prisoner's boxes; I found in one of the boxes this piece of cotton, (produces it); and this piece of list, (produces it); the prisoner came in while I was there, with the keys, and unlocked them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the prisoner did not hang back at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not shew any unwillingness? - A. Not the least; but said, you villain, I have none of your property, you may search.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the handkerchief? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you order the other witness to search his pockets? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Did you observe him when he put his hands in his pocket? - A. After I had searched the room, he requested me to search the prisoner, which I did; while I was searching the prisoner, the prosecutor came with a coat which was hanging behind the door, he came with it upon his arm, and I heard him exclaim, you d - d villain, you have robbed me of my handkerchief; I immediately looked round, and saw the prosecutor's hand coming out of the pocket, with a bit of blue paper, and this handkerchief in it, folded up, I presume in so small a compass as this, (produces it); he desired I would take charge of him; I told him I had got charge of him, and I took him before the Magistrate; there was a woman standing in the room at the same time, her name is Ann Smith.</p>
               <p>Court. As she was present, I shall call her as one of the witnesses for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did not Ann Smith charge the prosecutor with putting the handkerchief into the coat pocket of the prisoner? - A. yes; I heard her say, I saw you take that from your besom, and put it into the coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been ill, I understand? - A. Yes, I have for the last three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any inducement held out to you, by the prosecutor, to appear here, and he would do any thing for you? - A. He desired me to attend here, and if I was not well, he would send me into the country; when the prosecutor said, there is a silk handkerchief, the prisoner said, then you villain, you must have put it there, for the coat has been hanging there for a month.</p>
               <p>Court. Nothing is so improbable as that a man should steal that which is the only thing that could convince him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is very important to the prisoner that his whole case should be heard.</p>
               <p>Jury. We wish to have the woman examined.</p>
               <p>ANN SMITH sworn, - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the officer coming to search his apartments? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what you observed? - A. I went up when the prisoner went up; he took the keys out of his pocket and unlocked his boxes; the officer listed the lids of the boxes up; the officer then bid Mr. Jacob look and stand by him, and he came immediately and put his hands into the boxes and would search himself; there was nothing in that box; the next box he listed up the lid, and the officer said, do give me leave to excuse my duty myself; Mr. Jacob would not give the officer leave to execute his duty, but would do it for him, and be pulled out a bit of list, and a bit of fag end of cotton, and swore that was his property; there were two boxes in the room that belonged to the gentlewoman of the house, which had been left for rent; Mrs. Minton gave the officer leave to break them open, and told him he might search all her house without a search-warrant; the officer forced the boxes open, upon which Mr. Jacob took a pair of pantaloons from the back of the door, and searched them; then he took a great coat and searched it, and hung it up again; immediately the officer came and took hold of Price to search his pockets, which he had on his back; then Mr. Jacob took down this coat again, and put his hand to his bosom and took out something in a blue paper; he cried out, d-n your eyes you bl - y thief, here is my property, my handkerchief, before he opened the paper to see what was in it; upon that I called out immediately, you are putting that into the man's pocket you wicked man; upon which the officer turned round and all of them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Smith). Did you hear the woman? - A. I heard her say something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Court. I think we have gone too far already.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I wish to state, in the hearing of the Court, that I have persons of the greatest respectability in the trade, who would have told you that these are perquisites.</p>
               <p>The Court, the Counsel on both sides, and the Jury, expressed their abhorrence of the prosecution, and stated that they were perfectly satisfied of the prisoner's innocence. <rs id="t18010520-45-verdict243" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Was the stable close to the house? - A. Yes; after I had put up my horses I went in to eat my supper, and did not go back any more that night; my fellow-servant, the groom, slept in the stable; the next morning I missed my trunk, containing my leather breeches and great coats; I found the leather breeches the next day at Marlborough-street.</p>

No, I did not; the next morning, Mrs. Hayes sent the pearl earrings, and the pearl drops to Mrs. Hinton, which she returned again in a few minutes, saying, none of them would suit her; them Mrs. Hinton came to our house soon after, she was looking the goods over upon my mistress's knee, in the bar, but whether she said any thing, I do not know.</p>

This handkerchief has had my name marked in it, and it has been cut out; here is a hole that was in it when it was new, and is darned up; I know this garnet, there were twenty-seven of them in the trunk, loose in a paper, they formed a necklace, intermixed with rose diamonds, I putted it to pieces and took away the rose diamonds, I have not the smallest doubt of its being mine; this Spanish coin I believe to have been among mine, I had six or eight of them; there are more of the same sort but I believe it to be mine;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200035"/>there is a hole through it, and I had one with a hole through it; I brought it with me from Jamaica, where I was an inhabitant nineteen years; the marks upon this piece of cambric have been torn off, but I can swear pretty certainly that it is my cambric, by the quality; it is not a piece such as are sold in the shops here, I bought it at Amsterdam; this is in the raw state as it came from the bleach; when it is done up, and calendered for the shops, it is put up in squarres; I have here the table-cloth that belongs to these napkins, I bought them together at Amsterdam.(Miss

               <p>Hughes's defence. I went in to purchase half a yard of calico, there was some in the window marked eleven-pence a yard; when I went in they said they had none under fourteen-pence a yard, and I came out again; I stopped to look at the window as any body else might, and then I went away; I know nothing about the cotton.</p>

               <p>Clarke's defence. I know nothing of it; I picked up the cotton upon the kisb-stone, and went away about my business, I did not know who it belonged to; this girl is as innocent as the child unborn, I never saw-her before.</p>

(Produces it); the acceptance is in red ink; I hesitated some time before I took it, at last I told the prisoner I had not the difference in cash, but I would send it to him the next morning; he said he must have it directly, for he was ordered away to Portsmouth, and must go away the next morning by four o'clock; I still hesitated, but at length I gave him six pounds in Bank-notes, and a check for six pounds three shillings and eight-pence, upon Sir Robert Herries, who is my banker; he then went away, but gave me a direction to No. 6, Cavendish-square; I sent my shopman, Nettleship, up to Cavendish-square the moment he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. No; the next morning I sent my son to Mr. Bond's, the bankers, he is not here; I called some time afterwards, I cannot say when, and they disavowed the acceptance, and refused to pay the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you endorsed it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I suppose you have taken no great pains to inquire whether there are any other persons of that firm? - A. I have looked at the list of bankers, and I have asked several people, but I have not heard of any others; I inquired of Mr. Pattisall, acting clerk in Messrs. Bond's house; I made great search after the prisoner, and he was apprehended about fourteen days ago, from information that I had received that he went into the Swan, in Paradise-row, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you take a constable with you? - A. No; I did not consider him as a felon, and therefore I thought it not necessary; I did not find him then; I gave information round Chelsea, being pretty well known there, and he was apprehended by a soldier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Nettleship is not here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. And you thought it prudent to commit a burglary with a man you never saw before? - A. He was recommended by them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. There was only one person with Coleman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes, and he ran away.</p>

               <p>Harvey. This is the sort of sugar that I lost; I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton. (To Chapman.) Q. This is a common lodging-house, is it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The room door was open, any body might have gone in? - A. No, it was locked; I broke it open, there was nobody there; I apprehended him about three weeks afterwards, and found upon him eleven papers of tobacco, two nutmegs, and a small bag of coffee.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BALLARD sworn. - I am a patrol of St. Andrew's: About three o'clock on the 19th of March, my partner, Hunt, and I, were going down Holborn, when a fire broke out in Baldwin's-place, Baldwin's-gardens; my partner was going on before to see where the fire was, when he sell in with Coleman, and I met him bringing Coleman back; I took the sugar, and carried it to the watch-house; that is all I know.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS KINNERSLEY sworn. - I am patrole of the Ward of Portsoken; I was present when the prisoner was searched; I afterwards found this hat in Myers's room, the prisoner said it was his.(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>- ISAACS sworn. - I live in the same house with Mr. Myers; I heard a noise and I ran down stairs; I heard them say, we have got him; I saw the watchman had hold of him by the collar as he was going to the watch-house; I saw him take some money out of his mouth, and some out of his pocket, and put it inside of his breeches, the money dropped out of his knees; I then went away.</p>
               <p>LEAH MYERS sworn. - I can swear to this handkerchief, there is not such another in London, it was given me by a gentleman, who is a printer, and it would not take the print, it is joined in several places; I am sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This bill is for two pair of boots of mine that came home the morning before; here are two shillings and a half-crown that I can speak to; I am sure I had them in my pocket; the half-crown had been refused a great many times.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I was taken to the watch-house, the prosecutor said, I had got his money; he told the officer of the night I had cut his leg, and the officer looked at it, and said, it was no cut, it was a bruise; I said it was very improper that the prosecutor should see my money, but that he should describe the marks upon it, and the constable of the night directly shewed him my money, and then he swore to the marks.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. What may be the value of the eight shirts? - A. Forty-shillings; I went to the Poultry Compter to her and begged of her to tell me where the other things were; I found nothing at her lodgings; I went again to her, and upon her person found seventy-one duplicates concealed between her stays and her body; I then went to ten different pawnbrokers; I delivered the duplicates to the constable; the pawnbrokers were all summoned before the Lord Mayor; but not one of them attended.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Hart. Q. How many times was she taking these things? - A. I saw her take the check shirts twice, and the white ones once.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you interpose when you saw her take the two jackets? - A. I did not think it proper.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you wished to wait till she should commit a capital offence, that you might hang this woman? - A. I wished to see that she was a thief.</p>

Fownes and Scott, with the saddle on; when I came out I missed my horse; that was about a quarter past two; I saw it again on Wednesday night, about nine o'clock, at Mr. Minton's, Tothill-fields; he is a horse slaughterer; he was tacked up in a stable, and served with hay; I knew the horse again immediately; it had a white spot between the knee and shoulder, the inner foot white behind, bald faced and had a nervous humour upon him; I have had the horse near two years; it was a black gelding; I took him home on the Thursday; I found my own bridle at Mr. Minton's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long did you stay in the house before you came out and missed your horse? - A. It might be an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten your horse up? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out of the house yourself from the time you first went in till you came out and missed the horse? - A. Yes; I had been out about ten minutes before I missed him; a lady wanted me to unhang him, that she might pass, and I did not hang him again; I did not hang him at first, somebody else did; I never do myself.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse was across the pavement, and incommoded the lady's passage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you left him in a loose, unprotected state? - A. I threw my bridle over his neck and left him; he never left me before.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the horse did not stray? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Wardour-street is not a very broad street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then two carriages coming together would very likely cause the horse to move? - A. It might.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was not the prisoner's defence, before the Magistrate, that the horse had strayed? - A. I do not remember any such thing; I believe he did say he had found the horse.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARROW sworn. - I am a horse-slaughterer: On Monday, the 13th of April, the prisoner came to me to sell a horse, about four o'clock in the afternoon; he told me the horse was at the livery-stable, and if I would go with him he would sell it me for a guinea and a half; upon that I went with the man to the White Horse, in the Broad-way, Westminster; the horse was shewn me; upon looking at it, I thought the horse was too good for slaughter, and at too low a price; upon which I told him, if he would give an account where he got the horse, I would give him twice that money for him; he then told me he bought it of a man at Paddington; that he gave twenty-five shillings for it; upon which I had him taken into custody, and advertised the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the horse? - A. About ten guineas; on Wednesday night the prosecutor owned the horse, and had it the next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did he not say that he found the horse, that it was a strayed horse? - A. No; he told me that he had bought the horse.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HARLEY sworn. - I am a constable; Mr. Minton sent for me to take the prisoner into custody; I searched him, and found some duplicates upon it; he was taken before the Magistrate and committed.</p>
               <p>RICHARD MINTON sworn. - I am a horse-slaughterer, in Tothill-fields; Barrow is my servant; the prisoner came to my house, and said he had a horse to sell; Barrow and I both went to see the horse, at the White Horse, Broad-way, Westminster; he ordered the ostler to bring the horse out of the stable; he asked a guinea and a half for it; he was as well dressed as any trademan need to be; I asked him how he came by the horse; he said he bought it of a man at Paddington; I told him it was a stolen horse, and he should not take it away; I sent for a constable and had him detained; he gave the same account before the Magistrate, that he had bought the horse, but did not say where; the horse was a very useful horse, a very good tradesman's horse, about six years old.</p>
               <p>Q. What might the value of it be? - A. The horse might be worth ten or twelve pounds.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see so much of the face of the person who was buckling his shoe, as to be able to know him again? - A. I am almost certain that the prisoner, Hainson, was the man; Coleman had left me about two months; he had never slept in the house, but has worked in the house, and knew more of the f stenings and method of the house than any of the forty I employ.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you the last person that was up the night before this happened? - A. I am not able to recollect it, being six months since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you fasten up the house yourself? - A. I cannot at this time take upon myself to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Coleman is admitted an evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, you saw a person at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you nearer to that person at any time than fifteen feet? - A. Yes, I was within ten feet, and then I saw his face distinctly.</p>
               <p>PHILIP COLEMAN sworn. - Q. Are you the witness that was in the box yesterday? - A. Yes; I was originally a seafaring man: In the morning, about half past five o'clock, I cannot say what day of the month it was, nor the day of the week, it was in December, I met Green and Hainson at a public-house in Drury-lane, from thence we went to Mr. Ramiden's, in Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Burge). Is your house Mr. Ramlden? - A. It was Mr. Ramlden's, it is now mine, he is dead.</p>
               <p>Coleman. I worked for Mr. Ramsden two months; Burge carried on the business then; we did not get there till after six o'clock; the street door was always upon the latch for the workmen to go in; Green and I proceeded from thence through the passage into the kitchen, and left Hainson at the door; we broke open the kitchen door; there were two drawers in the dresser that we broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then? - A. No, it was dark; we took the sheeting and what linen and wearing apparel there was, some candlesticks, and three mahogany barometer frames; we put the things into a bag, and came to Hainson at the door, then we took them to Green's lodgings, and left them; from thence we went to refresh ourselves at a public-house in the Strand, near Southampton-street; I stopped at the door to make water, and Green and Hainson went in; while I was there, Green came out with a copper can in his hand, which might hold two gallons or more, and told me to come along; we left Hainson in a public-house; when I got a few yards from there, Mr. Pearce and Mr. Hill were close behind me, two gentlemen belonging to Mr. Burge's shop; Mr. Purce came up to me in Exeter-street, and spoke to me; Green went on, and left me; then Mr. Pearce went with me to my mother's; I told him I had slept there all night; he left me, and went home again; I went to my lodgings in Drury-lane, and Green and Hainson came to me, and told me they had sold the property to Mrs. Hayes, in Long-lane; they gave me thirteen or fourteen shillings, or some where thereabouts; some of the things are here.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to this house together? - A. We had been there several times before, but there was always somebody in the way till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told them where to go? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you were the first planner of this business? - A. No, I was not, because they wanted to know of me where I had worked.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell them any thing about your master's house? - A. Yes, I told them how to get in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been a voyage to Botany Bay? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Not as a convict, was it? - A. No, I went two voyages to Botany Bay as a sailor.</p>
               <p>Q. You never were convicted? - A. No, I never was a convict.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. But you gave them information how to rob your master's house, and you shared the plunder? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you know that man again? - A. I think I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners? - A. That is the man, Green; when they had got some little distance up the court, Coleman looked back, and then I went on; we followed them into Exeter-street, at a convenient distance behind them; then Coleman left Green, and returned back towards Denmark-court; consequently he met me, and the other man went on; I asked him where he was going, and then I left him, to find Mr. Hill, that we might go together to find out the person we were first sent to look for; then we returned home again.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know Mrs. Hayes? - A. I had been there before with Hainson; Hainson and Green both told me they had sold these things to Mrs. Hayes, in Long-lane; she talked at that time of removing to a public-house; when I was at Hayes's I was there with Green's wife and Hainson to procure money to pay Green's fees here at the Old-Bailey.</p>
               <p>Burge. I know these candlesticks to be mine; one of them has been mended by a screw by one of our workmen fourteen years since; I can swear they are my property; I have been in the habit of seeing them more than thirty years.</p>

               <p>Q. This gutter runs between the two houses? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bevil. Q. What number is this first house you speak of? - A. There is no number; the two houses are situated in a garden.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a gutter fastened on one side to one set of rafters, and on the other to another set of rafters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was turned up on one side, and not on the other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then still the whole body of the lead was fastened to the house? - A. Yes.</p>

Yes, I had seen them about on the 27th of April; I saw them upon the top of Mr. Clifton's house in the gutter; there are four ridges to the two houses; they were in that gutter that separated the two ridges of the furthermost house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see them do? - A. I saw them break in the shutter of the first of the two houses, and go in; I am sure it was the prisoners at the bar, for I stopped and saw them get up at the top of the house, and then they climbed over from the first to the second; I saw them taking the tiles off, and placing them upon the roof; then I saw them fold the lead over from the side of the gutter; I then gave an alarm to

             came down, and with the assistance of John Prince I secured him; I left a person waiting at the house while I took them to the watch-house; upon my return, I went up, and found the gutter, between the two ridges of the first house, gone entirely, but that was gone two days before; I climbed over the roof to the second gutter, and there I found the lead wrenched up, and doubled over all along the ridge on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. So that in order to take away the whole of the lead they must have ripped up the other side? - A. Yes; they had taken off the tiles and had begun that; I am sure the prisoners are the men.</p>

               <p>Q. In ready money contracts you deduct a discount? - A. Yes; we took him off two and a half per cent for ready money.</p>
               <p>Q. After having deducted that discount, what was the amount of the goods that he chose? - A. Twenty-seven pounds nineteen shillings; when I told him the amount, he looked in his pocket-book, and said, he had but fifteen pounds in Bank-notes, and therefore he should be obliged to us to send these to No. 22, New-street, Bishopsgate-street, agreeable to a written direction which he gave me,(produces it); he desired them to be taken precisely at seven o'clock in the evening; I took them within a few minutes of the hour appointed; I found the prisoner there, and delivered the goods,</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about his person? - A. I am certain of his person; I delivered the goods upon the table; I directly opened the parcel of goods, and desired him to see if they corresponded with the bill of parcels, which I presented him at the same time.

(The bill produced by Mr. Beckley).</p>
               <p>Mackereth. This is the bill; which I took; it is drawn for twenty-seven pounds ten shillings; he made up the difference, by giving me nine shillings in money; after some conversation, I asked him who Mr. Elvy was, that it appeared to be drawn upon; he told me he was clerk in the house of Moreau and Company, merchants in Barking church-yard; he gave me a great many assurances of the certainty of its being paid: under these circumstances I was induced to take it; I went home, I shewed the bill to Mr. Kirkby, and he was dissatisfied with the bill; in consequence of which, I was sent to make enquiries about Moreau and Company, and also Robert Elvy, whom it was drawn upon; I went into the neighbourhood of Barking church-yard, and Tower-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to go to Barkin churchyard? - A. I looked round the church-yard, and found Maurier and Company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find such a person as Robert Elvy at Moreau's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make diligent enquiries all over that neighbourhood? - A. I did; when the bill became due, I enquired of Henry Hart, No. 22, New-street; I went several times after the bill was presented, but he was always denied; I called, I dare say, twenty times, but could not find him; I left word that I had called, and my business.</p>
               <p>Q.How and where did you at last find him? - A. I think the 24th of February, in a house with which the back-door of No 22 communicates.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. When you enquired at this house in Barking Church-yard, did you not hear of Mr. Robert Elvy coming there? - A. I never could find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of such a person as Robert Elvy there? - A. I enquired of the servantmaid, and she said she believed there was such a person, but she had nothing to do in the accompting-house, there was no such person then in the way, but if I would call the next morning, I might be informed about it in the accomting-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you enquired at New-street for the prisoner, were you not told that he was upon his ordinary business at Gravesend? - A. Yes, or Chatham, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Did you call afterwards at the accompting-house, and did you then hear of such a person as Robert Elvy? - A. I never could find any body in the accompting-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this; did you ever present that bill for payment at Barking church-yard? - A. I presented it the day it was due, the 30th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. At the house where it is directed? - A. No; at the house of Maurier and Company; when I enquired, they told me there was a man put in only to give answers; he told me if I would leave the address where it laid, it would be taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask of him if there was any house of Morean and Co. in that church-yard? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make enquiries of any body else? - A. I made no such enquiries: Mr. Mackereth had been before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When a bill is made payable to a particular place, and the person not at home, the usage is to leave the address where it lies, is not that the course of fair trade? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you get either money or goods? - A. No; the reason assigned to me was, that he was gone to Gravesend the preceding night; I was once informed he was at Gravesend, another time at Chatham, and another time they believed he would come to town; but I never could find him.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that where Elvy lived, do you mean? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the stock-broker lived who employed him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know where Elvy did his business? - A. Elvy transacted some business, I believe, but what business I cannot say, in Barking church yard; I have come over with him sometimes from Walworth to that house in Barking church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Elvy write the acceptance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him write the name of Moreau, too, did not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the name of Moreau? - A. I wrote it, by Elvy's direction.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Write your own name now upon a piece of paper? - A. Never having been in a Court of Justice before, I am very much agitated.</p>
               <p>Court. We will make allowance for that. (The witness wrote his name, which was handed to the Bench).</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. It is certainly the same handwriting. Gentleman, we will admit it.</p>
               <p>Q. You attended before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell his Lordship what you have been telling us to-day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. As near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. It was taken down in writing, was it? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Newman take it down? - A. I don't know whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it? - A. I cannot say the day nor the month.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell us the month? - A. I suppose about eight or ten weeks back, but I cannot take upon myself to say.</p>
               <p>ALEXANDER BADDEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I have been in the seasaring line; I came home just before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Hart, the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Elvy? - A. Perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in company with Elvy and Hart together last winter? - A. Yes, several nights.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them together at the George. George-yard, Snow-hill? - A. Yes, and no where else.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any particular transaction that passed between them? - A. There was a bill drawn, which one Price drew the body of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Hart live? - A. No. 22, New-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his family reside there with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does his family continue to reside there? - A. They do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Elvy do any thing to that bill? - A. I saw him accept it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill; have you a sufficient recollection of the bill to say if that is the bill? - A. That is the bill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Where does Elvy live? - A. I do not know where he lived, but the bill was addressed, Barking church-yard; I have endeavoured to find him out, but have not been able.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the seafaring line, what are you now? - A. I live upon what I got when I was at sea, and I am looking out for a situation.</p>
               <p>Q. What ship were you on board of? - A. I have been on board several; I came home last, just before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. May I trouble you to tell me how you spell your name? - A. Baddan.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any bill transactions with Mr. Hart? - A. I never had in my life-time.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, as you never had any dealings with Hart, you never gave him a bill? - A. I gave him a bill, for which I was to have stops, which this very Elvy accepted.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was this? - A. It might be some time last January, I am not certain to a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold Hart goods? - A. No; I sold him some Spanish dollars and foreign coin, making altogether 15l. 10s. 9d.; he agreed to give me 4s. 9d. a piece for the dollars.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the bill drawn for that amount? - A. I do not know certainly, but I believe about that sum; it was within less than a pound.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200050"/>Court. I will trouble you to write your name.(The witness wrote his name, and it was handed to the Bench).</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. It was drawn for more than 14l.? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That you are sure of? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you are sure it was within a pound? - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. As you waver about it, are you sure it was within two pounds of 151. 10s. 9d.? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How came you not to take the bill from him for the exact amount of the dollars? - A.Elvy told me to call upon him in Barking church-yard, and he would pay me for them the next day, at twelve o'clock; I called there, and he was there, but came with me out of the house, and said, I will meet you at the George, in George-yard, this evening, at nine o'clock, and I will pay you, or give you a bill, and when he came there, he gave me this bill.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Hart to indorse it? - A. Hart was to give me slops for it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get these slops? - A. I did not get them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you to have them? - A. As soon as he could go to market.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a given time mentioned? - A. No, there was no limited time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many months did you suffer to elapse before you called upon Hart to supply you with the slops? - A. Not one; he was in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that one month after the date of this bill, Hart was in confinement? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not have been two months? - A. No, I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not more than three months after this bill was so drawn, that Hart was taken into custody? - A. Yes, I will.</p>
               <p>Q. Price wrote the body of this bill, did he? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bill? - A. This is the very bill.</p>
               <p>Q. You said it was within a month? - A. I was not certain to the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your custom to pay for slops before you get them? - A. No; it is time enough to pay for them when you do get them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Since you have returned the last time from on board ship, have you had any regular way of life? - A. I have not; because I had some money when I came from sea, and I have had enough, thank God, to support me since.</p>

             sworn. - I am a painter and glazier, in the Borough of Southwark.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of last winter, did you know a person of the name of Robert Elvy? - A. Very well; I have known him nine or ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. What has he been lately? - A. He pretended to me that he was a stock-broker, he lived either in Frances-street, or Hampton-street, in Walworth; I have been at his house several times, and have done work for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write? - A. Yes, often; I have seen a great deal of his writing; this appears to me to be like his writing; I don't mean to swear positively to his writing, but it is like it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did I understand you rightly, that he pretended to be a stockbroker? - A. I did not know him in any other business; whether he was or not, I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is he now? - A. I saw him last Sunday was a week at the Elephant and Castle, at Newington.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him here to-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you take upon yourself positively to swear, ther is such a person in existence as Elvy? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you believe that acceptance to be writing? - A. I believe it is, I don't swear positively, but believe it to be so.</p>
               <p>Court. Really, Gentleman, I could with great pleasure traverse the whole of this very long case, but it strikes me that I should be very much wasting your time, and the valuable time of this Court, which may be employed to other purposes, if we were to go on in this case. Observe how it stands. This is an indictment preferred against the prisoner for having uttered a Bill of Exchange, purportaing to have been accepted by a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t18010520-62-person505">

            , knowing the same to have been forged: therefore, it is of the effence of this prosecution that you should be perfectly satisfied that the name of Robert Elvy is actually forged. I should have been perfectly prepared, as the evidence on the part of the prosecution stood, to state, that 
               <persName id="t18010520-62-person506">
                  Robert

             was a man of straw, who never existed, and that the prisoner, or some person with his connivance, had put that name upon the bill. I should have been prepared to tell you, that that species of fraud did come within that higher species of offence, which constitutes forgery; but still, though this man has been in bad company, it appears that there is a man, perhaps, deeply particeps rimonis, a vagabond, that is at one moment at Walworth, and at another in Barking Church-yard, who has no visible place of abode; and this witness says, it is the hand-writing of Elvy, and he is corroborated by two other witnesses, that there is such a man in existence. Under these circumstances, I am quite satisfied that men of your understandings will not feel yourselves justified in saying that this is the forged acceptance of a person not existing, or of a person existing, whose name the prisoner has assumed without his consent.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any other witness? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Door-keeper. Here is another witness, my Lord. (The witness called in.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cook.) Did you know this witness before? - A. Yes; he spoke to me yesterday; I was talking about this, and he said he would go with me for charity's sake.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other witness come into the house where you lived? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever speak to this witness before yesterday? - A. Yes; I know him by eye sight, but I never saw him, nor know whether he knows any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a friend or a stranger? - A. Quite a stranger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How many months after you had been robbed was it before you went to the Grand Jury to find a bill? - A. It was between two and three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me understand you correctly; might it have been more or less; was it four months? - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. I see the bill is found in December, and I know that the Sessions were on the 3d of December; if you were robbed between two and three months before December Sessions, how can you swear that you were robbed on the 29th of October? - A. I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you know there is a 40l. reward if you and your helpmate can convict that honest man at the bar? - A. If I had had as much money as he, I dare say I should not have been asked so many cross questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know you shall have 40l. if you can convict that honest man? - A. I do not want any thing but justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there will be a reward of 40l. if you can convict him? - A. No; I can get as good a character as any poor girl in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear that there was a reward of 40l.? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is such a thing as an indictment for perjury, I suppose? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that neither? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never, in the course of your life, heard that there is a reward of 40l. for convicting a man of a highway robbery? - A. To the best of my opinion I never did.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you not conscious that you have heard of such a thing as a reward of 40l.? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200053"/>Q. Have you never said, that it was in the month of August that you were robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you lived in Spitalfields, in what month? - A. The same month that that happened.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it you lived in Spitalfields, was it summer or winter? - A. Winter, the beginning of winter; I used to go backwards and forwards there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not I understand you to say, you lived servant to some milk people for three days? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in summer or winter? - A. Winter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live after that? - A. I went to lodge in Union-court, and then I went to live in Field-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before you went to Spitalfields? - A. At that man's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that he was a publican, and kept the house in which you lodged? - A. His wife used to keep the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean, upon your oath, to swear, that you believe his wife kept the house? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that the man himself kept the house? - A. I cannot tell whether he did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe it; did you see any body else act as the master of the house? - A. Yes, a great many; it was very seldom I saw him in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him take money for beer in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been in his house drinking since you were robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you never at his house since October last? - A. Yes; since the bill was found against him, I went inside the door, and out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been in and out repeatedly since the bill was found? - A. No, I have passed the house; I have never been in his house since the bill was found.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Yes, you have sworn just now, that you have been in the house - have you been in his house or not? - A. Not since the bill was found against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you swear you have not been in the house since the bill was found against him? - A. No, I never was, but only at the door to call a man out.</p>
               <p>Q. I will prove that you have been there more than once, twice, or thrice: now, upon your solemn oath, have you never been there but once to call the man out? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you think it worth while to go on, gentlemen?</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Certainly not, my Lord.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. I am an officer of Bow-street: On the 12th of May, in consequence of information, I went with Ruthven, Bacon, and Gibbs, to the house of the prisoner, No. 11, Church-street, St. John's church, I think, about twelve o'clock in the forenoon; I directed Bacon to knock at the door, he knocked twice, I believe; it was sometime before the door was opened; it was opened by the prisoner; I went into the passage immediately, and desired the prisoner and Nixon to go up into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Nixon is the man who was afterwards discharged? - A. Yes; I immediately proceeded to search the house with Bacon, but smelling a great smell of sulphur, we went up stairs; seeing nothing in any of the rooms up stairs, we immediately came down into the kitchen, where we found these articles, (producing a basket full); upon the kitchen table were these two instruments, which are used in an engine for cutting blanks; upon the nob of the grate, by the side of the fire-place, I found this crucible; it was whole when I found it; I broke it to get the metal out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the crucible made of? - A. Earthenware; it was so hot, I could not take it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in that sort of fluid state that you could have poured it out? - A. I cannot say; for while the door was opened, it might have cooled; upon the water cistern in the kitchen, in a bag, I found a great quantity of blanks for shillings and sixpences, some of the colour of copper, and others nearly of the colour of silver; close by the side of the grate I found this stick, which appeared to have been used, and this sand paper, these filings, this pot of blacking, and these tongs; I then went to the front parlour, where I had left the prisoner, and upon the table, when I first went in, I found some filings in this box; upon searching the bureau, I found this small crucible, this cecil, and these three pieces of composition, resembling money; one of them is the colour and size of a half-guinea; in the front garret I found this shovel, this ingot mould, and some files.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dress? - A. In a working dress; he had a drab-coloured jacket on; I believe this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Let me look at those cutters; I believe you know perfectly well these cannot be used without a fly? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore no blanks could have been cut out of this cecil without the assistance of a fly? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, with the implements you found, this cecil could not have been produced? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they are both new, and appear never to have been used? - A. They appear to be new.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no difficulty of access to the house? - A.Bacon knocked a second time, just as we were going to break open the window; when I got to the window; the door was immediately opened.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no aquafortis? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. The smell that you spoke of, was a sulphurous smell, and not at all like aquafortis? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no mould for the casting of blanks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no instrument found, by which the shillings could have been either cast or stamped? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. A fly, I believe, is not necessary for the purpose of colouring base metal? - A. No.</p>
               <p>ARCHIBALD RUTHVEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was with Sayers on the 12th of May: Bacon knocked at the door twice or thrice before it was opened, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he knock pretty loud? - A. Yes; when the door was opened, I saw the prisoner in a working dress, he had on this jacket.(Producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his hands? - A. His hands seemed rather dirtyish, Nixon was there; I searched him, and found some money and Banknotes, all of which were good; I did not search the prisoner, it was either Bacon or Gibbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are not so foolish, when you apprehend any body, to give intimation of your coming? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the prisoner had no intimation the Bow-street officers were about to apprehend him for high treason? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You found the jacket upon him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about eleven o'clock? - A. It was in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200055"/>Q. It is a very common thing for a man to wear a light jacket in the morning, before he dresses himself to go out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear his hands were dirty in that sort of way that he had used these sort of metals necessary for coining? - A. I will swear they were in a dirtyish state.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear Carpmeal say at Bow-street, that his hands were clean, not dirty? - A. I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Carpmeal was not at the house, and therefore knew nothing about it? - A. Yes, he was.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of knocks were they? - A. Pretty smart knocks, such as might be heard all over the house; after I had knocked three times, the prisoner at the bar opened the door, Nixon was in the passage, just behind him; I immediately went across the passage, and went up stairs to the front garret; we smelt a very nasty smell upon the staircase as we were going up, a kind of sulphurous smell; Sayers said, there is a furnace here somewhere; we then returned into the kitchen, and found two sieves, and a sand paper in one of them, this butter boat, with bread crumbs in them; there were several files, and a pair of pincers; I found this apron in the kitchen, it appears to be eat up almost with something; and here are a pair of thumb-stalls that I found upon the kitchen shelf.</p>

               <p>Q. Are they in your judgment in a state fit for circulation? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and say what they are? - A. Some of them are shaped like shillings, but not coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag? - A. They are pieces of metal resembling shillings and sixpences not compleat; they would require the process of colouring to make them fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these three pieces, one of them having the resemblance of a half-guinea, and the other a foreign coin, are they counterfeit? - A. The half-guinea is a counterfeit; as to the others, I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see the manufacture compleated, or have you ever manufactured any yourself? - A. I have one in my pocket, that I have finished myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Look at these blanks? - A. These blanks have been cast in a mould; after they are cast, there is a considerable quantity of metal round the edge, which is called the spray, and the surfaces are extremely rough; therefore the first thing necessary with respect to the edge, is to clip the spray round with a pair of scissars; this pair of scissars, which have been produced, will answer the purpose; the next process will be to file the edges and the surface with files; here is a file, which is produced, which is the proper sort of file to be used on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are the files any other than common files? - A. No, they might be used for any other purpose; the next thing to be done would be to take the scratches out with sand-paper; some of this sand-paper appears to have been used, and some not; the chief part of the blanks in the bag appear to have undergone the process I have described; the next thing will be to colour them; those that I have now in my hand have been coloured, and are fit for circulation; the preparation for colouring them would be a solution of silver in aquafortis, made into a paste, with the addition of cream of tartar; that being applied upon the surface of the blank, and to the edges, the next thing would be to put them into a strong pickle of aquafortis alone, which would six the colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that be done without a fire? - A. They might afterwards have the addition of fire and heat, but that is sometimes omitted; then they are put into water, with an equal quantity of salt and cream of tartar, boiled over the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. In what kind of vessel? - A. Any kind of vessel, boiler, or pipkin; that brings the colour a great deal fresher; they might then he heated over<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200056"/>the fire in a shovel similar to this, this appears to have been much heated over the fire; they are then taken out, and scowered with fine powder of cream of tartar; they have then a bright silver colour, too bright for circulation; then the next thing is to apply what is called the blacking, which is a composition of mutton fat, bees wax, and lamp black, melted and incorporated together over the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that blacking? - A. This appears to be the stuff that I am speaking of; this is the sort of thing that it is generally done in; rubbing the money with a piece of it, dulls the brightness, and makes it fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that butter boat, and tell us what it contains? - A. It contains butter crumbs of bread; I forgot to mention that after they are scowered with cream of tartar, they are thrown into cold water, and then, in order to dry them, they are often shook up in a cloth with burnt bran, or burnt crumbs of bread.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, aquafortis was absolutely necessary for colouring? - A. Yes; it cannot be done without it; after they have been rubbed with the crumbs of bread, they are put into a sieve, to separate the bread from the coin; this sieve would answer that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that stick, at the end of the stick, and tell us whether there is any appearance upon the stick of its having being used with aquafortis? - A. I saw this stick on the evening of the day the prisoner was apprehended, at Bow-street, it then smelled very strong of aquafortis, the end of the stick was quite soft; such a stick as this, most probably, would be used in a process of this sort, it is for turning them round in the pickle after they have been washed with the solution of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us if you can discover from the appearance of that apron as if there had been aquafortis upon it? - A. Aquafortis would have this effect upon it; here are a pair of pliers that would be necessary to hold the money during the process of filing and rubbing it with sand-paper, and it appears to have been very much used.</p>
               <p>Q. You have in your left-hand some file-dust, is that file-dust of metal? - A. It is correspondent with the metal of which the blanks are made.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the contents of that basket? - A. Here is cecil, the refuse of the cuttings; and a crucible for melting metal; the metal is first melted in a crucible, then run into an ingot mould, and flatted in a mill, this mould would answer the purpose; here is a blank, which was delivered to me by one of the officers, upon which I tried the process that I have been describing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Though a very honest man, you have proved yourself a very good coiner, in theory and in practice; there are a great many things necessary that you have not enumerated to-day? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. In the commencement of the process, you told us it is necessary to use files? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the most usual way not to use files, but to use bags, in which they are moved backwards and forwards? - A. I cannot say, I never heard of that; they are shook backwards and forwards after they are coloured with bran.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated aquafortis as necessary? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. A stick has been produced here which you suppose to have been used with aquafortis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where one of the component parts is silver, is not aquafortis used to throw the silver upon the surface? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that sixpence? - A. That appears to me to be cast metal.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Suppose there was, in that cast metal, any composition of silver, would aquafortis alone extract that silver upon the surface? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You yourself procured elsewhere, and not at the prisoner's house, the ingredients with which you made the mixture, with which you tried this experiment? - A. Yes; the principal thing will be aquafortis.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no aquafortis found, nor cream of tartar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any solution of silver found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your hands are very black, was that by the process upon that shilling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you cannot get it off? - A. I have not had an opportunity of using that that would be necessary for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man is taken in the act of colouring he cannot get rid of it? - A. No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you think would take it off? - A. A little salt and vinegar.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in Church-street, Mill-bank-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know No. 11, Church-street? - A. Yes; that is my house; the prisoner at the bar is my tenant; he has the whole house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What other persons might frequent the house you cannot tell? - A. I cannot.</p>

               <p>Jury. (To Sayers). Q. Did you find any utensils which had the appearance of having contained aquafortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say from whence the stench that you have described proceeded? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows: - "My Lord, I stand here before your Lordship and a most respectable Jury, accused of a crime of the most heinous dye; my counsel have already urged in my behalf all that possibly could be said to prove that I am not guilty of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200057"/>the crime imputed to me; but, nevertheless I have humbly to beg the indulgence to add a few words. My Lord, I am a foreigner, and as such, unacquainted with all the ways to extricate myself from this dreadful dilemma; therefore, my Lord, and respectable Jurors, I claim your protection, indulgence, and candour. My Lord, I came to England with the late Earl of Bute, and the character given me by his Lordship in his own handwriting, will, I hope, prove the disposition of my heart; this will appear by the annexed letters, which I crave may be read; I have since lived steward with several foreign Ambassadors, always acting, and always conducting myself with becoming rectitude. I am near sixty-six years of age; I have been near thirty-three years in England; I always maintained a spotless and unsullied character; I never before darkened a prison, or saw the face of a Judge. I was too old for service, and not having enough to live independent, I made use of my talents in refining silver and other metals; I got a living by it during four years; I never imagined my doings could be deemed unlawful. Mr. Sayer, the officer, who arrested me, will no doubt tell your Lordship, that I did not hesitate moment to admit him; he humanely told me, that as neither aqua fortis nor any colouring was found on my premises, I must account in the best manner I could for the other things found to my prejudice. I did, my Lord, at my examination at Bow-street, state how the cast things found came there, and had the officer given ear to my proposal, not to make so much noise in the house or neighbourhood, the owner, Jones, would in all probability have come to take them away the same evening. I have, since my confinement, sent different persons to Bayswater to find out his residence, but without the desired effect; besides, my Lord, there was neither furnace, or any other tool or apparatus whatever for casting found in my possession, without which it is impossible to counterfeit the coin of this or any other realm. This must appear no less mysterious to your Lordship and the respectable Jury than to myself and to the whole world that know any thing of casting. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have only to add, that although a foreigner, I rejected the offer to be tried by a mixed Jury of my countrymen, fully convinced and persuaded of your Lordship's impartiality, consummate wisdom, and justice, and also of the wisdom and probity of these respectable Jurors seated here to decide on my fate, fully persuaded that their decision will be favourable to me, and thereby convince the whole world that neither prejudice nor country can influence an English Jury to depart from the path of rectitude, justice, and feeling, or any indulgence that could be granted to an unfortunate prisoner. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I therefore humbly bow to the justice of your verdict."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Sayer). Q. At the time you apprehended Mr. Theirars he made no sort of resistance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that the things belonged to a man of the name of Jones, and if you would wait quietly till the evening, probably he would come for them? - A. No, he did not; I heard him mention a Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what is become of Nixon? - A. He was discharged in consequence of his hands being quite clean.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. (To Mr. Powell). Q. Look at that blank, do you think that has ever received the white? - A. Certainly not.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. Above three pounds; on the 3d of March, a milk-pot, two salts, and three tops of castors.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth? - A. About a guinea; on the 14th of April, the two prisoners came about seven o'clock in the evening, and Waterman asked me if I had any plate there in the name of Waterman; I replied, yes, I had; I asked him his reason for asking; he said, that Bush had lost the tickets of them; I asked them what they wanted to do with them; he said he wanted to have them altered into another name; I told them they could not have them altered into another name, without making an affidavit; I wrote out an affidavit, and gave it to them in the name of Bush; I asked Waterman whose plate it was; he said he had every reason to believe it was

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I apprehended the prisoner, Bush; I told her I apprehended her for robbing her master, Mr. Regnart; I asked her if she knew Mr. Wadmore, and she said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promises of favour if she confessed? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor threatened her if she did not? - A. No; it was near twelve o'clock at night, and I took her into a cook's-shop, which was the only house open; I asked her if she knew Waterman; she said, she wished she had never known him; we got a coach immediately, and I took her to Pancras watch-house; I searched her, but found nothing that led to the property; she told me she had pawned the plate, and the counterpane, and that Waterman and she went to the Northumberland arms, the corner of Grafton-street, burnt the duplicates, and spent part of the money; she said, they had burnt two of them, and destroyed the rest; I asked her what became of the rest of the things; she told me Waterman had taken them away, and pawned them, and what he had done with the duplicates she could not tell.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Waterman was not present at this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Did she tell you that she took the plate, and pawned it? - A. No; she said she pawned it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Regnart.) Q.Was Waterman in your service? - A. Yes, more than a twelve-month; I discharged him on the 13th of April, before all my men.</p>
               <p>ESTHER REGNART sworn. - Court. Q.Had you the key of the room where these three boxes were? - A. It hung up in my bed-room; the prisoner, Bush, frequently had the key to go into the room to clean the room.</p>

               <p>Q. You never gave the key to Waterman? - A. No; he was not in the house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. James. These articles are all mine, they have my name upon them.</p>
               <p>Bush's defence. It was never locked till a month before I left my place; the apprentice used to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Regnart. It might be open; but I never knew that it was not locked.</p>
               <p>Bush. The things I confess I had, but they were delivered to me by Waterman on the 18th of January; I was a poor country girl, he came down into the kitchen, and gave me the plate to pawn for him; he said he had no wife, but two children, and he wanted to put them to school at Homerton; he was always soliciting and deluding me; I was very comfortable in my place till I knew him; he drew me aside, and told me he was not a married man when he was, and had two children; he told me he would take me away from my place, and marry me, and live with no other person; he had the money that the things were pledged for.</p>

               <p>Mr. Regnart. I know these to be mine, they have a private mark upon all of them; I had missed fifteen or sixteen dozen; there was one particularly I had questioned him about, and he said he knew nothing of it, and it was very unpleasant to him in his situation for any thing to be missing; they are worth 2s. 3d.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the lodging in which you found them, a lodging in which his wife and family lived? - A. Yes; his wife was there, he was not, he was in custody; he told the patrol he had another lodging half a mile from Tottenham-court road, No. 4, Southampton-court, at the top of Tottenham-court-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe it is customary for the men to provide themselves with tools, and sometimes the masters find them? - A. There is a particular branch of the business in which I lend my tools, but they are never taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not a paper stuck up in the shop, that if one man takes another's tools without leave, to be fined a pot of beer? - A. That was from my study, if they took any from my bench.</p>
               <p>Q. The tools are so small, that they might be taken away innocently by a man as for his own tools? - A. I cannot conceive that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not tools, exactly like those, made for other persons besides you? - A. Yes; but these are for sculpture work, and he was never employed upon sculpture work by me.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a mason; I worked with the prisoner at the bar at Mr. Regnart's; in the business of a mason, a man generally finds his own tools; but when he is in the employ of a sculptor, it is generally the custom for the master to lend the necessary and useful tools to the men; during the time I was in Mr. Regnart's employ, I was principally engaged in knocking the rough part of stone off from figures; Mr. Regnart was in the constant practice of lending me tools and the prisoner at the bar; I have been in Mr. Regnart's employ nearly six months.</p>
               <p>Q.Does it not often happen that there are innocent mistakes made? - A.Frequently tools are put promiseuously together; I have known the prisoner ten years, he has always borne the character of an honest and industrious man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Mr. Regnart lent the prisoner tools; did he ever give him permission to take tools home with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four other witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Regnart told me I was a thief; i told him I was not, nor he could not prove me to be a thief; he has not paid me my wages yet; he said again I was a thief; I said I was not, but I could prove him as such, for he had taken some stone from Christ Church, and that has made him so spiteful against me.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Regnart. Q. Did you ever lend him tools to take home? - A. No; he told me he had got a watch-case to do, and I told him he was very welcome to have my premises to execute it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever permit him to take tools to execute it at his own lodgings? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you permit him to use your tools? - A. I did not, solemnly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Have you or not paid him his wages? - A.There was thirteen shillings and ten-pence halfpenny, which I have paid his wife since; he has thrown an imputation on me, which I beg to explain, in October last I erected a monument to the memory of Mr. Southgate, a merchant in the City: this man was employed along with another; after he had taken up the old stones, he said to me, sir, these stones are your right and property; I said, I don't know that they are, I know not whether I have a right to them or not; I had never done any thing of the kind before, and therefore I said, as you have been in the customary method of being employed in this sort of work, you should know better than me, but do not send them home to me, if the churchwarden, or any body about the premises, hint that they have a right to them, do not send them home; when I found I was wrong, I returned them the next day, and when I discharged the prisoner, he threatened me with a prosecution in the Ecclesiastical Court.</p>

When I came up into the garret, I saw the prisoner sitting at the foot of the bed; there were two old women in the room; I told her she must go along with me; I asked her who that bundle belonged to at the foot of the bed, and she told me it was her's; I took her to St. Ann's watch-house; some of the things in the bundle were her own property; Mrs. Cramer came to the watch-house; I opened the bundle in her presence, and she claimed the articles that I now produce; the prisoner put her hand into her pocket and took out a box, which I took from her; it contained nine guineas in gold; I asked her whose money it was, and she told me it belonged to her mistress; Mrs. Cramer said she could not swear to the gold, but she had lost ten guineas; I searched her pocket at the watch-house, and in one of her pockets I found a veil, which Mrs. Cramer said was her's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cramer. I know all the things; they are all marked.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in her defence. <rs id="t18010520-76-verdict420" type="verdictDescription">

On the 15th of December I saw Mrs. Hancock passing the shop; I beckoned to her, knowing there was a little bill standing; she came into the shop, the prisoner was then in the shop; he had told me she had been in the country; I told her, she looked very well since she came from the country; I had often asked the prisoner if the bill had been paid, and he always denied it; she said, she had not been in the country at all; I asked her then to come into the parlour, which she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he remain in the shop when she went into the parlour? - A. No; he took his basket and bread out with him, and never returned any more; I sent my son to call him back, and he would not come back.</p>

            " - I always paid the prisoner Mr. Younger's bills, and he always gave me receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you discontinue Mr. Younger as a baker? - A. At the time I paid that bill; I told the prisoner not to bring any more bread.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You, like all good wives, live at home with your husband? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley contended that the 2d and 3d Counts were inoperative, and that the first should have stated the money to have been received of the husband by the hands of the wife.</p>
               <p>Court. As to the 1st Count, I am clearly of opinion that it is quite sufficient to state that the money was received on account of the master; as to the other two, the question is merely whether they are necessary or not; it has been said, the 2d Count is bad, because it does not state from whom it was received; but suppose a prisoner, charged with a crime of this sort, does not chuse to confess from whom he received it, although he confesses he has received a large sum of money on account of his master, I think it would be very good evidence against him, though the sum is not ascertained. Under all these circumstances I am of opinion that this indictment is good; as to the Common Law Count, I have always entertained an opinion that it was not good.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHARPE sworn. - I have known the prisoner five years; he has always bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q.Have you not been for the purpose of settling this with the prosecutor? - A.Not since he has been taken; I went at the desire of the young man; he said he owed Mr. Younger some money, and he wished to pay it in the couse of a month.</p>
               <p>Q.When was that? - A. I cannot say, it was since he left Mr. Younger; Mr. Younger would have taken it, if I would have paid it down.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. This was before the man was indicted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Younger. Mr. Sharpe came two or three days after the prisoner left me, and told me he wanted his clothes; he said, the prisoner had given him an account of about five pounds that he had taken of my money, and he wished to pay it for the prisoner; I told him I would not take the money from him, for I should prosecute him; there was no money tendered, and I refused to take any.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you, or not, offer to take the money if it was paid down? - A. I did not; there was no money presented to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or not, offer to take it if the money was paid down? - A.Not that I know of; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200065"/>never could agree about the sum, for he had more than ten pounds of my money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Upon the oath you have taken, would you not have received the money from the hands of Mr. Sharpe, if he had given it to you? - A. If he had paid me the whole sum, I might.</p>

               <p>Jury. (To Whiteman.) Q.Did you find the fellow glove to it upon her? - A.No; she disowned it; but as we came from Guildhall, I asked her why she threw away the glave; she said, because the money was bad.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had some business to transact for a widow, at Somerset-house, I had infinite trouble with it; she was to receive some prize-money, what prizemoney she received I don't know, and I accepted of that half-guinea from her, I did not examine the value, nor the quiality of it; I went to get a bottle of Dassy's Elixir for my daughter in America, I produced the half-guinea, which Mr. Becue said was a bad one; the two shillings I know nothing of; that I have suffered once before for a similar thing is certainly true, but I have lived a very honest I se for some time; I am a West-Indian by birth, I have no friends here; I throw myself upon the mercy of the Court.</p>

Yes; I went the next morning to receive the key again, I received it from Lemon, and went to the warehouse in Three-crane-lane, between six and seven o'clock; I found the door single-locked, there was no appearance of force; I found a great quantity of wool lying about the floor, the pack that I had set up on end was cut all the way, and the biggest part taken out; I then went up to the accompting-house, and gave information of it; I then returned, with Mr. Marsh, and weighed what remained, there was not more than half a hundred, I believe, left; there was about three parts out of four of the bag gone; they weigh about two hundred-weight.</p>

I am porter to Mr. Brooke: In the afternoon of the 16th of December, I was at the warehouse in at Antholin's Church-yard, Watling-street, in my business; Bew brought the key of the Three-crane-lane warehouse, and gave it to me; I took it, with the other keys, to the accompting-house, in Sambrook-court, Basinghall-street, I put them all in an iron safe; and the next morning, between six and seven o'clock, I went to the warehouse in Watling-street, with the keys, and delivered the key of the Three-crane-lane warehouse to Bew; Bew came back to me, and I went to the warehouse, and saw the remains of the bag which had been plundred, and the greatest part of it gone; the package was cut from top to bottom.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Bew brought the key to you in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.At what time? - A. A quarter past five o'clock, or it might be a little after.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it earlier or later than half past five? - A. Earlier rather than later.</p>
               <p>Q.And the next morning you gave the key back again to Bew? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you give it to any body? - A. No; I put it by itself in the iron safe.</p>
               <p>- PARTRIDGE sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of Mr. Brooke's clerks.</p>
               <p>Q.In December, 1799, do you remember there be ing any Spanish wool in Mr. Brooke's warehouse in Three-crane lane? - A. Yes; I weighed the bag in question, in December, 1799, I took down the weight at the time it was weighed, it weighed two hundred and two pounds gross, or two hundred and twenty-six pounds; I saw the same pack the following day, it was afterwards weighed again; I did not take any notice of the deficiency, but Mr. Marsh did; there was a deficiency of about three-fourths I should imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any wool produced before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes; in Spanish wool bags there are four searns, and if any one of them is cut, they can take out the wool; it was cut with some sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it that you saw any wool produced before the Lord Mayor? - A. I think within ten days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that wool? - A. I did; it exactly resembled the wool that remained; it corresponded in quality exactly, I have no doubt but it is the wool that we lost from the warehouse; the remainder of the wool is here.</p>

               <p>JOHN MARSH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp I am clerk to Mr. Brooke, he has a warehouse in Threecrane-lane, from whence this property was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the particular pack of wool? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember a pack of wool of which there was a deficiency? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember weighing it, to see what the deficiency was? - A. Yes; I did not weigh it before, I only weighed the quantity that remained; I made a minute at the time; it weighed a quarter of a hundred and twenty-seven pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the general run of the weight of a pack of wool? - A.About two hundred pounds; the deficiency was one hundred weight, two quarters, and three pounds gross, or one hundred and seventy-one pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you seen any wool since you lost it from the warehouse? - A. Yes, before the Lord-Mayor; I saw some wool which corresponded in quality with that which I weighed, and also in quantity; in the warehouse where this wool was seized, I picked it from twenty sacks.</p>
               <p>- GOWKETT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a warehouse man in Great Distaff-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the 10th of December, 1799, any body coming to you with any package of wool? - A. Yes, about a quarter past five; I had locked up the front warehouse, as we generally do when it gets dark.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you take upon you to say, that it was not later than that? - A. I am confident, for I had an engagement to go out.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was it that brought it? - A. Mr. Leggatt's carman.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.(Produces a sample of wool.) Q. The bags of wool are at the door in a cart, are they not? - A. They are; we brought them from Mr. Brooke's warehouse, in Three Crane-lane; I took this sample out of the warehouse, in the presence of Mr. Marsh and Bew.</p>
               <p>- CARTWRIGHT sworn. - I know no more than Mr. Miller; I was with him when he got the sample from Mr. Brooke's warehouse; I assisted in bringing the wool from Mr. Gowkett's on the 20th of December, 1799.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Marsh.) Q. Is that a sample of the wool that remained in your warehouse of the pack that was cut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been concerned in this trade? - A.About twelve years.</p>
               <p>Q. At what age did you first begin? - A.About twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had an opportunity of becoming well acquainted with Spanish wool? - A. I certainly have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen that wool, which is said to have been produced, from Mr. Gowkett's warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you compared it with the remainder of the bag that was left in Mr. Brooke's warehouse? - A. Yes; I entertain not the least doubt of its being the same; it is of a very singular quality, a wool that we seldom receive in the country; when we have it, it must be known from other wool.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that this wool, found in Mr. Gowkett's warehouse, is identically the same that was found in Mr. Brooke's warehouse? - A. I can undertake to swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You don't mean to say, that all the wool that comes to England, comes to your house? - A. This is an article that seldom comes to this market; it has been generally sent to Holland.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me what proportion of that, which comes to England, goes to your house? - A. I suppose one-fourth.</p>
               <p>Q.Suppose you had seen such wool as that at Bristol. would you still say, you had no doubt of it? - A.Most assuredly, if it was the same poil, I should say it was the same, as far as my judgment goes.</p>

               <p>Q.Be so good as to state to the Court what he said-Mr. Const. It was taken in writing, I believe.</p>
               <p>Chetham. No, it was not; being asked before the Lord-Mayor how he came in possession of the wool, he said; he had bought it of some Spanish sailors, who said, it came to England in their beds; the Lord-Mayor then put a question to him, whether it was a usual thing; upon which he said it was a very usual thing for their beds to be stuffed with Spanish wool.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const then intersered, and the witness stopped, and said no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. I believe you know that the prisoner has put off this trial upon an affidavit of the absence of those witnesses, and that he swore he had done all in his power to obtain them? - A. He has certainly put off his trial upon an affidavit that some sailors were material witnesses, who were gone in an English ship to the South Seas, and I think, named a witness of the name of Carbinell.(Mr. Const addressed the Jury in behalf of the defendant.)</p>

            ). Q. Do you know Mr. Vigurs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a tailor, and a man of considerable property? - A. He is a man of considerable property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so stated at the trial? - A. He was, on the trial, stated to be worth full 20,000 pounds, by Mr. Vaillant, the Counsel for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call at the office of the defendant? - A. On the Saturday, in consequence of the paragraph appearing in the Public Ledger, I, in company with Mr. Roberts, called at the office of Mr. Crowder, where the Public Ledger was printed and published, as we understood; upon our going into the office, we saw a clerk; we enquired for Mr. Crowder, and were informed that he was not at home; we left our names, and for what purpose we called.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Whose name did you leave? - A. I left my name, and Mr. Roberts's, who was attorney for the family, and a most intimate friend of the family; I had to defend the defendant in that case; he went with me as a friend, and not in the capacity of attorney; Mr. Roberts attended as the friend of Mrs. Vigurs with me, as the solicitor of Mrs. Vigurs: On the Monday following, Mr. Crowder sent me a paper, containing a paragraph contradicting the former one.</p>
               <p>Q.Be so good as to read the offensive paragraph first? - A.(Beads)" A woman who keeps a lodging-house, and whose husband, a tailor, was stated to be worth 20,000 pounds, was tried for stealing three bushels of coals, the property of a gentleman who had apartments in her house; her maid-servant appeared as a witness against her, and she was found guilty."</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. The indictment stated three pecks of coals; paragraph states three bushels of coals; and therefore I think this indictment impossible to be sustained.</p>
               <p>Court. It will be for the Jury to decide whether this paragraph applies to the same transaction</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetham. I was going to state, that on the Monday following, I received a paper, which I presume came from Mr. Crowder, with a paragraph contradicting the one that had been stated in the former paper, which I have here, (produces it;) it was directed to Mr. Chetham, solicitor, Falcon-square; in that newspaper is the paragraph, which I will read, if you think proper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. If you please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetham. (Read.)" In the account which we gave in our paper of Saturday, of a trial of a person charged with stealing the coals of a lodger, our reporter gave an erroneous statement of the result; the party accused was acquitted." It is under the title of Westminster Sessions.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not since had any other application from the solicitor of Mr. Crowder to make any satisfaction that you should think proper? - A. I will tell you the sort of manner in which that proposition was made.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not want to go into any conversation; I want to know whether the name of Mr. Barry had not been given up to you as the author of that paragraph? - A. I do not know how to answer that; Mr. Shepherd certainly did name such a person, but not exactly as the author.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harrison. Q. Were you present during the whole of the day of that trial? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person tried for stealing coals? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the Public Ledger of the succeeding day? - A. I did; and saw the paragraph that has been read, which I understood to apply most completely to Mrs. Vigurs.</p>
               <p>Q.What is her Christian name? - A.Charlotte; her husband's name is John; I went on the Saturday evening with Mr. Chetham, Mr. Crowder was not at home; we left a message respecting that paragraph; we likewise left out addresses in writing; on Monday, the 27th of October, I received this newspaper under cover; it is the same as that Mr. Chetham has produced.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday, did you see Mr. Crowder in his office? - A. I did; I complained to him of the enormity of the paragraph; his answer was, did I not receive a paper on the preceding day, in which he said he had made an apology; I admitted that I had; Mr. Crowder added, and that is the only concession I can make; I then said, Mr. Crowder, this is not enough, I come here to request, and even to require, the author of it; Mr. Crowder made a pause; he hesitated, and said, that a Mr. Barry, an Irish barrister, who was occasionally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200071"/>the reporter of the Sessions and Old-Bailey trials, had brought it to his office; I then required to see the manuscript of it, which he denied me, alledging that some correction or alteration, he believed, had been made, or might have been made, I cannot say which; and he would not shew it; I repeated my request again, and said, Mr. Crowder, I must request of you to give me up the author; he would not shew me the manuscript, nor give up any other author than he had given up, Mr. Barry; I told him, if he did not, Mr. Vigurs, who was three hundred miles from town, at Penzance, upon his return, would make him give an account of his conduct; he then said, I shall give you no farther information, you may do just as you please, or take what course you please, I conceive I know what course you can take, you can bring an action against me, and I shall suffer judgment to go by default; you can recover only trifling damages and your costs; I then bid him good morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp Q.Have you told us exactly every thing that passed at the time you went to Mr. Crowder's, and saw him? - A. I think I have, but it is impossible to recollect every word.</p>
               <p>Q. He did give you the name of the author? - A.He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you made any application to Mr. Barry, at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not state to you, that he had looked for the manuscript, but could not find it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say that he could not immediately find it, but if he could find it, he would new it you? - A. He did not; he positively refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that he has offered to shew it? - A. I do not know it; there was an application, I understand, made to Mr. Chetham the other day to settle it, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not Mr. Crowder offer to make any apology that you should require? - A.Never, to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know of your own knowledge, that we were ready to make every apology beyond that of giving you the name of the author, that you should require? - A. I know nothing of it myself, but from Mr. Chetham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gorney. Q.Have you ever seen Mr. Crowder, but upon that occasion? - A. I do not know that I ever saw him, but upon that occasion</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that Mr. Crowder did not offer you the paper that you required? - A. He positively denied it</p>

            ; I lodged at that time at No. 6, Staple-inn-buildings, Holborn; the trial was put off till the next day, the 10th; I left my lodgings about a quarter after seven o'clock, to go to Wells and Co. my employers; when I got to the bottom of Castle-street, Holborn, turning into Cursitor-street, there was a hackney-coach standing with the door open; I passed it about ten yards, when a man came up to me in a tailor's dress; there came up immediately three or four more, who forced me into the coach; one of them said, d-n you, you are a deserter; I holloa'd murder, and made an alarm as loud as I could; Edwards was one who forced me into the coach; I think I recollect to have seen his face before; Edwards, and another in a tailor's dress, then got into the coach with me, and another on the outside; the coach drove immediately down Chancery-lane; I made seve<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200072"/>ral attempts to run my head through the window, upon which Edwards stuffed something into my mouth; they stopped at the Prince of Wales public-house, in St. Georges's-fields, when I observed another man behind, Harry Rounce, who called himself a press-master; I heard his name afterwards; Edwards and the other man said, their press master was without; when we got to the Prince of Wales, he got down and came to the coach window, and shewed me a copy of the information, which he said he had received, that I was a deserter; there they called for something to drink, and asked me to drink with them; I said, I hoped they were not going to hurt me; and the press-master and Edwards assured me they were not if I was quiet; I thought it was policy to be quiet, and I drank some gin and water with them; they then proceeded to Mill-stairs, Rotherhithe, and went into a public-house, the Prince of Orange; we went into a private room.</p>

               <p>Q. When you were taken up in Castle-street, did you call murder loud enough for the coachman to hear you? - A. Yes; when we got to Rotherhithe, the coachman came into the room, and had a glass of spirits, which is the defendant in livery, John Welch; he stopped a considerable time in the room, and I told him where I lived, and asked the favour of him to let Wells and Co. know where I was confined; I told him I was a witness upon a trial, and I suspected that this was done to prevent my giving evidence; he gave me a blunt kind of answer, that he knew nothing about it, or something of that sort, and then went away; he was paid in the house. but I did not see him paid; the press-master, Edwards. and the other man in a tailor's dress, had some ham and bread, and some porter, and I had some with them; they begged I would have what I liked, for Government were at the expence of it; while we were eating and drinking, I reported to the press-master the particulars of the case; he said, from my hands and my appearance he did not believe I had ever been at sea; that was about eight o'clock; he said, if I would shew him a subpoena he would let me go without going to the regulating Captain; he remained about half an hour and then went away, saying he was going to the regulating Captain; Edwards also went away, and left me with one tailor; I forgot to mention that I said to Edwards I had seen him before, and believed I knew him; he said, I had not, for he had just come from sea; I saw no more of Edwards that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You got home in the evening of that day? - A. I did; about three weeks after the women were tried, I saw Welch standing against a toy-shop, opposite St. Dunstan's church, with the coach door open, ready to take up a fare; I said, well coachy, how are you; he seemed very much confused, and said, I thought I recollected you; I forgot to mention, that after I had been two hours at Rotherhithe, there came into the room where I was, a distiller's clerk, who happened to know one of my brothers, and I conveyed a letter by him to my brother, to let him know where I was; when I saw Welch at the toy-shop, I said, I suppose you recollect taking me to Rotherhithe the other morning; he said, yes, I do; I then asked him if he knew of those fellows that were with me; he said he had never seen them before; he then took up his fare and drove away; about three weeks or a month after that, I was going to Somerset-house, and saw him again near the same place; I was talking with Mr. Canner, the City Marshal, about this business; I called to him, and said, how are you, coachman, and he nodded his head; Mr. Canner immediately followed him, stopped his coach, and took him to the Mansion-house; A considerable time after that, I saw Edwards sitting on the rails in Smithfield, with a parcel of drovers; when he saw me, he ran across Smithfield as hard as he could run; two officers pursued him, and caught him; I am sure he is the man; I could swear to him from a thousand people if it were necessary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp (Counsel for Welch.)</p>
               <p>Q.You did not see the coachman when you got into the coach? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor till he came into the room at Rotherhithe? -No.</p>
               <p>Q. And will you venture to swear that the defendant is the same man? - A. Yes, I will; they called him coachman, and he had a whip in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to that Jury that he was the man who drove all the way from Castle-street to Rotherhithe? - A. It is impossible that I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not always tell you, at the public-house, at the toy-shop, and again near the same place, that he knew nothing at all of the other persons? - A. I did not ask him the question at Rotherhithe.</p>
               <p>Q.But upon both the other occasions he told you he did not know the men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or hear of the fare being paid? - A. The man in the tailor's dress said he had paid the coachman half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Gilgrest's shop is in Fleet street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the coachman you belonged to that gentleman's shop? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet the place that you afterwards saw him in was in Fleet-street, near your master's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
