                  </hi> (78 <hi rend="italic">A</hi>). About 3.35 a.m. on July 22nd I was on duty at the River Terrace, Westminster Palace, when I heard a splash in the water near Westminster Bridge—I looked out on the water, and saw a man struggling in the water near the centre arch of the bridge—he came to the surface, and fired five shots from a revolver; after the fifth shot the trigger went down with a click, but there was no report—I was right facing the man—I blew my whistle to attract the attention of the River Police—their boat came up after three or four minutes—the man seemed to be swimming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was striking out in the ordinary way of swim<lb/>ming—after firing the five shots and clicking the trigger he dropped the revolver—I could not say how the revolver was pointed when it was fired—the tide was flowing, and he gradually came towards me, and had drifted about 100 yards with the tide by the time he was rescued.</p>

About 3.40 a.m. on July 22nd I was on duty in a police galley—I heard reports of a revolver coming from Westminster Bridge—T rowed in the galley to the spot, and saw a man struggling in the water and throwing his arms about; he was not swimming or doing anything to keep himself from sinking—he was carried up some distance by the flood tide; he was about 100 yards from the bridge when we got to him, I should think—I saw him disappear two or three times before we got to him—I was steering, standing up in the galley—when we got up to him he tried to avoid the boat—I and another constable caught hold of him and pulled him in—I took him to Westminster Bridge, and sent for an ambulance—on getting him into the ambulance he said, "Why did not you let me finish it?"—T assisted to take-him to St. Thomas's Hospital, and helped to undress him—he had all his clothes on—Awhile undressing him he said, "Don't disturb them"—I said, "Don't disturb whom?"—he said, "I have killed my wife"—I said, "With the revolver?"—he said, "No, with a knife; I fired at my head four times"—I asked his name and address; he gave the address, 14, Parkside—I went there that early morning; I knocked at the door, and received no answer—I noticed</p>

               <p>a bunch of keys lying on the pavement inside the iron railings in front of the shop door—the railings are about three feet from the front door, with a kind of gateway—with one of the keys I opened the front door, and, with a sergeant and constable, entered the bouse—on getting in at the front door, there is a passage leading to the foot of the staircase, and to the right, and about four or five yards further on were stairs down to the basement—the restaurant is on the ground floor—I went down the steps to the basement, and at the foot of the steps, sharp round to the right, I saw two patches of blood on the floor covered with freshly strewn saw-dust; the blood had partly soaked through the sawdust—on looking further I saw the body of a woman lying on the right side, fully dressed, in a large pool of blood—I left it in the same position until the doctor, for whom I sent immediately, came—Dr. Evans, the divisional surgeon, and Inspector Hornsby came about 6.30—the basement is used as the kitchen—the head of the body was nearly underneath the steps, which lead right into the kitchen—I did not see any signs of blood on the steps going down to the kitchen—I went in through the street door, and not through the shop.</p>

I was in the police boat on the morning of July 22nd, and heard the four shots fired—I rowed to the spot; the prisoner was taken into the boat, and afterwards to St. Thomas's Hospital—I was left in charge of him there in the ward—he said, "I have killed my wife by stabbing her with a large knife; she had worried me so much for a long time that I told her she wtmld make me murder her, but she said, 'You are too big a coward'"—he said, "I changed my shirt' before I left home on account or its being all over blood"—I made this note at the time.</p>

Having heard what had occurred on the morning of July 22nd, I went to the ward of St. Thomas's Hospital where the prisoner was in bed—he knew me personally—I said, "Mr. Mariottini, you know me?"—he replied, "Yes"—I said, "Let me caution you before I tell you what I am going to charge you with, for if you say anything I must take it down, and it may be used against you"—I then told him I should take him into custody on a charge of murder<lb/>ing his wife by stabbing her, and he would be further charged with attempting to commit suicide by throwing himself into the River Thames—he replied, "Everything is right what you say; I had a quarrel with my wife; I have been unhappy for twenty years"—I took him in a cab to Gerard Road Police-station, where he was formally charged—when the charge was read to him he said, "Do what you like; I don't care; it is true"—he was taken to the Police-court the same day; on the way he said, "I have had a miserable life"—I went to 14, Parkside, at about two and five—in a bedroom on the top floor I found a pair of boots and jacket—there was a good deal of wet blood on both boots, with saw-dust adhering to it—there was blood on the coat-cuff; the doctor ex<lb/>amined it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner and assistant divisional surgeon to the police, at 85, Pimlico Road—on July 22nd, shortly after six a.m., I arrived at 14, Parkside—I saw the dead body of a woman lying in the basement—I judged she had been dead about six hours—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination the same day—I found twenty-eight wounds altogether; twenty-five of them were punctured and incited, and three contused—two of the contused wounds were on the left side of the head, above the left ear, and the third just in front of the left ear, on the side of the face—there were two punctured wounds in the left breast, four in the left side of the abdominal wall, three on the right side, two very superficial wounds in the middle line, one above and one below the navel—all the wounds on the left side of the abdomen entered into the peritoneal cavity; two on the right entered into that cavity—the bowels were punctured in one place, and nicked in two other places—there was a punc<lb/>tured wound in the left side of the chest, which had gone through into the pericardium, the bag surrounding the heart—there were two incised wounds in the palm of the left hand, and one on the palm of the right hand; those might have been caused by the woman trying to protect her<lb/>self—there was also a punctured wound at the back between the shoulder-blades—it did not penetrate the thorax, but went deeply under the skin; its direction was upwards and forwards; its depth was about four inches, and its width one inch—it must have been done by a sharp instrument used with some violence—the deceased was fully dressed—the two wounds in the left breast had gone through her clothes; the one on the back, the one on the side, and two of the abdominal wounds had gone through her chemise—the others might have been done under her clothes—she had no corsets on—the wounds might have been caused by this knife—I think the two contused wounds above the left ear might have been caused by this part of this hammer, because the skull was fractured under the upper wound; it was a very severe wound—there was a depressed fracture half an inch long and a quarter of an inch wide, of an oval shape—the other contused wound in front of the ear might have been caused by the soda<lb/>water bottle, or by the woman falling down—the wounds, or some of them, were the cause of death—the stomach was</p>

I am the prison doctor at Holloway—the prisoner has been under my supervision since July 22nd—I have seen him daily—he has been in the prison hospital for closer observation—I have been present in Court during this trial—Dr. Bastian, Dr. Maudesley, and I have had a consultation as to his mental condition—Dr. Bastian is here—I consider the prisoner is now insane, and that such was his condition on July 21st, and that he was not then responsible for his actions, and did not understand the nature and quality of his acts—I have examined his cranium—there is a depression of the skull at the back of the head—the place to which the witnesses said he put his hand would represent the place—I should think the injury he received there may have affected his mental powers, having regard to the evidence as to the alteration in his mental condition afterwards—probably the close and oppressive weather on July 21st would aggravate the symptoms.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has stated over and over again his ideas as to his wife's infidelity, and brought very serious charges against her moral character—I can find nothing in the sworn evidence which sup<lb/>ports him—he has also stated that on two or three occasions he was de<lb/>cidedly of opinion she attempted to poison him, and that he was under the impression that she was robbing him and allowing others to do so in his business—the facts he adduced as proof of these statements seemed to me quite inadequate—my opinion is that he is now suffering from in<lb/>sane delusions—in my opinion, the evidence goes to show that during the four or five days before he committed the crime, or perhaps longer, his mental condition was abnormal, and his restlessness, excitement, inability to sleep, and inability to attend to business seem to point to a more acute state of this disease during that time—his insanity was of such a nature</p>

                  </hi>. I was the house surgeon at the London Hospital till the end of July—about two a.m. on July 23rd I saw this child—it was suffering from a wound about two and a-half inches long, far back over the frontal bone on the left side—it had been stitched up—I took out the stitches and examined the wound thoroughly, and found there was a de<lb/>pressed fracture of the frontal bone and a fracture of the parietal bone; a piece of bone had been driven back down into the brain; there were fractures over the temple, and one forward, and across into the right eye—that was verified at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the cracks of the skull extended over a considerable extent—considerable force would be necessary to produce what I saw—the depressed fracture was raised successfully, but the child died at 7.20 on July 24th—the cause of death was shock and anæmia, or loss of blood from the fracture—this spade might cause exactly such a wound—one blow could easily have caused the fracture, and there was no evidence of a second blow on the head; there was only one mark—the cracks all radiated from the one fracture.</p>

He had a punctured wound on the outside of the right elbow, about half an inch deep. There is a corresponding cut in the vest—that has since been shown me. The wound is now healed.") From a communication I received, I sought out the prosecutor at the end of the first week in August—I afterwards arrested the prisoner, whom the prosecutor saw at the Police-station—I traced the prisoner by his being known as" the Coffee Copier"—an anonymous letter was written, which I followed up, and in consequence of information I arrested the prisoner—I told him I should arrest him for stabbing a man on Bank Holiday—he answered, "I did not stab the man; I did not have a knife"—when charged he made no reply.</p>

               <p>my breakfast—when I came out the prisoner took the knife from me—I came out to see what occurred, because I heard in the lodging-house that the prisoner and the decea sed were <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi>—when the prisoner took the knife from me he held it in his hand, and the deceased saw it and walked away, and I did not see any more of him till the afternoon—I said to the prisoner, "For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Scabby</hi>, give me the knife back; don't get me into a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>"—the prisoner said, "I will keep it only to frighten him"—the prisoner went away with the knife—I next saw the deceased about five or six that afternoon—I was speaking to him in Dorset Street, when the prisoner came from Spitalfields Market way towards us, peeling an orange with the knife—the deceased walked towards the prisoner when he saw him coming down the street—the prisoner showed him the knife was in his hand—the prisoner pulled the knife from his pocket when he was about as far from the deceased as I am from the Judge—the deceased said, "You have got a knife,"and made one or two kicks at the prisoner—I cunnot tell whether they reached the prisoner—if I told the Coroner he made one kick, it was because I was excited—the prisoner then made five or six stabs with the knife at the deceased, and they clenched and fell to the ground—I cannot say if one fell on top of the other; the prisoner got up first—the prisoner was on the top when they fell—when he got up the prisoner went away with the knife—<hi rend="italic">Scabby</hi> was his nickname—in two or three minutes the deceased complained of being stabbed; I did not think he was stabbed; he did not say anything when he got up, but afterwards he said, "<hi rend="italic">scabby</hi> put two into me"—I said, "I don't think you are"—he put his hand to his side, and there was blood on the palm of his hand, and I said, "So it is; I did not think it was"—he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out coppers, and said, "I don't think I have enough for a cab"—afterwards he was put in a cab, and taken down the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, of 38, Dorset Street—at mid-day on July 26th I was in ray shop, when my attention was called to a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> going on outside between the prisoner and Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer, who lodged above my shop—the deceased was standing outside, and he came into my shop and asked me to go and stay the quarrel—the prisoner was tormenting the Dwyers by pulling them about, and having a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with them—the deceased was taking no part in that disturbance—I Asked Mrs. Dwyer to go upstairs, and not make herself a fool—she said at first she would not—I said to the prisoner, "If you hold your tongue and go away, the woman will go upstairs," and at my request he went away, and the Dwyers went upstairs—the deceased was in my shop then; when the prisoner went away he went outside—a few minutes afterwards I went back to my shop, and I heard the prisoner and the deceased were quarrelling and threatening to strike each other, and calling each other bad names—the prisoner had an open knife in his hand—the deceased threatened to punch his head, and the prisoner said, "Come on, Jack; I am not frightened of you"—I went outside, and said to the deceased, "Come inside and cool your temper, and do not take any notice of him"—I should think the prisoner could hear that, he was near enough—the deceased would not come in, but after that he went away up the street, towards Commercial Street—three or four hours after the prisoner came into my shop and showed me a knife, and said, "I met <hi rend="italic">Fishy Jack</hi> (meaning the deceased) "at the top of the street, and he attempted to kick me, and I struck him in the side with this knife"—it was a common pocket knife; I saw it at a distance of about five feet—I said he ought to have been ashamed of himself for doing so—he turned and walked out.</p>

I was house surgeon at the London Hospital on July 26th—I received the deceased there about seven p.m.—he was suffering from a punctured wound on the left side of the chest, under the arm, about two inches deep—it penetrated the cheat wall—he progressed favourably until the 29th, and then became delirious—on the 31st it was necessary to perform an operation, in order, if possible, to stop the internal bleeding—that was not successful—in his delirium he occasioned more bleeding—he grew worse, and died on August 5th—on the 7th I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found that the wound had bled internally on to the lung—the cause of death was syncope, resulting from hæmorrhage—it was such a wound as might have been produced by an ordinary pocket-knife—this coat was produced to me by the police; in it I find a cut corresponding with the wound in the man's side—he was suffering from the effects of drink when he was admitted.</p>

I aid to him, 'Why don't you leave the old people alone?I will give you something one of these times.' He said, 'If you do I will stick a knife into you.' I said, 'All right.' About five minutes after the knife was in me. He showed me the knife; it was a pocket-knife, with a blade about two and a-half inches long. I ran for a cab. I don't know what the prisoner did. I had known the prisoner before as knocking about the street; I have not seen him since till now. I did not go into the barber's shop to get a razor. I did not run into Brooke's shop to get two bottles; you ran into Brooks's after me. It was not my knife; I do not carry one. I was not drunk. I did not kick you opposite McCarthys shop. You did not have a stick in your hand; you did not strike me with the stick on the arm; you did not fall down, and I did not fall on top of you. It was an hour before that you showed me the knife. I did go into John McCarthy's after I was stabbed, to ask for some money to pay the cab.

I am in the employ of a private detective—the defendant came to me in June, wanting some documents copied—my employer was too busy to attend to them, and seeing the state of Sheldon's health, I said I would do them in my own time, and I made a dozen or eighteen copies, and addressed some envelopes, principally, I think, to his. own relations—one was addressed to Mr. Friedlander, one to Mr. Lush, and one to Mr. Hudson—it is not part of my business to copy letters—I did not give evidence at the Police-court.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Sheldon seemed very unwell and shaky, and did not seem able to hold a pen; that is why I wrote the letters—I wrote them at my own house, and he called for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical practitioner, of 68, Leman Street, Whitechapel—Messrs. Warwick, Oliver, and Hudson, surveyors, sent for me in June to see Sheldon at their office—I went and examined him, but did not take notes, not expecting these proceedings—I think he was sitting in a chair in the office—he was in a state of great excitement—he was able to go home—I saw it was about some family matter, and I did not advise him one way or the other—I did not detect any sign of apoplexy—he said he was in fear, and that would account for the ner<lb/>vous condition in which he was—he did not complain of any bodily injury.</p>
               <p>

I am one of the firm of Warwick, Oliver, and Hudson, architects and surveyors, of Leman Street—I had to be away from business for some time owing to a slight attack of brain fever, and returned from Bethlehem Hospital cured—on my return I found Sheldon had been making slanderous statements against me—on June 23rd Mr. Oliver and I called him into our room—he had been employed there at £2 a week to look after my interests—I put certain questions to him and took his answers. (<hi rend="italic">A document containing various questions and answer, the subject of the alleged libels, dealing with jamily matters, and imputing the contracting oj disease of a discreditable nature to Mr. Hudson, was then read, the witness interpolating that he had seen the mark referred to on Sheldon's hip for years when he was rubbed at the Turkish baths; that he had never kicked him, and that Sheldon had taken papets out of his cupboard during his absence.</hi>) I said I should discharge him—he said he should not take his discharge from me, but from Mr. Oliver, who engaged him—Mr. Oliver then repeated my words, and he said he should stop to clear up what he was doing—I said he must go at once, and he said he would get his hat and coat—he stayed on, and said he was ill, and I then sent for Dr. Jones—I took the doctor into my father's office, where Sheldon was sitting—he said, "I am your patient, doctor; I shall not speak to you before that man"—I said, "Very well; I will see you after you have spoken to Dr. Jones"—he said he was ill, and could not go home—I said, "Is there any reason why he cannot go home?I hare offered to pay his cab to any part of London"—the doctor said he was quite as well able to go home as I was—he took up a diary—I said, "I must have that</p>

                  </hi>. I am house physician at Westminster Hospital—I was on duty on August 12th, when the prisoner was brought in—his wife was brought in before him—she had a semi-circular wound below the lower jaw on the left side; it was quite superficial—there was another wound, also quite superficial, extending down along the front of the wind</p>

               <p>pipe from left to right—there was a superficial wound between the thumb and first finger on the left hand, a little deeper than the others—those wounds might have been caused by this razor—the prisoner was in a far more serious state; he had a wound across the front of his throat, about four inches, which had opened into his throat—it was between the larynx and the bone above—it is a serious wound—I had no opportunity of speaking to him; I took off the stocking which was across the wound, so that the air all came out from the front, and he could not articulate—he endeavoured to say something, but could not—he was admitted into the hospital, but was not under my care—I just saw him, but I had no opportunity of judging of the state of his mind—the doctor under whose care he was is not here—I do not know to where he was removed, but I saw the policeman taking him away.</p>

I am medical officer at Holloway Prison—on Septem<lb/>ber 9th the prisoner was brought to Holloway, and since then he has been under my care and constant observation—I consider him at present insane; he does not seem to realise where he is—from the evidence of his wife, I should consider that, in all probability, that condition of mind has been going on for at least some months—he has not complained to me of a pain across the back; he is generally in a poor state of physical health; mentally, I should think he has been through an attack of melan<lb/>cholia, and is now becoming demented—I think, from the evidence and his present condition, that the prisoner on August 12th was so insane as not to know the character of his acts.</p>

I am a merchant, and live at 182, Richmond Road, Dalston—just before nine p.m. on July 22nd I had just returned from business, and the girl had taken away my boots, when I heard a noise in the front, and a police whistle blowing—I went to the front door and asked what was the matter, and was told that burglars were in the house two doors away—I went out into my garden, and called to the girl to bring my boots, as I was in my slippers—while waiting for</p>

                  </hi>. I am head of the Assay Office, Goldsmiths' Hall—their mark is stamped on gold and silver wares, and also, when gold, a mark is used to represent the standard; 18 ct. or 22 ct.—the 22 ct. has the leopard's head, the lion, the letter of the year, and 22—for the 18 ct., on gold standard articles, it is the leopard's head, the crown, the figure 18, and the letter of the year, the leopard's head being the exclusive mark of the company—those marks show the standard of purity—silver articles are marked with the leopard's head, the lion, and serial letter—those marks are put upon the articles by punches; the four marks on gold articles are impressed by one stamping of one punch—assuming the marks on these articles to be genuine, they are not exactly in order; we put the crown at the top, the leopard's head to the right, the letter to the left, and the "18" underneath; here the letter is to the right, and the leopard's head to the left—there is nothing to prevent the Goldsmiths' Company nltering the order if they like—these marks on these articles are forgeries—these two marks, I should say, are genuine for a silver watch, and put on by the Goldsmiths' Hall, in London, in 1856—the pendant of the watch has "18" and a letter on it—in the ordinary way, assuming it to be a silver watch, it would have a lion and a letter—the "18" is over the lion, as if a lion had been there before—the "18" is a forgery, and the other mark is genuine for a silver watch—on the bow of the watch a forged "18" is stamped over, probably a lion—the chain has "18" upon it, forged—the ring has something to represent a set of marks, but it is a forgery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe there is a considerable trade in cheap jewellery—cheap articles have small marks upon them, but you can see them with your eye—there are marks on this which are not ours, "T.H." or "T. A.," I think, and" 86"—they would not deceive me—if articles are properly marked they must be gold.</p>

Allen and Co., of 2, Cowper's Court, and Lloyd's Bank are my customers—the prisoner was in our service, and was authorised to receive money and give receipts—Lloyd's Bank owed me £52 1s. 8d., and on August 11th I asked the prisoner if Lloyd's Bank had paid—he said,"Yes," and that he had given the money to me—it is usual for such an amount to be paid by cheque—I accepted that as truth, and referred to a memo<lb/>randum book, in which it was the duty of anybody receiving money to write it off—I found it had not been written off, but accepting the prisoner's statement, I initialled or wrote off the amount in the book—I discovered on Monday, September 6th, that the amount had been paid in,</p>

               <p>cash—Mr. Matheison found that out on the Saturday—the prisoner did not hand over to me £52 1s. 8d. in cash—it was his duty as soon as he received the money to put it in an envelope, endorse it with the name of the person paying in the amount, and hand it over to us, and we should put it in a drawer and lock it up, aud it would be paid into the bank—I am quite certain it was never handed over to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Belgrave Street, Stepney—I have known the prisoner over thirty years—he originally married my sister, and on her death a son of theirs was placed under my charge, and I was appointed guardian—in 1888 the prisoner came to live at my house, be<lb/>cause he wished to live with his son—he told me he had married a second time to Annie Louisa Robinson, but had separated from her—he lived with me as my husband from 1888 till the end of last year, when informa<lb/>tion reached me, and I told him I heard he had been walking about with a young woman; he denied it at first, but afterwards admitted it, and said that he wanted to bring her home to my house—I told him I would find his wife, and acquaint her with what he was going to do; he dared me to do it—I went to Ilford and made inquiries, and then told him I had ascertained that his wife was alive and well—that was in February this year—he asked me not to hunt her up and send her on to him, as he was determined to marry the young woman, and would do so in April, and bring her home—I said that I should leave the house before she came, and I did so—I wrote to the wife, and she called on me—this "George Heckford" in the register is the prisoner's writing, and these two documents (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were written by him in my presence—I believe this letter and envelope are his writing; the letter is in smaller characters than the envelope, and I should say it is bis.</p>

I took the prisoner on September 2nd from a description I received—he made no reply to the charge—he was put with ten other men at the station, and the prosecutor identified him—he said to the prosecutor, "Where did you find me last night at 1.30?"—the prosecutor never spoke—I examined the premises, and found that some-body had scrambled up the wall—the paint had been scraped off the area door by somebody climbing up, and three panes of glass had been taken out, and a hand could be put in and the catch pulled back.</p>

My husband is a blacksmith, of 137, Marylebone Road—he is the prisoner's son—on Wednesday, September 1st, the prisoner came round at a quarter to one, when I was just going to bed, and asked for money for his lodging—my husband gave him fourpence through the window—I know the time, because I was waiting for the clock to strike, as my husband had to go to work—he was asleep in bed, and I did not awake him—I did not answer the prisoner, but I looked out at the window and saw him; he went away, and I went to bed and went to sleep—I afterwards heard the knocker and woke my husband, who looked out at the window and asked him what he meant by knocking at the door at that hour; he said that he could not get in, because his wife had gone away, and he had no money for his lodging—my husband gave him 4d., and I went to bed again—it would take me about a quarter of an hour to walk from my house to the prosecutor's.</p>

I am a cattle-man—I came to London in a cattle-boat from Buenos Ay res—on Monday, the day we arrived, August 30th, I met the prisoner in Deptford in a public-house, about 5.30 p.m.—I was with Charles Le Brun—when we came out he told me he was from Calais—we went to the Duke of Cam<lb/>bridge, where the prisoner was refused to be served—then he sent us to another public-house—I had a Monte Video five-franc coin, and was going to pay for the drink, but they would not change it—the barman returned the coin—I had it in my hand when the prisoner took it, and let it fall on the ground, and the coin disappeared—I stooped to find it, but the prisoner put his hand in my trousers pocket—I took out my handkerchief with a sovereign and a half-sovereign tied in the corner, to see if they were safe—they were safe, and I put it back in my pocket—two others joined the prisoner—about ten minutes after we went in the second public-house, and then two women came—when the five-franc piece fell on the ground the prisoner took hold of me by the throat, then the two women and the two men struck me blows—others were in the bar drink<lb/>ing—I sent my comrade for the police—the prisoner passed my handker<lb/>chief and the money to the men before he seized me by the throat—then they tried to get away—I went outside and saw two policemen, and I had a conversation—five minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner outside the Duke of Cambridge, smoking a cigar, and I pointed him out to the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is my second voyage here—I do not speak English—we heard the prisoner say, "Calais, Calais "; then we asked him, in French, "Do you speak French?" and he made a sign, "No"—we first met the prisoner outside the public-house, and went in together—we were in the first public-house with some women the first time, but not afterwards—we were not with the women when the prisoner came in—he was in the same compartment in the second public-house—when I gave the prisoner in charge he was about forty yards away—the barman did not send for the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The women were drinking far off us on the other side, although we were speaking to them, but we did not understand each other—I did not speak any English—the only English I understand is" a pot of beer" and" money," because" money" is the same in French—we did not treat the women—in the second public-house I ordered the drinks, and the women followed in—how they came there I do not know.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Interpreted</hi>). I am a cattle-man—on Monday, Aug 30th, I was with Prim in Deptford, having a glass together—I saw the prisoner when we came out of the Duke of Cambridge—all we understood of what he said was, "Calais, Calais"—we asked him, in French, if he was a Frenchman—we did not understand the answer—he did not understand us—we went back into the Duke of Cambridge, where they refused to serve the prisoner—then he took us to another public-house, the Dis<lb/>tillery, No. 143—the prisoner ordered three glasses of beer, which Prim</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189709140071"/>
               <p>took out a Monte Video dollar to pay for—the coin was refused, and I offered to pay—Prim showed it to the other people, two men and two women, who came in about the same time—I did not recognise them—the next I saw was the prisoner holding my comrade by the throat, and the other four taking hold of his arm—Prim asked me to fetch the police—I went out, and left them in the public-house, the row still going on—I re<lb/>turned in five or ten minutes—I saw a policeman at the door—the men and women had disappeared—I was with Prim when we found the prisoner smoking a cigar outside the Duke of Cambridge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Immediately the prisoner was refused to be served, we walked to the second public-house, about fifty yards away—about a quarter of an hour elapsed—other beer was ordered when the women came in—the first I paid for, the second my comrade wanted to pay for, but the coin was refused, and five glasses I paid for—that included the ladies, who remained in our company a quarter of an hour in the Dis<lb/>tillery—the beer was poured into glasses—we had no other drinks that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I was barman at the Duke of Cambridge public-house, High Street, Deptford, on August 30th, about 5.30, when Prim and Le Brun came in and had a drink—soon after the prisoner came in—some women were in the bar—the prisoner called for drink—I refused to serve him, acting under orders, and he left with the two Frenchmen, leaving the women, who left a few minutes afterwards—four or five people went out together—the prisoner had been in before and on the previous day—I saw him in the evening, and on Sunday, the 29th.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There had been a dispute on the Sunday evening, and that was the reason I did not serve him—his friend paid for the I drinks—the Frenchmen only had one drink on the Monday night—they came in before the prisoner did—I have seen the others in the house frequently—I know the public-house called the Glass House—I have heard it called the Distillery—it is in the same street—I only know one house called the Distillery, but I have not been in Deptford long—Mullens has a shop opposite, but I do not know him.</p>

                  </hi> (484 <hi rend="italic">R</hi>). On August 30th, soon after six p.m., Prim came to me in High Street, Deptford—he endeavoured to make me understand with his left hand—I asked him, in French, if he could speak French—he answered, in French, "I have been robbed in that Distillery," and took me to the Distillery—the prisoner was not there then, but at 6.20 the prosecutor pointed him out—he was crossing the road from the corner of Charles Street, towards the Duke of Cambridge public-house, smoking a cigar—I told him I should arrest him for being concerned with others in assaulting and robbing two foreigners in the Distillery public-house—he said, "You have evidently made a mistake, governor; I was never in the house at all"—I took him to the station—an interpreter was sent for, and the prisoner was charged—on searching I found 3d. in bronze—he made no answer to the charge at the station—I know only one Distillery public-house—I know the Glass House as the Pilot—it is about 300 yards off on the other side of the road.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Lion and Wheatsheaf, High Street, Deptford, which is known as the Glass House and the Distillcry—about 5.30 or 5.50 p.m. on August 30th two Frenchmen came in, accompanied by three women and two men—seven ales were called for in English—I served Prim, who tendered a silver English coin, I cannot remember what, but change was given—when attending to other cus<lb/>tomers I heard a coin drop, and the words, "Money lost"—I turned round to see what was going on—a woman was claiming a scarf which was round a man's neck, and holding by the scarf—I sent the second barman, Walter Kent, for a constable—the prisoner was in the next compartment—while the disturbance was going on he came round the partition and looked on—he took no part in it—they all cleared out of the house—the prisoner followed the others out—in two or three minutes Prim came back with a constable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There is another house, known as the Distillery, or the Pilot, about 350 yards down the road—the Pilot is the name up outside—the compartments are like stalls opening into a passage, with a door in the last compartment, or private bar—they lead into one another—I do not remember saying, "The prosecutor said, 'Money lost!'"—I signed my deposition. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "After they had been in there a few minutes a disturbance arose, and the prosecutor said, 'Money lost.'") When I got into the witness'box the Magistrate told me to be careful what I was going to say—I believed the prosecutor called for the seven ales, as he paid for them—I could not positively swear he called for them—I did not know he could not speak English when I was called in to give evidence—I have heard it since—that is the man in the corduroy suit (Prim) who paid me an English coin for the ale, not Le Brun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was three or four yards away when Prim ordered the ale—there are four barmen; one other was in the bar with me; Walter Kent; he is outside—drink was called for only once—Le Brun did not pay for three drinks—no Monte Video dollar was tendered—the prose<lb/>cutor had one in his hand—I am not sure ales were not paid for by Le Brun—the prisoner went into the bar where the prosecutor was, facing the door, where there is a lobby and a gate. (<hi rend="italic">The witnes explained the shape of the bars by means of a rough sketch.</hi>) It is easy to get from one bar to another; they are open to the passage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman, 8, High Street, Tooting—I know the prisoner as a customer, but not by name—on July 31st, between nine and ten in the morning, he came to my shop and bought half a pound of sulphuric acid; I served him with it; it was supplied in a mineral-water bottle—I believe this is the bottle—it was labelled "Poison"—the label is not on it now—he had no bottle with him—I said I could not oblige him with a bottle, and he went out and came back with this—he said he wanted it to use as a mason—vitriol is a common name for it—since then something has been mixed with it, which has reduced its strength at least twenty percent., and altered the colour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and was house surgeon of Bolingbroke Hospital—I was not there on July 31st; I became surgeon there on August 6th—I saw Collins on that day—he had been attended by Dr. Lister—he was suffering from a burn on the right side of his face and neck; the left eyeball was burnt—he is under my observation now as an out-patient—when I first saw him his sight was not affected at all, and there was no reason to suppose that it would be—the eye-ball became inflamed, but it has to a great extent recovered, probably it will cause him annoyance to the end of his life, but, in my opinion, the sight will not be seriously injured by the accident—his sight is affected, being an old man, and he ought to wear glasses—I have seen the clothes which he was wearing at the time; they bear marks of vitriol—I have seen the con tents of the bottle, but have not tested them—some organic matter has been added to the vitriol, and darkened it—the lid of his left eye is con<lb/>tracted; that is due to the burn.</p>

On the night of July 31st the witness Bathurst came to me, and made a statement, and I went with him to High Street, Tooting, to the house where the prisoner was lodging; on the road Bathurst pointed the prisoner out to me, standing at the corner of High Street—I went up to him, and asked him if he knew anything of a disturbance here—he said, "No"—I did not say what kind of a disturb<lb/>ance, for I did not myself know what it was—I said, You had better come along with me to 19, Callinos Street"—he walked by my side, Bathurst being behind—something dropped at my feet—I said, "What's that?"—I stopped and got a light, and searched, and saw this bottle lying at my feet, between me and the prisoner—he said, "I did not drop it; I know nothing about it"—I had not seen him do anything; he was stand<lb/>ing straight—I went into No. 19, and there saw the prosecutor, and the condition he was in; he was partly undressed—at the station I sent for a doctor—the prosecutor charged the prisoner with this offence—he said he did not know anything about it—I charged him with causing the prose<lb/>cutor grievous bodily harm by throwing vitriol—he said, "I know nothing about it"—on the Monday following I saw the prosecutor's clothing; there were stains on it—I did not notice any marks on the prisoner's clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master farrier, of 7, Star Yard, High Street, Borough—on Sunday afternoon, August 1st, about 3.30, I was going home, and saw three men at the corner of the public-house gateway—someone knocked me down from behind, and, while down, I was robbed of £1 4s.—Cowmey was in front of me, and snatched my watch and chain from my pocket—they ran away—the third party I can't swear to, but I can to the prisoners—I was kicked and knocked about, and not able to do any work for three weeks—I know the prisoners—I picked Cowmey out at Staines Police-station, and Howell some days after; Howell was dressed differently when I picked him out; I did so at once—my chain is worth £3 1s. 6d.</p>
