                  </hi>. I am traveller to Messrs. Nicholls. I came from Ips<lb/>wich by the Eastern Counties Railway to the station in Shoreditch on the 30th Sept.—I saw a brown portmanteau of mine put into the luggage-van at Ipswich—it contained about a dozen coats of a new register <hi rend="italic">Llama</hi> paletôts and about eighteen French waistcoat-shapes, which I used as patterns—I had also a new edition of "Walker's Dictionary"—Mr. M'Pherson and I were together at the same hotel at Ipswich, and he having no luggage agreed to assist me—when I came to London, I went to the luggage-van to get my portmanteau, and it was gone—there had been a leather label on it, with my name on it—I have not seen the portmantean since, but some of the waist<lb/>coatings have been produced by the officers, which were part of the property stolen—some of the coats had patent pocket-protectors, and some had the <hi rend="italic">Llama</hi> hood—the "Protector" is an elastic covering on the mouth of the pocket, which prevents anything falling out or being easily extracted from it; it closes when the pocket is shut—I believe that the waistcoat-pieces pro<lb/>duced are part of what I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier. On the evening of 8th Sept. I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">London Pride</hi>—I sat on the right-hand side, at the head of the boat—just as we got by Paul's Pier, I heard the captain call out that a woman had jumped overboard with a child in her arms—I jumped on board a barge that was alongside, and saw something floating on the water, but, being very nearly dark, I could not tell what it was at the time—a waterman made towards it, caught hold of it, and held it, until with assistance, it was got out of the water—I assisted in getting her on shore, and it turned out to be the prisoner—I assisted her towards the station-house—the first words she spoke were, "What has become of my child?"—I said I sup<lb/>posed the child was all right, but that I was unable to inform her—she said it was excessive grief that had caused her to do what she had done, she was in great trouble—she also asked for some drink, and said she was very thirsty—I did not take any particular notice of her on board the boat—there were about fifty people on board.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230018"/>
               <p>a few minutes after—we waited there a minute or two, then left Hungerford, and went down the river for London-bridge—when we got opposite Mr. Lyon's granary, a little below Paul's Wharf, I was on the larboard paddle-box and my attention was directed towards the head of the boat—I saw a female with a child sitting on a chair close to the larboard fore-sponson—I thick the child was on her knee—I cannot say how old it was, but I should think about five years—I cannot say whether it was a boy or girl—I cannot say whether the prisoner is the woman—about a minute or two after I had observed them, I heard something go <hi rend="italic">flop</hi> into the water—it might have been more than two minutes after I had seen the woman and child that I missed them, and I heard some of the passengers say, "A female overboard!"—I saw something in the water outside the paddle-box, apparently a female—I stopped the boat as soon as I found out what it was, and had the engines reversed immediately—I saw a boat at a little distance ahead—I called out, "Sculler!" and Bryce came immediately—I did not see the woman taken out, it was too dark—we went on to Paul's Wharf Pier—the tide was running up, against us.</p>

I am inspector of letter-carriers at the Charing cross Branch-office—the prisoner has been a letter-carrier at that office for three or four years in the Pimlico district—a letter addressed to Emanuel Hospital Schools would be in his delivery—a letter posted at Beverley, in Yorkshire, on 3rd Aug., would be delivered in town on the morning of the 4th, about nine, or from nine to ten—after his delivery, he came to the office about twenty minutes past twelve—he was then taken into custody upon a process of the County Court—the officers were waiting at the office for his return—they brought him to me, and asked if I would see that all his letters were taken from him before he was taken, as they could not take him while he had any letters in his possession—I desired the prisoner to give up all his letters to his partner, George Feltham—he said he had done so—he was then taken by the officers—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bears the Beverley post-mark of 3rd Aug., and the London post-mark of 4th—it is open—it has been wafered—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I believe this other letter to be his—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>.)</p>

I am a warden in the Westminster House of Correction—the prisoner was brought there on the 4th Aug. under a process of the County Court—I was asked by another officer to come and search him, and I did so—the first thing I searched was his hat—I turned up the leather lining and found a piece of newspaper put in, as if the hat was too large for him—I said, "Have you anything else in the hat?" He said, "No." I then tanned down the lining, and there found the letter produced, broken open—I said, "Halloo! here is a letter!" He said, "Oh yes, it is quite right; I have deliverd the letter, and am further going to deliver it to a Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Somebody</hi>, "</p>

Eastwood, Emanuel Hospital School, James-street, Westminster, London." He said, "Yes; if I can see the next postman that comes to the prison gate, I will explain the whole particulars to him, and give it to him to take it to where I was to take it to." I was about to take it out of the enve<lb/>lope, when he very quietly took it from my hand, and said, "It is quite right"—I had not read the contents of it—I said, "I don't think you will be allowed to see the next postman; if you will tell me the particulars about it, I will give it to the postman?"—He said, "I think you will not understand it." I said, "Why; is it not written in English?"—he said, "Yes; but you won't understand it." I continued to search him, and the only money I found on him was a penny, and he acknowledged that to be all he had; but he wanted to send for some money—that was while I was searching him—I searched every pocket except his fob, and I told him to turn that out—he said, "he had nothing in it"—he bad given the letter back to me, and I gave it to Maries, who was also present during the search—I handed it to Marles with the other papers—he reported the case to the Governor, and the Governor allowed the prisoner to see the next postman—I was not present—I did not read the letter and envelope at the time I was with the prisoner—it was about five minutes to two when I searched him, and it was about half-past four the same afternoon that I saw it again—Marles was not present when I looked at it—the prisoner did not ask me for pen and ink to write a letter, nor did I see him write a letter—next day I went to the General Post-office, and accompanied Peak back to the prison—I was present when Peak saw the prisoner—Peak said to him, "You are charged with stealing a money-letter containing one shilling, directed to Master Geo. Eastwood, Emanuel Hospital Schools, James-street, Westminster, London." He said, "I did not steal it, I found the shil<lb/>ling in my pocket and meant to have returned it to the inspector on duty."—I said, "How could you do that, when you had only one penny in your pocket?"—he said, he had made use of the money previous to coming in, and he meant to have returned it.</p>

On Sunday, 27th Aug., a little after eight in the evening, the prisoner applied to me for a saddle-horse to go to Barnet, next day—it was to be sent to Neighbour's coffee-house—he gave his name William Nash, and said his office was close by—I went next morning to Mr. Neighbour and asked if he was respectable—I found the real Mr. Nash was perfectly respectable, and took the horse and met the prisoner on the steps waiting for me—I asked him for the money, a guinea; he said he had nothing but notes, but if I would go to his office and ask for his brother Thomas he would pay the money, but he said, "Don't let the clerks know; I don't wish my father to know it"—he told me to go to the Adelaide hotel, London-bridge, and order rump-steaks for his dinner, at seven—I did so—I went to Great Arthur-street, to the firm of Nash and Co., for the guinea—they dis<lb/>claimed all knowledge of the prisoner—I did not see him till he was at the station—I found the horse at the Star and Garter, Richmond—it cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for its keep there.</p>

Between four and five o'clock, on Monday morning, 9th Oct., I was on duty in Wentworth-street, Whitechapel—I heard somebody crying out in Kent-street, went, and saw the last witness, who made a complaint to me, in consequence of which I went with her to 5, Kent-street—she told me again what had happened to her—I went into the house with her, and searched all over it, but did not find the prisoner or the girl; I searched another house, and did not find them there—the girl bad lost her clothes, and required some; some one at one of the houses lent her some—I met her again on the following Tuesday, a little after nine, and went with her to the same two bouses—we did not find the prisoner—we came into the street—there were some persons standing directly opposite, and Maddon pointed out the prisoner, and 1 took him into custody—I did not tell him what it was for—Maddon was present, and he saw her—as we were going to the station he said, "Do not lead me along the street; I can walk without leading"—I said, "Nevei mind; it is no harm to lead you"—he said, "I have done nothing; I do not know what I am taken into custody for"—I said, "You will hear the charge against you at the station; some one ought to know something about it;" and he said, "So they do, if she had been stripped of her clothes, as she says she has been "—I had said nothing about her being stripped of her clothes, nor had the girl.</p>

                  </hi>. In April last I joined the Chartist Association. I do not remember on what day—the association was divided into different loca<lb/>lities in London—I belonged to the Cripplegate locality, the place of meeting for which was at Cartwright's Coffee-house, Redcross-street, Cripplegate, in a front room on the first floor—the affairs of that locality were conducted by a council of five persons—I was appointed by that council to attend a meeting of a committee at the Black Jack, in Portugal-street—it was called the secret committee—I have notes that I made from time to time of the transactions that I witnessed—that meeting at the Black Jack was on Thursday, July 20—when I got there I found Payne, Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Dowling, Allnut, a delegate from Greenwich, and others, amounting altogether to fourteen assembled—I did not then know the name of the delegate from Greenwich; I have since discovered it was Davis—I do not think I have any recollection of the persons' names who attended the meeting, except <hi rend="italic">from this</hi> paper—sometimes I made the memorandum two days after the meeting, and at the latter part of the meetings I took care to put it down when I got home on the same night—I always did it within a day or two after—I got there about nine o'clock in the evening—I was asked for my credentials—I attended as a delegate from the Cripplegate locality—I stated that I was one of the council appointed to attend there as a delegate—I produced my credential, which was a leaf torn out of a book which I had received from Mr. Bezer, the secretray of the Cripplegate locality—I gave the half to Payne, who was chairman, and he compared it with a book he had in his hand it corresponded with the leaves in that book, and he said, "That will do"—each delegate was called on to give a report of the feel<lb/>ings of the members of his locality, and the number of fighting men, and now they were disposed for a physical-force movement—each delegate made a return of the kind—I have not a note of the number, but I remember that the number I gave in was eighty or ninety—I do not remember the numbers given in by of the others—some papers and credentials, and leaves of a book in which the names of people were kept who had attended other secret meetings, were burnt at the gas—at that meeting a committee of five was elected as a plotting committee, to draw up five plans of action—those five</p>

               <p>plans were to he produced to the general body of delegates at the next meeting, and the best of those five plans was to be selected and acted on—the five persons appointed were Payne, Brewster, Rose. Mullins, and Dowling—the meeting was then adjourned to Denny's Coifee-house, Great St. Andrews-street, Seven-dials, on the following Sunday, the 23rd—I got there about ten, and found Mullins, Rose, Dowlining and Breuster there—Payne went with me—we remained there about an hour before the general meeting of delegates took place—Mullins had a pocket-book and a map of London lying on the table, and there were other plans—each of them had pipers in their hands, and were busy in conversation—I did not see the papers that the others had, except one plan—I had a perfect view of it—that was a plan of the Seven Dials—I saw Dowling take the plan into his hands, and he said he thought he could not undertake the management of the Seven Dials—he then returned the plan to Mullins, who put it into his pocket-book, and put the pocket-book into his pocket—I do not recollect that anything was said about the other plans or papers which the other members had—it was not said at ill what the other plans were—I do not recollect it—Payne took the chair at this committee—I recollect him saying, "Gentlemen, our object is to destroy the power of the Queen, and, if possible, to establish a republic"—there was a general concurrence in that observation—there was some conversation about assassinating the police—Rose said, "We must first assassinate the police, burn down the station-houses, and build barricades"—there was some conversation about pouring vitriol into the policemen's faces—I cannot say who made use of that observation, but I think it was with Rose and Brewster—those suggestions seemed to be generally concurred in—I saw one plan distinctly, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced, marked "A"</hi>)—it is the one pro<lb/>duced by Mullins, and shown to Dowling, and put by Mullins into his pocket again—a resolution was passed to admit the general body of delegates, after which they were admitted into the same room—five came in, and there were then ten present, including myself—I know Allnut—he was there, and came from Hopkinson's locality, which is Saffron-hill—when the other people were admitted, Mullins remarked that the plans were not sufficiently mtured for their inspection—a report was then given in by the new delegates who then attended of the number of fightingmen, and the feelings of the members of their locality—they were similar reports to those which had been before made—arrangements were then made to meet at Cartwright's the same even<lb/>ing—I went, and found Payne, Mullins, Rose, and Brewster there—they all went into a small back room, on the landing of a staircase that goes down into the back kitchen—they did not admit me with them—I waited until they came out again—they were in there about an hour—the next meeting I attended was at Hopkinson's Coffee-house, Saffron-hill, on Wednesday, July 26th—that meeting was in consequence of arrangements made on the Sunday—Dowling, Rose, Mullins, myself, Davis, Ferdinando, Allnut, Flanagan, and others, in all eighteen, were present—it was Ferdinando's first appearace—he stated he was a delegate from the Green Gate, Hackney-road—the fresh delegates gave in their credentials—I think they were not of the same kind as I had given, but written credentials—reports were received of the number of fighting-men from their localities, and how far they were disposed for a physical force movement; the same kind of reports as before—a resolution was then passed that Rose should wait on the <hi rend="italic">Northern Star</hi> Newspaper Office, and put in an advertisement, calling on all the localities of Chartists and Irish Confederates to send one or two delegates to attend a meeting on the next Tuesday, at the Dispatch Coffee-house, Bride-lane, Fleet-street—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230037"/>
               <p>that was adopted—delegates from the Irish Confederates attended the Chartist meetings—it was announced by one or two that evening, that they were from the Irish Confederates—Dowling was one of them—I have not got the names of the others—a resolution was then passed that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should be brought hy every delegate—I have no note of it, I speak from memory—the meeting adjourned to the following Friday, July 25th, at the same place—fourteen persons attended—Ferdinando, Page of Tothill-street, Westminster; Brewster, Rose, Mullins, Payne, myself, and Hopkinson and Fay, Irish Con<lb/>federates, Flannagan and Home—I believe it was on this occasion that a resolu<lb/>tion was passed that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. should be brought by every delegate, to pay to the committee for their purposes—a report was given in by the new delegates of the feelings of the members of their localities, and of the number of fighting-men that could be depended on—some new delegates joined at that time—we ad<lb/>journed, to meet at Cartwright's on July 30th—I attended there—there were twenty-eight persons present, the prisoner, Payne, Rose, Dowling, Fay, Bas<lb/>sett, and others—Bassett was a new delegate, and also a person named Steven<lb/>son—reports were given in from the new delegates, as before, and the commit<lb/>tee of five, the plotting committee, resigned, in consequence of a charge being brought against Rose and Mullins that they were spies, and Mullins stated that they thought the committee had better consist of nine; they thought they would be better able to carry out the objects of the committee, and each member was to draw up his plan of operation—nothing was said on that occasion as to what sort of men were to be added to the committee—Payne, Rose, Mullins, Bassett, and Dowling were then elected on the committee, and the other four were to be elected at the next meeting—Rose and Mullins were re-elected, notwithstanding the suggestion that they were spies—the general body of delegates were to elect the—other four—on the evening that the five were elected the committee was called the ulterior committee—a resolution was passed that they should meet, if necessary, on the following Monday, at Cartwright's; but there was no meeting, to my knowledge—the next meeting I attended was on Tuesday, Aug. 1st, at the Dispatch coffee-house—there were thirty-four delegates present—the prisoner, Rose, Brewster, Dowling, Bezer, myself, Fay, Thompson, and Donovan—it was Bezer's first appearance—that is the same man I have spoken of as having given me my credentials—Lynch was there, and I have put down Fus<lb/>sey, or Fusson, Warry, and Allnui—returns were made on this occasion similar to the former ones—Bezer returned the number of fifty from our locality—I knew a club or society at that time called the Irish Felon-club; it was held at Cartwright's; Fay was secretary—I do not remember that there was a Star Club—there might have been a club called the Davis Club at Cartwright's; I have heard it spoken of, and the Star Club, too, and the Emmett Brigade, the Wat Tyler, and the Tom Paine localities; I have heard them spoken of at various times—delegates from those societies attended our meetings—at this meeting some conversation took place about a feeling of jealousy prevailing on the part of the Irish Confederates, and some of them said they thought it was not fair that the committee should be composed of Englishmen alone—after a discussion, Fay, Thompson, Donovan, and Lynch, were appointed—they were all four Irish Confederates; they were added to the five to form the ulterior committee—there was then a discussion about sending a delegate to Limerick, or' Cork, and some of them made some objections to it, and said it would be a waste of time and money; it was im<lb/>possible to send a delegate there to obtain any news, on account of the dis<lb/>turbed state of the country, and the authorities had set such a strict watch,</p>

               <p>so that no person could come away with any information—the proposition was abandoned—a proposal was made by Douling that there should be a demonstration by the Chartists and Confederates on Primrose-hill at two o'clock on the following Sunday, 6th Aug.—that was lost by a majority of five—instead of that it was resolved that the delegates should return to their localities, and ascuitain how their members were for regulanty of conduct and preparation for the coming event, and they were to ascertain if they were ready to be called out at an hour's notice—money was paid in in pursuarnce of the previous resolution—I paid 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in—Mullins said he had seen Mr. kydd that day, and he had said if the people came out for physical force he would not be backward in heading them—Mullins said that Kydd said he had entered the executive only as a moral force man, and on that ground had taken office—that statement was received by the meeting with satisfaction and surprise—I knew Kydd as a member of the executive that sat in John-street, Fitzroy-square—we then adjourned to Friday, the 4tb, at Cartwright's—I attended; there were thirty-two present, Payne, Rose, Brewster, Gurney, Mullins, Donovan, Lynch, Dowling, and others—there had been a meeting of the committee an hour before that, at which the prisoner was, present, and Rose, and Bassett—it was said at that committee that Kydd had received a circular from Manchester, requesting to know how far the committee of delegates were disposed to send a delegate to Manchester, and that they had also received similar circulars at the <hi rend="italic">Northern Star</hi>-office—the committee determined to send a person, and Lacey's name was mentioned—Bassett was proposed to wait on Lacey, for the purpose of his going to Manchester—I saw Mullins give Bassett the money into his hand for that purpose—there was some con<lb/>versation about the scarfs that should be worn, as signs of officership, by the committee; and it was decided that it should be a red calico sash—the thirty-two delegates were then admitted, and reports were then given from the new delegates the same as before, and monies paid in by different delegates—a resolution was passed that the whole of the delegates should submit to the de<lb/>termination of the ulterior committee—there was some conversation about an advertisement put into the <hi rend="italic">Northern Star</hi> by a person named Dwaine, calling a meeting at Kennington-common; that was objected to by the Chartist body in general; it was considered that that meeting was not called by a real Chartist, and a resolution was come to that the delegates should call on their respective localities, and request the members to meet at their localities on that afternoon, and they were to wait until the return of the delegates from the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house, and they were to take care to secure their members from attending at Kennington-common—the delegates were to be at the Dispatch coffee-house—a resolution was passed that each delegate should select four men as telegraphs, to be stationed from Bride-lane to ken<lb/>nington-common on the following Sunday—they were to be stationed at intervals, to keep up a communication between Kennington-common and the Dispatch coffee-house, in case of any conflict between the police and the people—I attended the meeting at the Dispatch coffee-house on the Sunday—I have made no memorandum of the number present, but I believe it was about twenty-four or twenty-five—I was appointed to station the men as telegraphs—I was occupied nearly all the afternoon in arranging them; we could not get them to work—when I returned the business in discussion was just on the close—Page of Tothill-street, Mullins, Rose, Brewster, and others, were there—Page was speaking about giving Mr. Bond Hughes, the Government reporter, a good thrashing for what he had reported—it was arranged to meet on Monday night, 7th Aug., at Denny's coffee-house, Seven</p>

               <p>have requested me to give you the following instructions; and as our friend Mr. Laeey has informed us, and we have no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement, that the men of Birmingham and Manchester are up and doing, or will be up am) doing to-night, to-morrow night you must come out to fight and strike the blow; it is necessary you should speak out honestly and boldly, for there must be no flinching in the matter"—Cuffey then said, "Mr. Chairman, you had better put the question round the room, and let them answer yes or no; my time is short, my men are waiting; I take the western division"—Mullins then asked the delegate sitting next to me whether he would come out to fight—he said, "Yes"—he then appealed to me, and I said, "Yes"—he appealed to all rour, 'd till he came to Ferdinando, who rose up and made a sort of speech, and gave an explanation why he would not, and said he would not, and also another one who sat next to Allnut—with those two exceptions they all said yes—after that had been gone through, Mullins said every delegate must assemble the members of his locality at their localities at eight o'clock to-morrow night, and they were to come armed—a question was abked, how were they to come with their poles and pikes? and Mullins said, "I can only say they must get them there the best way they can"—he said, "We shall take up four positions; Mr. Brewster will take Clerkenu ell-green, Mr. Payne will take the Tower-haralets, and myself and Mr. Bassett will take the Broadway, Westminster, and Seven-dials"—I am not certain which of the two was to take either—Mullins said the delegates were to come armed, and every delegate was to be with his members at their respective positions, at twenty minutes past nine to a second—he also proposed that Ritchie should be the man appointed to superintend and direct the men for firing; and it was put and carried that he should he the person—Ritchie was present—he did not object to it—I do not think he said anything—it was proposed that they should meet at the Orange Tree, at five—that was carried—a question was put, how were these men to know Ritchie? and some delegate proposed the words "Frost" and "Mitchell" as a pass-word—it was afterwards proposed that the word "Justice" should be the pass-word; and that was carried—that pass-word was to be used by every man when he went into the room and opened the door, and Ritchie was to ask "Who do you want? What do you want?" and they were to make use of the word "Justice," and by that word Ritchie would know them—Mullins then asked every delegate round the room how many fire-men he had selected—I think the person next to me gave in his number—he appealed to me, and 1 said two—I had spoken to one—he then went round the room, and Payne put down the number on a piece of paper—forty-six was the number—almost the last words Mullins said were, "May God's bitterest curse hang on the soul of that man who shall betray any one of us"—the ribbands that were distributed were exactly like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was at a meeting next day, Wednesday, 16th Aug., at the Crispin, in Milton-street—it was arranged on the Tuesday evening, at the Lord Denman, that the different districts should meet their respective leaders; the City district, the Finsbury and Cripplegate locality, and some other districts, were all included in one, and were all to meet Brewster at the Crispin at twelve in the day, to receive further instructions: that was what was called the Clerkenwell district—I got there about a quarter to one, and found eight or ten there—Brewster was there, and Fay and Gurney—Brewster said that he meant to attack the Artillery-ground, and if possible to take it—he said that they would have to fight b—y hard; and he also said that Ritchie said he would shoot the first man that flinched from his duty—he said we should know by four o'clock</p>

Bassett stated the men of the Wallace brigade of Chartists at Westminster, were impatient for the fray, and he wished to tell the Committee they need be under no trouble in making any plan of attacking the prison where their friend Ernest Jones was confined, Tothill-fields, for the men of Westminster would undertake that business themselves: they had good auxiliaries in the men of Duck-lane, and the parts adjacent, for they had forty or fifty of their comrades in that prison, and they would be as equally glad to release them as the Chartists would Ernest Jones"—the expression "auxiliaries" is my own language—I cannot remem<lb/>ber whether "the parts adjacent" was the term used by Bassett, but "auxil<lb/>iaries" was—I swear that the sentence I have read is the language word for word for I delivered it to Marks—I was not a Chartist—I did pretend to be one, to defeat their plans—I did not enter with the intention of serving myself—I had not the slightest idea of doing myself a service—I went there entirely from motives of public good—I thought the Government did not know what was going on, and there would be an outbreak and destruction of life and property, and if I could save it, I was entitled to do so—that was my motive—I have asked people to come up to the meetings, but not to join the Chartists—I have sold arms in the way of my trade—I am a broker and dealer in old boots, and what arms I have sold, I have sold in the way of trade as a broker—I am not a marine store-dealer—I make new boots, and am a <hi rend="italic">translater</hi> as well—I have sold two guns and one sword within the list six months—I have tried to sell a pair of pistols, but I did not—here they are (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I tried to sell them for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I brought them to prove that I did not sell them—I never offered to sell any more arms than these pistols—I never unged men in the neighbourhood of Greenwich to buy arms of me to join the Chartist movement, and to break out in insurrection against the Government—the Druids' Arms, at Greenwich, is where the meetings were held—I first began to be a Chartist about 24th May—I was the cause of removing the meeting from Deptford to the Druids' Arms—the landlord of the Druids' Arms paid me for it—he left me out money when I wanted it—I had half-a-crown, sometimes five shillings, and sometimes half-a-sovereign of him—I believe that was because I lost my time, and he made me a remuneration for it—I only once got half-a-soverein; generally speaking it was rather less—I do not believe I had altogether more than 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer and tea-dealer, and keep a post-office at No. 86, Upper-street, Islington. On Thursday, 28th Sept., I marked three half-crowns and one shilling, between four and six o'clock in the afternoon—I put them in my till—there was no other half-crown there—the prisoner was my shopman—he had been in my service about twelve months before, as a warehouseman—about two hours after I had put the money in the till, the half-crowns were all gone—I had only been in to take my tea—there had been two or three customers in the shop—I had an engage<lb/>ment out, and did not return till ten at night; my shop was then shut up—I did not say anything to the prisoner till the Monday evening following, when be came in and told me he thought he should not be able to get through the work, that he must leave—I said, "Why?"—I had not made any complaint—I then said, "Wareham, you have been robbing me "—he paused, and seemed very much confused, and said, "Will you forgive me, sir?"—I said, "That depends on circumstances"—I then asked what money he had in his pocket—he said he did not know—I said, "Certainly you know what you have got; what have you got up-stairs?"—he said he did not know—I sent for a policeman, and gave him in custody—he was searched at the station, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one half-crown found on him, but not one of those I had marked—the policeman came back with me and<lb/>the prisoner, and searched his boxes—there was found 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in his trowsers pocket—his wages were 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, but he had not been paid, as he had not been a quarter with me—among the money, I identified this half-crown—I have no doubt of its being mine—I cannot speak to any of the other money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 21). At eleven o'clock on Tuesday morning, 3rd Oct. I met Rehden, at the Red Lion public-house, St. John-street-road—I had an appointment, made by himself, to meet him there, for the purpose of receiving information from him where to take Hare, and obtain the property which had been obtained by Hare (his uncle) under false pre<lb/>tences—having met Rehden, he said to me, "If you will place at once in my hand three sovereigns, I will give you information that will enable you to take Hare into custody-tody"—I said, "If you also enable me to recover the pro<lb/>perty, I will do so"—the property amounted, he said, to about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "Very well, I will do so"—I gave him the three sovereigns, and he turned round and laughed at me, and said, "You may go 10 the station-house, and there you will find him"—I asked him for my money—he refused to give it one, and said, "You may do your best, you may do your worst"—I said I should take him to the station-house, and charge him with obtaining three sovereigns from me under false pretences—I took him into custody, to the Bow-Lane station—I went to 10, Powell-street West—Rehden gave his address there—he did not tell me what room he occupied—some person in the house told me he lodged there, but the room was not pointed out—I went to a room on the second-floor, I think, a back room—a young woman pointed out a portmanteau to me in that room—I found in it sixty or seventy dupli<lb/>cates, amongst which were those of the pawnbrokers' who have been exa<lb/>mined</p>

               <p>—I also found this paper—I do not know whose writing it is—I have seen Rehden write—I believe the words "read" and "private," which are indorsed on the outside, are his writing—this list contains an account of all the property taken by Hare—when Rehden made an appointment to meet me to give his uncle into custody, he gave me this card, "Mr. C. Rehden, Powell-street West, Goswell-road, No. 10."</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to the prosecutor. On the night of 4th Sept., when the bouse was said to be robbed, there was no female in the house but Chalton—no one else was in the house but me and Rennell the apprentice—I know Langley; he had been there on four successive Sundays to see Chalton—on one occasion, about two months previous to 4th Sept., I went into my bed-room, which is parted off from the kitchen, about one o'clock in the day, and saw Langley under my bed—Chalton cooks in the kitchen—she was down there—they could hear me run down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Sir Henry Meux an another. I had the management of the storehouse—the prisoners were in their service—Biddle had the management of a van; Farr was foreman under the loading clerk, to see that the drays were properly loaded—he would know, as a matter of course, what were the loads the drays should take out—on 9th Sept., about a quarter before eight o'clock in the morning, I gave Farr instructions about loading some beer, and what to do while. I was gone to breakfast—he suggested that Biddle's van and team were at liberty, and there was a load of sea-beer to go, I think, to Beresford's-wharf—he went to the storehouse, returned, and said they were not ready, but there were four puncheons and six hogsheads ready, which Biddle could take to Gun and Shot-wharf, Tooley-street—I left with him two delivery-notes, one for the four puncheons, and one for the six hogsheads, in the ordinary course of business—it would be Farr's duty to confine himself to the loading of the matters mentioned in the delivery orders—I did not instruct him to take any other articles by Biddle's van—I had given Potts instructions—I returned a few minutes before nine—Potts made a communication to me—I went to Gun and Shot-wharf, and found that the goods had been delivered—I did not find any other goods of ours there—at a quarter-past two that day I saw Biddle in the Brewery-yard—I asked him what he had brought back with him—he said, "Two kilderkins and one empty barrel"—I asked if he had brought any full casks—he said, "No"—I saw him again that evening near the brewery with his van and horse—I gave the van and horse to another man, called Biddle into the counting-house, and asked what he had done with two barrels of beer that he had taken in the morning loaded into the tail of his van—he denied having had them—I received from him his delivery-notes for the beer delivered at Gun and Shot-wharf, and it appeared that was delivered right—he gave me the difference between 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the money which he had paid—I gave him into custody—I sent for Farr, and asked him two or three times what bad become of the two barrels he had loaded into Biddle's van—he denied having loaded any.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Charlotte-street, Whitechapel. On Tuesday evening, 12th Sept., I was in Whitechapel,—between six and seven o'clock, and saw Susan Cooiidge on the kerb on the right side opposite the Church, in the act of crossing—I was close behind her—when she got about the centre a cart came along very furiously; the prisener was driving it, another man was in it—Susan Coolidge was knocked down very quickly—the wheel went over her shoulder—she cried out, "Oh!" when the wheel touched her—the cart went on about thirty yards—I believe it was stopped by the by-standers—I saw Susan Coolidge at the doctor's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farrier, of Saracen's Head-yard, Aldgate. On 12th Sept., about twenty minutes past six o'clock, I saw the horse and cart coming along at a very fast rate, seven or eight miles an hour—the pri<lb/>soner was driving it—I saw him strike the horse previous to coming up to the place—he had got a pipe in his mouth—the young woman came out of a shop, passed me, and crossed the road—the near wheel struck her on the side, which <hi rend="italic">slewed</hi> her round, and the wheel went across her shoulder—she had a plate in her hand, and was going to get some butter—she did not cry out—</p>

               <p>I do not believe the men in the cart saw her no more than she saw them—the road was quite clear—the cart went on about sixty yards—I went across the road to assist in picking the young woman up, and taking her to Mr. Cook's, the chemist—he sent me' to get the name on the cart—it was a wine-merchant's cart—if the men had seen it, there was plenty of time for them to stop—the prisoner was talking to the other man in the cart—the horse was galloping, as they had struck it just before—they were pulling its head at the time, whether to check its speed or make it go faster I do not know.</p>

I was present when Burrows was brought to the station—the inspector asked her how she came by those pencil-cases—she said she received them in Oxford-street, on the previous evening—he said be knew more about them than she was aware of—she said she did not know the man's name, but Johnson, meaning me, knew him well—I asked her who it was—she said she could not tell me his name, but described him to me—I was satisfied that I knew him—I went to Snow's-rents, saw Mrs. Cox, and asked her to accompany me to the prisoner's room—she did so—I found this smaller case among the blankets in the second-floor front room, at 100, York-street, this strap," which bound up the leather case, and these pattern-cards, under the sacking—it was Warren she described, and not the gentleman Oxford-street.</p>

On 20th July the prisoner came to me and showed me a gold watch, very much like this, with the glass broken—she said it was hers; she had been to get it out of pledge for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked how she got 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in so short a time in her situation—she said, a gentleman bad been very kind to her—she was going to back some plate, and asked me to go with her—I asked how she came by the watch—she said the father of her child gave it her; she had had it for years—she asked me if the chain was gold—I said I did not know—she said, "I know it is not, for I have been to a jeweller's shop and found it was not"—she said she should throw it away—I said, "Give it to me"—she gave it to me—I went with her to a pawnbroker's, but waited outside-six or seven weeks ago I met her in Holborn, and she had the watch and chain round her neck—it had a new glass—I think this is it—I asked her if her mistress allowed her to wear a gold watch in the house—she said yes, the better she dressed the better she liked it; and to tell roe the truth a gentleman gave it her who frequently came into her bed-room at night, and she made a noise one night, and he said, "For God's sake be quiet," and hang it round her neck, and made her a present of it—she sent for me to the House of Detention, and asked me to be her chief witness—I said, "What for? I know nothing of the watch"—she said, "Yes you do; I want you to say that when you brought the body of Mrs. Low's dress home, that Mrs. Low brought the watch in a piece of paper, and asked you to get a new glass put into it"—I said, "Certainly not"—she said, "Oh, do! I would do as much for you if you were in trouble"—I never had a minute's conversation with Mrs. Low about the watch—I gave Mrs. Low this chain at Bow-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am not now in any habitation—I did live in White Horse-yard, Drury-lane—I am a porter in Covent Garden-market. In May last I went to lodge at the European Coffee-house, in Long Acre, which was kept by Beaumont—I left on Monday 21st Aug., as near as I can recollect—I had known Beaumont before, by using the House, and I had lodged there pre<lb/>viously—she spoke to me several times about firing the house—she said she would not mind giving 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to any one to do it—that was about a month or six weeks before I went away—she said, as she had known me so long, she would not mind giving me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to set fire to the house—I said I would con<lb/>sider of it, or something to that effect—I knew that the house and property were insured—Beaumont showed me the policy on three different occasions—isaw that the amount was for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after I had told her that I would con<lb/>sider this proposition of hers, I saw things taken away from the house several time?, such as baskets of China and glass—I saw the bedding cut up and made into pillows—I saw Fitzgerald (who was servant in the house) take the pillows away; she told me it was by Beaumont's orders—I have seen her take them away when Beaumont was in the house—on the day that I left, Beaumont said the things were ready, and asked me what time it would be convenient to me to set fire to the house—she said the Thursday would be convenient for her, and would I go to tnke tea with her—this conversation took place in the little bar—I do not know that there was anybody there but Beaumont and I; Fitzgerald might have been in and out, following her occu<lb/>pation—I said the Thursday would suit me, or words to that effect—I led her to believe that I would do it—I went again on the Tuesday—I do not recollect that anything passed respecting this matter—she sent for me on the Thursday, and I went about five o'clock—Kitzgerald went in with me-Beau<lb/>mont was not there, but a young woman was, who was a stranger-Beaumont wme in, and 1 had tea with her—she said all was ready, and we might as well go through with it, as things bad gone so far—she said she had appointed to go to the theatre with Fry, at half-price, and that I was to set</p>

               <p>she put a light, or a lighted greasy paper, under the place where the old newspapers were kept, and it was all on fire in a moment—this was on the Saturday—on the Monday I was in Covent-garden market-Fitzgerald came to me there—she told me that Beaumont wished to speak to me, and would I go to No. 13, King-street, Long-acre, that is where her brother lived—I went there after Fitzgerald had left me—I saw Beaumont's brother—I waited a few minutes, and Beaumont came in—it is a little shop—her brother was in the private parlour-Beaumont said I need not be afraid, she would give me the remaining 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as though I had set fire to the house myself—I think she said I was not to mention it to anybody, I was to keep it a secret—I said, "Very well"—I then came away—on the Wednesday afterwards I saw Fitzgerald again in Covent-garden market, or somewhere adjoining; I think it was in James-street—I gave her a note to take to Beaumont—she came back after she had taken it, and told me that Miss Beaumont said I might do what I liked; if I said anything concerning the fire, that she would charge me with stealing some books that I had the care of—there were three books, a writing-desk, a bird-cage, and some other trifling things, that she had given me—I told Fitzgerald I would go and give information to the Fire-office—she said I might go as soon as I liked—I do not recollect that anything more passed on that occasion—I think I saw Fitzgerald again on the Friday—I told her I had communicated to the Insurance Company (which I had not; I did not make the communication till the next day, the Saturday)—she said I had done very wrong in stating that she had set fire to the house, it was a mistake—she said I had misunderstood her when she told me that Fry had proposed to bring 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of combustibles to put under the cup<lb/>board—that might have been on the Wednesday; it was after the fire—I informed the Insurance-office on the following day, and on Monday, the 4th, I attended at Mr. Storr, the agent's office—I found Miss Beaumont there, and her sister, Mrs. Matthews—I waited till Mr. Storr sent for me in-1 was in the same room with Miss Beaumont and her sister, the public auction-room-Miss Beaumont came to me, and asked if I had been sent for there—I said, "No," I was come there to meet a friend—she asked me to go out<lb/>side with her, which I refused to do-Mrs. Matthews came, and said there was something very mysterious between her sister and me, and she wanted to know the meaning of it-Miss Beaumont told her there were some trifling sums of money that she owed me; if I would make out my bill she would pay me—I told Matthews it was no use asking me such a question as that, that she knew all about it—Miss Beaumont said if I would go outside with her, or meet her at her brother's at three o'clock, she would give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I refused that, and soon after, Mr. Storr called for me, and 1 went out of the room, and left them to themselves—I knew there was a ladder at the house that was burnt; I had seen it several times—it was kept down stairs in the passage, and sometimes I have seen it at the top of the house—Miss Beaumont desired me to take it from the passage up to the top of the house—there is a trap-door opening at the top of the house—I put the fodder on the top land<lb/>ing; that would enable a person to get out at that opening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of the firm of Debenham and Storr, of King-street, Coven t-garden. We act as agents and valuers to the Westminster Fire-office. On 30th Aug., I went to 21, Long Acre—I had that day got a claim from the prisoner Beaumont—she called on me on the following day, the 31st, on the subject of that claim—I asked her about the policy—she said it was destroyed by the fire-in this claim there are forty aprons charged: a black satinette dress, unfinished; a black velvet shawl, embroidered; a cashmere dress; a black satin shawl; a black satin dress, unfinished; a pair of fur cuffs; and two water-coloured cuts, with gilt frames—when I was in conversation with Beaumont, the claim was in my hand, and it was discussed—on the 2nd Sept., I went to Cottrill and Harrison, pawnbrokers in Drury-lane—I saw something there that I thought important, and I made an appoint<lb/>ment with Miss Beaumont to see her at her brother's at three o'clock that day—she came, and I asked her to describe the satinette dress, and what she meant by the term unfinished—she said that it was a satinette in the length, not made up—I asked her the same question in reference to the black satin dress, and she gave the same answer—she said that one of the dresses, either the satin or the satinette was complete, with the exception that a piece had been cut off for an apron—I appointed to see her again at eight in the evening, and Is saw her at her brother's—I asked her what kind of dress the cashmere dress was, and she said an old one, and unpicked; that she had had it for a deceased relative—she said that the cuffs matched a large fur cape, and that they were squirrel-fur—she said one of the water-coloured portraits was of her sister, and the other of herself—she described the sizes-one was in a gold frame, about eighteen inches, and the other a miniature, in a black enamel frame—on 4th Sept., on my return to my office, I found Fitzgerald there, about ten—she was ordered into my room—I asked what she wanted—she said her name was Fitzgerald, that she was servant to Miss Beaumont, and she had called for the purpose of giving me information respecting the fire in</p>

               <p>Long Acre—I took down what she said on this paper—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"I heard Miss Beaumont say to Baxter that she would give him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he would set fire to the house; this was three months ago. She said she was highly in<lb/>debted, and she owed three quarters rent to her landlord, and he would not grant her a lease, and therefore she would injure his house. Accordingly she kept sending me out with her clothes to pledge; this was about last Saturday fortnight, but others were taken about three weeks before that. She told me it was to pay her landlord, and instead of that, when she received the money altogether, and the trinkets, she told me that she would take the money and trinkets to Mrs. Robinson, of Oxford-street, shoemaker. On last Thursday week a young man called upon Miss Beaumont, and took her out, as they said, to the Hay market theatre—on that day, before they went, she agreed with Baxter to set fire to the house, but he never said he would or he would not do it—she laid down 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the dresser, and said to him, (Baxter), 'I won't give it into your hands, in case that I should be put to my oath that I gave you any money'—Baxter took the money up—I was standing at the sink washing cups and saucers up—after that, Miss Beaumont and her young man went away, leaving myself and Baxter in the house—when Miss Beau<lb/>mont was gone, he turned round to me, and said if he could get 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to do it, he would not do such a thing, and he would go off into the country before she could pull him up for the money—he then went away—in the course of the day I heard Miss Beaumont and the young man in conversation about setting fire to the house—the young man said to her, 'Get three shillings-worth of powder, and put it into some greasy paper, and place it near the fire, and it will blow the roof up'—Miss Beaumont returned half an hour after Baxter had gone—the young man came the next morning to breakfast—Beaumont told him how Baxter had served her out about the money—he was there all day talking to Miss Beaumont about the fire, settling how it should be done—she promised him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also that when she got her money, she would go to Australia with him, and if I would like to go with her she would take me as her servant, or if not, she would give me some money—I told her I did not want her money, and that 1 was never bribed to do such a thing-Miss Beaumont sent me out for a threepenny stamp, upon which they wrote something which they told me was by the God above, this secret was not to be revealed by either of us—she signed this paper after he had done so, and then made me put a cross to my name to it—after doing this I got frightened and ran away, and went to my cousin—Miss Beaumont came after me there, but she did not see me, as I had hid myself—this was in the afternoon, from one to four o'clock—I returned to Long Acre about half-past four—Miss Beaumont went out and bought me a pair of bouts, and brought them to me, and told me she was going to Cre<lb/>morne Gardens that night with the young man, she would not return before one o'clock—she said that I had better go to bed after the shop was shut, and when she came home she would ring double—when I was at tea, Mrs. Robinson came in—she (Miss Beaumont) and the young man went up-stairs, and remained there more than an hour and a half-before Mrs. Robinson went, she took three or four large books out of the bar, on the shelf on the right hand side as you go into the bar from the coffee-room, over a little box—Mrs. Robinson said they were nice books, and it was a pity that they should be destroyed, and I said, 'Do you know that my mistress is going to do such a thing? and she answered me and said she never was astonished so much as when she returned to her own home, after she had been out during the day, to find a large parcel or Miss Beaumon's containing duplicates and money and</p>

I am attached to the fire-engine department—I went to the bouse in Long Acre on the night of the fire—I was called about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock, and got there in ten minutes—I found the back part of the house, No. 53, on fire—the front-door was closed when I got there—I broke it open—I and one more walked in together-from what I saw I judged the fire had begun in the coffee-bar at the back part of the house—there were books burning; after we had extinguished the fire, we discovered them to be on the floor—all the coffee-bar was on fire all round—we afterwards noticed that there was a boiler in the fire-place, and a kettle over the gas—the gas projected from a post, and the kettle hung over it—I did not see any gas alight—I mean the kettle was hanging over where the gaslight—burner was—the wood-work all round the bar was on fire, the back-front of the window, and back of the house—the fire had scorched the shop, but it had not broken the windows in the front shop—I and my companion succeeded in putting the fire out in about a quarter of an hour—I afterwards went over the premises, and examined them carefully—in the first floor there was a pianaforte, a wardrobe, a carpet, a table and chairs in the front-room, and in the back-room a bedstead, a bed, and blankets—in the second-floor front-</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as clerk to the Magistrate, at Bow-street, when the examination of the witnesses in this case took place—after the examina<lb/>tion, Fitzgerald was asked if she desired to say anything—it was explained to her that if she did it would be given in evidence against her—I took down what she said from her lips—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"From the time I entered Miss Beaumont's service, Miss Beaumont kept me a prisoner. She told me that she was highly indebted, and that she was talking to Baxter about setting the house on fire. She would not let me speak to Mrs. Moore at all. I gave her warning to leave; she would not take my warning; she knew that I was very easily led, and she began to flatter and coax me to stay with her. She told me she was going to Australia with Baxter and her brother; that she would get a farm and land there with her insuring-money, and that if I wished it I should go with her. I refused to go. She used to go down and speak privately with Baxter; they talked very seriously together for about three weeks. Miss Beanmont has asked me to open the feather-beds, and two of them I opened for her, and filled bolsters and pillows with the feathers, and I pawned them two or three at a time by her direction. I pawned some of them at first in the name of Smith, and the others she told me to pawn in my own name, bat that I was to give a wrong address. I pawned a great many dresses, china, and other things, for Miss Beaumont. I took out a great many boxes and bundles for her. I showed Baxter the money and the duplicates for most of the things I pledged. She sent me up stairs to coax Baxter to set the house on fire, and to tell him that if he would go to Australia with her she would marry him when she got there. About two days before the fire I brought down two bedsteads by Miss Beaumont's direction, and I assisted her in chopping it up. She said she wanted to set fire to four places to destroy the whole house. On the Thursday before the fire happened, Miss Beaumont spoke seriously to him about it, and it was agreed that the house should be set on fire that night. He went away, and when he was gone Miss Beaumont sent me for a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stamp. She told me to go for Baxter, and she said she wished me to be a witness that she gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to set the house on fire that night. I went for Baxter, and I showed him. the stamp, and told him that he was to have 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he was to sign his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230128"/>
               <p>name to that. He said he would not du it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. When I canie back, the prisoner Fry was in the coffee-room, and when Miss Beaumont came in she said she was going to the Haymarket Theatre with Fry, and that Baxter was going to set fire to the house then. When Baxter told me he would not have anything to do with it, I made myself perfectly agreeable to him. When Fry came into the bar she blew out the candle, and lowered the gas. She then went out to the Haumarket, with Fry, and then Baxter told me he would not do it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he would go off into the country, and he did go. She returned home about half an hour after going away. Her brother was in the coffee-room. She told me that Fry had left her, and that she felt miserable; and that thinking the house was on tire she came out to see how the place was getting on. She staid looking out for Baxter till half-past twelve o'clock, and then told me he had acted very wise not to do it that night, because it was the Opera night. She then said she would do it herself if she could not get any one else to do it. The next morning she sent me to look for Baxter. I found Baxter's late master, Mr. Davis, and he came up, and saw Miss Beaumont, and told her that he (Baxter) had gone into the country with a young man "hopping." Miss Beaumont then told me that she would try and get the prisoner Fry to do it. He (Fry) came, and had break-fast that morning, and she told him how Baxter had served her, and then said she would give him (Fry) 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if we would do it, and we both refused. She then persuaded Fry to put his name to the stamp, and she put her own name to it, and she made rue put my mark to keep the secret. She read it over. The words in that paper are the same I gave Mr. Storr. She wished Fry to sleep in the house. He refused. I heard Fry say to Miss Beaumont, 'If you get 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of gunpowder, and put it in a paper, that will blow the house up.' She said, 'Would not turpentine do better?' In the evening she told me she was going to Cremorne-gardens with Fry. In the evening Mrs. Robinson came, and she went up into the front room with Miss Beaumont and Fry; and after that Mrs. Robinson came down stairs, and took three books, and she said it was a pity they should be destroyed; and she said to me, 'Be sure to do it, and do it so that it will not be known that it was done with hands.' I told her not to be puzzling me. She said I was to be very careful how I did it. I did not answer her either way. She said she was frightened, Miss Beaumont had told it to too many, and that it would be found out. The night of the fire Miss Beaumont and Fry went to Cremorne-gardens. That night after they were gone, Baxter came to the private door, and he asked me what Miss Beaumont had said about his not setting fire to the house. I told him she said he had done very right, as it was the Opera night. He said he would not do it for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said if he did not do it somebody else would, and that perhaps I would; and I told him it was to take place either that night, or the night after. He said be never intended to do it, and he went away. I fastened up the doors. I washed a coarse apron, and then hung it up before the fire in the bar, on the back of a chair, near enough to catch fire. There were files of bills hanging round by the fire. I went up stairs to bed, and was in bed about an hour, I suppose, when the ringing and the knocking came, and I was almost smothered with the smoke. I got up, and went up the steps that Baxter had taken up stairs, and I got out through the sky-light on to the roof, and then began to cry. I was taken down, and I was afterwards taken to Beaumont's, in King-street, and there Beaumont and Fry came to me, and asked me how it took place, and I said I did not know; and Fry asked me how it took place, I said I did not know. Miss Beaumont gave me three books and a writing-desk,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230129"/>
               <p>and told me that if Baxter said anything I was to join her, and swear that he had stolen them. I went away from her, and saw nothing of her till the next day. She told me to say that the dresses I had pledged for her, and the china I had pledged for her, were burnt in the fire; and she also told me to say that the pictures she had given to me to take care of were burnt in the fire. She said as soon as she got the insuring-money she would go into the country, and take me wirh her. She told me to say at the Fire-office that there were two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, and some gold and silver in the little box that she gave me, which there were not; for there were no 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes; there was no money at all, except a few halfpence that I had put in. She told me to say that the satin dresses were also burnt. After I came from the Fire-office we went to 53, Long Acre, and Mrs. Matthews was with us; and Beaumont said that I should come over the water with her, and Mrs. Matthews said, 'Would it not be better to have 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than to be raking about.' On the Monday following I went with Beaumont to the Fire-office, and from there to her brother's, and then she told me that if I saw Baxter I was to snap my fingers at him, and that if he said anything she would charge him with stealing bird-cages, books, a desk, and carpenters' tools, and that I was to do the same; and I did not see her again until I was in custody. I met Baxter, and he told me that he would give information, and that I had better come forward and speak the truth, whatever I might suffer; for he was sure to give information. I have nothing further to say; my mistress has led me astray.—<hi rend="smallCaps">MARY JANE FITZGERALD</hi>, + her mark.—Taken before me this 13th Sept., 1848.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Nottingham-place. On 8th Sept. between seven and eight in the evening, I was in Fieldgate-street—I was surrounded, and received a violent blow with a blunt instrument on the back of my head, which deprived me of my senses—when I came to I missed my watch from my waistcoat-pocket—the guard had been cut—my pocket was turned out, and four sovereigns and a shilling were gone from it which were safe five minutes before—I called, "Thieves! Murder!"—the watch was returned to me—I have suffered from concussion of the brain ever since; I never had an hour's illness before.</p>

On 13th Oct., about eight o'clock, I saw a bag of sugar on the quay in the London Docks, which had been cut open in two places—it was not full, but the other bags were—some sugar was spilt near there—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Red Port</hi>, which was ten or twelve feet from the bag, and found the prisoners and another in the forecastle—a light was burning, and a bag of white sugar, similar to this, was lying in the locker—Frazer handed me a pillow-case, containing 7lbs. of white sugar—I asked the prisoners if it belonged to them—they said they knew nothing about it—I went to a hammock which Pendrill said was his, and found in it a small box, containing 5lbs. of the same kind of sugar, with "R. P." on the lid—I asked him if it was his-be said, "Yes, those are my initials; I do not know what is in it"—I opened it, and said, "It is sugar"—he said, "1 know nothing about it"—on the locker I found a bag, containing 4 1/2 lbs. of the same kind of sugar—in a bed which Cox said was his, I found a bottle, containing brown sugar, at the bottom, and white sugar, like this, at the top—it weighed 5lbs.—Cox said, "That is mine"—I asked where it came from—he said, "From the quay"—I said, "Where from?"—he said, "From a bag;" that was in Pendrill's hearing—I took Cox to the bag, and said, "This bag is cut"—he said, "Yes, that is it; but I did not cut it"—I took a sample from it, and it corresponded with the sugar found—that in the box was patted down, I think, by a spoon, to make room for some clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Rose and Crown, Broad-street, St. Giles's—the prisoner was in my service eighteen months—she used to act in the bar. On Thursday, 5th Oct., I marked six shillings and eight sixpences, and put them in two tills at each end of the counter—in about half an hour I missed a marked shilling and two marked sixpences—I sent for an officer, and asked the prisoner in his presence when I paid her her wages last—she said in May—I said, "Yes; what money have you in your possession?"—she said, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked if she could account for that—she said, "It is mine"—I said I suspected she had been robbing me, and I had put marked money into the till and missed it—I said if she would tell me the truth I would forgive her—she still denied it—her box was brought down from her bed-room after she was taken to Bow-street—I know it was hers, because she bought it of my wife—the officer broke the lock, and found 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and silver—there were twenty-six sixpences, two of them marked, and three marked shillings; also this halfpenny—these are them—they are marked as I marked them.</p>

"on Saturday last, between two and three o'clock"—I said, "How long did it live?"—she said, "Only a few minutes"—I said, "Where were you going to take it?"—she said, "To a woman in Chelsea, who promised to bury it for me"—after this, she said, "Oh, sir, what do you think will be done to me; tell me your real opinion; do you think I shall be hanged?"—I said, "It is impossible I can know "—she said, "I would not have done it, if that woman had not promised to put it out of the way"—I then took her to the station, and the basket also—Mr. Pearce, a surgeon, was called in—I examined the basket in his presence, and found it to contain the dead body of a male child, forced into this stocking—the whole of it was forced into the stocking, headforemost—a mark, which was on the upper part of the stocking, was cut out—it was wrapped round with this piece of gown, and I found a gown of the same stuff in the prisoner's bed-room—I searched the room, but could not find any baby-linen, or anything of the kind.</p>

On 14th Oct., I was desired to examine the body of a child at the station-house—Inspector Cum<lb/>ings was present—it presented the appearance of a full-grown male infant, born at the full period—it had eighteen inches of the umbilical cord attached to it, which had been divided, without any ligature, and the body had been forced into the half of a stocking—I opened the body, examined the chest, removed the lungs and heart, and from the appearance they presented, I was fully satisfied that the child had respired—the lungs did not appear to have been completely inflated—it is sometimes the case that a child will have a partial or even a full respiration before it actually leaves the mother's body—there was extravasated blood within the lips; the eyes were strongly injected with blood, and the membranes of the brain, and the brain itself, gorged with blood; those symptoms are all referable to pressure—I cannot say confidently that those symptoms must have been occasioned by pressure after the child had wholly left the mother's body—there were no marks of external violence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Cox, of 7, George-passage, Snow-hill—he has rented the house for four years—we let part of it—the prisoners lodged in the second-floor front room-in the course of Sept. they owed us eight weeks rent—we asked them for it, and could not get it—we then gave them notice that they must either leave or pay—my husband went to a broker, and while he was gone Mrs. Shea came down, to me, and said, "Tell your husband to bring up the bill?"—I said he was not in; when be came in I would tell him—she came down twice after that—my husband and the broker came in afterwards—they went up, and could not get into the room; the door was locked-Mr. Shea said he was to bring the bill by-and-by, and he would pay it when his wife came in—she was out then—she afterwards came in, and went up stairs—she went out twice again, and after she went up again I went and knocked at the door—Mr. Shea opened it—I said, "Mr. Shea, this is the broker's-warrant; will you settle this, and leave in peace?"—he said, "I will pay you"—I had gone into the room—Mrs. Shea came in at the time, and struck me with something, I did not see what, over the head, and knocked me down—she said nothing to me—Mr. Shea jumped on my stomach, as I was on the floor, and threw himself with his knees over my chest and stomach, and held me down, and she kicked me violently in the lower part of my body; I am very lame now—I screamed out "Murder!" and my husband came up to my assistance—I afterwards saw Mrs. Shea with a hammer—when my husband came in they got off me, and went to him, and Mrs. Shea knocked him down with a blow of the hammer on the fore<lb/>head—I got up, and said, "For God's sake, Shea, do not kill my husband!"—he said, "Yes, I will, and I will do for the pair of you"—I threw myself over my husband, trying to keep him from the blows, and then I turned round—I saw a shoemaker's knife and hammer in each of their hands—she had a large hammer with a large bottom to it, and he had a small one—we were beaten with them, and <hi rend="italic">cut in two</hi>—I was cut in the back of my head—I bled violently, and then they got off, as we were covered with blood—they got up to shut the door, arid I got up as well as I could, covered with blood, with no cap or anything on—I got to the window, screamed out "Murder! for God's sake, come to my assistance, for my husband is lying dead on the floor!"—Mrs. Shea ran after me to the window, and when she saw the crowds of people she said, "I will disperse that mob; you shall not have any witness," putting her hand to some flower-pots that were there, and throwing them out—she took me by the legs, and tried to throw me out—I held by the window by my two hands, and she could not get me out—she took my shoes and stockings from me in trying to get me from the window—she gave me several blows with the large hammer again on the back of the head, as she could not get me from the window—she then went back to Shea, who was nailing the door on both sides, to prevent its being opened, as he heard</p>

I am dead!"—I did not take up parts of the chairs, and strike the prisoners; nor did my husband—I had not been drinking at all.</p>

Some time before Sept. the prisoners were lodgers of mine for four or five months—they owed me some rent, and five weeks before this happened I told them to go away—they would not leave, and I could not get my rent—I employed a broker to distrain, after I had given them written notice—the broker's warrant was left with my wife, on Monday the 18th—I went out that day, leaving my wife at-home—when I came back I heard a noise—went up, and found her and the prisoners in their room—I turned about to speak to Shea, and the woman struck me with a hammer and knocked me down senseless—I did not see anything done to my wife—I had not time—I was knocked down the moment I went up—it appeared to me that they had been ill-using her—I had no time to see whether she was bleeding or not—I remained senseless till I was taken out of the room—I do not know what became of my wife—the woman struck me with a large shoemaker's hammer—I did not see any other hammer in the room at that time.</p>

I went with Mr. Wood and Bradley to the prisoners' house, and at the foot of the bed I found this piece of drugget tied up with string, and a sheet over it—in a cupboard I found a hearth-rug, and between the sacking and the mattress nine sheets—Eliza Young came up stairs—she said she knew nothing about the things, I must speak to her husband—I found this carpet on the floor.</p>

On 10th Oct. I sent her for some beer for supper—when she came back she seemed to have a bundle under her apron—she moved her hand, and it seemed as if she had put it into her pocket—next morning I missed some rings from my jewel-case in my bed-room—the key was in it—I had given the prisoner notice to quit the evening before—on the next evening she asked leave to go to her aunt's to tell her she was going to leave—I gave her leave, and then told my husband—he would not let her go—he went up and spoke to her—he is not here—I was present when he asked her if she had seen anything of Miss Louisa's brooch, my cousin—she said she bad not, and did not know what kind of brooch it was—Mr. Jannaway said if she was innocent she would have no objection to his searching her boxes—she said she had not—we found nothing in them which we could swear to—Mr. Jannaway turned her bed down and found a bundle, containing a night-gown and two aprons, which</p>

               <p>were his, and were in the shop for sale the day before—I turned the bed further down, and found two books of mine—she was asked if she wore pockets—she said, "Never," and showed her frock—there was a hole, but no pocket—Mr. Jannaway left the room, and I desired to see her petticoat, I found a pocket in it, which she tried to hide from me, and in it was a pair of new boots, which were in pledge—she said she bought them in the Vauxhall-road, and was going to take them to her cousin—next morning I saw five cloths in Wiltshire's possession, some lace, and about two yards of ribbon of mine.</p>

I am the prisoner's brother—in Feb. last, Bowden kept a book stall in the Waterloo-road, and from that time down to June, I called on him several times about my brother joining him in the artist's colour trade—he produced two or three lists—one was of Reeve's colours, and said my brother could get them on credit, and he should be very much obliged if I could find out a shop for him which my brother and he were to carry on together—I saw one likely to suit in Little Queen-street, and went with him and my brother to see it—my brother and he agreed to do the repairs, and my brother promised him to obtain credit of gas-fitters, painters, and glaziers—I know that my brother ordered them to do the work, and the plumber's bill was made out in his name—it was agreed that in three or four months, if my brother could get a connection together, his name was to be put up—my brother said it should be Bowden and Robinson—Mr. Bowden said it should be Bowden and Co., as my brother's name was not to appear till they ascertained that the business answered, and, if it did not, Bowden was to carry on his bookbinding in the shop—my brother has been working from seven o'clock in the morning till eleven at night to get a connexion together—there was no appearance of his being a shopman—I never heard the word till I was at Bow-street.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house six months—he was in my debt, and I called on him and said in Bowden's hearing, I was surprised that he, a partner in a successful business, should not be able to pay so small a sum—he said they were new beginners, and were short of money—I believe they both said so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Tomlin's service. On 7th Sept. he sent me to Messrs. Burrows and Wale, Old Barge-house wharf for some oats—I went with a horse and cart—five quarters of oats, and two quarters of split beans were put into fourteen sacks—I did not see them put into the cart—I saw them when there—Mabey provided them for me—I left—as I went towards Blackfriars-bridge one of the bags slipped, and I was assisted in putting it right by some persons—Croft was there, and went down the bridge with me—something happened to another sack, and at that time Viner came up and said, I was to go back to the wharf for a letter for my master—Croft offered to take care of the horse and cart, and I went back, leaving the horse, cart, and beans with him—when I returned, they were gone—I informed the police, and afterwards saw Croft and Viner in custody.</p>

I saw the oats and beans put into Lewis's cart on 7th Sept.—he returned in about half an hour, and said something upon which I sent him off—I subsequently went with two policemen to Sealey's house, Theobald's-road, and saw a sack found at the further end of the shop, with two or three empty sacks lying on it—I compared the oats in the sack with a sample from the bulk at Mr. Tomlin's—they were exactly the same sort—I have been a lighterman fifteen or sixteen years, and have been accustomed to oats all my life.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you at all short-sighted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have not complained of being short-sighted since I have been in business—I am a diamond-setter—I was short-sighted when I went to school—I can see diamonds very well—I went at once to the police, and had the advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi>—I mentioned that there were two per<lb/>sons there during the whole time—I should know the other person if I saw him—he had a sallow complexion, and full dark whiskers—Mr. Barnett, of Primrose-street, Bishopsgate, has acted as my attorney in this case—I believe him to be an attorney—I do not think he has got a name on the door, I will not be certain—here is the <hi rend="italic">Hue and Cry</hi> in which I described the person—I gave a description to the officer—I stated there were two men: I cannot exactly remember the description—I described the prisoner as of a darkish complexion—I cannot remember what age—I will not swear I described him as forty-five—I will not swear I did not describe him of fresh complexion—I described him of darkish complexion—I do not consider dark and fresh the same—I cannot remember which I described him to be—I described him with carrotty whiskers and darkish complexion—I went to Bristol, and took the prisoner into custody on 8th Oct.—I received a letter at my house that Mr. Barnett wished to see me—that is how he came to be my attorney; he found me, I did not find him—Mr. Humphreys was engaged for me at first: he did not withdraw, I sent a letter to him—I had received a letter from Mr. Barnett previous to engaging Mr. Humphreys—I know Sherwinski; he did not introduce this lawyer to me—I heard from Sherwinski that the prisoner was at Bristol—I had not known Sherwinski previous to 6th Oct.—I told one of my men about the robbery, one of my men told a man named Cohen, and then Sherwinski came to my house, and told me that the prisoner had left London; but I had to give a description of the man—he came to hear what I had to tell him—I described him to Sherwinski, and he said, "I have an idea who is the man"—he did not tell me what his idea was; I did not ask him—I came, in a round-about manner, to ask him, and he would not tell me—I did not know Sherwinski before—it was on the evening of 7th Oct that he told me he suspected it was this man—I have not paid him anything yet—I am to pay him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the close of the Court—I gave him money for refreshment—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know what he did with it—he is to receive 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of this trial—it did not suit me to give it him before—perhaps I should like to see the finish first.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on 9th Oct., at the Duke of York public-house—Sherwinski was present, he spoke to the prisoner in German, and the prosecutor gave him into my charge—I told him he was charged with stealing eight diamond rings, in London—he said he did not know Mr. Joseph, and he was not in London at that time—I did not hear him say anything as to Mr. Joseph's own character—I never heard anything against the Duke of York public-house—I found on the pri<lb/>soner, at the station, a watch, two rings, some keys, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—before he left, he went up stairs and undid his box—we locked the door, and Mrs. Wilcox gave me up the key—I found in his lodging a coat, a cap, some jew<lb/>ellery, and eighteen duplicates; these seven <hi rend="italic">dummy</hi> sovereigns, and these notes of the Republic of 1792—(<hi rend="italic">one of the duplicates was for an article pawned at Reading on</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">rd Oct</hi>.)</p>

                  </hi>. I was a farmer, at Stratford—I now live at 129, Bishopsgate-street. When I was in the farming business, Spackman was my foreman, and lived in a cottage adjoining the stables and barn, on my farm—I did not know Barker then—he keeps a horse and cart, and a little greengrocer's-shop, at Stratford—I had repeatedly spoken to Spackman about missing things—on 30th Aug. they began to reap some wheat—I reckoned, as nearly as possible, that there would be very nearly forty quarters in that threshing—this wheat was different from any other in the neighbourhood—Spackman had the charge of the barn altogether, before and after the thresh<lb/>ing; it is quite impossible that it could have been interfered with without his knowledge, his cottage was close to the barn, and no one could come to it without his seeing them—he brought the keys in every night, and came to my window between four and five o'clock every morning, and I gave them out to him—he rendered me an account of twenty-eight quarters and five bushels—I have been a farmer ever since I was fourteen years old—I am able to calculate what quantity should be produced—the nature of the crop and the hours employed in threshing would be very fair data for the amount—on the morning of 20th Sept. I went up to Barker—I said, "Is your name Barker?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "What did you do with the wheat that you carted from my house?"—he said, "I do not know you; I have not carted any wheat"—I said, "You carted two quarters and a half, on the 5th and on the 6th"—he said, "You know all about it; I carted, altogether, seven and a half and six bushels; I was employed by Spackman to do it"—I said, "Who?"—he said, "Spackman, Green, and Oliver"—they were men</p>

I was at the Lord Duncan, at Deptford, between twelve and one o'clock at night—the prisoner was at the door as I entered—he had a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> there, and proposed to take me in it to London-bridge for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but after we got outside the door I asked him what part of London he was going to—he asked where I wanted to go to, and I said if I stopped by Bond-street I should be near home—he said he was going there, and would take me for 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said if he would I would give him a drop of beer—he required pay<lb/>ment from me at the public-house, which I refused—he said he had taken fares frequently, and when they got to their destination they had not money to pay with—I asked him if he thought it was the same with me—he said, "Yes," and I showed him half a sovereign, and some silver, and returned it to my pocket—he said, "Old fellow, I may as well have your shilling as any one else's"—he had some beer and tobacco, which I paid for—I was going to get on the box by him—he said I had better get inside; would I have no objection to his looking for another fare—I said, "No," and got inside—he put up both the windows—I objected, and he said, "When you get to your destination, if you should be asleep, I will wake you up, and he drove on—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped in the Westminster-road—I woke up directly; I was not sound asleep—I found it was not my destination, and slumbered again—about two minutes after the prisoner came back with some other parties, two, I think, and said, "I have got a b----y old <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> here," or words to that effect—I do not know what that means; he was speaking to the other parties—I distinctly heard the words—there was some conversation—the door then opened, and he said, "He is sound asleep"—I felt a handkerchief vibrating in the air several times, and I was completely insensible, and yet conscious of what was going forward—a hand was afterwards put into my waistcoat-pocket twice—I heard a party say, "Put his knife back again;" that was returned, and I felt a hand in my trowser's-pocket, and I rose up in the stupified state, in which I was, and turned round, inclining on my right side, and said, "What are you doing?'"—there was again a vibration of a handkerchief seven or eight times, and I felt a hand at my trowser's pocket, and in about two minutes the prisoner came round to the door, and said, "Old fellow, I can't take you any further for nothing"—he took me out with violence on the pavement, and drove away—I ran after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about 150 or 200 yards, when I was tripped up, and the first person I saw after I got up again was a police<lb/>man, to whom I related the circumstance—I went to the station-house, and gave information, and went the following morning to the Badge-office—I got information the following day, and he was taken on the Saturday following—I lost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a half-sovereign, my watch, and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I know I had it about me when I awoke in the Westminster-road, and it was all gone when I was pulled out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I cannot tell what they gave me to inhale,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184810230188"/>
               <p>but I felt completely stupified; I felt a vibration in the air to and fro—I had had nothing to drink with him—I had walked from Woolwich, having lost the conveyance—I am perfectly satisfied the prisoner is the man that drove me from Deptford to the Westminster-road.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you always been satisfied he is the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite; I never mistook any other man—I never asked any other person whether he was the person that drove me—I asked a man named White whether he was down at Deptford on the Tuesday night—he said he was—I did not ask him whether he brought me from Deptford; I positively swear that—I asked him if he had brought a fare from Deptford—I asked that to apprehend the prisoner, because he was in conversation with him at Deptford half an hour before I entered the house—I had no doubt he would say he knew nothing about it—the prisoner showed me his badge at Deptford—I was not satisfied whether it was 2696, or 2969: but it was four numbers, and I know the left-hand figure was two—I went to the Badge-office, and found such a badge was not licensed—I then went to the station-house again—they could give me no assistance or information—I then went to the Lord Duncan, at Deptford—they did not know the cabman—directly I saw the prisoner I recognized him, and he said, "That is the man that I 1 brought from Deptford," speaking to me—I had been at work that day from five to one o'clock—I then went from London-bridge to Greenwich, where I transacted some business with an ironmonger—after that, it being fine, I went to Woolwich, and remained there till I lost the last boat to London—I was drinking and enjoying myself at the Waterman—the last steamer started I about a quarter to eight—it was a quarter to one when I started with the prisoner from Deptford—I stopped at Woolwich, after my brother left of ork with his shipmates, till twenty past ten—I then walked through Green-wich to Deptford, and met the prisoner—I did not drink anything after I left Woolwich; I drank nothing at Deptford—I accepted the glass out of the prisoner's hand, and just put it to my lips, but did not drink anything—I had not been in any other house before that—it was the first time I was at the Lord Duncan—I do not know whether I came up the Old Kent-road—I do not know my road about that way—I cannot say whether I car through a toll-bar; I believe there is a toll-bar—I do not know whether it is customary to pay a fresh toll after twelve—I did not pay toll; I swear I did not pay any money after leaving the public-house—I did not pay the prisoner any money before leaving the public-house—I was to pay him 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he was to have a glass of anything he liked to drink, when we got to London—he had a pint of porter, half a quartern of gin, and a pipe of tobacco, before we started, at my expense—it might have been twenty minutes after leaving Deptford that I went to sleep—it might have taken an hour or an hour and a quarter altogether coming from Deptford—I found myself in the Westminster-road about a quarter to two o'clock—I was not sound asleep the whole time, I did not doze the whole time—I tried to amuse myself by looking through the glass, perhaps about a quarter of an hour, and then 1 dozed, and after that I have very little recollection of the objects along the road—I have not the slightest recollection of the toll-bar—I am certain the toll-man did not put his head into the window, and I pay him the toll—we first stopped in the road in a line with Westminster-bridge, very near a night-house there—I know it was in a line with west-minster-bridge, because I went over the bridge afterwards—I do not know the neighbourhood much—I did not know where I was when I first looked out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> window when it stopped; I did not know till afterward—I saw</p>

               <p>it was not my destination—I was not very sleepy—I thought the prisoner had got off for his own convenience, and I dozed off again—I leaned back—I did not see the waterman there when I was pulled out—I did not stop to see any person—I might have seen him, but did not recognise him—I followed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I am certain the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> did not go on again after I looked out of the win<lb/>dow, previous to my being thrown out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was not asleep, though dozing—I will undertake positively to swear the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> did not go on after I looked out of the window till I was pulled out—I have no recollection of the caiman stopping and taking up another fare—I do not recollect a woman being in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I heard a woman's voice outside the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door when it stopped—no person got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> after I left Deptford till I was pulled out—a woman and a man did not get in—I am quite sure I was not at all sick during the evening—I had drunk porter and a glass of gin and water, no brandy, nor rum, or wine, or ale, only porter and gin—the jolting of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> did not make me sick—I am quite positive I was not sick in or out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On Tuesday night, 19th Sept., I was on duty in the Westminster-road, and at a little before two o'clock saw the pri<lb/>soner pass me, driving a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had an opportunity of seeing him, his face was towards me—after he had got fifteen or twenty yards he commenced flogging his horse, put it into a gallop, and went down York-road—I saw Cotterell running after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> along the Westminster-road—he gave an alarm, and told me he had been robbed of his watch, a half-sovereign, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some copper—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was going very fast down the York-road—the prose<lb/>cutor was quite sober—he was excited, but not from drink—he went with me to the station—I found the prisoner in custody on the following Thurs<lb/>day, and knew him again.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Had you seen him before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, on different ranks—I was standing under a lamp as he passed me—it was in the bend of the road—it is rather broad—it was at two o'clock in the morning—he did not go very fast till after he had passed me ten or fifteen yards—he turned and looked at me, and the gas shone full in his face—after he passed me he began to whip his horse, and if I had caught the number I should have taken it, for furious driving—that was why I took notice of him—it was about fifty yards from where the prosecutor was, and for that fifty yards, till he passed me, he was cantering his horse, going at the ordinary pace—I saw both the prisoner and the prosecutor before he came up to me—the prosecutor did not give any alarm till he came up to the corner of York-road—he was excited, but not drunk—I did not see him roll over—I cannot say whether there were other people there then, I was not there—two females came up from West<lb/>minster-bridge way—there might or there might not have been people coming in the same direction as the prosecutor—I did not notice anybody—the pro<lb/>secutor said he had been thrown on the pavement—he said he had either fallen down, or he believed he had been tripped up by one of the prisoner's asso<lb/>ciates, as he was pursuing the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>.</p>

               <p>Sept., in York-street, York-road—I told him I wanted him for robbing a person in his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I hesitated a little, as his wife was there, and told him I would tell him what it was for as we went to the station—he requested me to tell him, and I told him it was for robbing a man of his watch, whom he brought from Deptford in his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said he had brought an old <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> from Deptford, and as he was conveying him to the Westminster-road he took up another fare, and as the fare was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> he was sick all over the other parties, and they got fighting in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> together; that he put the other fare down at the Elephant and Castle, and brought him into the Westminster-road, and thought he had brought him far enough for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and there he bundled him out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and drove off—as we were going to the Police-court, he said, "I can see the old <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> means to stick to me, I can see it in his ways," or words to that effect—the word "<hi rend="italic">bloke</hi>" is a common term used among <hi rend="italic">cabmen</hi>—I cannot say the meaning of it.</p>

On Wednesday, 20th Sept., the deceased, Eliza Wilson, made a statement in my presence and hearing, and signed it—I took it down, but in consequence of her weak, dying state, I had to bend over her in bed, and then I got the police-inspector to write part, in my presence—I had seen her on the previous Sunday—I was requested by the inspector to go there on that day to take the declaration of a dying female—she was then very ill, but she expected to recover, and I therefore went away—on the Wednesday the inspector came again to me, and I went again—I saw her father, and sent for a Clergyman—I asked her how she found herself—she said, "Very ill"—I said, "Do you now think you will recover?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Do you think you will die?"—she said, "Yes"—I then proceeded to take the statement.</p>

I went with Mr. Elyard to Mr. Wilson's house at Norwood, on 20th Sept., and saw the deceased Eliza Wil<lb/>son—I heard her make a statement—I wrote part of it down—this is it—she signed it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" The declaration of Eliza Wilson, taken before me, Samuel Elyard, Esq., at Norwood, 20th Sept., 1848. The said Eliza Wilson having been examined by me as to whether she at present considers herself in a dying state, and she having assured me that she does, is in the thirty-second year of her age, and saith, and suspecting herself to be in the family-way, she made known her suspicion to Richard Orpin, with whom I had had criminal connection, and who would have been the father of the child—I never had connection with any other man—and on my informing him as above, he said, 'Stop till Monday, and we will go together to East-lane, Walworth, to a</p>

               <p>woman, but she need not trouble herself for three or four months;' and he went with me on Monday, 4th Sept., to East-lane, but could not find the woman, and on the following day, Tuesday, I went by myself and did not find her, but saw a Mrs. Dryden, who resides in York-street, Walworth, to whom I acquainted that I was in the family-way, and informed her that I wished to get rid of it, and she said it should be all right, if I would pay her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and which I gave her; she gave me a box of pills and a bottle of stuff, which did not have the expected effect. Mrs. Dryden then went with me on the Wednesday to Mrs. Lindfield, to Prior-place, East-street, Walworth, a herb shop. Mrs. Dryden said, 'I have got a friend of mine come to see you.' Mrs. Lindfield, without asking any questions, said, 'I will take her up-stairs directly,' and shortly after did so, and told me to lay on the bed on my left side; she then performed an operation by some instrument, which had some holes at the end. I went again on the 9th, she used the instru<lb/>ment again, saying, 'It does not come so freely from you.' I slept at Mrs. Dryden's that night. I paid her, Mrs. Lindfield, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the first day I went, and gave Mrs. Dryden a few shillings for her trouble in taking me to Mrs. Lindfield. I went to Mrs. Lindfield again on the following Monday, the 11th, when she again used the instrument, when I came home and became ill. I told Mrs. Lindfield my father thought I was ill, and she said, 'Nonsense, you are all right.' Richard Orpin promised to pay the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but has not done so. The young man, called Mrs. Lindfield's son, was pre<lb/>sent on each occasion I went, and was perfectly aware of the business which I was on")—the prisoners were in custody before I saw Wilson—Lindfield's house and premises were searched in my presence—I was present when the catheter, a box containing other instruments, a quantity of herbs and pills, and drugs of almost all sorts, were found—Merritt, the policeman who was present, has them.</p>

I told her I was a constable, that Lindfield was in custody, and she was also charged with her with endangering the life of Eliza Wilson, by trying means to procure abortion—she said, "It is through nothing that I have given her, I only gave her some five-leaved grass, ground ivy, and pil. cochice pills; I saw her twice on Monday, and last Monday week"—I asked her if she had received any money from Mrs. Lindfield—she said she had received none, and knew nothing of Mrs. Lindfield, but merely took the female there to</p>

I wish that some medical man should examine my hand, to see whether it is in a state to reach the uterus of a person in a rigid state, like this young woman's. I did what I could, but I told her I could prove nothing. I told her to keep her mind easy, and gave her some laxitive medicine. When I tr ied to examine her next time, I had not got my finger more than an inch when I found menstruation coming on again, and I told her to go to bed, and keep her feet warm. I drew her water off for her, as she complained of pain. I gave her an ounce of salts to take home, and I gave her at the same time four pills. I told her to take half an ounce of salts that night, and next day to take two pills, but no salts. I said, 'Take them alternately, till your bowels are relieved.' She complained of costive-ness very much. I did not see her again till that day week, and then she showed me appearances to satisfy me ail was right. She said she was going to see her aunt; she complained that her bowels were still in a constipated</p>

               <p>state. I attributed it to the properties of the savin. I heard no more of her till Thursday evening again, when I received this note; then she complained only of the constipation of the bowels, and I sent her two ounces of salts by a young man who brought this note. Dryden did not say she had given her savin; it was the young woman said that, when I took her up stairs privately to examine her. It was the third time the deceased came to me I drew off her water." Dryden says, "She (deceased) had no savin water from me. I gave her rive-leaf grass, ground-ivy, agrimony, and pil. cochioe, which are fine things for the stomach. She asked me if I knew a midwife, and I referred her to Mrs. Lindfield." Orpin says, "I have been out with the young woman several times, but as to giving her poison it is wrong; whatever she took she got it, and took it of her own accord; I neither supplied her with money nor bought it myself; she said something must be done; she came to me, and asked me to give her 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to get her some stuff, but 1 told her I would not have anything to do with it, and 1 have not seen her since.")</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Elliott's-place, Lambeth, with my sister, who is the mother of the deceased boy, Robert Woodrow—he would have been thirteen years old next Jan.—he came home on Saturday evening, 9th Sept., from Mr. Randall's, his master, a boot and shoemaker, at Camberwell—he sat down on a chair, and complained of his head aching—I asked what made his head ache, and he said a boy had struck him at the back of his head, and he said to me, "Aunt, feel what a lump I have got?"—I felt a lump, about the size of a nut, behind his ear—I did not think it of any great importance; I thought it was only a cold—he told me his nose had bled at his master's—he went to bed—he awoke me in the night, and his nose was bleeding violently; it poured out all over the bed, I suppose it was more than ten minutes before I could stop it, he went to bed again, it bled again about ten o'clock on the Sunday, and again twice that day, equally violent—he complained of pain in his head—he went to his employment on the Monday, and every day up to the Thursday, but he complained, and was getting worse every day—on the Thursday he came home earlier than usual, and said his head was so bad that he could not do anything at his masters—he went again in the morning, but came home directly, and went to bed—at went again on the Saturday, but he was still very bad, and his master let him come home very early in the evening—he was then very ill indeed, still com<lb/>plaining of his head—he never went to work after that—his master asked him to come on the Monday, and he went, but could not stop—on the Thursday following we called in Mr. Thomas, and he attended him till he died, which</p>

               <p>was on Friday, 6th Oct.—I was speaking to him a short time before he died—he told me he was sure he should die that night, and he did die that night—I said to him, "My dear, you are on your death-bed now; are you sure that what you said to those gentlemen, (meaning Mr. Norton, the Magistrate, and his clerk,) was the truth?"—he said, "Yes, aunt; was I to die this moment, what I said was the truth"—several times in the course of his illness he said if he died that boy would be the cause of his death who he had pointed out to me as we were going to Camberwell—the prisoner had passed us, and he said, "That is the boy that hit me on the head."—he did not say that loud enough for the prisoner to hear—he took an oath, when the Magistrate was there, that he never knew a boy of the name of Cole, or Coles—he repeatedly told me during his illness that he never knew nothing of a boy named Cole—he never, at the time he was dying, said anything about a boy named Cole—about half an hour before he died, I asked him whether he had been fighting, and he said, "No, I never have; I never fought with any boy"—I mentioned the name of Cole to him, and he said he did not know a boy of that name.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the London-road. I was seat for, and first visited the deceased on 21st Sept.—he complained of great pain in his head and behind his right ear—I examined it, but perceived nothing, and considered it was a disorder within the head that caused him to complain of pain there—there was no discharge—I went again on the Sunday follow<lb/>ing, and he then complained of having received a blow—the aunt told me first, and the boy himself afterwards—in consequence of that I examined the parts behind the ear, and on shaving the hair, found a small tumour on the projecting part of the bone—feeling there was matter or some fluid there, I made an incision, and there flowed a small quantity of <hi rend="italic">pus</hi>, or matter, very foetid—I saw him daily after that—on the Tuesday following, not considering the incision free enough, I made a larger one, and a small quantity more matter escaped, still very foetid—he gradually got worse—I attended him till he died, which was about twelve, or a little after twelve, on the night of 6th Oct., so 1 was informed—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—on dividing the scalp, I found that portion situated over where the abscess was, in a gangrenous condition, and the pericranium was separated from the skull—it did not adhere as it ought to do—that was precisely over the tumour—the skull beneath the bone, beneath the section of the tumour, was in a state of <hi rend="italic">necrosis</hi> or mortification—on examining the inner portion of the skull more particularly, which contains the passage to the internal ear, it was in a very much more advanced state of mortification—the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> had a large patch of ulceration upon it immediately beneath the affected portion of the bone and scalp, and on removing the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> I found a portion of the bone in a slightly inflamed state—there was a small quantity of reddish white matter on the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, not like that which had escaped from the tumour—that was evidence of decomposition, arising from extended inflammation or fever—in my opinion death was caused by irritative fever, the result of this inflamma<lb/>tion and destruction of the parts—there was a small quantity of fluid in the ventricles of the brain, rather more than natural—hearing that he had received a blow, I should ho inclined to suspect that that was the cause of the disease under which he laboured, the fever, the inflammation, and the destruction of</p>

               <p>the parts—it might have occurred from spontaneous <hi rend="italic">necrosis</hi>, it does so some<lb/>times, without any external injury, if it is in the system—I cannot say that this was caused by external violence, I think it probable, but I could not say so positively—a very slight blow will sometimes produce <hi rend="italic">necrosis</hi> in an unhealthy subject—<hi rend="italic">necrosis</hi> does not affect the head so frequently as it does other parts of the body, as the legs or arms—the effect of a blow behind the ear would be very sensibly felt, because a variety of important nerves and veins pass in that direction—the discharge from the ear could not of itself cause death, but it might have been the result of a disease which would—he died of mortification—I did not take blood from him, he was not in a con<lb/>dition to bear it, the disease had gone so far—there was no symptom of any discharge in the other ear—I discovered nothing in his system to show a predisposition to any complaint in the ear, but I was not acquainted with his previous history—if he had disease, a blow would probably render it worse and accelerate death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q</hi>. Was the boy a <hi rend="italic">strumous</hi> or scorbutic subject? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I am aware of—I cannot tell either one way or the other—if there is a purulent discharge from the ear, that must arise from some disease either within the ear, or deeper—irritative fever is sometimes accompanied by deli<lb/>rium—I only perceived that he was light—headed on one occasion, five or six days before his death, but I heard that he had been delirious in the night—I gave a very small quantity of soothing medicine, not so much to subdue the irritation as from the great disturbance of the bowels—he was suffering from profuse diarrhoea—that would not, if it did not act as intended, produce wan<lb/>dering, not in the small doses I gave it, and combined with other medi<lb/>cines—it will do so sometimes, but the medicine did act as I intended—it was only administered on one or two occasions—I cannot say that the mark behind the ear was produced by a blow—the gangrene covered a space of four inches in length and two in breadth—all the symptoms were those of inflammation.</p>

I saw him leaving the premises, and I kept him in conversation to point him out to the officer—I have seen the metal produced—it is called pot-metal—I have no doubt it is the property of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a printer in Wardrobe-terrace, Doctors'-com<lb/>mons. The prisoner was in my employ as overseer or foreman—his wages were 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he had access to all parts of my office and stock—I employ sixty or seventy men—I went with the policeman to the prisoner's house in Blackfriars-road, on 26th Sept.—one officer went in the back premises with my foundry-man, and there found some metal lead—I did not go with him—I found this metal block, or moulding, in the front room, on the first-floor—I believe it to be mine—this cast is made use of in the working of the wrapper of the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>—that is a work that has been printed on my premises—the prisoner would have no business to take any type or mould from my premises to his own—this is stereotyped—I had printed the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> about a year and a half—I was not present when the prisoner was given into custody—I had not charged him with it before I went to his premises.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had he been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years—I printed a work called the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Standard</hi>—the prisoner was not originally employed in my jobbing business, but on the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Standard</hi>—he was put on it about April—that was what he first came to work upon—he had no other employ to attend to then—he was I think on piece work—he earned about 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—Jones, my over<lb/>seer left me, and the prisoner being a steady young man I put him in the place, and increased his wages to 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Jones' wages were 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he was only overseer, the prisoner was overseer, and had the printing of the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Standard</hi>—Jones also had the superintendence of that—Mr. Bar<lb/>low was the proprietor of the journal—the prisoner was not in custody when we searched his house—he was in my employ—I took my founder, Hicks, with me to the prisoner's premises—I did not give the prisoner any notice, or make any charge against him at that time—I ceased to be printer of the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi> the week before—I knew when I went to search his pre<lb/>mises on the 26th, that I was no longer to be continued the printer of the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>—I gave the prisoner notice to quit my employ on the 18th Sept.—I did not at that time know that he was going to be taken into the employ of Messrs. Barlow and Co., to be employed on the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>—I knew it on the Friday following, before I searched his house—all that I can recognise of these articles amount to 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in value—the printing of the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi> did produce a profit, but a very small one—I believe this block to be mine, as far as a man can speak to property on his premises—I mean to swear to it—it had been made for myself—I know a person named Miller—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a sheet</hi>)—this is not the impression of my block—nor is this other—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>)—here is part of it here—this one has been cut and pieced about—this centre appears to be it, but the top and bottom have both been cut off—Miller had nothing to do with this casting—he had to do with some former blocks—these were at one time in separate casts—they were sent to me to work, and I cast them for my own convenience—the small blocks I have no doubt went hack to Mr. Barlow, or Mr. Miller as their agent, but this block was never out of my premises—I know that Cap<lb/>sey and Cole, two men who were in my service, lodged in the same house with the prisoner—I did not employ them, or either of them to make any search at the house—after I heard that he was going on the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi> they went there, being anxious to find out the guilt—I told all the men in my employ that property was missing, and every man must look out—I deny that I gave them authority, or direction to make any search there—I believe Capsey and Cole, and the prisoner all left my service together—it was not at my instance that Capsey and Cole left, nor by any interference of mine—I</p>

               <p>had no reason to believe before I gave the prisoner into custody that he had received this block from Miller's hand—I had never been told so before he was in custody—in coming out of the Court, Miller said, "That has been in my possession"—I learnt with utter astonishment from Miller, when I was at the station, or police-court, that he had given this to the prisoner—he did not say he gave it to the prisoner—he said it had been in his possession—I knew the prisoner was about to be employed on the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>, and that Miller told me it had been in his hands—I did not ask whether Miller gave it him—from a memorandum found, it appears that Miller gave it him on the previous day—this plate would be of no use to anybody that did not print the <hi rend="italic">Patent Journal</hi>—Messrs. Barlow and others were about to employ the prisoner to print it.</p>

I have been about a year and a half in the employ of Mr. Silverlock—I can speak to these leads and this brass-rule—I reside in the prisoner's house, in Blackfriars-road; there is an outhouse in the yard—I remember my master complaining of things being lost about the 12th or 14th Sept.—on Thursday night, the 14th Sept., about nine o'clock, or from that to ten, I saw through the window of the room where I reside a light proceeding from the upper story in the prisoner's outhouse—I went down into the yard, and while 1 was there the prisoner came down out of the place—he said, "Halloo, Capsey, are you there?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I have got a bit of a job up stairs at tinkering; I am mending the leg of a chair"—I said, "You are fond of tinkering"—I had observed a vast volume of smoke proceeding from the chimney, and I knew there was a fire—I smelt fumes, like molten metal; I had smelt them before—on the night of the 15th we had been at work at the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Standard</hi>, and on Saturday morning, the 16th, as we did not go to work so early as usual, I observed the prisoner come out of the outhouse, and there was a smoke, and 1 observed the smell of the metal—the prisoner said he had got a fire up stairs, and he had been burning an old mattress that had bugs in it—on the morning of the 26th Sept. I got up early, on account of my wife being unwell, I went down into the yard, the outhouse was unfastened, and I went into it; I saw a quantity of leads on the floor, I saw a fire-place, and a pan, or sort of thing in it, for melting metal, I took up three of the leads, and examined them, I brought</p>

I was walking in Willow-walk, Bermondsey, at a little after eight o'clock, near the Grey<lb/>hound-yard—I was seized from behind, as it appeared, by more than one person—they put their hands over my eyes—after knocking me down, they let me go, and went away—while they were about it, one of them said, "Quick! quick!"—I was then knocked down, and they ran off—there were four of them—they turned to the left, towards the Grange-road—I got up and called "Thieves!" and "Police!"—I had lost my watch during the time they had been pressing on my throat—I saw the policeman get over the back premises of Alfred-terrace—I saw Mr. Maeer—he called out, and I went round to the front of Mr. Maeer's house, and saw the prisoner in custody of the police—he asked why he was taken, and said he went over there for a necessary purpose—my watch was found in the garden adjoining the house—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On Wednesday night, 11th Oct., between eight and nine o'clock, I heard a cry of "Police!" coming from Willow-walk—it was moonlight—I stopped and looked down the walk—I saw a gentleman lying down, and four men upon him, stooping and bending over him—I saw one of them feeling about his clothes—I noticed that that one had no whiskers—it was the prisoner—I am sure he is the man—I saw the men who were there going away from the gentleman when they heard me cry "Police!"—I ran up toward? the place, and saw the four men turn round the Grange-road—the prisoner was one of them—they ran down Queen's-road, down Alfred-street, and got over toe back wall in Alfred-terrace—there is a high heap of dirt there, I got on it, and saw three of the men go to the right, over the Palings, and I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Maeer's garden down by toe kitchen door—I saw a policeman getting over another garden, and I cried out, "Here he is; here he is," pointing to Mr. Maeer's garden—I saw Mr., Maeer come out of his door, and presently the door was opened and a light was brought, and I saw the policeman go down to the kitchen door with the prisoner—I followed him to the station, and recognised him as being the person—I have no doubt of his being the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Eastwood, who keeps a beer-shop at Mill-pond—it is his dwelling-house—the prisoners formerly lived with us—Purfleet left five or six weeks ago, and Foreman on 27th Sept.—I had no other lodgers. On 24th Oct., about ten o'clock in the morning, Purfleet came and asked me whether my husband was at home—I said, "No"—in about five minutes Foreman came—they asked me for the dominoes, and went into the tap-room—in a few minutes they came to the bar and had a pint of beer, which Purfleet paid for—I went into the kitchen—I could see from there through the bar to the front door—I frequently went backwards and forwards—I went into the tap-room, looked over a small partition, and saw the prisoners in conversation—Foreman then came into the kitchen, and wanted to go up stairs and play at bagatelle—I refused him—he went into the tap-room—Purfleet was there—they stood a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> minutes—Purfleet came out, and walked through the passage three times, in conversation with me all the time, close to the kitchen door—I was in the kitchen—I heard the creaking of the stairs door, and footsteps on the stairs—those stairs lead to a long room; then there is another stair-case leading to our bed-room—I pushed by Purfleet, went into the bar, and missed Foreman—I went to the stairs door, found no one there, then went into the bar again, heard footsteps on the stairs, and a creaking of the door, and saw Foreman in the bar, but half a yard from the door, with his back towards it, the door just closing as if some one had come down—I left them there, and went into the kitchen—I did not see them go out, but missed them—in about ten minutes Purfleet came back and spoke to me in the bar about the brewers—my husband came in, and went into the skittle-ground—Purfleet joined him there—Foreman came in and joined them—I had not told my husband what I had seen—they were there till about one o'clock—about six in the evening I went up to my bed-room—it was locked as I had left it in the morning—I missed from my drawers five sovereigns, five half-sovereigns, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper, and a sovereign and some half-crowns from the cash-box—the drawer was not locked—I had seen it safe the night before—I know this halfpenny (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) by marks on it, and can swear it was in the drawer—I also swear to this half-crown—the bed-room door key was in my pocket, but the key of the staircase door, which was left in it, will open the bed-room door.</p>
