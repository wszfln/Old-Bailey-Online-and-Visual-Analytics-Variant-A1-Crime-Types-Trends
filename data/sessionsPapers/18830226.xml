On 2nd February I accompanied Hurst to Arcadia Street, and went with him, Hines, and Hooper to the station—on reaching the station Hines walked across to Hooper and attempted to pass something to her; I took it from his hand, and found it to be this pocket-book—Hines said "That is hers"—I afterwards opened it, and found in it these three money orders, one issued on 1st February for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and altered to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and one for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., altered to 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., also a flash 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the Bank of Engraving and two or three brass Hanoverian medals.</p>

I am travelling clerk attached to the Missing Letter Branch of the General Post-office—on 2nd February I was present when Hines and Hooper were taken into custody—at the station Hines endeavoured to pass this pocket-book to Hooper; it was stopped by Bick—Hooper was taken into another room, and she made a statement—I afterwards saw Hines, and after telling him who I was I said "This pocket-book you had in your possession just now contains three money orders"—I opened it and showed him the orders—he replied "I don't know anything about it, she gave it to me to mind for her"—I said one had been fraudulently altered, and the woman had confessed to altering and negotiating several—he said "I don't know anything about that; I met her last night and went home with her, and on coming out this morning to have a drink she gave me the book to take care of"—I said "You will be detained here until I have made further inquiries"—I afterwards went to 36, Arcadia Street—on my return Hines called me into a back room where he was standing, and said he wished to speak to me—he said "I am innocent;" I said "If you are you are a very unfortunate man to be in the company of this woman, but I have just ascertained that you did not go to the house last night, but went there this morning between 9 and half-past 9, and as two of the orders found in your possession were taken out in the neighbourhood where several have been negotiated, you will be charged with being concerned with the woman"—he said nothing to that.</p>

I live at 38, Onslow Square, South Ken<lb/>sington—in the beginning of December, 1881, I was in want of a butler—a man named Charles Lay came to me at the Foreign Office, where I am engaged—I conversed with him relative to the situation—he gave me the names of two or three persons in whose employment he had been—he wrote this name and address, "H.N.E. Herbert, Esq., Hackness Grange, Scarboro'"—I wrote to Mr. Herbert and received this reply: "Dec. 22, 1881. Dear Sir,—In reply to your letter of this morning I am happy to be able to answer your questions satisfactorily; I found Charles Lay a man somewhat superior in point of intelligence to most of his class, and I consider him sober, honest, and in every respect trustworthy. He did not when with me have charge of the wine cellar, that I always manage myself; but I should have no hesitation in trusting him to that extent. He kept my plate in truly beautiful order, and in fact every<lb/>thing else with which he had to deal. I am confident you will not regret it if you engage him. I remain, faithfully yours, H.N.E. Herbert. I omitted to state that with me he had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year." I believed that to be a genuine character, and in consequence I engaged Charles Lay as butler—he remained about three months, when I discharged him—I subse<lb/>quently attended at the Westminster Police-court on a charge of his conspiring with the prisoner, not then in custody, for obtaining my situa<lb/>tion by false pretences—he was committed, tried, and convicted in June last.</p>

I told him again and he said, "I have got nothing"—I found on him at the station five counterfeit florins wrapped up in an old song paper—I then went back to see if I could find the other man, and Newman had gone into the Criterion to look for him—I then saw the prisoner again, and he said that the other man brought him from the Ele<lb/>phant and Castle, and he was in the Criterion—we were in plain clothes.</p>

He brought them to me, and asked me if I had room in my box. I went out on the Sunday to Gadrum's. I did not come back till the Tuesday. On the Sunday Henri Fournier came down from his room bringing some sheets, saying he had received those articles. He begged me to pawn them; he did not speak a word of English, and wanted to pay his landlord when he pawned them. My wife took the clock on the Tuesday. If we had known he had stolen them we never should have taken them into our possession."</p>

We received the cloth, the pencils, the clock from a man named Henri Fournier, who left for Paris a week after we were arrested. He also rendered to me the night before we left Wood Street the two chisels, the revolver, and two knives; he had paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he owed to the landlady the week before. He brought some daggers, which</p>

               <p>were found in my place, also a pair of trousers, and various other articles, and he told us that he had received the money from his friends in Paris by a post-office order. He went to Paris with a man named Jerome. He gave us all these things for the purpose of living together at 23, John Street. My husband and I are quite innocent of the robbery. Had I known these things were stolen I should not have given my name on the ticket when I pawned them. I gave some English, and not a French name, because they would not be able to spell or write it. Immediately I came to Clerken<lb/>well, after being taken in custody, I wrote a letter to the Magistrate directing him have Henri Fournier arrested.</p>

Seeing him stop, I came out and asked him what was the matter. He asked why I had run into the gateway. I said I did not want my legs broken. We came to a constable, and the cabman tried to turn his horse on to me. I ran into another gateway. The constable came up, and the cabman said I had broken into some one's house in Richmond Road. I was taken to the station. We passed a house which was lit up, and the prosecutor came out, and said "That is the man, I thought he had a brown coat on, and his handkerchief was not tied in that manner." I know nothing of the robbery, neither was I by the house. I was at the coffee-stall at a quarter past 2, and it was impossible for me to have broken into any one's house at 2.</p>

I am a paper-stainer, and live in Barnsbury Road, Islington—the deceased William Johnston was my brother; he would have been 27 next birthday—he lived with me—he was a painter by trade—on Saturday, 20th. February, about 9 o'clock, he and I went into a public-house in Graham Street, City Road, and there saw the three prisoners; I knew them as fellow-workmen—somebody proposed to play skittles, and we went to the Dock public-house and played skittles—we then went to the Duke of Bridgwater public-house—Jackson asked me for a penny for setting up the skittles—I said I could not spare one just now—he said "I want it"—I said "I can't spare it"—he punched me in the mouth—I said "If you were big enough I would give you a good hiding"—I and my brother then left the house—the prisoners came after us—they were all going out together, and I said to my brother "Bill, we will go with them"—when we got out I saw Jackson telling Alf Kingman that he had punched me in the mouth—I said "What are you talking about, Jackson?"—he said "About punching you in the mouth,</p>

               <p>and I would do it again"—I then struck him back; he struck me first; that was in the Duke of Bridgwater; he did not strike me a second time; when I struck him, he called Daniels up—I said "Jackson, what do you call Daniels for?"—he said "To take my part"—Daniels came up and said "So I will take his part;" and he went to hit me; he did hit me, and then my brother hit him back—this took place in the City Road, on the pavement—then the two had a fight and fell in the road—they both got up—they were all right that round—nothing had been said about fighting before—then Daniels wanted to fight me because I was his own size—my brother said "You won't fight him, you will fight me"—Daniels said "Do you think I am going to fight a man of 25. and I am only 18?" then he said to my brother "I will put a knife through you"—he had no knife then—my brother pushed him and they both closed in at one another, and while they were fighting, Jackson and Wilsdon punched my brother, and Daniels threw my brother on his head—I picked him up and took him home and laid him on the sofa—the prisoners went away—it was about 9.30. when I took him home—I went out again and came back about 11.30., and found him on the floor groaning—I put him into bed, and next evening, Sunday, I took him to the hospital in a cab and left him there—he died on Monday morning.</p>

I am a paper-stainer—I am 18. years of age—I was with the three prisoners at the Duke of Bridgwater on this Saturday night—George Johnston offered to play anybody one game of skittles—two of us offered to play him—he would not pay his money as he ought to have done, and there was a dispute about a penny; then there was a blow struck by Jackson on George Johnston—I went out with the prisoners—we said we would go to a place of amusement—the John<lb/>stons were not to go with us—they followed us on to the City Road bridge—they stopped there and Jackson called Daniels—we were in front—we all went back—George Johnston said "What did you call Daniels for?"—Jackson said "To see me righted"—Daniels said "So I will see him righted; you offered to fight anybody of your own size at the Duke of Bridgwater; I am your size, I will fight you"—George John<lb/>ston said "No, you fight my brother"—Daniels said "What, me fight a man of 25. and I am only 18"—with that there were a few words between Jackson and George Johnston, and George Johnston struck Jackson in the mouth—it was a hard blow with his fist—Daniels went to interfere and William Johnston struck him, and they fell to the ground—they got up again—they were all right then, and they walked to the kerb, then William Johnston said "I won't fight you now, we will have it out another time"—Daniels said "I don't wish to fight you, you are too big and too strong for me"—with that William Johnston struck Daniels in the nose and made it bleed—up to that time no blow had been struck by Daniels—they then closed with each other and fell from, the kerb into the road together, Daniels on the top—Johnston fell on his back—George Johnston was standing by looking on—I saw Wilsdon trying to part them once just before the first fight—there is no truth in the suggestion that Jackson and Wilsdon set on the deceased just before he was thrown to the ground, or that they punched him about the head and face.</p>

Feb<lb/>ruary, about 10 minutes past 12, she brought her baby to my house and said she had taken laudanum herself and given it to the child—she gave me two bottles—she did not seem very ill, but very much distressed in mind—I knew that the child was illegitimate—she said she had no food to give the child and no money to get any—she did not say anything about the father of the child—she did not seem to have command of her<lb/>self—I have known her some time—she has been very kind indeed to the child—she was removed to the infirmary about half-past 6; it was about noon when she came to me—I took the child to the doctor as soon as she came in—this is the child—it has recovered now.</p>

I saw the prisoner there—she had been brought there earlier, but I did not see her till then—she was suffering from the effects of opium poisoning: contracted pupils, coldness of the extremities, drowsi<lb/>ness, giddiness, slow pulse, and sickness—she was rational, although drowsy, and appeared to be extremely miserable and desponding—I knew her previously—she said she wished to be locked up to create a sensation—I heard from Mrs. Stagg that she had taken three teaspoon<lb/>fuls of laudanum; that would have been sufficient to destroy life if she had not vomited—the child had also been sick, but for that I am afraid it would have died—I can't say the quantity it had had—the prisoner has been under the charge of the Union since.</p>

The father had been away four months, and I had been without a situation all that time. I had removed the child in consequence of not being able to pay for her. I gave her to another person; after she was there some time I was not able to pay for her, and I had to remove her. On this Satur<lb/>day morning I really did not know what to do; I had no money to get the child any food; I had taken it away the night before, and I really know not what I did. I bought the poison, threepennyworth, and gave half a teaspoonful to the child and took two and a half myself, and when I done it I really knew not what I done.</p>

C. M. Roust and Co."—he said that he came for the case, and wanted us to deliver it that day, but we could not as we had no Tan-we asked for a printed bill-head as a mark of identification, and he produced this printed paper: "C.

On 30th December I went to Liver-pool, and found Sanders in custody—I told him I had an extradition warrant against him with regard to some pictures—I read it in French—it related to M. Herdsart—he said "I reside at 92, Belvidere Road; I keep a place under the name of Sanders; I had two pictures from an artist named Herdsart; I wrote to other artists, but these are the only pictures I obtained, I had the intention of paying him"—I showed him two sketches of "L'Atente" and "La Lundi," and he identified them as the two he had received, and said they were in the Antwerp Exhibition, and he thought he could dispose of them in London—as to the water-colours, he said "I know nothing about them, Martin brought them with him"—I brought him to London, and he was charged with the others—I went to 28, Stanmore Street on 27th December, and found about 70. letters in Leroy's room, addressed to H. Sanders, by Belgian and French artists—they were addressed to Lavadat and Woreschi, and others to Davis, 20, Stanmore Street, and to Barnes and to Charles De Keroomer—I also found the cover of a book stamped "H. Sanders, 92, Belvidere Road, S.E.," and a tissue copying book, some of the letters in which are signed Grond<lb/>smith and Son; others are signed differently—I also found various cata<lb/>logues of picture galleries in Vienna and Antwerp, in which Herdsart's and Oliver's and Cretien's pictures are marked—I found a quantity of note-paper with headings of Barnes, and of Lavadat, Woreschi, and of</p>

Cattell and Co.?"—he said "My name is Henry Cattell, and I am trading as H.

I am the wife of George Horne, of Ottershall, Bucking<lb/>hamshire—on 12th January I was living in Poland Street, Oxford Street, at my mother's, and met Taplin and Perring in a public-house in Oxford Street—we had some conversation about changing my apartments—Taplin said that his mother and sister kept a lodging-house on the other side of the water, and I went there with them; but the mother said that she would take no more people into her house, and they went back with me in a cab to Poland Street to remove my luggage—a proper cabman drove the cab—Perring went up to my room and took my box down—Taplin was in a public-house—directly my box went down I missed my gold watch and Albert chain, and went down and told my mother—I then looked for the cab, but it had gone, and my box also, which contained wearing apparel and other things, value about 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is a list of them—I have since seen the property found at 17, Windmill Street, and identify it, and also a handkerchief pawned by Sweeney.</p>

I have lost my watch and chain," and you had got it in your pocket—I was so poor that I was going to let you pay for my lodging, but I said that I would give it to you back—I left a clock at Mr. Osborne's, the jeweller's, to get money—he said that it was worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I asked him to have something to drink.</p>

I said "No, but if he is, and he has anything to do with you, fetch him out," and he fetched Taplin out and said "These things he has stolen from a young woman of mine"—I said "If they are you had better pay for what he had last night, and take them away"—they began quarrelling, and went away, leaving the things—I spoke to the police—a man named Kingswell came a few days afterwards and asked for the things that a dark young man had left—I refused to give them up, and he left.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Perring's Defence</hi>. We met the prosecutrix in Wardour Street in a beerhouse. She seemed very partial to my friend here, and we went in a cab to my lodging to pay my landlady. We went from there to Kennington to his mother's house, as she wanted a room, but his mother would not take her in. We took a lodging in Penton Street, and from there we went to Poland Street in a cab. I said, "Shall I come up and help you pack?" She said, "How can you?" I said, "I will put on the badge, and say I am the cabman." Her brother-in-law came up and said, "Clear out as soon as you can; you will rob anybody." I took down a japanned box and another article, and she met me and I did not go into the room again. A door opened and somebody said, "Have you been in my room to-day, I have lost my watch?" We went to Penton Street, and the landlord said, "You cannot come here, my wife objects to take children," and we went to a lodging-house and left the things. I think the fact of taking her to his mother's house shows that we had no intention of robbing her.</p>

The woman left me in charge of the little box, and told me to take charge of it, and said that I might do as I pleased with it, and I was rather short one day and pledged it in the name I am known by. I had had a wash, and the things were hanging about, but they were of no value to adybody but the owner.</p>

On 12th February, about 1 o'clock in the night, I was on duty in High Street, Whitechapel, and saw the pro<lb/>secutor—just as I got within ten yards of him he was knocked violently forward, and some one glided from behind him; except for that I am un<lb/>able to tell whether he was knocked or fell down—I went up to him, and saw the prisoner Hart kneeling on the prosecutor's knees, with his left hand in the prosecutor's trousers pocket—Kauffman had hold of him by the right arm, and another man by the left, who I pulled away, and then collared Hart, and drew his hand out of the prosecutor's pocket with these two keys on a ring in it, and some money dropped from his hand—Kauffman let go of him and picked up some of the money—some one said to the prosecutor "What is the matter with you, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>? get up, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—I took Hart and Kauffman—Kauffman pointed to the prosecutor, and said "I don't know him, I am a gentleman"—Hart said "I have taken nothing"—a shortish female stood by the prosecutor and Hart when I saw them first.</p>

I am a general dealer, of 23, Freeman Street—about 12.30 on the night Kauffman was taken in charge I saw him with Morris in Commercial Street—we stood talking, and saw Gray there drunk, and surrounded by prostitutes in white aprons—I saw him fall, and Kauffman and I went to pick him up—I saw some keys on the ground, but no money, and a minute or two afterwards I saw the constable take hold of Hart—the women were near then—I had been to a club—I have known Kauff<lb/>man for the last ten years—he has been manager to Michael Lyons, a boot and shoe maker, of Chiswell Street, who is here, for a number of years—he bears an excellent character.</p>

I said "I do not know you"—he said "I know you;" I said "I do not know you, and I do not want to know you"—I went to the Savoy public-house, and he came in after me—he said "Halloa, Harris, how are you?" I said "I do not know you"—he said "Oh, but I know you very well, I worked for you years ago; I worked with Morris; you know Morris well enough down where you live?" I said "Yes, I know Morris, but I do not know you, and I do not believe you are a plumber"—that was 5 or 10 minutes after the first conversation—I was not drunk, I only had two glasses of ale—I was having lemonade—I had one glass of ale in the Savoy—he said "Are you going to treat me, or shall I treat you?" I said "I do not want any, I have some here"—he said "Well, you can have one if you want it;" I said "No, I do not want it"—I then pulled out my cigar-case to give a gentleman</p>

I said "Oh, I am not particular to a cigar"—refer<lb/>ring to something in his hand, he said "This is not a Geneva lever, is it, old boy?" I said "What do you mean?" he said "Oh, it's all right"—I said "It strikes me you know something about my Geneva lever I lost last week;" he said "Oh, that is all right"—I said "Well, I will be going home;" he said "I am going with you, I live down your road"—I had not told him where I lived—he said he lived in New Court, close to where I lived—he does not live near me, he lives in the Southwark Road—several men and women were in the house—I treated one woman—the landlady Mrs. Nelson, called me to the bar—in conse<lb/>quence of what she said Rose Scott got into my trap—my boy was with us—we stopped in Queen Victoria Street to have a drink—I had a small bottle of lemonade—the prisoner kept on talking about the Geneva lever—he said "You think I have got your Geneva lever, if you think so lock me up;" I said "I do not know but what I shall do yet"—I went to the door, and sent my boy for a constable, who came, but did not take the prisoner—I went back into the public-house—the prisoner was fumbling down his leg, and seemed to pass something into a glass—he said "Here, drink, old boy"—I was about to drink it, when it was knocked out of my hand—he said "Well, there is no harm," producing what appeared to be a quartern rum-bottle from his pocket—I had another small lemonade—I asked Rose Scott what he had done; she said "He put something in your drink, you do not want that"—I was standing with my hands in my pockets, and saw the prisoner drop some<lb/>thing at my feet—he was standing close to me, and nobody was within three or four yards of us—I saw a book, and he said "You have dropped something;" I said "No, I have not, for I have not had my hands out of my pockets"—he said "Then it cannot be yours," and put it back in his pocket—I said "I will be getting off home, are you going?" he said "Oh, stop a minute, and have another drink"—I said "No"—I recognised the pocket-book at once as mine—after 10 minutes I got into the trap; the prisoner got in, I wanted him in—I drove him to the Black Horse, Leman Street, about a quarter of a mile from where I live—he said "I am not going farther;" I said "I am going to drive you home, if you are not going any farther I shall send for a constable and have you locked up"—I sent the boy for a constable to the opposite corner of the street, about 40 yards, when the prisoner had gone inside—Scott left me a few minutes past 11 in Queen Victoria Street—I gave the prisoner in custody about 12 o'clock—I saw him searched—he had the pocket-book in his hand, but I have seen no more of my property—I am sure I lost that pocket-book on 25th January among other articles.</p>

Our letters had crossed—I then wrote: "We beg to enclose you a statement of your account, and shall be obliged by your handing us the amount in bank notes on the 12th instant, and in the event of your failing us we shall resell them." The 12th was the settling day—no remittance came, and the stock was sold on the morning of the 13th at a loss 17 <hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wrote to him again, but never saw him till he was at the police-court.</p>

Fordham and Sons, general merchants—on 16th January in the after<lb/>noon the prisoner brought me a linen press and a special order—that would have to be checked by me—the price of the press was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I looked at the press and passed it as all right—the prisoner produced this invoice: "One linen press 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he was entitled to receive that sum upon that document after I put my initials at the end—the top line has since been added: "One dozen housemaid's boxes, No. 2 new shape, 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that would entitle the prisoner to receive 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—I gave no authority to receive that extra sum of 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not receive those articles—on 12th of February the prisoner produced this invoice: "Twelve housemaid's boxes 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—they were checked by Charles Wallis—I initialled it, giving an authority for the payment of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—"Twelve each housemaid's boxes, 2 and 3 old shape, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." has been added, which would entitle the prisoner to receive 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 16th February, about 4.30, the prisoner brought three dozen housemaid's boxes for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Wallis checked them—I gave an authority to receive that sum by initialling the invoice—nothing else was entered when I initialled it—"Three dozen housemaid's boxes each No. 1 and 3, 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." has been added—that would alter the authority from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—another invoice has been added from another department.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know where the other invoice is—we employ about forty people—I have been in the firm about twelve years—the prisoner has supplied them with articles near upon that time to the extent of thousands of pounds—this invoice is in Mr. Murray's, the cashier's, handwriting—we have fifteen or sixteen clerks—I have six men under me—I work on the country floor, that would be the third floor—goods are received on the ground floor and then removed to the upper stories—the man delivering them comes to me with the invoice, which I initial and hand back to the man, who takes it to the cashier, Mr. Murray, or to one of the firm, or to the town cashier—above 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we pay by cheque—2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid by cheque possibly because they had not sufficient cash—Mr. Harrison pays small amounts—Wallis receives the goods such as housemaid's boxes—he is not the stock-keeper for the whole place—some goods go to another department—there are ten or a dozen departments—Wallis sees all goods brought to his department,</p>

               <p>and looks at the invoices—I do not make any entry in any book when I sign an invoice—I believe Wallis does—Wallis's signature is sufficient for me that he receives the goods—I took the invoice down to Mr. John Fordham to ask him to look at the press—he came up and looked at it—I believe the firm have got back the money out of moneys owing to the defendant—8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was owing to him, 5 guineas were deducted and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. handed over to his wife—I remember selling a pony—I asked the prisoner whether he would like some tickets for a lottery or a draw, but I cannot remember shouting out to Charlie on that day.</p>

I am a German—I speak English—I live at 82, Drury Lane—I was formerly in the service of Urban Napoleon Stanger, at 136, Lever Street, St. Luke's—he was a baker, and I assisted him as a journeyman baker in his business—I was about two years with Stanger before 12th November, 1881, and about four or five months before he came there—he was doing a considerable business, it was the best busi<lb/>ness in the neighbourhood—I last saw him on Saturday night, 12th November, 1881, about 5 or 10 minutes to 12—he came home with Stumm, Mr. Lentz, and Mr. Kramer—Stanger came into the shop, and the other three went home—Mrs. Stanger was behind the counter—I went to bed—since I left Mr. and Mrs. Stanger together in the shop on that night I have never seen Stanger—the following morning about 8 or half-past 8 Mrs. Stanger called me and another German in the house, Peter Schroeder—when we came down she asked me if I had time to go and fetch Mr. Stumm from St. John Street Road—she did not say for what pur<lb/>pose—I fetched him from St. John Street Road, which was his home—he came to Lever Street about an hour afterwards—that would have been about 10 on the Sunday morning—I remained in the house till 2—Peter Schroeder and Stumm were there up to that time—I can't remember if I went out or to bed in the afternoon—I was at home again at 7—Stumm was there then—after the Sunday he stopped there every night, and after a week or a fortnight he went away for a few hours in the afternoon—he was a baker—he had sold his own shop at that time—he attended to the baking and to the business generally during that time—I left the employ<lb/>ment in the beginning of May, 1882—I was away four weeks, and went back in June some time, and continued there in Lever Street till Septem<lb/>ber last—Elizabeth Harvey was the servant there—I saw her in the bake-house on the evening of 13th September burning a paper over the gas—this parchment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was that paper—while she was burning it some customer was knocking in the shop, so that she was obliged to go into the</p>

               <p>shop to serve, and then she pushed it underneath the trough—I took it out, looked at it, and saw Stanger's name on it very often, so I took it to the Black Bull, a house of call for bakers, and gave it to Mr. Hein<lb/>rich, the proprietor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I and Peter Schroeder slept in the house on the second floor on the Saturday night—I think I was asleep when Peter came to bed—he was shutting up the shop—he was there when I woke up in the morning—Mr. and Mrs. Stanger used to sleep on the first-floor, under us—the three master bakers who came home with Mr. Stanger on the Satur<lb/>day night did not come into the house, they came to the door, and Mr. Stanger came in—I was not in company with them on that night: I was out about four or five hours by myself—I came home just a few minutes before Stanger—Mr. and Mrs. Stanger were both in the shop, and Peter was shutting it up when I went to bed—if I was awake I should hear a noise on the stairs—I did not hear Stanger come up to his bedroom, and I never saw him afterwards—Mrs. Stanger did not tell me the following morning that she did not know what had become of Mr. Stanger—I am sure she did not say anything at all about Mr. Stanger—I knew Stumm before he had sold his business—Mrs. Stanger said "Go and knock at the private door and desire Stumm to come directly"—she did not tell me the reason, and I did not ask her—on the Sunday night the baking for Mon<lb/>day went on—as Stanger had not made his appearance, Stumm overlooked the baking business—I had seen him at Stanger's house nearly everyday, or twice a day before this transaction, and I have seen Mrs. Stumm there sometimes—I don't know whether the families were on good terms—Kramer is dead; the other master baker, Lentz, who came to the house on that night, is here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, practising at 47, Mark Lane—I knew Urban Napoleon Stanger, of 136, Lever Street—I remember Stumm, the man who was convicted, calling at my office on 23rd November, 1881—he brought me the deeds of the property in Lever Street, and gave me instructions as from Stanger—on that I prepared a mortgage deed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the engrossment of the mortgage deed that I drafted and prepared—it was engrossed at Waterlow's—I saw Stumm again the following day, November 24th; he called again at my office and took away this engrossment—the mortgage is by Stanger to Charles Frederick Clark, 64, Caledonian Road, brewer, to secure 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by demise of the premises, 136, Lever Street, and interest at five per cent. payable half yearly—it is dated 5th October, the date given me by Stumm as the day the money was advanced—the proviso for redemption was that the money was to be paid within three months, and if not paid within that time interest was to be paid half yearly—there was an attestation clause and there was engrossed a receipt for the money, the stationer put that on without instructions—it was a clean engrossment on stamped parchment when I handed it to Stumm, there was no signature to it—I had it in my possession on the 23rd, and at that time there was no signa<lb/>ture</p>

               <p>of the grantor and no signature to the attestation clause—Stumm took it away—I next saw Stumm about the matter in February, the 23rd I think; he brought the deed with him—it then purported to have been executed, receipted, and attested—Urban Napoleon Stanger appeared as mortgagor and as having signed the receipt, and it purported to have been attested by Ch. F. Clark, 65, Caledonia Road; and in consequence of Stumm's instructions I had a reassignment endorsed upon it—that was engrossed by one of my clerks, Wintersgill—according to this the mort<lb/>gage is paid off and the property reinvested—the money was supposed to have been repaid on 6th January, the date of the equity of redemption, three months from the 3rd October—the reassignment is dated the 6th January, 1882—there was an attestation clause, also engrossed, to the reassignment—when the deed was so engrossed it was handed to Stumm, who took it away—I don't remember to have seen it again till I saw it in the hands of the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired Major in the Army, and live at Winni<lb/>ford Villa, Southampton—in March last year I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>: "Secretary wanted for a club, salary 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with allowances, address F. X., May's Advertising Offices, Piccadilly"—I replied, and on 13th March received a letter, which I cannot find, and on 15th March came to London and saw the prisoner at the club premises, Cursitor Street—I saw the prisoner, and said that I should like to have some particulars about the club—he said "I am the proprietor; it is a proprietary club, the premises belong to the Law Chambers Com<lb/>pany, and the rent is 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year. The standing furniture, such as the large tables and carpets, I have paid 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for"—we went over the rooms, and he showed me the furniture—the expensive things were billiard</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188302260073"/>
               <p>tables, and things of that kind, which with the pictures were included in the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I would consider about it, and let him know by post—he said that there were a great many applications for the secretary<lb/>ship, and mentioned clergymen's sons and persons well-to-do, and that the furniture had been valued at 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would draw up the agreement and send it to me by post, which he did on 15th March with this letter: "Dear Sir,—I enclose you a copy of the agreement about which I spoke to you to-day, which can be stamped, and then it becomes a legal document"—that is written on the inner side of the club prospectus (<hi rend="italic">The agreement was to perform the duties of secretary to the club for</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year and daily luncheon, on deposit of</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">upon which</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">per cent. interest would be paid, provided the accounts were correct</hi>)—I wrote accepting the situation, and an interview was appointed, but as my little boy was at the point of death I wrote and put it off, telling him to select another candi<lb/>date—he then wrote me this letter of March 22nd. (<hi rend="italic">Offering to keep the appointment open for a week, as he had declined the services of several gentle<lb/>men who had applied for it</hi>.)—I afterwards saw him, and signed the agree<lb/>ment (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the same as the other, except that I was to have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week more instead of lunch—I gave him a cheque for 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the balance in gold—it was not my own cheque, and I do not know what became of it—he gave me this receipt for the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I parted with my money believing that he had put 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the business, and that the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to secure my integrity—I commenced my duties on 17th April, and continued till 8th May—there was a clerk, who addressed envelopes—I only answered a little correspondence, nothing of any im<lb/>portance—I received money, and paid it, and it was duly entered in the book—the club consisted of three paying members only, and they were enrolled in my time—there were about four others, but they only put their names down on 6th May—the prisoner paid me a cheque for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a month's salary, and I cashed it—I saw Mr. Turpman on the premises several times, and found that he was secretary, and after having a con<lb/>versation with him I resigned at once, and received this letter from the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th May</hi>) accepting my resignation—I had an interview with him at Forest Hill in the presence of Mr. Hall and Mr. Roberts, when he expressed a great deal of contrition, and said that he would settle with us to-morrow and discharge us—Mr. Turpman was not present—next day I attended to receive my money, but the prisoner was not there, and at the hour appointed I received this letter by post from the prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had consulted a solicitor, who advised him not to pay the money till it became due in August, and that he must hold the witness liable for any act which necessitated the closing of the club, and was going to the North of England for a few days</hi>)—that was the last communication I received from him—I went to Bow Street, and the Magistrate granted a summons.</p>

I now live at 8, Upper Bedford Place—I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> like the other, only that the salary was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the prisoner at the club premises in January or February, 1882, we discussed the question, and I agreed to accept the situation and to deposit 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my fidelity, but I only paid 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I entered on the situation on 11th February, and the agreement is dated March 11th—I discharged the duties of secretary daily up to May—I directed between 2,000 and 3,000 envelopes, containing the club circulars, and did all else that was required of me—I parted with my 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. believing it was a guarantee for my fidelity—I saw Major Deacon as soon as he came on the premises, but did not have a conversation with him till May—I believe he sent in his resignation in consequence of that conversation—I then had an interview with the prisoner at Forest Hill, and said "You told Roberts the furniture was yours"—I don't think he answered—I said "It is strange you absent yourself from the club, when it is so neces<lb/>sary you should be there"—he said that the want of success was a dis<lb/>appointment to him, and he would find the money for us all next day—I did not discharge the steward's duties at the club; as far as I know there was no necessity for stewards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no club; there was no business—I was not engaged as canvasser—I did not take out a summons—my wages were paid regularly up to a week prior to the distress—I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am a week or two short—a week's notice was to terminate the appoint<lb/>ment—I arranged to pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit; my paying 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only was the result of an interview with Mr. Watson after I had the situation—my salary was 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was secretary before Major Deacon—I entered into the prisoner's employment and received wages before I paid the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 11th February, the day I went in—I engaged one porter for the club, not more.</p>

I called again on 4th April—before I signed the agreement he told me he had paid 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the furniture in the club; he pointed to it and said, "You have got good security for your money"—thereupon the agreement was executed—this is the me<lb/>morandum of agreement.

A receipt for the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is attached to that—I entered on my duties the same week—I parted with my money because Brett told me he had paid 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the furniture, and produced a document on which I saw written 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was there till 20th May—on 10th May he promised to come back and pay us back our deposits, but he never came back—after I entered on my duties some kamptulicon and a few chairs came into the club, but the bulk of it was there when I went in—I never received back my 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am a lathrender, of 36, Ship Lane—on Sunday night, 28th January, I was passing along the Hackney Broadway, when I saw the fire at Mr. Foreman's shop, between 9 and 10—I saw smoke coming from the top of the shutters—I saw Pickton kick the door three times with his right foot; the shutter of the door fell down, and he broke the front of the shop open with the shutter, and went in through the window—I saw him go up the stairs, and come down with two or three bundles in brown paper parcels—he went towards his home, somewhere by the side of the Duncan public; I saw him turn the corner, it is not more than 50 yards from the shop—he came back again, and with something in his arms went the same way—he said "It is a b—good job I had the things, if not they would only have been burnt"—I know Hobbs, Charles Smith the younger, and the father by sight—I did not see them there—I was there about a quarter of an hour—the fire was not out—a policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Lord Duncan, in the Broad<lb/>way, Hackney, a full-licensed house at the corner of Duncan Street—I have been there nine months—the two Charles Smiths keep a green<lb/>grocer's stall opposite my house—on this Sunday evening, at a quarter past 9, when the fire broke out, I and Miss Lane were in my bar—the elder Charles Smith was there and the younger Charles Smith was there part of the evening—my house is 150 to 170 feet from Mr. Foreman's—the elder Charles Smith stood at the corner smoking a long clay pipe—my door at the corner faces Mr. Foreman's shop—the elder Charles Smith looked over my window—on the cry of fire the bar was almost left empty—old Smith said "Here's the engines"—my barmaid stood on the counter—old Smith said "You wear pretty stockings, miss"—I said "Now, Mr. Smith, no rude remarks"—he must have been there 25 minutes before the fire broke out till about 5 minutes to 10.</p>

I am a hairdresser at 41, Coleman Street, Hackney—I was in my shop when I heard the cry of fire—Mr. Foreman's shop is 200 yards off—when I came up I saw people pushing things away and kicking the door open, and the shutters were falling—I stood at the corner of the Lord Duncan—from there I went home—Mrs. Smith in the fruiterer's shop said "Don't you think they set fire to that place?"—I said "I do not think so"—she said "What do you think of the robbery"—I said "I can see no robbery"—I was speaking in her shop about 20 minutes before the fire-engines came—I saw old Smith come out of the corner door of the Lord Duncan smoking a 10-inch pipe just as the engines came up—a little while after he returned into the Duncan again, and I saw young Charles Smith standing at the Duncan door six or seven minutes—I did not stay outside the place more than about two minutes; I came back again—Mrs. Smith did not say a word about Charles Smith, father or son, having taken part in the robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 20, Fowler Street, Camberwell Grove—I formerly lived at 28, Stonecutter Street, Farringdon Street, for about five years; it was the shop of the Freethought Publishing Company—at the commencement of October last that company was removed to Fleet Street—they vacated at the Michaelmas quarter—I was in the service of Mr. Bradlaugh and Mrs. Annie Besant; they represented the Freethought Publishing Company—up to that time Mr. Ramsay had been the manager of that company, and he was from day to day at the shop 28, Stonecutter Street—the <hi rend="italic">Freethinker</hi> was sold there, but not by the Free<lb/>thought Publishing Company—I decline to answer whether I used to sell it, or whether I have seen it sold in the shop, in case it might lead to a criminal information against me—I was not employed at all by Mr. Ramsay—I ceased to live at 28, Stonecutter Street when the Freethought Publishing Company removed to Fleet Street—I know Mr. Foote, he called in occasionally at Stonecutter Street when I was living there—if Mr. Ramsay and I were there he has seen us—Mr. Ramsay would be there at times attending to the business—I did not know where Mr. Foote lived—I know Mr. Kemp slightly—I don't know what he is by trade—I believe this cheque to be in the handwriting of Mr. Ramsay; I have no doubt of it—I should say this was his writing. (<hi rend="italic">The name and address in the bank-book</hi>.) I should say the filling up of these registra<lb/>tion forms are his writing—I am not sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Kemp's handwriting to speak to it—I have known him eighteen months or two years—I meet him occasionally—this "H.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Ramsay</hi>. You were manager of the Freethought Pub<lb/>lishing Company up to the time they left Stonecutter Street, and when they shifted to Fleet Street—you are manager there still—you removed to Fleet Street in consequence of requiring larger premises—you were not entirely employed at Fleet Street in managing the business of the company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier, and live at 84, Gower Place, Gower Street—I have been in the habit of delivering letters at 9, South Crescent, Bedford Square—I have been on duty there for 18 years—during the last year I have noticed how some of the letters I left there were addressed—some were addressed "G. W. Foote Esq., 9, South</p>

               <p>Crescent, Bedford Square, some Mr. G.W. Foote, Editor of the Free-thinker, and some G.W. Foote Esq.—I noticed letters so addressed for several months past—I put them in the letter-box in the door—I remem<lb/>ber on one occasion about three or four months ago, having a packet that was too big for the letter-box, and I rang the bell and gave it to the servant—that bore on it as part of the address "Editor of the Free<lb/>thinker"—I don't know whether it had Mr. Foote's name on it or not.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Foote</hi>. Since I saw the detective, Oldhampstead, I have made memorandums of the delivery of letters addressed to you—that was, I believe, on the 9th of last month; the first memorandum I took was on the 10th—I have often delivered letters addressed to the Editor of the Freethinker, but I can only recollect delivering one package, that was about three or four months ago, it might be longer—I cannot swear that I delivered any letter or package addressed to the Editor of the Freethinker between 16th November and 16th December; I should be surprised to learn I had not, because my belief is that I have delivered letters to you so addressed pretty well every week; I could not swear as to that interval—the 9th February was the first time I had any conversation on this subject—I have not been paid anything for coming here to-day—I expect to be paid my expenses, it has cost me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day to get off—I received half a crown on the night the subpoena was served, nothing else.</p>

He quoted largely from the works of Payne, Carlisle, Shelley, Byron, Professors Huxley and Tyndall, J.S. Mill, and others, whose works are still freely sold, and contended that if the Freethinker was blasphemous those works were blasphemous also, and that Christianity, like every other religion, ought to take its chance of success without having to depend, upon law and police.</hi>

At half-past 10 on Sunday night, 21st January, I was on duty in the Barking Road, East Ham—I saw a flash of light, and heard the report of some fire-arm in the direction of Barking—the Barking Road leads up to Barking within 200 yards of Bark<lb/>ing Lane—I continued on duty in the same locality—I heard a second report about half an hour after the first; but previous to that I went in the direction in which I heard the first report—I heard some men going across some building land—I went in that direction, and heard some one running along the road—I went into the road again, and found it was the prosecutor—he made a complaint to me, and gave me some information, in consequence of which I asked him to accompany me across the fields in search of them—he went with me—we came back into the Barking Road—I then told him he had better go to the police-station, and he left me to go there—about 5 minutes after I heard the second report—I got Josept Taylor to accompany me across some fields, and we came up with the two prisoners in the White Horse Lane—they were both loading their guns, ramming the charge with the ramrods—they both had double<lb/>barrelled guns—I asked them what they were out discharging firearms for at that time of night—Newton replied "We are only having a bit of sport"—I told them a man had been to me and complained of being shot, and did they know anything about it—they both said "We know nothing about it"—I told them they had better accompany me to the corner of the lane—they said they would not—I took Webb's gun away from him—I was in uniform—Taylor is a farm labourer—I told Taylor if he could to take the gun away from Newton—he attempted to close with him and do so, when Newton said "If you touch it I will put the but into you" or "strike you across the head," or something similar to that—they both refused to go to the police-station—I detained them for 10 minutes, and then I allowed them to pass on through the lane, directing them through</p>

                  </hi>. I am the manager of the Temperance and General Advance and Investment Company—it is an incorporated company—their offices are at 202, Bishopsgate Street—on 7th August last the defendant called at the office and said "I require an advance of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "What security have you to offer?"—he said "The security of my fur<lb/>niture"—I said "By bill of sale?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I cannot give you any answer until I have seen the furniture, I will do so the evening of the day after to-morrow"—two days afterwards I called at the defendant's house, 23, Wingfield Road, Leytonstone—he showed me through various rooms and pointed out the furniture—I said "Is all the furniture in these rooms absolutely your own and free from incum<lb/>brances?"—he answered "Yes"—I then said "Is any of the furniture on hire?"—he said "No, with the exception of a sewing machine which I have had from Messrs. Davis"—I said "Have you a marriage settle<lb/>ment?"—he replied "No"—I then handed him our ordinary form of application to fill up, and I saw him sign—in consequence of that I in<lb/>structed the solicitor to fill up a bill of sale—30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced by cheque—two instalments were paid—on the third coming due the defendant called and said "I am unable to meet the instalment due to-day, will you kindly allow it to stand over for a fortnight or three weeks?"—I said "Yes"—that was on 1st November—he called again in a few days</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188302260099"/>
               <p>and said "Will you advance me a further sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the security you now hold?"—I said "In the face of an instalment being already overdue I cannot do so, but I will not press you for payment of the in<lb/>stalment for a week or so"—I received no more money—I entered into possession—on 18th December I received a letter, and in consequence of an interview with Mr. McCandlish I had to give up the furniture—I issued a writ on 18th December in civil proceedings—he had given me a promissory note—it is the usual custom to take one—at the time civil proceedings were taken I was not aware the furniture was on hire.</p>

You had the first lot of goods in April, 1881, and the last were delivered in March, 1882—there were nine deliveries between April, 1881, and March, 1882—he had been paying monthly for them—the agreement setting out that the furniture was on hire was not entered into till 5th July, 1882—I cannot swear whether there is a word about hire on the receipts. (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition being read, stated</hi>: "I never gave the prisoner a receipt for payments on account of these goods with the word 'hire' in it.") That is my signature—that must be so, I was considering the first lot of goods—no doubt I said it—I call my system the easy purchase system—it is unusual to supply furniture upon the hire system without an agreement—the schedule was added when the agreement was drawn up—in my first examination before the Magistrate I was not sure of that—I said several months might have elapsed before the schedule was added—the clerk called my attention to that statement once or twice—the second</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 303). About 11.30 on the night of 18th February I was on duty in the Victoria Dock Road with Constable Hopkins—on turning the corner into Eagle Street I saw Suleman, a coloured seaman, thrown from the door of a brothel, No. 9, by the hands of a female—I went to him—he was lying on the ground on his left side—I picked him up, and found him bleeding from a wound over his right temple, and there was another on the top of his head, and another behind his left ear—I went into No. 9, and called out "Is Holmes in?"—after about three minutes Holmes came to the front parlour door in his shirt only—Suleman had followed me into the passage—he said, pointing to Holmes, "That man strike me," and he put his hand to his head—Holmes said "You are mistaken; I have been in bed since 10 o'clock"—Suleman said again "You did strike me; <hi rend="italic">mumma</hi> take my money"—I told Holmes to dress himself—I then went into the back kitchen with Suleman and Constable Hopkins—Donelly, Holmes's wife, Devine, and a woman named Swan were sitting round the kitchen fire—Suleman went up to Devine, put his hand on his right shoulder, and said "This man strike me, sahib," pointing to his head—he counted his fingers, "One man in front room strike me, one man in this room strike me"—Holmes was in the front room dressing at this time—Suleman pointed to Donelly, and said "This <hi rend="italic">mumma</hi> snatched my money, 2 1/2 rupees"—that would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in English money—it was English money he had, two florins and a shilling, only he called it rupees—I said to Devine "I shall take you into custody for being con<lb/>cerned with Holmes and a woman in assaulting this man and robbing him of 2 1/2 rupees"—Devine said "All right, if you want me to go I will go with you"—he was under the influence of drink, not very drunk—I went to the front room door to Holmes to see if he was dressed—I told him he would have to go to the station with me—he said "All right, sir, I will go"—I did not make any charge against him—I got them to the station and charged them with being concerned with a woman not in custody in assaulting Suleman and robbing him of 2 1/2 rupees—Holmes said "I was in bed, and know nothing of it"—he did not say what time he was in bed—ho had mentioned at his house that he had gone to bed at 12 o'clock—Devine said "I thought I was at my lodgings"—he said he could get a good character from his captain—about 3.30 on the next morning, the 19th, I went in company with Suleman to 9, Eagle Street—I knocked at the door; it was opened by Donelly—I said "Can you tell me where 'Black Polly' lives?"—she said "I will go and show you; she lives in Poplar Street"—that is adjoining Eagle Street—I knocked at the door and asked the person who opened it if Mrs. Carroll was in—she said she was upstairs in the presence of Donelly and Suleman—Mrs. Carroll is called "Black Polly"—she called out from upstairs "Yes, I am in; who wants me?"—I said "The police"—she came to the street door—Suleman said "That is not the <hi rend="italic">mumma</hi> that take my money"—Donelly had crossed over to a street lamp opposite the corner of Eagle Street, and Suleman went up to her and turned to me and said, "Sahib, this <hi rend="italic">mumma</hi> snatched</p>

               <p>money," making a motion with his hand—I said to Donelly, "You hear what this man says, I shall have to take you in custody for being concerned with two other men in custody with assaulting and robbing him of 2 1/2 rupees"—she said "I never had his money"—I took her to the police-station, Barking Road, and she was charged there with being concerned with Holmes and Devine in stealing 2 1/2 rupees—she said to Suleman "You black sewer, I never had your money;" that was all the reply she made to the charge—I found a shilling on Holmes—in the passage at 9, Eagle Street Suleman picked up four pieces of a glass decanter in the presence of Donelly, Holmes, and Devine, and said to me "This is what struck me"—they made no reply.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On 18th February, about 11.30, I was in the Victoria Docks Road—I went into Eagle Street, and saw Suleman thrown by a woman from No. 9, which is a brothel kept by Holmes—I assisted a constable to get him up—he was bleeding from wounds on his right temple, the top of his head, and behind his left ear—I went into No. 9 with the last witness, who called out, "Is Holmes in?" in three minutes Holmes came to the door in his shirt, and Doyle said "This man says he has been robbed and assaulted in your house"—Holmes said "He must be mistaken, for I have been in bed since 10 o'clock"—Suleman said, pointing to Holmes, "That man struck me"—I went into the back kitchen and saw Devine and Donelly, and two other women, sitting by the fire—Suleman touched Devine, and said that he struck him on the head, and pointing to Donelly, "That woman was there"—Holmes came into the kitchen in two minutes, but was not there during the conversation—Devine was under the influence of drink—when he was charged he said that he could get a good character from his captain.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Holmes's Defence</hi>. I went to bed early, as there were three or four ships in, and I had to get up early. I heard no noise, and was asleep till I heard the knock at the door, and went to the door in my shirt. I was taken to the station without my stockings, and have had none since. I had never seen the prosecutor till then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Donelly's Defence</hi>. About half an hour before the policeman came I had been to bed, and this darkie and another darkie frightened a lot of white men. This darkie had a knife out. I said "Mind, he has a knife in his hand." This darkie rushed into our house, and what they did with the other darkie I don't know. I went downstairs when they came and took Mr. Rose and the other man in custody. He said I should have to go to the police-court, and I said "All right, I will go."</p>

Cannon Row, Woolwich—I know the three prisoners by sight, and also Harry Pritchard—they are occasional customers—on Saturday, 29th January, I closed my house at midnight and went to bed—I heard a tumult in the direction of the Prince of Wales public-house, about 100 yards off, looked out at the window, and saw Goggin, John Cane, and Pritchard coming down the road—it was moonlight, and there was a lamp just above my house—I saw McCarthy near his door, and as he turned to go into his house Goggin pulled hold of him and forced him into the middle of the road, and they fought for 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour—a soldier named Alexander picked McCarthy up once or twice, and then moved</p>

               <p>down the street a door or two below my house, and Goggin, John Cane, and Pritchard went up and attacked him—he defended himself, but was soon down—I could judge that they were fighting, by the savage thuds which I heard—Reilly came up and said that he would not stand to see a man murdered like that; he is a powerful man, and beat off the three of them—Peter Cane then came upon the scene, and the fight was renewed—the four were getting the worst of it, when Pritchard said "Hold on a minute, I will fetch something which will do for him," and ran to a house 20 yards up a court, and returned immediately with something in his hand which I took to be a soldier's belt—I went downstairs, but the door was locked, and I returned to the window and saw them kicking Reilly, who was on the ground—I heard cries, and the tumult was like Pandemonium—some of them were drinking beer in the street out of cans—Reilly was taken into a house smothered in blood.</p>

On Sunday, 28th January, about mid-day, Reilly made a complaint to me, and I went to the station with him—about 12.30 that afternoon I met Peter Cane in Beresford Street, and said "Peter, I want you"—he said "All right, Sir, do you know what it is for?"—I said "Assaulting a man named Reilly last night"—he said "I know nothing about it"—on the following Thursday I went to 1, Collingwood Street with Griffin, and found John Cane hiding behind an arm-chair in the front room—I said "John, is that you?"—he said "Is that you, uncle? I would rather you would take me than somebody else"—I am not his uncle; that is my nickname—I said "You have given us a great deal of trouble"—he said "Everybody has to get a living; I suppose I shall see Commissioner Kerr over this."</p>

On Sunday, 28th January, about 1-25, I saw Goggin in the New Road, Woolwich, and said "Goggin, I want you for being concerned with three other men in assaulting a man shortly after twelve o'clock last night"—he said "I was not there, I know nothing about it"—his waistcoat and trousers were smothered in blood and dirt—I took him to the station.</p>

I am a fellow of the Royal College of Sur<lb/>geons and surgical registrar at St. Thomas's Hospital—I remember Donovan being brought there about the end of March, 1881—he was suffering from bruises on the face, an abrasion of the nose, and symptoms of tetanus—he remained in the hospital two days—he died from tetanus caused by the injuries to the face and nose caused by severe blows by some hard body; a kick would be as likely as anything to cause it—Mr. Butler, another Burgeon who also attended Donovan, is now at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

               <p>about 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Blackman Street—I told him he would be charged on a warrant with causing the death of Matthew Donovan about March two years ago—he said "I am glad it is settled, so help me God"—at the station he said "I have been travelling all over the country, to Bristol, Newcastle, Wales, and Chatham"—the inspector read over the charge to him—he said "I am glad of it; I went to see Mr. Green before the Magistrate; I can clear myself"—I had been endeavouring to find the prisoner from the time the alleged offence was committed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard that he had been working at Stratford, and also that he had been in the neighbourhood where I apprehended him.</p>

                  </hi>. Matthew Donovan was my father; he was in his 62nd year—he generally had pretty good health—he was a sober man—he lived in the same house with me—I saw him when he was brought home on 20th March—he went to the hospital on the same day, and on the 28th he was admitted as an in-patient—he had been an out-patient for about a week—he complained of the pain in his face almost directly he came home; he complained that he could not take any food, that he could not get his mouth open to take any food—he complained of that directly he was brought home from the accident—he got gradually worse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, and live at 2, Little Suffolk Street—on the night of 19th March, 1881, I was with the prisoner and Nubbins, at the coffee stall in Suffolk Street—I saw Freeman and Donovan there—we had some coffee, called for three more cups, and Freeman would not serve us till we paid for the others—Donovan came round from behind his stall and caught hold of Quinlan, and in Quinlan struggling to free himself, they both fell down on the ground, Donovan still keeping hold of Quinlan round the neck, and while they were on the ground Nubbins kicked him in the side or back—I did not see any other kick—Quinlan got up first, I believe—he did not kick Donovan before he got up—I did not say anything about kicking—I did not see the witness Huggins there—when Quinlan got up he went across the road, and Donovan went and fetched a policeman, who took Quinlan into custody—I followed them over to the police-station—Nubbins got away somewhere—the constable came out after me, and I was charged with the assault also—I was admitted to bail—next morning I went before the Magistrate and was remanded for a week on bail—I surrendered again—I was then fined 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or a month; I paid the fine—after Donovan died I was charged with manslaughter here and was acquitted by the direction of the Judge—I believe Nubbins is in Australia—I last saw him about a week after the occurrence.</p>

               <p>—when Quinlan got up Donovan did not keep hold of his leg so that he should not get away—Quinlan walked away and Donovan got up and walked after him—I did not hear anybody call out "The old b—won't leave go," nor did I hear anybody say "Kick him off"—I did not say so—I first mentioned Nubbins's name when I gave evidence for the prisoner at the police-court—I heard Donovan say at the station that Quinlan had kicked him; I can't say that I heard him say where—I did not hear him say he had kicked him on the nose or face.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Speller's Court, Blackfriars—on the 26th December I closed the house and fastened the window at 1 a.m.—next morning at 8 o'clock I found the window had been opened and a nail removed which I had fastened it with—I missed a coat, waistcoat, and shawl, which I have since identified—on 31st December, in consequence of what my wife said, I went to 11, Speller's Court and saw the prisoner Michael Keefe—I said, "Michael, you know something of my things, and if you did not have those things you know who did"—he said, "Well, George, I will see you at 6 in the evening at the Angel"—that is in Webber Street—I went there at 6 o'clock, and he came in and said, "Well, George, I did not have your things, but I will do all I can to find them"—he came to me next evening and said, "I have been to a pawn shop and found the things, and had them stopped; I will see you again to-morrow"—I spoke to Jupe, and next evening Michael Keefe came, and Jupe at the same time—he said to Jupe, "I have been over and stopped the things at the pawnbroker's," mentioning the pawn<lb/>broker's name, which I forget—the same afternoon Jupe and I met both the prisoners outside the Victoria Tavern, and we all went to Somers Town together, and the police arrested Daniel Keefe outside, who was tried last Session (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 508)—the coat and waistcoat which I lost were made at Macdonald's in the Waterloo Road, where Michael Keefe's father works, and he helps his father, so that the clothes were probably made by his father.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—we have been married 17 years—he is a lighterman—we live at 25, West Lane, Bermondsey—about 8 o'clock on 29th January he was the worse for drink, and about 11 o'clock he was lying on the floor in the back room—he got up and came into the front room, where the bed was—I was going in there to go to bed, and he shut the door in ray face—my three girls and I stood against the door to keep him out—he said that he would get something to break it open, and he would rip me up—he also said that he would go down and get a chopper and chop the door down—he did not, but he broke the panel in and went into the front room to go to bed—he then came towards me with something in his hand, I could not see what, as there was only the light of a sixpenny lamp—he struck the back of my hand with it and cut it—my hand was dressed at the station—I think this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's knife.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the Rev. Alexander Murray, who died in February, 1881—I am now living at Forest Hill—in January, a year after his death, I proved his will—I produce the probate—with the exception of a few articles he left me all his personal property—in January last I was living at St. Helens, Bournemouth, with my son and his wife—my son was in partnership with Mr. Nesbit, a photographer—the property my husband had left me, of the value of about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was temporarily at this place until I took a house for myself—it consisted of a little furniture, chiefly books, plate, pictures, and other articles—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were all there—this case contains a large Bible presented to my husband by the congregation—this inkstand was also presented to my husband by the congregation—in July I left Bournemouth to go for a two months' visit to Scotland, leaving all my property at Bournemouth except the trifles I took with me—I left all these things—the inkstand when I left it had an inscription plate across here, and a brass handle above that attached to the plate—I arrived back at Bournemouth, I think, the end of September; everything was gone except a very few things of no or very little value—I had not given instructions to any one to remove my property—none of these things are excepted in the special legacy to my son—on 9th December I caused an advertisement with regard to the property to be put into the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> newspaper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My son was married in June, 1880—he was in no situation at that time; he had come home from China—he had 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week from his father at the time he married; that was not continued after he married—they went to live at Catford—my son was not in receipt of any income, he was looking for a situation—he married a Miss Mennie, the prisoner's niece—she had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I believe my son was 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in debt when he married—he paid off his debts after his father's death with the money left him—he inherited a house in Jersey, which he sold in order to pay them and to have a little money to put into business—I never heard that he received any money with his wife—she furnished the house at Catford, or partly furnished it—I believe he made a little money occasionally looking for situations, and doing any<lb/>thing he could get to do—it was very little, I believe—my husband and I went to Marseilles for the benefit of his health, and my son and his wife came to us there immediately after their marriage—we thought it a very imprudent marriage—we had a little furniture in our house at Croydon—I believe my husband gave them permission to use it until we came home—this inkstand had been in our house at Croydon; it was generally kept in the drawing-room; it is an ornamental one, wood inlaid with brass—after my husband's death I came back to live at Catford with</p>

               <p>them—my son went into partnership with a Mr. Nesbitt, at Bournemouth, and paid a considerable sum of money to him—my daughter-in-law was never in good health; she had been prematurely confined in June, 1882—she had another child which is still living, and I have it now in my charge—all the goods were moved from Catford to Bournemouth—I packed my own things, and they went down along with the others—my son and I insured the things together, mine as well as his—I was not aware that he had insured them with a declaration that the whole of the things in the house belonged to him—I never heard it; it was not true if he did—I think I heard it said at the trial at Winchester—I never heard my son say so—I believe all the things were insured in his own name with my permission, simply for convenience—at that time my son and his wife were on perfectly good terms, and were so at the time I left—I never heard of any serious quarrel between them—there was a quarrel I understood after I left, but I did not understand it was at all serious—I went to Scotland in July, my son joined me there on 26th August—I think he told me he had left his wife and child at Bournemouth—he said there had been a difference between them, and he had come away for a short time till it was healed—he never told me that he did not intend to go back; we were going back together—I did not go back to Bournemouth when I left Scotland; I had business in London, that was the only reason—I intended to go back after I had settled that—I had no idea that the furniture was sold—my son had arranged to go back to Bournemouth with me—as far as I know, his partner advised him to stay away for a time while he was selling the furniture—I did not wish to return till their quarrel had been made up—I did not wish to mix myself up with their quarrels—I never heard that there was any suggestion of immorality between Mr. Nesbitt and my son's wife—I have heard that pro<lb/>ceedings in the Divorce Court were talked of—I did not hear that she had alleged cruelty on the part of my son, or desertion—he did not desert her—I heard from some one that she had said so—before I went to Scotland I asked my daughter-in-law to take charge of my things—I never told my daughter in Mrs. Curtis'a presence that the furniture there was all their own—my son is here to-day—he was at Bournemouth during the proceedings before the Magistrate there—he gave me what assistance he could—the prosecution was against his wife and Mr. Nesbitt by me alone—I did everything in my power to avoid the prosecution—I tried to speak to my daughter-in-law and to Mr. Nesbitt, but they both treated me with the utmost contempt—my son did not promise to put a stop to the proceedings if his wife would only come and live with him—I heard it said that he had done so—I did not hear a witness swear it in Court—I left the Court directly I had given my evidence, and heard nothing more; it was too painful to stay and listen to—my son told me that he had had an interview with his wife and told her if she would give up my property I would take no steps whatever—he did not tell me that he had said if she would come back and live with him he would give up the proceedings—the things charged in the indictment are mere trifles, a few knives and other things—my daughter-in-law had a little jewellery of her own—her husband gave her a very handsome gold necklet and a silver one—the jewellery was not kept in the plate chest at Bournemouth—she asked me to keep a silver mug for her and a couple of children's spoons</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188302260128"/>
               <p>—I don't know what has become of her jewellery since these pro<lb/>ceedings—I think my son has one or two things, intending to keep them for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I contributed to the expenses of the different houses in which I lived with my son and daughter-in-law; I paid a large board and a good deal besides—that was one of the things that induced me to live with them—he took the house at Bournemouth in his own name, and insured the goods there in his own name—I wrote to my daughter-in-law from Scotland to ask her to join me there, as she was in very poor health, but she declined—I was only away for two months, and my son was about a fort<lb/>night with me—when I returned I asked for my daughter-in-law's address, as I wished to communicate with her, but her relatives refused me her address—I found that all my property was removed to Mr. Nesbitt's house—they were recovered at different places, some at friends of Mr. Nesbitt's, some at Mr. Garnet's—my silk sealskin jacket was found at Loughborough Station, and a great many of the things were utterly destroyed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Garnet, a hatter, of 64, Lothian Road, Brixton—in November last I had a room to let, and I had a card up stating that fact—about 11.30 on the morning of Saturday, 11th November, the prisoner called on me; she was quite a stranger to me—she said she had seen the card, and asked me if I would let her the room—she did not wish to see the room, as she did not wish to live in it, but merely to warehouse some goods for a lady in Wales; and she asked if it would be convenient to bring them in half an hour from Vauxhall Station—she brought them in a cab in about half an hour—the rent was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week—she paid me for three weeks' and a shilling, as I had not change enough—she put the things in the room, locked the door, and took the key—she did not give me her name and address; I did not ask for them at that time—this inkstand was among the goods warehoused at my house—I next saw her on the fourth week, she came when the rent was due—I told her I wished her to take the things away, as I wanted the room for a lady, or if she could not take them away I would place them in my apart<lb/>ment, and then she said she would communicate with the lady and let me know on the Monday morning—on the Monday she came and said she had been to Wales and seen the lady, and she was quite willing I should put them in my own apartment, as she was too ill to travel—she sorted them, and I wanted her to take an inventory; she did not care to do it, but she did do it, saying she did not care to write in her own handwriting—she did not say why—she made an inventory, which she took away with her—she wrenched the handle off the inkstand—I said "What a pity!" she said "Oh, that does not matter, it is of no value"—I did not see the plate—she wrapped the bundle in a piece of cloth, which she took away with her—she also took away some letters out of a gentleman's letter-case—the things were removed into my own apartments—I saw her again about 12th January, I think—I went to the Law Courts to try and identify her—before that I had looked at some of the articles, and the inscription in this large Bible had attracted my attention—it is in the Bible still: "Presented to the Rev. A.J. Murray by the ladies of his congregation as a mark of their affectionate esteem." In consequence of that I went to Croydon, and saw the wife of the Presbyterian minister there, and after that I went</p>

               <p>to the Law Courts to see if I could identify the prisoner—the last time I saw her I said "If I wish to communicate with you about these goods I have no idea of your address"—she said it would be all right—I pointed her out to Detective Melville.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see any plate on the inkstand at all, only the handle—these things had been in the room before then, locked up—I had made no examination—I could not tell if the handle was loose—I was no party to the proceedings at the Law Courts—I only went to identify—I saw a child—I did not know what the proceedings were about—I saw the prisoner there—she wrote out the inventory herself, and took it with her—I merely asked her if she would take an inventory.</p>

On 12th January I went to the New Law Courts with Mrs. Garnet, and she there pointed out Mrs. Mennie, the prisoner, to me—in consequence of that I afterwards took the prisoner in custody on a warrant on the 25th January, at 41, Arthur Road, Brixton—I read the warrant to her, she said "I know nothing about Mrs. Murray's property; I know she took the things away, and I know where she put them"—this was Mrs. Murray, junior—I subse<lb/>quently told her that she had been identified as leaving some things at 64, Lothian Road—she said "I will say nothing"—I searched the house, found nothing, and she then added "Mrs. Keys knows more about the things than I do, and she ought to be treated the same."</p>
