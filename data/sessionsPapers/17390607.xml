            . I have seen the Prisoner bring Lamps into my Room, in Lambeth-Rents, in Petticoat-Lane. About five Weeks ago, I saw him bring a Globe Lamp in his Apron into the Room, about two o'Clock in the Morning: I can't remember the Day of the Month, but 'twas the Day the Charity-Children walked to Christ-Church. I saw him pull it out of his Apron and set it down on the Dresser: Then He, and William Greenaway's Brother, called up Greenaway out of his Bed, and asked him, if he would go out with them to get more, and they all went out again on that Design. The Prisoner had formerly lodged in the House, but had left his Lodging there, some Time before the Fact was committed.</p>

            . About seven Weeks ago we lost seven Lamps out of our Ward, and upon Enquiry after them, I heard that some disorderly Persons had a Lodging in a little Alley, in Petticoat-Lane. On the 15th of May I went to this Room, having been directed to it by a Watch-man, and found five or six Fellows playing at Cards, but there was neither Chair, Table, nor Stool in it.

             told me he belonged to the Room, and upon looking about, I saw a Heap of Rags, under which, I found six Rims of Lamps. Greenaway told me they belong'd to him, that he was a Lamp-Lighter, and lit Lamps in Thames-street. I told him we had lost several Lamps, and that I must take him into Custody. I seized him accordingly, and he was committed to Bridewell as a Disorderly Person, because the Tin Man could not swear to the Rims. The next Morning I went again to the same Room, and took Vaughan, the Evidence. As I brought him down Stairs, he told me he had a Favour to beg of me; which was, that I would intercede for him, that he might be made an Evidence.</p>

Greenaway to get up, and go out with them again for more; he did so, and they all went out again, but I did not know what they were about, for I was in Liquor the same Time. <rs id="t17390607-1-verdict4" type="verdictDescription">

            . I live at the Flying Horse without Bishopsgate, and keep Livery Stables there. About the Middle of September last I was at Wandsworth; and there I saw the Prisoner, who told me he had a pretty Mare to sell. I went into a Stable, and when I had seen her, I ask'd him what she was worth? He ask'd me 11 l. and I bid him 7 l. or seven Guineas, but he not being inclinable to take my Money, I came home. In about a Week's Time he brought her to my Stables, and set her at Livery, desiring me to help him to a Customer for her if I could, and telling me she was his Property: But one Morning when he came to see her, I told him, I would buy her myself, if we could agree upon Price, and in Talking I bid him 8 l. and at last eight Guineas, which he took for her; this was about the 29th of September last. The Mare for which I paid this Money to the Prisoner, is the same that Mr. Warren afterwards own'd. I did not ask the Prisoner how he came by her, for when I saw him at Wandsworth, I found he was an Acquaintance of my Brother-in-Law's there, and upon that Account I had no Suspicion of him. I had had her about a Fortnight, before Mr. Warren came to enquire after her, and had put her to Grass at Plastow, for she was very poor when I bought her. I believe I told Mr. Warren at first, who I bought her of, and about two Days after he had claim'd her, the Prisoner come into my Yard, and I took him.</p>

He said he had work'd her very hard, and as he was going over to Holland, and wanted Money, I should have her for eight Guineas: I told him 'twas too much Money for her, for she was very poor, and a little lame; but at last we went to the Black Bull Alehouse, and there he agreed I should have her for six Guineas. I paid him the Money in the Alehouse, and took a Receipt for it before two or three People, and spent a Shilling in the House. I drive a Cart at Queen-Hithe, and have work'd there twenty Years. At that Time I wanted a Horse for my own Use; for I buy and sell Corn, and serve a great many Gentlemen's Servants with Corn.

[The Prosecutor shew'd the Places where he had been wounded] I had 24 Guineas in this Pocket, so I clapp'd my Hand into it, while one of the Men thrust his Hand into the other Pocket, out of which he took two Half-crowns, and some Half-pence, and then said, - I have got it! Then they went a little Way from me, and one of them came back immediately, and put his Hand into this Pocket where the Gold was, and took out two Guineas, leaving me 22 behind: I believe, when I put my bloody Hand into my Pocket, I might raise them up from the rest, and, perhaps, as I lay upon the Ground; they might see them. When they had done this, they left me, and I saw no more of them. At that Time, when they cut me down, I was alone, and lay upon the Ground, till the Hostler at the Crown at Kensington took me up and carry'd me to a House. How long I lay on the Ground I can't tell, but I believe it was not long before I was taken to the Dolphin, at the Gore in Kensington. After the Hostler had found me, several other Friends came up, and among them Mr. Banks, who was robbed the same Night. I told the People at the Gore that I had been robb'd by three Soldiers, and what I had lost; but I cannot take upon me to say the Prisoners are the Men, for they cut me so fast, and the Blood flew about me in such a Manner, that I could not take Notice of them, so as to remember their Faces; I saw three other Men before these Men were charged, but I could say nothing to them, nor can I swear to these.</p>
               <p>Coldlough. Had the Soldiers who robb'd you their Accountrements on and their Spatterdashes?</p>
               <p>Mr. Swafford. I can say nothing to that; they gave me no Time to observe any thing, but came upon me without saying a Word, and fell upon me with their drawn Swords, till I dropt to the Ground.</p>
               <p>Geo. Banks. I live next Door to Mr. Swafford; he is a <rs id="t17390607-5-viclabel28" type="occupation">Carpenter</rs>

I had been with him to London, and we were returning home between Eight and Nine that Night: When we came to the Half-way House, I stopp'd to make Water, and Mr. Swafford walk'd on, and was got some Distance before me. As I went after him, I saw three Men cutting another Man, but I did not know it was Mr. Swafford, so I endeavour'd to pass by them, and as I was striving to get past them, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070005"/> Prisoner Caldclough got hold of my Collar. I saw them actually cutting Mr. Swafford, and not knowing him, was endeavouring to get from them. There were three Men, and I think they had all Soldiers Cloaths on, but I can't say I saw any more than two Swords drawn, nor did I then observe that Mr. Swafford was bloody. I am positive to Caldclough, and that he had his Sword drawn, but I can say nothing to the other Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cald lugh. Was it light, or dark?</p>
               <p>Banks. Very Moonlight: The Evening was just closing. I had got five or six Yards from them, when Caldclough came up to me: I asked him what he wanted? And immediately the two others who were robbing Mr. Swafford, left him, and came up to me. I endeavoured to get away from them, but Caldclough followed me, with his drawn Sword, and cut my Hat off my Head, which he himself took up directly. After Caldclough had seized me by the Collar, another of them came up, and they both thrust their Hands into my Pockets, and took out five Guineas and about 13 or 14 Shillings in Silver, and three Silver Pennies. When they had done with me, I made off towards Kensington, and they went back - towards Mr. Swafford, who was about five or six Yards distant from the Place where I was attack'd. As I went homewards, I met a Friend, and asked him if he had seen Mr Swafford? He told me, be came directly from Kensington, and had seen no body. I told him I had been robb'd, and if he had not met him, I fear'd he was murder'd; and upon going back to see for him, we found him wallowing in his Blood, and very much cut, and his Nose hanging into his Mouth: We got Help, and carry'd him to the Dolphin at the Gore, and I went for a Surgeon. After we had seen proper Care taken of him, I went up to the Court, and desired Madam Keen, (Mr. Loman's Daughter) to get the Roll called over, and upon calling over the Roll, three Soldiers were missing from the Guard, but the two Prisoners were then upon Duty. After the Roll had been called over, I went home; and in the Morning I was sent to, and was informed that the three Men who were missing over Night, were then returned, and I went to see them, but could not swear to any of them; however, they were carry'd before Justice Hinson, and not giving a satisfactory Account where they had been, he committed them to Newgate, but they have since been bailed out. Three Weeks after this, I met one James, a Bricklayer, in the Strand, and he told me he believed the right Men were taken; upon which I went with him to the Savoy, and saw Caldclough first: He was then in Custody, and I asked him if he knew me? He said, - No. I told him he had seen me once too often, for he was the Man that had robbed me: He then desired me to do him no Hurt; and I told him I would hurt him no farther than was consistent with Justice. Then I went to look at the Evidence, he lay on a Couch, but I could not swear to him; nor could I charge the other Prisoner when I saw him. I asked the Evidence (in the Savoy) if he knew me? He said, No, but I was very like the Man that he robb'd; and, if I was the same Person, I had then on a new Pair of Buck-skin Breeches, and that among the Money he took from me there were two Silver Pennies. There were three among the Money I was robb'd of, but one of them we found next Morning on the Ground, in Mr. Swafford's Blood. He told me farther, that he took two Guineas, and about nineteen Shillings in Silver from us both, beside the two Silver Pennies; but I lost five Guineas, which another Man took out of my Pocket; for there were two Men took Money out of my Pockets. He added, that Caldclough and Morris were the Men who were concerned with him in these Robberies; but Morris told some Persons who were present, that he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Caldclough. Had we our Spatterdashes and Accoutrements on?</p>
               <p>Banks. I think they all had Soldiers Cloaths on, and I believe they had Spatterdashes over their Stockings. I was 'frighted at the Time, - but I believe it was so.</p>
               <p>Caldclough Was it I or the other, that put the Hand into your Pocket?</p>
               <p>Banks. There were two Men who put their Hands into my Pockets, I had five Guineas in my Right-Hand Pocket, and I am sure the Prisoner Caldclough's Hand was in one of my Pockets, but who the other Man was, I can't tell.</p>

We had been drinking that Night at the Suttling House at St. James's, and talked about going to the Gore, and robbing the first Person we should meet. Accordingly we went thro' the Middle-Park, and along Kensington-Road 'till we came past the Half-way House. Then we looked back, and saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070006"/> Mr. Swafford and Mr. Banks coming up. I did not know either of them then, - but the Persons we saw, prove to be these Gentlemen. When we first discovered them, they were Two or Three hundred Yards behind us; upon which, we turn'd back, and met them. Caldclough drew his Sword, and immediately fell to cutting Mr. Swafford.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet Mr. Swafford and Mr. Banks together? Or, were they at any Distance asunder?</p>
               <p>Robinson. We met them together, and Caldclough without saying any thing to Swafford, fell on him with his Sword. Morris's Sword was likewise drawn, and he held it to Mr. Banks's Breast. Mr. Swafford was about two or three Yards from Mr. Banks, when Caldclough fell upon him (Swafford) with his Sword, and gave him a great many Cuts. Morris held his Sword to Banks's Breast, while I took the Money out of his Pocket. I had not a Sword with me, and was dressed in this Frock that I have on now; but they both had their Soldiers Cloaths on. From Mr. Banks I took about 19 s. and two Silver Pennies; I can't tell whether They took any more from him or not. From Mr. Swafford I took two Guineas in Gold, but not any Silver at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the other Persons take any Thing from Mr. Swafford?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I don't know: I can't say I observ'd that. After this we went directly over the Hedges into the Fields, towards Chelsea, and when we got to Chelsea Horse-Ferry, we helped the Ferry Man to pull up the Drag. [the Ferry-Boat] and we crossed the Water to Lambeth, and under the Archbishop's Wall, we divided the Money, and I had a Guinea for my Share. This was what I had for my Part of what I had taken, for they did not tell me they had taken any more. From Lambeth we came to Stangate, and there we crossed the Water again; then we parted, and I went home. Some time after this Robbery, I was drinking in Dutchy-Lane, with one

            , and he disclosed that I had asked him to go with me on the Highway: This occasioned my being taken up, and then I discover'd this Robbery; but Caldclough was taken up before I was in Custody, though I cannot tell how he came to be taken.</p>
               <p>Caldclough. Had we our Spatterdashes and Accoutrements on?</p>

               <p>Caldclough. Then there is a Contradiction; Mr. Banks said he lost 13 or 14 Shillings, and the Evidence says he took nineteen; he said they all had Soldiers Cloaths and Spatterdashes.</p>

            . On the 7th of April at Night, within a Quarter of Nine, I was going from London towards Kensington, and about a hundred Yards on the other Side the Half-way-House, I was stopped by three Soldiers, and saw them cut Mr. Swafford in a very barbarous Manner; I was about a hundred Yards behind him, and to the best of my Knowledge, the three Men who attacked him, were all in Soldiers Cloaths. Two of them had Spatterdashes on, but I can't be positive whether the third had Spatterdashes on, or not. I saw two of them with drawn Swords cutting him down, and saw him fall with the Blows. I never saw Mr. Swafford before in my Life, and thought it had been a Quarrel, so I pushed up immediately, and saw two of them upon him, (Swafford) and the third Man ran directly to Banks, after which, one of them came up to me. Mr. Swafford was about ten or twelve Feet distant from Mr. Banks, at the Time when Banks was robbed. I can't swear to either of the Prisoners, but if either of the Prisoners were concern'd, then I take it, That James Caldclough was the Man who stopped me with his drawn Sword, and demanded my Money, which I had in my Hand to give him, but as I had an Opportunity to push off, I got from them and lost nothing. I did not go forwards, but went back to the Half-way House, where I got a Stick, and returned to the Place, thinking to take the Men, but they were gone, and Swafford was lying upon the Ground; I thought he had been dead. I can't swear to either of the Prisoners, but I believe Caldclough is the Man who stopped me.</p>
               <p>Caldclough. I ask this Witness, whether he did not charge one Ringal before Mr. Deveil, as the Man who stopped him?</p>
               <p>Harris. He is a Soldier; one of the three who were missing when the Roll was called over. I believed him to be the Man, and took him up on Suspicion. I cannot swear Point-blank to any Man.</p>

            . I work at the Ferry at Chelsea. On the 9th of April, about a Quarter past Nine at Night, three Soldiers came down to the Ferry, and wanted to go over the Water. I desired them to lend a Hand, and help me to pull up the Drag; they did so, and got in. Then they bid me pull away, pull away, - make Haste over; this they said, all the Way they went. I landed them at Battersea-Ferry, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070007"/> they asked me the Way to the King's Arms. I don't know the Men again, for though it was Moon-light, it was dull Moon-light, and cloudy: Two of them were in Soldiers Cloaths, and the other was not, but whether he had a Coat or a Frock on I can't tell; for they hurry'd me, and said they would give me 3 d. Farthing, which was seven Farthings more than my Fare; and when we reach'd Shore, they left the Money upon a Bench, and went away before I could get a-shore.</p>

            . I apprehended the Prisoners on the 10th of May, on this Occasion. A Soldier in the Company told me, the Prisoners had sold a Piece of melted Gold in Foster-Lane for 47 s. and the Person they offer'd it too, refus'd to let them have the Money for it, till one of the Serjeants in the Company came with them. This gave me some Suspicion of them, which was increas'd by Richard Stevenson's telling me, that Robinson had perswaded him to go out with him on the Highway; and that he did go with him as far as Whitechappel, where Robinson bid him slouch his Hat, and told him they would go into the Fields and stop the first Man they should meet. Stevenson said he did go with him into the Fields, but watching an Opportunity, he ran from him, and got away. On the 10th of May, when our Company was waiting to mount Guard, Stevenson told my Brother Serjeant this Story. I thought it was proper the Affair should be enquired into, so I went to Somerset house Guard, and apprehended Caldlough that Evening; for when Stevenson told me this concerning Robinson, he said, that Morris, Caldclough and Robinson, had all been concern'd together. When I had seiz'd Caldclough, and was carrying him to the Savoy, I talk'd to him about these Robberies; he deny'd them all, but desired he might speak with Robinson the Evidence, which I refus'd; and when I had confin'd him, I went to Robinson's Quarters, in Dutchy-Lane, and the Surgeon of the Regiment coming in, I desired him to search Robinson's Body, for he had not been able to perform Exercise, on Account of his Arms being bruised; he was view'd by the Surgeon, but the Bruises were almost worn out; however, I seiz'd him, in order to carry him to the Savoy, and advised him to confess and save himself. He said if I would carry him to Morris in Holborn, he would tell me all the Affair; I consented, and before we got half Way to Holborn, he said he wish'd he could save Morris, for he was an honest Fellow; I bid him save himself, and tax'd him with this Kensington Robbery, among others: He confess'd it, and told me, Morris and Caldclough were both concern'd with him in it. Upon this I turn'd back, and carry'd him directly to the Savoy: Then I went to Morris's Lodgings in Fuller's Rents in Holborn, and apprehended him. As I was going with him to the Savoy, I told him, Robinson had discover'd the Persons concern'd in the Robbery; upon which he told me, 'twas in my Power to do him some Service, and desired I would carry him before Mr. Deveil; but I told him it would be to no Purpose, for Robinson had made the Discovery first, and was to be admitted an Evidence.</p>

            . On the Monday Night the Robbery was committed, I saw the two Prisoners, and the Evidence Robinson, drinking in St. James's Suttling-house about Seven o'Clock; I left them there, and had no Discourse with them about committing this, or any other Robbery. Robinson has talk'd to me about going to rob with him, and I told Serjeant Aspinal of it: He [ Robinson ] and I were drinking three or four Pots of Two-penny one Day with a Girl, and he asked me to take a Walk with him; I consented, and he asked me if I wanted Money, giving me at the same time two Half-crowns. As we went along, we drank another Pot of Two-penny, and he bid me either pay for it, or give him his Money again; so I threw him down his two Half-crowns, and then we walked to Whitechappel; where he asked me, if I was Man sufficient enough to rob, and to stand by him, if we should meet with any who might resist. I did go a little Way with him, and then gave him the Slip, and came home to my Quarters. Afterwards I told Serjeant Aspinal of it, and he was taken up.</p>

When I came up to him, he said, - I'faith I have name of your Hat No, says I, - but, I will carry you to the Place where you dropp'd it. That's the Man at the Bar, - for I never saw the Face of him till the Chairman took hold of his Wrist, and turn'd him about; then we carry'd him to the Watch-house, and asked him where he lodged? He told us in Rosemary-Lane. I asked him where he was going at that Time o'Night? He said, - to see a Friend at St. James's: I reply'd, - He was likely to have more Halberds than Links to attend him. - All the whole Thing was done in three Minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask him, whether he had any Debate with any other Person, before he came out of the Alley?</p>

               <p>William Row. On the 12th of May, I ty'd a grey Horse to a Post at the Bottom of <placeName id="t17390607-10-crimeloc49">Pudding-Lane, in Thames-street</placeName>

I was gone about eight or ten Minutes: When I came back my Horse was gone, and I was ill, and unable to run about to see for him. I thought the Carmen might have play'd the Rogue with him, but a Woman told me, she saw a Boy get upon him and ride him away; and I never saw the Horse again 'till I saw him in the Green-Yard, which was about six Hours after I lost him. The Green-Yard is a Pound, belonging to the City; I am sure the Horse I found there, was the same I lost: I bought it of Mr. Thompson in White-Chappel.</p>

            . I was going along Shoe-Lane with my Fish, and saw a Man lay hold of the Horse, (the Prisoner being upon it) and somebody said, he believed the Horse was stole. I said, I made no Doubt but it was stole; for the Prisoner had been try'd for stealing Horses: So I took the Prisoner and brought him through Newgate, towards the Compter. As I came along, a Man told me he knew who the Horse belonged to. I bid him fetch the Man, and he brought the Prosecutor, who own'd it directly. When I took the Prisoner, he told me a Man gave him the Horse to carry to the Royal Exchange.</p>

            . I keep a Victualling House in the Minories. The Owner of the Horse (William Row) is an Acquaintance of mine, and I know his Horse. A young Lad, and an old mean-looking Man with him, brought the Horse to my Door, and having fastened him there, they came in, and called for six or eight Penn'orth of Veal. I having heard the Man (Row) say, he would never lend his Horse to the best Friend he had, - not even to his Wife, I asked them if Mr. Row was coming? I told them I was sure it was his Horse, and asked them if the Farmer was dead, because I knew he had been ill of an Asthma. By God, says the Boy, I bought the Horse at a Country Fair. I have a great many People come to my House, and am tender of swearing positively to the Prisoner, but there was an old mean looking Man with him, about fifty Years old, and he said, - damn it, - it was his own, and he bought it at such a Fair, but they both seemed to be surprized, and paid me nine Pence Half-penny, and went away. I knew the Horse, and gave him a Crust of Bread at the Door, as the Farmer used to do. This was (I think ) last Saturday was a Month. And about three Days ago the Farmer told me, he was to go to the Old Baily for Horse-stealing: I was surprized, and said, - What! you to go there for Horse-stealing, if you are, I will bail you, as far as a hundred Pounds; but at last I found he joked, and then I told him, I had seen his Horse with such Persons at the Door.</p>

            . This John Brown, Jemmy Wint and I were in Moorfields, playing at Skittles, and from thence all went through Coleman street, and along the City, to see if any Chance offered. When we came to Aldersgate, we saw a Cart going through the Gate: Wint said, - here's a Chance, and he jumped up, and pulled the Box towards the Tail of the Cart, but at Long-Line End, the Carman turned about and put it farther in the Cart again We followed the Cart to the Horse-shoe Inn; then the Carman took the Box to carry up the Inn, and cry'd, - who will hold my Whip? Wint said, - I will. Then the Carman took a Truss and carry'd it and the Box up the Yard, and Wint followed with the Whip. In a little Time he came down the Yard again, and said, - 'twas hoddy enough; - we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070011"/> shall have it presently. Then he went up the Yard again, and brought the Box as far as the Horse-Pond, but a Woman coming up the Yard he set it down, and when the Woman was gone, he went in again, and brought it clear off. Brown stood at the Watch-House at a little Distance from the Inn, and I sat upon a Bench, where I could see all he did; we kept asunder, that the People might have no Occasion to suspect us, from seeing too many of us together.

I have seen them several Times together, but can't recollect the particular Days. I have often seen them together in Moorfields, and they have been several Times, since last Christmas at our House, and at other Ale-houses. I know nothing of their Characters, for I never conversed with them, nor do I know how they get their Bread. I have heard, that one of them is a Calender, and the other a Weaver.</p>
               <p>Wint. Have you ever heard any Harm of me?</p>
               <p>Staples. Harm! - I never saw any thing of Harm. - I have heard but an indifferent Character of them. - I can alledge nothing against them. - I have heard their Characters are but indifferent.</p>
               <p>Akins. When we had got the Box, we carry'd it into the Fields, and there we broke it open, and took out the Goods. We carried them to my Room, and fetched Bullinbroke and Deal to buy them. We bargained for 7 l. 8 s. 6 d. She knows 'tis true, and that this was not the first Time she has been at our House, and she knew how we came by our Goods. I went to her that very Night about Eleven o'Clock, and she told me, she could not come to look at the Things that Night, but she lent me a Shilling, and she was at that Time a-bed with Deal. On Sunday Morning she came to see the Goods; we bargained, and she took the Silk away with her then, and gave us a Guinea in Part, out of a Green Purse. On Monday Morning they came and took more of them, and gave us another Guinea, and in the Afternoon they came and took all the rest away, and paid us the rest of the Money.</p>
               <p>Bullinbroke. Did I, or Jemmy Deal, buy the Goods?</p>
               <p>Akins. She made a Bargain for the Silk, and was to give four Guineas for it. Deal and she fetched away the Gloves in a Hand-Basket. The Woman knows me very well, her Husband,

            , in Angel-Alley; I believe I have seen him at Work, within these twelve Months. As to his general Character, I have heard but very little amiss of him. - He might be given to Drinking, or so, - I have not heard much against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chamberlen. On the 23d of May, Brown was bought before me, and made a voluntary Information of ten or twelve Robberies, and put Akins into his Information. I had heard of this Robbery, in Goswell-street, and asked him if he was concerned in that. He said, - upon his Word he was not. I bid him conceal nothing, and told him, if I found he did, I would have nothing to say to him. Akins had put this Robbery into his Information, and so I would not stop him. If Brown had confessed this, I should have admitted him an Evidence against Akins.</p>
               <p>Three Witnesses appeared for Brown. One always thought him to be honest and just: Another took him to be a sober Lad, but as to his Character<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070012"/> he never enquired into that; and the 3d never knew any Harm of him.</p>
               <p>A Woman appear'd for Wint, and gave an Account that she had employ'd him in carrying Fruit, Greens, &amp;c. for her to Spittlefields Market; that he did this Business for her about four Months, and then enter'd himself on Board a Man of War; that he came home about Christmas last, and since that Time had fetch'd Scores of Pounds for her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had Brown Part of the Money?</p>
               <p>Akins. Yes. Out of the first Guinea we had 7 s. a-piece, and the Money was shar'd in the Room where we liv'd. The other Guinea was shar'd in the Street, at Whitechappel, and the rest we shar'd in the Afternoon. Brown had his Share of the whole. Wint, <rs id="t17390607-16-verdict80" type="verdictDescription">

I don't know the Prisoner, but I am positive the Evidence is the Man that was in the Shop. We lost the Things mentioned in the Indictment, among which were a Parcel of Linnen Handkerchiefs, - how many I can't exactly tell, but I am sure there were two Dozen, and we miss'd them, and the other Things, the Minute the Evidence was got out of the Shop; I am sure they were there when he came in. I am positive to the Evidence, for I spoke to him in the Shop, and as I pursu'd him in the Street, a shorter Man than he took hold of my Gown-sleeve, to prevent my following him, and said, - Don't follow him, Child, for you can't catch him, - he is run away.</p>

And I lost all my Weights; - there was a 14 lb. Weight, a 7 lb. and two 4 lb. Weights; - they took all. They broke my Shop, though I lye in my Bed next to my Shop. I lost them a little before Christmas, and miss'd them the next Day, about Eleven or Twelve o'Clock at Noon, - but I am not certain neither.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When did you see them last, before you miss'd them?</p>
               <p>Vannie. Oh! - next Morning. I went to Bed, between Nine and Ten, - for my Wife was dead at that Time, and my House was safe, - all the Doors and Windows fast, when I went to Bed. - Yes, yes, - I am sure of that, and my Beef and Pork were there then. I got up next Morning between Five and Six o'Clock, and I found my House very well, - all, but my Shop broke, and my Meat gone. The Shutter was broke, I found it broke before Day-light, - before Five o'Clock, when I get up. I found all my Things gone by Candle-light next Morning. - I never had a Bit of my Things at all, and I made no Complaint about them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. And did you lose your Weights the same Time you lost your Meat?</p>

I lost all the Goods and Money mention'd in the Indictment as my Property, and I am sure the Prisoner is the Man who robb'd me; I don't say I saw him take them away, but he was taken with them all upon him. I am sure I never took a Farthing from him but us'd to give him Three-Halfpence every Morning. I won't tell a Lie for the whole Globe. I had all the Things in my Pocket, and was to have gone to Flanders on Monday Morning, if I had not been robb'd I should have been gone gone before, if I had not waited for some Things a Man was making for me to carry with me. I never saw the Prisoner from the Time I was robb'd till now.</p>

            . (or Whitehead) I lodged in Shoe Lane, at a Woman's House, who us'd to sell a Dram. The Prisoner frequently came there for a Dram, and I have now and then drank a Dram with him. On the 12th of January, between Five and Six in the Morning, he knock'd at the Door, and said he came to pay my Landlady 6 d. or 7 d. which he ow'd her; she let him in, and he asked for me; she told him I was abed, and he bid her call me down to drink a Dram with him, and tell me he had some Shipmates at Brentford, who had appointed him to meet them there, in order to sell some India Goods: I would not go down, so he came up to my Bed-side, with half a Pint of Gin in his Hand, and my Bed-fellow and I drank two Glasses apiece, and he told me he was to meet some Shipmates at Eleven o'Clock, at Brentford, and if I would go with him he would give me a Crown: So I set out with him; and in Piccadilly, as we pass'd a Night-cellar, I said, a Draught of Beer will do us no Harm after our Drams; so we went in and drank. While we were in the Night-cellar, he pull'd out this Watch; I asked him what 'twas o'Clock? He could not tell; so I took it out of his Hand, and found it stood; I wound it up, and set it a-going, then he took it, and put it in his Pocket. At Brentford he shew'd it me again, and told me it cost him 15 l. I guess'd it at 10 l. and imagin'd it was only Pinchbeck's Metal, but he took a Knife, and upon scraping the Edges of the Case, found it to be Silver. After we had eat a Rasher of Bacon, he told me he could not stay, for he was going to Bristol, and from thence to Ireland, and he desired me not to take any Notice where he was gone: So I left him, and came homewards, and being afterwards at the Bull and Garter, by the Ditch-side, I saw an Advertisement, which occasion'd my telling the Landlord that I had been that very Day with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070016"/> Prisoner at Brentford; so we went to Lumley, and he and I hired Horses to pursue him. At Reading, Lumley could go no farther; but I went on to Newbury and seized him, with all the Goods upon him: A Gold Ring set with Stones, a Gold Watch, the out-side of which was Silver, gilt; a Gold Stone Ring; the Gold Buttons, and the Gold Pendants, &amp;c. All which I delivered to Lumley, who had advertised him. I did not search him for Money, but all the rest of the Things were found on him, except the Cloth Breeches. I then charged him with the Robbery, and he owned it, and said he took the Breeches out of the Chair, in Elliot's Room. He had a Silk Camblet Coat, a Scarlet Lepelle Waistcoat, and two Pair of Breeches on; one Pair was Silk Camblet, I don't remember what the other was. The Prisoner own'd he stole all these Things in

               <p>Lumley. The Watch I pawned to a Gentleman in Charterhouse-Lane, - but I don't know his Name. I had laid out 3 l. 9 s. on my Journey, and when I came Home, I had no Money for my Family, so I pawned the Things.</p>
               <p>Elliot. I never had a Word of Discourse with Lumley about pawning the Goods. When he came Home, he told me, he had taken Care of the Chap, (the Prisoner) and had taken fresh Horses at Reading, and so went to Newberry, where he seized the Prisoner, and brought him to Reading. Well, says I, what have you done with my Goods? Your Goods, says he, are in the Justice of Peace's Hands, at Reading. He had no Money when he went after the Prisoner; and when he came Home, I observed he was very flush in Money, but he never said a Word of his having pawned my Goods, 'till six Weeks or two Months after he came back.</p>
               <p>Lumley. I mentioned it to him, about a Fortnight or three Weeks after I had pawned them.</p>

               <p>Lumley. Whiteer brought all the Things in his Pocket to me at Reading, except the Gold Buttons and Pendants; they were in the Breeches the Prisoner had on, and he told Justice Pottinger he took them instead of his own, and found the Things in them. Whiteer said he would hang the Prisoner, - he would hang him for the Reward of 40 s. which I had promised for taking him.</p>
               <p>Whiteer. I did demand the 40 s. of Lumley, and he abused me in a scandalous Manner, and told me the Man should not be hanged on any Account, and he himself would appear a Witness against me.</p>

            . I was present at Poplet's Trial, and remember Goodman's being in Court. I saw him sworn in the usual Manner. The Indictment against Poplet, was for privately taking from him 13 s. 6 d. He swore, That as he was going on the 9th of February, in a Coach from Newgate to the Judges Chambers in Chancery Lane, the Person that sat against him in the Coach, stopped his Mouth, near the Market, and that Brogdon Poplet took from him 13 s. 6 d. by Force. There was a Question subsequent to this; he was asked, - of what particular Pieces the 13 s. 6 d. consisted Goodman answered, - two Half Crown, eight Shillings, and a Six-pence. He was then asked, how lately he had seen that Money? He answered, - about a Quarter of an Hour before. He was asked, in what Manner the Money was taken from him? He made answer, - that Poplet put his Hands into his Breeches Pocket, and took the Money from him by Force. He said, he had been robbed and beat by Poplet. These are the Words which were sworn upon that Trial.</p>
               <p>Counc. You have given a long Evidence; - did you put the Words down in Writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Keat. Not at that Instant. I did not take them down in Writing at that Time but after the Trial was over, we went to a Tavern (The Baptist's Head) in the Neighbourhood, and staid there two or three Hours, and had some Refreshment.</p>
               <p>Counc. Then you took down the very Words you have repeated at the Tavern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kents. I did; and have the Paper now at home, among my other Papers; I saw it within these three or four Days.</p>
               <p>Counc. How many Hours did the Trial last?</p>
               <p>Mr. Kent. Not above half an Hour. Mr. Poplet said at the Tavern, he had been grievously injured and would indict him for Perjury: And the Pen and Ink was called for, in about a Quarter of an Hour after we went in, and I wrote down the Evidence, and reduced them into an Indictment the next Day.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did not Poplet move for a Copy of his Indictment when the Trial was over?</p>
               <p>Mr. Keat. He was was going to speak something to that Effect, but was told, that Goodman was a Prisoner, and it would be of no Service to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070018"/>Counc. When the Order was obtained from the Attorney General that you should have a Copy, did any one attend on Goodman's Behalf, to shew cause to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keat. No, no body at all. Goodman has since owned to me, that he did swear he was going in a Coach from Newgate, to Chancery Lane, and lost 13 s. 6 d. in the Coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. Poplet offering to be sworn, the Councel for the Defendant objected to his giving Evidence, but the Objections were not allowed.</p>

I know nothing of the Prisoners directly nor indirectly; but Mr. Bradford belonging to the Child, he sent for me three or four Days after the Thing was done, to search the Girl, to inspect or look into - She was a little tumified, - tumify'd comes from the Word tumeo, and tumor, tumoris, to puff up and swell. There was some small Damage, but not a great deal. I gave her some Things accordingly, for Fear, (as I understood the Man was a vile Fellow ) there should be some Foulness.</p>

So we took the Geese upon our Shoulders, and when we came to London, a Constable stopped us on Suspicion of stealing them, - so we were taken up. The Constable was called, but did not appear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have very good Friends, - if they were but here. These Geese were the Witness's, and he hired me for a Drink or two of Beer, to help him to carry them. He told me he was carrying them to a Sister of his at London, but God knows whether he has e'er a Sister there or no, for he would have sold them upon the Road if he could. <rs id="t17390607-44-verdict207" type="verdictDescription">
