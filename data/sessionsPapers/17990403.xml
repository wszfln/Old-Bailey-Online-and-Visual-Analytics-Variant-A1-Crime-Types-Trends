             sworn. - I am a headborough: On the 10th of March, Guest, another officer, called upon me to go with him to take the prisoner into custody, for making a great riot in the house where he was quartered, in sermon-time; when I got there, the landlord called me on one side, and told me he suspected the prisoner had been stealing some fowls; I went up stairs where the prisoner slept, and in a drawer in that room, I pulled out a bag containing five hens and a cock; I took him into custody, and took him to New-prison; I asked him how he came by those fowls; he asked me what fowls; I told him that were in his room; he said he had bought them; I asked him where; he said it was no matter where he bought them, there were three of four of them in it; the prisoner told me he had been at Old Ford the day before, and I went round there, but could not hear of any body there that had lost any fowls; on the Thursday I produced them to Mr. Gasquet in their feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Gasquet). Were the fowls that were produced to you the same fowls that you had lost? - A. They were; and before they were taken out of the bag I described every one of them.</p>

               <p>Q. How far was this from Mr. Dyson's house? - A. About three miles and a half; I asked him where he had brought them from; and he said, he had brought them from Cheshunt, that they belonged to Mr. Wilson that keeps the White-lion in Bishopsgate-street, and he was going to carry them there; I said I thought it was very old Mr. Wilson should send him for them, when there were so many coaches coming that way; he said I might do as I liked, they were Mr. Wilson's property; I then stopped him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you hold the bag yourself? - A. Yes; he then asked me to lift it up upon his shoulder, accordingly I did; he then immediately walked out to the stable-door where he entered in at. He was taken in a very few minutes afterwards, for my master did not let him get above ten yards from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given a hint to any persons to watch him at this time? - A. Yes, my master, Mr. Lonsdale, and one of the men, came up and took him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. On Wednesday the 20th of February, about six o'clock in the morning, I saw the two prisoners in Petticoat-lane, Isaacs was first, and he had a bundle of leather upon his shoulder, he had no hat on; Belasco was behind him, close to him, with this bag under his arm, and a man's hat in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat upon his head besides? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the leather prevented him from wearing a hat? - A. Yes; I made a snatch at Isaacs, and he dropped the leather almost upon my feet, and attempted to run; Belasco also attempted to run, and I called out to Armstrong to stop him, I pursued Isaacs; he ran about four or five yards, and then Peach caught him, he was not above three or four yards from me all the time; I brought him back to where the leather was dropped; I picked up the bag and the hat that Belasco had dropped; Isaacs then said, give me the hat, it is my hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The man was carrying the leather publicly upon his back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Without any concealment? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they had a sack? - A. Yes; but that was not big enough to put it in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you make any observation of Belasco's back? - A. Yes; there was the tan of the leather upon his back.</p>

               <p>Q. When you took him; what passed between you? - A. I did not ask him any questions; he said, when I came up to him, stop, I know what you want, I want to go back for my hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you count them? - A. No, I did not; we found two-pence more in his waistcoat pocket, which, he said, was not mine; that was the very expression he made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of halfpence did you lose altogether? - A. Somewhere about two pounds, in halfpence, farthings, and penny pieces.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am an officer; the prisoner was delivered to me by Mr. Matthews and another neighbour; I was going out, and I delivered him into the hands of Osmond; I returned, and went into the room where they were; I believe Smith was not there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you relate any thing that the prisoner said, did you, or any body in your hearing, tell him it would be better for him to confess, or worse if he did not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What Osmond might say to him when you were not there, you do not know? - A. No.(Osmond called in again).</p>
               <p>Osmond. I found upon the prisoner this parcel of halfpence and penny pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him to persuade him to tell every thing that he knew about it, or make him any promise of favour? - A. No, nor any body else in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember such an expression as this- tell us what you know about it, and save yourself from being hanged? - A. No, there was nothing of the kind. After that I found two-pence in his waistcoat pocket, and he said it did not belong to Mr. Matthews: Griffiths said, there were more halfpence missing; and he said, if they would send for his father, he would tell them; then he said that they were hid under a stone in his father's yard; Griffiths and another went there, and after they were gone, he said he had missed telling them of the drawers which were under the cellar stairs, and then Smith went after them; when Griffiths came back, he said something which I did not hear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. He referred you to his father's house, and to his father, for the rest of the things that you had not found upon him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His father was at home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, whether his father might not have given him these things, you cannot swear? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. And every thing that was found by his reference to his father's house, were found in his father's house? - A. Yes; his mother told him he had better tell the truth, while Griffiths was gone.</p>

               <p>Kettle. These are the same halfpence that I marked.</p>
               <p>Forbham. I keep a small shop for greens and oysters: The prisoner one night brought me twelve shillings worth of halfpence and penny pieces, and asked me if I could give her silver for them; my little girl counted them up, and put them in sixpenny-worths in a row; they were all sorts, good and bad, and I thought from that that they had come out of a till; I sent for Mr. Kettle, and told him of it; I persuaded him to mark some; accordingly he marked some, and the very same day she brought me ten-pence halfpenny of marked halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that money - See if that is the money that she brought to your house? - A. Yes it is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I leave it to the mercy of your Lordship and the Gentlemen of the Jury: I have not a friend in the world; I have not been from the country a twelvemonth; my friends live a great way off; I have not a friend in the world to speak for me; that man was to give me a pound for twenty-one shillingsworth.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Forbham). Q. Did any thing of that sort pass between you? - A. Yes, it certainly did.</p>

             sworn. - On Wednesday the 13th of March, I was standing upon the Quay, between three and four o'clock, when Mr. Deare called to me; I followed him up three pair of stairs, and then I saw Mr. Deare had hold of Conner; Busted had just passed Mr. Deare, when I laid hold of him; I turned round, and saw Connor taking sugar out of his pocket and chucking it out into the Capsail-room; the boy, Busted, begged of us to let him go; I told him I should do no such thing; Connor resisted Mr. Deare very much, and had got him down upon the stairs; he would have chucked him over the stairs if I had not got hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that is the boy? - A. Yes.(The constable produced the sugar and the knife.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Deare. This is the same sort of sugar that was in our warehouse; we weighed the hogshead, and found half a hundred and sixteen pounds deficient.</p>
               <p>Connor's defence. I was at work in the warehouse, I saw the door open, and I went in and took a bit of sugar.</p>
               <p>Busted's defence. I was at work in the warehouse, but I did not take any of the sugar.</p>
               <p>Busted called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             - Q. How old are you? - A. Going on fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the consequence of taking a false oath? - A. I shall go to hell. (She is sworn.) I live with Mrs. Govin: On the 16th of March, at night, I shut the door and went up stairs; and about two minutes after I saw the prisoner go out of the shop with the cheese under his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door broke open? - A. No; he opened the door and came in, and took it off the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not lock or bolt the door? - A. No; I gave the alarm to Mrs. Govin, and she went after him; this is the same cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the door was shut? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see enough of the man to say the prisoner is the same man? - A. No; I did not see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brown.) When did you get possession of the cheese? - A. On Tuesday Mrs. Govin deseribed the prisoner to me, and told me he worked at Mr. Abell's, the paviour.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Govin. I have known him for some years.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you speak to her? - A. Yes, the first time I saw her I spoke to her; I cried out, holloa, who is that getting in at that window; she made no answer, but went into her own room.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is her house to this? - A. Next door but one, and her daughter's is next to that; she took the bed into her own room, and the rest of the things into her daughter's.</p>

               <p>Q. What was in your purse? - A. I cannot say positively to the money that was in the purse, I put, myself, into it, in the afternoon, a guinea and some silver; and there was gold and silver in the purse before, but how much I cannot say.</p>


               <p>Q. Was there any struggle between you? - A. No, it was a sudden snatch; I was frightened, and put down the silver that I had in my other hand to endeavour to save the purse, but he got it from me, and ran away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a messenger on the debtor's side of Newgate: On Thursday, the 21st of February last, I was going of an errand to Barbican, and just as I was coming out of the prison, Mr. Walker, the prisoner at the bar, called to me; I had known him when he was in prison in January, 1798; he went a little way with me, and then asked me if I knew the banking-house of Prescott and Co.; I said, yes; then he said, I was the very man he wished to see, he had got a draft of Sir

            's, which he wanted to take up, and if you are going that way, says he, I will be glad if you will take it up for me; says he, the reason I do not like to go there is, because there is a little account between them and me; I think he said between five and six pounds, and if I should go with it, they may recollect me, and may want to take it out of this, and that won't do; I was going to Doctors' Commons, and he was to wait for me at the Cock eating-house till I came to him; when I came to the Cock he was not there; the waiter said, a little man had been looking for me; he came in and gave me the draft; I just opened it and looked at the sum; it was 65l. 10s. and Mr. Colvill paid me a 40l. note, 20l. in smaller notes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030021"/>there might be, I think, three 2l. notes, and the rest 1l. notes, four half-guineas, nine seven-shilling pieces, and two half-crowns; I then returned to the Cock to the prisoner, and he was not there; when he came he would not take it there, because, he said, there were a great many swindlers always about there, and he should get robbed of it; he asked me which way I was going, I told him, to Barbican; he said it was all in his way home to dinner; then we went to the Nag's-head, in Aldersgate-street, we went in together, he called for some rum and water, and there I paid him the money; it was in a private room; he said, he knew that house, and I gave him the notes and money that I had received; he paid for the liquor, and gave me one shilling, and I went away; I saw no more of him till he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by taking up the bill? - A. I went to take up the money for the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass upon your looking at the bill? - A. I made two observations upon it; Walker told me he lived at Mr. Austin's, a japanner's, in Cold-bath-fields, and when I saw the note, I said, it was very odd what Mr. Trevannion, the member for Dover, should want with japanned goods to such an amount; his answer was, that he laid out a great deal of money with him in the year; he could not tell whether it was for exportation or presents; the other observation I made was, this is all written upon paper, meaning there was none of it engraved, and he said, that is always the way he draws them.</p>

             sworn. - On Thursday, the 21st of February, the last witness came to me at Messrs. Prescott's, between twelve and one o'clock, and presented this draft for payment, (producing it); he said he wished to have it in small notes and cash; the amount is 65l. 10s. I paid him a 40l. note, 20l. in small notes, and the remainder in cash; I do not recollect what the cash was.</p>
               <p>Q. You had information afterwards, I believe, that the forty pound note was stopped at the Bank? - A. Yes. In consequence of that, I went to the Secretary's office at the Bank, on Saturday the 23d, there I saw the prisoner; I asked him from whom he had the forty pound Bank note; he said he had it from Mr. Windus, who lived in Newgate-street; he said he knew that Windus had received it for a draft, which Messrs. Prescott's had paid a few days before; I told him I wished to see Windus, as I had paid the draft, and there was some mistake in it. Walker and I then left the Bank, and went to Newgate-street; and, in going along, he went into a silversmith's shop, and asked if they had any thing to do; the master of the shop said he had nothing for him to do then; Walker then wished me to remain there while he brought Windus to me, but I refused to let him go; then we went across Newgate-street, down a lane that led to Fleet-market; he went into a public-house, and enquired if Windus was there; a person there replied, he had been gone about half an hour; the prisoner then came out again, and went into another public-house, and made enquiry for Windus; but they did not know him; then he took me into a gin-shop in Newgate-street, and enquired for Windus, but they did not know him; then Walker said, I will go no farther with you, for it is no concern of mine. I then went into the first public-house I came to with him, and asked the publican if he knew Windus; the publican replied, that Walker knew very well where to find Mr. Windus; then I begged of the publican to tell me where I might find Mr. Windus, as Walker would not; and then he told me to go to Newgate, on the debtors' side, and I should hear of him; one of the turnkeys told me he was gone to Guildhall, and would return in about half an hour; then Walker, myself, and another man went all to Guildhall together; I then left Walker in custody of an officer at Messrs. Prescott's, and I went to Guildhall to find Windus; I did not find him there; I then went to Newgate, and found Windus, and then he went with me to Messers. Prescott's office, where Walker and the constable were. As soon as Windus entered the room, he said, Mr. Walker, how could you send me with this draft - you know it would have been a very serious piece of business to me, if you had not been found; Walker made no answer; we then went before the Lord-Mayor, and the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been at Messers. Prescott's? - A. About thirteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any person of the name of

               <p>Q. Did he say from whom he had received the draft? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The account that he gave you that he had received the forty pound note from Windus, Windus confirmed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was likewise true, that it was received in payment for a draft at your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He never denied that Windus was the person from whom he had received that note? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. I am a cook by trade; I go to sea now, I came home in the Marquis of Lansdowne.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you work as cook before you went to sea? - A. At several gentlemen's houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes, I think I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you on the 20th of February last? - A. I was passing along Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing draw your attention, as you were going along Newgate-street? - A. I saw the prisoner at the bar pick up a note much about lvy-lane, or between that and Warwick-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to look at it? - A. Yes; and I saw, as he held it in his left hand, that there was 65l. 10s. at the top, and at the bottom, on the left hand side, there was Messrs. Prescott and Company, bankers, in London.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to look at it? - A. Because something of a curiosity led me; I asked whether it was a Bank note; it was not a banker's check, it was only on common paper, and it was all written.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed after that? - A. Nothing passed. I went then about my business, I was going to Hazard's lottery-office to enquire about a share of a ticket.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you were found out as a witness? - A. I saw an advertisement in the papers to enquire at No. 13, Bateman's-buildings; it mentions for a gentleman, who had seen another pick up a draft; in consequence of that, I applied there; I then gave an account who I was, and where they might find me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Where do you live? - A. No. 6, Temple-street, Whitefriars.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were going to Hazard's in Cornhill? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you make Newgate-street in your way from Whitefriars? - A. I generally do go that way.</p>
               <p>Q. As the nearest? - A. Not as the nearest.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. I never saw him before; I only observed his picking up the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at some little distance? - A. Yes; and then I went up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Thinking it might be a Bank note, or something valuable, to claim a part of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On seeing it to be a banker's check, how came you not to claim your share of it? - A. I did not take it to be a banker's check, I did not take it to be any thing of consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you have told us, you saw Messrs. Prescott and Co. bankers, London? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And your object in going to look at it was, to take half if it was valuable, and finding it was a draft for 65l. 10s. how came you to give up your share? - A. I did not ask it, as he had it in his hand, I looked over his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are sure it was directed to Messrs. Prescott and Company, <rs id="t17990403-39-viclabel231" type="occupation">banker</rs>

               <p>Q. Now this is not so; it is Messrs. Prescott, Grote, and Company, London; not a word about bankers? - A. I knew they were bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know it was a draft upon a banker? - A. I did not know but it might be a note not worth any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you happened to see something in the paper about it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw it in the paper - last week was it not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were looking in the paper to see what had become of your ticket? - A. No, not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live at that time? - A. No. 6, Temple-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the paper? - A. I see it generally in George-yard, Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that where the prisoner uses? - A. I never saw the prisoner in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. And who did you apply to when you saw it in the paper? - A. To No. 13, Bateman's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of the advertisement? - A. If that person would apply to No. 13, Bateman's-buildings, they would save a poor industrious man and family, I don't recollect the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030023"/>Q. By what means were you to save them? - A. By appearing.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it say about it? - A. I cannot say how the words run, but it is about a person seeing this draft picked up in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the paper about you? - A. Yes. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Now read it? - (Reads it).</p>
               <p>Q. Now I will thank you if you will find any lottery in this paper - you know this was only last week? - A. No, there is no lottery in this.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The house where you generally go to read the paper is in George-yard, Newgate-street? - A. Yes; I generally go there, every day, to smoke a pipe, and drink a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. How came you by that paper that you now have? - A. I bought it last week, at the Royal-Exchange; last Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you to buy it? - A. It was from curiosity to see more particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was last Friday only that you wanted to satisfy yourself about the ticket? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Are the hogsheads closed or open? - A. Mostly closed, but some open; he then begged for mercy; I told him it was out of my power to do any thing of the kind; then I secured him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they say what they wanted of Macdonald? - A. No, I believe it was intentional; he was knocked down under the table, and he was begging for mercy; it was a house I frequented.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Smith's a respectable house? - A. Not while he kept it; he was there about a fortnight, I believe; I saw a great deal of gentlemen there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It was a very disreputable house while Smith kept it? - A. In what respect? I met with no ill treatment there.</p>
               <p>Q. It was an improper house to go into? - A. They were apparently gentlemen there.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the reason you called it a bad house; you used the house yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw Macdonald thrown upon the table? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And saw all that passed while he was upon the table? - A. As much as I could; I was in a great deal of danger myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told my Lord all that passed? - A. Yes, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. How much gin had you drank before you went there? - A. I cannot tell you; we had drank a little ale, but to the best of my knowledge there was not more than a quartern of gin between us before that, and I had a glass of gin in the morning part.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in the afternoon part, now? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had you stopped at a quartern, or did not you drink your share of above two quarterns of gin before you went into the house? - A. Here are a number of gentlemen coming here that did not see any thing of the transaction.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Answer the question? - A. I cannot say how much I had had, but I was sober.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many public houses had you called at? - A. In coming from Bow-street we had a glass of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. I cannot say; we stopped and had some ale between Marlborough-street and Margaret street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Then you had drank some gin before you got to Marlborough-street? - A. I might.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many houses did you stop at before you got to Smith's? - A. One house, but I cannot say what the name of the house was; we drank between six of us half a pint of gin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How much gin did you drink in Smith's house? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not call at any other house, nor drink any other gin, but what you have described to my Lord? - A. No, we did not, but at one house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the London Apprentice? - A. Yes, in Margaret-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the house where you drank the gin? - A. No, I drank some ale there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any gin there? - A. No, I did not, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you drink any gin there? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, at Smith's house, were you not so drunk, that the landlady of the house, Mrs. Smith, refused you any more gin and any more liquor? - A. I believe she is a woman quite the reverse; she did not care who was drunk, if she got the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not refused by Mrs. Smith any more liquor, because you were so drunk? - A. Macdonald had half a pint of gin, and I heard nothing about her refusing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that Macdonald ordered half a pint of gin? - A. I did not order it, but it was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Macdonald order it? - A. To the best of my knowledge he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that Macdonald ordered it? - A. I cannot swear it, it was brought.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it brought by the order of Macdonald? - A. It was, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not they charge you and Macdonald with the watchman, for having assaulted Mr. Smith and his brother, in the house of Smith? - A. I heard nothing of this till the morning following, and then they went to proceed against us at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did any body else, connected with Macdonald or you, or any body else, come into the house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury. This is an indictment against the three prisoners for a capital offence: against Henry Smith and Alger there is not a little of evidence; it may be therefore necessary for you to acquit them now, because possibly it may be expedient, for the ends of justice, that they should be called as witnesses.(The Jury consulted).</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I live in Margaret-street, opposite the house of Mr. Smith; I am an engine-maker; I make instruments of agriculture; I have turned my dwelling-house into a warehouse, and have a lodging in the house of Mr. Smith; I was in the house from the time that Dwyer and Macdonald came in, till they went away again; they were both very drunk apparently, I am certain of that; they had all the appearance of being very drunk, and they were very riotous.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any windows broke? - A. Yes, I saw Macdonald break three squares of glass;

             came to light his pipe at the table that Macdonald sat at; Macdonald took up the candle, and would not let him light his pipe; there was a scussle between them, and the candle went out; I saw his elbow go through one square of glass, and then they scussled to the other side of the tap-room, and broke two more.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners all there or not? - A. I am not certain whether they were all there; Macdonald and Dwyer had not been in ten minutes; Smith did not stay then above then minutes or a quarter of an hour; after some time Dwyer went out, and left Macdonald sitting in the box; he wanted to get some more liquor to drink, and Mrs. Smith refused to let him have any more; then Macdonald got swearing very violently at Joseph Smith, and then gave him a slap in the face, and that was the beginning of the assault.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it when the prosecutor went away? - A. It was past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing about money being lost, or a robbery? - A. Never such a word mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when the watchman came? - A. Yes; Joseph Smith went to call the watch; the watch came, as far as I can understand, to the door, but I did not see them, I heard them; I heard the watchman say, he would not come into the house; Macdonald and Dwyer went out just at that time; I followed them as fast as possible, and not a word about robbing them was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said about a pocket-book or Bank-notes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body thrown down while you were there? - A. There never was such a thing; I am sure that neither of the three prisoners touched any body that night; Dwyer was very drunk, and he swore he would sight; he struck me, and I struck him again.</p>
               <p>Q. There was nothing said about losing any money that night? - A. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard Macdonald say how much he had lost? - A. No, I heard Dwyer mention, that his friend Macdonald had lost about 40l.</p>
               <p>Q. And you are satisfied the prosecutor was not knocked down by any body? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. STEVENSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I lodge in the house of Mr. Smith; I am the wife of the last witness; I went down a little after nine to ask my husband what time he would like to sup; Macdonald and Dwyer were not there then, they came in about ten minutes after; they were both very drunk; Macdonald was very impudent, and trod upon my toes several times; Alger said to me, if he is rude, change seats with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Alger is waiter in the house? - A. Yes; then they wanted liquor, and Mrs. Smith refused to let them have any; she gave as a reason for it, that they were riotous and drunk; Mr. Joseph Smith<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030028"/>was attending, and Mr.

               <p>Q. As you have lived in the house, and observed their conduct, does he bear a good character or not? - A. As far as ever I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a respectable house? - A. Yes; Macdonald and Dwyer had bailed three men that had been riotous before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who called the watch? - A. Joseph Smith and Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be sober or otherwise? - A. They were very drunk, I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>- HEYLYN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a hair-dresser: I was at Smith's house, I live with my father, in Wells-street, Oxford-road; Macdonald and Dwyer came into the house very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they conduct themselves, at the time they came in, like drunken people? - A. They did; they had some porter first of all, and after that they had some gin.</p>
               <p>Q. That did not make them less drunk, I should think? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had any thing happened before he retired? - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he absent? - A. I suppose it might be an hour, he was absent during the whole of the affray; I understood he was asleep, he was called in, by Mrs. Stevenson, after Macdonald and Dwyer were gone; a German went to light his pipe at the candle where Macdonald sat, and he would not let him; and, in the scuffle, with his elbow, Macdonald broke a square of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt whether it was his head or his elbow? - A. It was his elbow that broke one square; and on the other side of the house there were two squares broke, but how he broke them I do not know; but there was nobody near it but himself, and he was very much in liquor; Mrs. Smith refused to give them any more liquor, and Macdonald struck Mrs. Smith.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he complain of being robbed? - A. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>Court. Certainly the Gentlemen of the Jury's consciences are in their own breasts, they are not in mine, or else I should have thought the cause had long ago got to its end; generally speaking, the feeling of the human breast is inclined to mercy; and before Juries find themselves warranted to give a verdict, involving the life of a fellow creature, they expect something not amounting to absolute demonstration, but judging mainly from the circumstances, throwing mercy into the scale of justice; and it oftentimes falls to my lot, and to the lot of those who fill the same situation much oftener, to caution Juries from yielding too much to their feelings, than to caution them on the other side; sometimes one feels it necessary, when one sees an improper leaning, doing great credit certainly to the feelings of the parties, but not dispensing, as it ought, the administration of justice; it is essential to the ends of justice, that Juries should summon up the fortitude of men in judging upon their fellow creatures; but I do not know whether, upon this occasion, it is not for the Judge to call upon the Jury to be certain that they are not proceeding upon grounds which will not bear them out. Here are three persons called upon to answer with their lives, for it is a capital offence, and the cause had proceeded a great way, when I thought myself called upon to put the Jury in mind that the evidence for the prosecution being closed, they had made no case upon earth against two of the prisoners; - why the indictment extended to those two, against whom no evidence was given, God knows, it was very improper; that interposition of mine, perhaps, was premature, and I yielded to the better judgment of the Gentlemen of the Jury; since that time, you, Gentlemen, have unanimously acquitted those two men. Then in what posture does the case stand against the other? The prosecutor has sworn that his pocket-book was taken from him; he has sworn, at the same time, to other facts, that he and his companion were sober; he swears that he did not break any of the windows, but that his head was knocked through the window; and upon his evidence, and his only, depends the life of the prisoner; he has sworn that the prisoner took his pocket-book, in that fact he is not contradicted; in all the other facts of the case, is there any one in which he has not been contradicted by one, two, three, or four witnesses? - They all swear that both of them were very drunk, very tipsey; - Why then was his head knocked through the window? - Three witnesses have sworn directly the contrary. The German, who is not very conversant in our language, swears it was done with the candlestick; it was not very easy, perhaps, to distinguish whether it was done with the candlestick or the elbow; these witnesses all swear that he began the riot, that he would not suffer this poor German to light his pipe. The witnesses for the prosecution swear that they were not refused liquor because they were drunk, they swear that Henry Smith was a chief in the riot the whole time; whereas Mrs. Stevenson swears to his being asleep during the whole of the affray. There is another circumstance: when the watchman was fetched, it is sworn by every one of the witnesses that he was called by Joseph Smith; - did the prosecutor complain of the robbery smarting under the injury he had received - It is sworn by all the witnesses he did not. I am now addressing twelve Gentlemen possessing humanity, while they are administering the justice of the country, but I can hardly suppose that this is evidence upon which they are to deliberate upon the life of a fellow creature. I have stopped the evidence; if you are not satisfied, the evidence shall proceed till you shall unanimously say you are satisfied, or till you shall unanimously say that this man shall go to the gallows and be executed. If you have the least doubt, the case ought to proceed to be sure.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Not quite.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether it was between one and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030030"/>two, or between two and three? - A. I cannot say, I was left in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking so much that you cannot safely say what the time was? - A. Yes, within three quarters after twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor had you been drinking that day? - A. I cannot justly say; I had been drinking porter and gin.</p>
               <p>Q. A pretty good quantity of both, perhaps? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you sup that night? - A. I do not know that I supped any where; I very seldom sup any.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been drinking? - A. The last time that I drank was at the Running-horse, in Davies-street, and that was pretty near twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many public-houses had you been in that evening? - A. I cannot pretend to say, for I frequently go into public-houses to hear of a place; I go into more than I drink in.</p>
               <p>Q. But how many did you drink in that evening? - A. I do not recollect any other public-house but that I had had a glass of gin at.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean to say you are a drunkard, but not being used to liquor you had had rather more than you could bear that evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell us how many public-houses you had been in? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor how many pots of beer you drank? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor how many quarterns of gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have gone with them if you had not been in liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor, if you had not been very much in liquor you would not have gone with them, I suppose? - A. I was not so very much in liquor but I was sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women did you speak to as you were going from public-house to public-house? - A. I do not recollect talking to any but these two; the last public-house that I was at was the Running-horse, in Davies-street; and the woman gave it me out at the window, because the house was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you wake in the morning? - A. Between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And where was your companion? - A. Gone; I looked at my breeches, and missed my notes and my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you had the notes when you went into the house? - A. I know it by giving the woman two shillings, out of the canvas bag that the notes were in, to sleep with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the women? - A. Yes, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw them before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your property again? - A. No; but they gave information to one of the runners where the watch and one five pound note was; that a person that goes by the name of Big Suke had them.</p>
               <p>- LOVIDGE sworn. - I belong to Marlborough-street; I apprehended the prisoners between Orchard-street and Duke-street; when we met the prisoners, I asked the prosecutor if he thought they were the two women; and he was not perfect which was the woman that laid with him; he stopped Smith, and asked her if she did not know any thing of him; she said, no; while he was talking to her, the other prisoner went on twenty or thirty yards, and I went after her, and overtook her; then I took them to Marlborough-street, and found two new bonnets, two new petticoats, a shift, and two pair of stockings upon them; he said to me, himself, that he was so much in liquor that he hardly knew which was the woman; he said, if he saw her again he thought he should know her; she passed him and he did not stop her, he only stopped Mrs. Smith; I found eight shillings and two-pence three farthings upon Smith, and three shillings upon Hands.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any coffee scattered about the floor previous to that? - A. None at all, either in that part, or any other part of the warehouse; the prisoner begged I would let him go, and begged I would consider his family; I told him I was put in there for the King, and the gentlemen belonging to the warehouse, and I could not let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Eaton by at the time? - A. Yes; and Thomson came up two or three minutes after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not say before the Elders that he begged to be let go, and about his family? - A. I cannot say; what I say now I swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. You took the prisoner below stairs to be examined? - A. No; I delivered him to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the keepers of the warehouse? - A. Mr. Hanson, and three other gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the prisoner before those gentlemen? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him before the Magistrate, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you ever tell the Magistrate that this man had asked for mercy? - A. I cannot say whether I did or did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was only yesterday that you were before the Magistrate, and you cannot remember - did not the prisoner say, there was some fun between him and another man, and he knocked his hat off? - A. How his hat fell off I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know two men of the name of Perry and Sibley? - A. There were two men at work with him, but I cannot say their names.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say there was no other coffee in the room besides this? - A. Not loose.</p>

             sworn. - On the 18th of March I was ordered to come on board the ship to attend my business.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business? - A. Selling old hats.</p>
               <p>Q. Ordered by whom? - A. By the mate of the ship, that was at seven o'clock on Monday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030032"/>evening, he wanted a couple of hats; I finished my business, and went towards home, and as I came through Houndsditch, the prisoner at the bar saw me go along with a bag under my arm, and a hat in my hand; he called after me, Jew, will you buy a hat; as I was in the habit of buying and selling old hats, I told him I could not see it by the dark, I must look at it by the light, it was about eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Not before that; I went home with the prisoner to my habitation; he asked me half-a-guinea for it, I gave him nine shillings; I offered it for sale to one Mr. Salmon, a tallow-chandler, he offered me six shillings and another hat worth about two shillings; I went out with some old hats upon the quay, saw Mr. Littler, I asked him whether he would buy a hat; he looked at one, it would not suit, he looked at another, it would not suit, then he looked at another, and that would not suit; I then pulled a hat off my head, and said, sir, will you buy this, it was undressed; Mr. Littler viewed the hat, and he immediately swore that the hat belonged to him; I was charged with the hat before the Lord-Mayor, and I told him how I came by the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you afterwards light of the prisoner at the bar? - A. As I was out upon bail, I saw the prisoner in Widegate-alley, Bishopsgate-street, and I saw an officer nigh at hand of the name of Jewell, a broker; he took charge of the prisoner, and brought him before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were out upon bail, charged with this offence yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you in your house? - A. About five minutes, to the best of my knowledge: when the prisoner was taken by the officer, he asked him to give an account of how he came by the hat, and asked him if he sold Mr. Chapman a hat upon the 18th of March; the prisoner said, I sold him a hat, and what of that; he was then given in charge to another officer, and he told the other officer that he had sold me the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the officer? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Littler). Q. Did Chapman tell you that the prisoner had admitted to the constable that he had sold him the hat? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Chapman. He told the Lord-Mayor that he sold me the hat.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Littler). Were you present when the prisoner was before the Lord Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his examination taken in writing? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I know nothing of either of the parties, or the hat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know them before? - A. Yes; they used to come up to Billingsgate for fish, and then go down into the country with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner give you any account of this mare? - A. He said, he had been at Potton-fair, in Bedfordshire, and bought it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say so, or the father? - A. It might be the father, they were both together in the yard; but I paid the father the money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you buy her for? - A. I gave 33s. for her for slaughter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they another mare with them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not kill her then? - A. No: when they were gone, I thought she seemed to be in foal, and I desired my man to put her into the stable with my own.</p>

Yes; I live with Mr. Porter: On the 23d of February, about a quarter past nine in the evening, the prisoner came in and ordered a pot of beer, and change for half-a-guinea, to be carried into Vere-street, but he mentioned no particular house, he waited at the door till I took it with him; I carried it to the first house on the left-hand side, a picture-shop; he said, that was the house; I set the beer down at the door, there was a light in the shop; I gave him the change, he looked at it, and put it into his right-hand coat-pocket, and then he gave me a farthing instead of half-a-guinea, and then he run away as fast as ever he could; I ran after him, and the watchman stopped him at the corner of Oxford-buildings; he was secured, and taken into the tap-room, and searched, and three shillings and two-pence halfpenny was found in his pocket, with other silver; he had conveyed a seven-shilling-piece into his handkerchief, and when he took his handkerchief out of his pocket the seven-shilling-piece dropped out; he was taken to the Justices on Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not pretend that he had been sent by a gentleman in Vere-street? - A. No; he mentioned no gentleman, nor any person; he said it was to be carried into Vere-street.</p>

In the beginning of the last year, in the month of February, we purchased the stock in trade of a Mr. Chandler; the prisoner had been in the service of Mr. Chandler; we took him into our service upon having purchased that stock; he remained in our service in the manufactory till the the 5th of January in the present year; he seldom left the manufactory before nine, the other men generally went about eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time he was in your service, did you miss any articles? - A. Yes; we took stock at Christmas, and found a very great decrease, which we could not account for by any means.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages did you pay the prisoner? - A. We paid him by the piece; he was paid up to October upon an average about twenty-nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information received by you, did you go with a search-warrant to any house in Houndsditch? - A. I did, on the 27th of February, to the house of the prisoner, No. 80, a whip-maker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a stock of whips manufactured and unmanufactured, in the usual course of business? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of the whole of that stock? - A. I did not make any calculation, but I think the stock would amount to about 300l. I think rather more than less.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the stock to have been all manufactured, how long would it have taken one man? - A. Many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the stock in that shop? - A. I did; I saw the prisoner, and I asked him how he came by the goods; one article of catgut, he said, he had out of Herefordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon looking at the stock, did you recognize any of the articles as having been your property? - A. Instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in your manufactory of whips, which enables you to speak to them? - A. Yes, there have been more than one invention of my own applied to these goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him as to any particular articles? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and the constable take possession of any part of the stock? - A. Yes; and while we were doing that, he endeavoured to escape; he did succeed so far as to open the door out of the shop into the passage, and from that passage into the street, and he was brought back by one of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the goods here, which you and the officer took possession of? - A. Yes; they had been in the custody of the officers.</p>
               <p>- CHURCH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. - (Produces the property).</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030036"/>Q. Are those the goods which you brought from the house of the prisoner? - A. Yes, they have been in my custody ever since; I have the keys of the boxes in my pocket. (Opens them).</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Griffiths). First look at the two parcels marked No. 1? I have examined them very minutely; I have spent many hours on different days in the examination of them, and I am perfectly sure they were manufactured in our manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you explain the means of your knowledge to persons who are not in the trade? - A. It is very difficult to do that. Some years ago I invented a method of braiding which was different to what had been practised before, and I have never heard that any other manufacturer does it in the same way.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many years ago did you invent that? - A. Six or seven I should think, I cannot say exactly; I know these whips partly by that difference, and partly by the general appearance of the goods. With regard to these handles, the raised part is occasioned by a piece of packthread being would round the whip handle, which was usually done by hand, but as these handles became more used, this method of making these handles was found to be very tedious, and as there was no particular guide to lay the packthread even, they were frequently raised very uneven, opener in some parts than in others; this induced me to endeavour to invent a method that should expedite this work, and to do it more even and better; I did invent another method of making these handles, and I am perfectly satisfied that these handles are done by means of a machine which I invented.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, as far as your knowledge of the trade goes, is there any body else in possession of such a machine? - A. One person has a similar machine, a person who did live with me at the time I invented this machine, and who has lately begun business. These tools (producing one), are a principal part of the machine which I invented; by means of these screw tools, the handles are raised with exactly the same number of rounds in any given length as there are in these tools; for small whips these tools are made use of. (Produces another).</p>
               <p>Q. Do these whips answer to those tools? - A. Most exactly; in the smallest of these tools there are forty-six rounds, I think, in five inches.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But this, you know, is made like the worm of a screw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the other part which you work in this? - A. It is a machine which cannot be used without being fixed, I wish I could have brought it into Court; there are upwards of sixty handles, all of which tally most minutely with these screws.</p>
               <p>Q. These tools you brought from your own house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call that machine? - A. A raising engine.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the tools you have now produced made in your shop? - A. No; they were made by my direction, by a man who is a witness here, he is a whip-hook maker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Be so good as open the parcel marked No. 1, is there any thing among them by which you can speak to their having been your's? - A. I have no doubt of their having been made at our manufactory; I can only speak from the general appearance of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so good as look at the parcel No. 2? - A. These goods I have examined very minutely, and I am persuaded they were all partly made at our manufactory, they have been finished since; this whip, for instance, was made at our manufactory, but not the handle or the buttons; a great many of this parcel were not finished at our manufactory. This whip I know from a very particular circumstance, the braiding is begun at this end contrary to the usual practice; some time ago, a thought struck me that it might answer the purpose to begin at the large end, the button is worked on after it is finished. By my directions this whip was braided, and one or two more upon that plan; I assisted in braiding the whip, and therefore have not the smallest doubt of the whip being the same; this was the only one of this sort that I had made in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of them in the same state in which they came out of your manufactory? - A. Yes, several of them, (points them out); we never sell whips of this sort without a nail drove in the end of the handle, or very seldom.</p>
               <p>Q. How many may you have sold without nails? - A. I cannot say; not a very great number; here are seven unbraided whips which were made at our manufactory, they are our property, I know them by the general appearance, but more particularly by my own hand-writing upon them; the initials of the man's name that made them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never sell them in that state? - A. Never; I make a rule, on the men bringing their work into the accompting-house, of a Saturday night, to mark one of each parcel with the workman's initials.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you call this? - A. An unbraided jockey whip.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to ask for a jockey whip, you would not sell me this? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to ask you for an unbraided whip you would? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. But still it is a whip though it is unbraided? - A. Certainly it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the five bobbins? - A. One of them has my own hand-writing upon it, the words are "large best sheep," which signifies the gut;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030037"/>here is a piece of whip-cord with my mark upon it; the other bobbins were made for a spindle that I have in Court. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Without going through the whole, do you verily believe that all the rest of the whips were made at your manufactory? - A. I verily do believe them to be so; a great many of them I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that they have been stolen from your shop? - A. I cannot doubt that, because we never sell them in the state that many of these are in.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of all the property produced - it is laid in the indictment at ninety-five pounds eighteen shillings? - A. I should think it is thereabout, but I have not estimated it; here is a whip, which, if it is cut, you will find a groove to correspond exactly with a tool that I have in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was not made with that tool, would it be likely to correspond? - A. Not at all likely, (cuts the handle); it does fit most minutely.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. This man worked by the piece, and not by the day? - A. Not by the day, that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. It occurs to me, that the man who works by the piece is likely to get more money by working later than otherwise? - A. Yes; those who work the latest generally earn the most.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to any other person, you would have said, such a man was an industrious and a laudable man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a young man, just set up in business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His stock, you say, amounted to about three hundred pounds? - A. I believe it would amount to that, at a fair valuation.</p>
               <p>Q. Ninety-five pounds is about the value of what is brought into Court? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it occur to you to strip his whole shop by this search-warrant? - A. Certainly we did.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the bare walls? - A. Certainly we did not bring them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of that been returned since? - A. Not that I know of; they were not withheld by my order.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, as to those goods that you have not brought into Court he is deprived of the use of them for the benefit of his relations? - A. They are supposed to be stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you made any one of them the subject of an indictment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps this man may have made application for business to some of your customers? - A. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. That was before you took out the search-warrant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This stock of his being worth three hundred pounds, perhaps it occurred to you, when you first set up business, to furnish your stock, part with credit, and part by the assistance of friends and relations? - A. Yes, as all tradesmen do.</p>
               <p>Q. A man does not furnish his stock out of the money in his pocket only, but he gets credit and assistance from his relations? - A. I have every reason to believe he had no credit. Upon searching, we found some bills of parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. What you seized all his books and papers did you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And never sent them back again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find the vouchers for stock in the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever return them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suppose them to be stole? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is soft sugar an article made use of in the whip trade? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The soft sugar belonging to this man was taken, was it not, in this general sweep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept house there, did he not? - A. No; he only rented the shop, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the sugar, in the shop? - A. In the shop or the parlour; the shop is divided, and seems to have been part of it used as a parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. These were made in your manufactory? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner never worked in your manufactory? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then would it not be likely that he should follow your method? - A. Not the braiding, he could not to answer his purpose, unless it was to a very large extent; he could imitate our method of manufacture, certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. And yet you have seized these things, a great many of them, with no other evidence than their general appearance? - A. Yes; most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet, if he chose it, he might manufacture a vast number of hundreds of the same general appearance, with hundreds that are to be found in your shop? - A. If he had men to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, about the means; he had money, had he not? - A. That appears by the receipts.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he had the means, not only of working himself, but getting other men? - A. If he could get men, but men are very scarce in our business.</p>
               <p>Q. There is one bobbin that has got your mark upon it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts do you think is the value of that bobbin? - A. I cannot recollect; it is a very small price.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it never happened, in your manufactory, that a man who worked extra work at home, might have taken a bobbin, and forgot to return it, and yet maintain a very good character? - A. I cannot say, it might.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030038"/>Q. Do not you know that he did work extra hours at his own lodgins, having an expectation of getting into business? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of the fact that he did work at home? - A. I apprehend he did, because many of these whips have been finished since he left our service.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it would not be very extraordinary that he should borrow a bobbin for the sake of carrying on that work? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not a great many other workmen in your employ that worked at home? - A. We employ some that work entirely at home; but since the prisoner came to our house the work has never been delivered out.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not your man, Callow, work at home at this moment? - A. Yes; but that is another branch of the business, making whips in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that there is no person in the trade who works that raised work? - A. All persons who make whips, I suppose, raise some.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, they have not raised work as well as you have? - A. No; they have of course.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that you have employed many hours, amounting to some days, in examining these articles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have spoke to three or four? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that has been the result of many hours examination of his whole stock? - A. Yes; and I am equally as sure of the rest of the articles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not the power of making all these from what he learned at your house? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you are certain that they are all your's? - A. No doubt he might have made any pattern that he chose.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it is not an agreeable thing for you to have this invention of your's go abroad? - A. Certainly we do not wish to lose the merits of it.</p>
               <p>Q. It might have roused a little resentment perhaps? - A. I declare I have no resentment whatever towards him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had learned that he had applied to some of your customers? - A. Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us of any time whatever, when you lost a bundle of whips? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that those finished whips have not been sold by you? - A. The articles, No. 1, I cannot swear that they have not been sold; but the articles, No. 2. I can.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not now a great many goods which were made by his hands? - A. He makes only a part; the braiding is a distinct branch from any of the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. And he is capable of doing that, is he not? - A. If he has machines he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. You say he might braid these provided he had materials for the purpose? - A. Yes; there are several machines necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they large and expensive? - A. They are both.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any such machines in his possession? - A. Nothing like it; and there is no one man who makes a whip complete.</p>
               <p>Examined by the Court. Q. What was the prisoner's branch? - A. Generally in the button part and finishing, and partly making them in an unfinished state.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the braiding is not the branch in which he was employed? - A. Certainly not; he had no business even in the shop where the braiding was done; he might understand the general principle of it, but not likely to carry it into practice.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men do you employ upon your premises? - A. I believe the number is one hundred and thirty, including men, women, and boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Your own hands do not make any of the whips? - A. No, I only give out the materials.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men do you employ not upon the premises? - A. I suppose about six or eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men do you employ about the braiding part? - A. We have thirteen machines.</p>
               <p>Q. Any man that knows any thing of the business may use the machine, I suppose? - A. It would take some little time; the strings are frequently knocked out of place, it will want putting to rights frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. The men who are used to do it by hand would be able to do it with the machine without serving a seven years apprenticeship? - A. Most certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What part is done by the machine? - A. The raised handles, and the braiding.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man who works by the piece chuses to amuse himself by learning any other part of your business he may do it? - A. Yes; at home, I should rather he was at work.</p>
               <p>Q. It could not make any difference to you if he idled a whole day, you would not pay him a farthing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this an ingenious man while he was with you? - A. He was a very industrious man, and very sober; but I never thought him ingenious, because his work was not done quite so well as it ought to be.</p>
               <p> Q. Now, as to these two whips, do you know any thing of them but by these being no nail in the end of the handle? - A. Yes; one of them, by the braiding being begun at the wrong end.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you assist in the making of it? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to your work? - A. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030039"/>Q. Cannot your men swear to their own work? - A. Not always.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you mean to say that this man never worked at home? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. And if he had carried this bobbin home with him, it would not have been any great harm, I suppose? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am servant to Messrs. Griffiths, I have been in their employ upwards of twenty-two years: I went to the prisoner's shop on Monday the 25th of February, by my masters orders; I passed by the shop, and saw some whips that I was convinced were manufactured at my master's; I returned again, and looked more stedfastly than before; the prisoner then nodded to me, and I went in; I attempted to reach a whip, and he gave me another, such a one as I never saw in our manufactory, it was bound round with whalebone; he said, it was his brother's buttoning; I took up a whip that laid in the window; and he said, you have come to take away my patterns; I told him I did not want to do that, because I had left off finishing; then I laid the whip down, and he asked me to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those whips, are you able to state that they are manufactured at your master's shop? - A. I examined them in Mr. Church's custody, and I believe the whole of them to be my master's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Church.) Q. These goods, that have been shewn to the last witness, Stanwell, were brought from the prisoner's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to execute a search-warrant? - A. Yes, on the 1st of March; we found a great deal of property there belonging to Mr. Griffiths; there was a door leading into the passage, which I tried to open several times, and could not; while I was there, the prisoner rattled at the door, and some person on the other side opened it, and the prisoner attempted to escape; I and my brother officer pursued him, and brought him back again, he had got about fifteen or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing? - A. He said he was going for his brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030040"/>Q. You have got every thing you took from him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any application been made by him to you to restore any of the papers? - A. No; I kept them by order of Mr. Newman, the Lord-Mayor's clerk.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you not take away every article of business that there was, including books? - A. Yes, every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Sugar and all? - A. Yes, every thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Griffiths tell you not to suffer any person in the trade to see these things? - A. Yes, not without an order from him.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to take this man's books, you could not suppose he had stole them? - A. We were obliged to shut the shop up; there was nobody belonging to him that we could find.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, has not the man's brother applied to you, and have you not refused to let him see those things, without an order from Mr. Griffiths? - A. I do not know his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know a man applied to you to inspect this property, and you refused? - A. Yes, without an order from Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. The Lord-Mayor did not tell you not to let any body see them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did he say he was his brother? - A. No; a man came and asked if he could see the property; I said, I could not suffer him to see them without an order from Mr. Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The Lord-Mayor had given you no such order? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the person that applied to you? - A. I cannot say; I did not take particular notice of the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the person - (Pointing to another brother)? - A. I cannot say, they were strangers to me.</p>
               <p>- CARTWRIGHT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. - I am the other officer who went with the search-warrant; I pursued the prisoner, and stopped him in the street, in Houndsditch; I went to get a coach for him; one of Mr. Griffiths's men opened the door to let me in, and the prisoner at the bar ran out at the side door; I followed him, and he turned round and faced me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - A. He went down upon his knees, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Upon your oath, did he not tell you he was going for his brother? - A. He said he was going to let his brother know.(The Bank stock receipt for 150l. read).</p>

               <p>Q. Where was Messrs. Alder and Ellis's house? - A. In Abchurch-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Mind and tell us the truth - do you know any thing about any indigo? - A. The Monday after the 5th of November was the first that I took; I took three pounds, two pounds of East-India, and one pound of Manilla.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not take it with the consent of your masters? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You stole it? - A. Yes; I took it home to my house, and Hughes sent his little boy to me; I had seen old Hughes before, and he saw something blue about me, and asked me if I did not deal in indigo; I told him, yes; he asked if it was not a very valuable article; I told him it was of different prices; I was about buying a dog of him for half-a-guinea; he told me, if it was not convenient for me to pay for the dog, he would take three pounds of indigo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you worked? - A. He knew I worked at the indigo warehouses; I am sure his son knew it; Hughes sent his son for the indigo before I had time to bring it to him.</p>

               <p>Q. You do not mean the son who is the defendant? - A. A little boy about fourteen. The next day the youngest defendant came, and told me, if I could get some more indigo, he could dispose of it; I told him I would, and the next day I got ten pounds from my master's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did young Hughes at that time know in whose warehouse you worked? - A. Afterwards he did; he gave me three shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it worth? - A. Some of it was worth twelve shillings a pound, and the rest five shillings. I took it to him that night, and was to call the next day for the money; I saw the father and the son both in the shop; the son put the indigo into a cupboard on the left side facing the door; I went the next night and got thirty shillings for the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I submit to your Lordship, they must confine themselves to one of the two transactions.</p>
               <p>Court. Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030044"/>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you remember any thing about any being carried away in a box? - A. They were in paper parcels; the father paid me for them both.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with the prisoners during the last Session, or since the last Sessions? - A. The son spoke to me in the yard, and begged I would be as favourable as possible; he said nothing more, and I turned away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were apprehended, did you ever write to the Hughes's? - A. Yes; I told them I was accused with it; the son took me down into the hall, and told me never to confess it, as no person knew it but my wife, and she could be no evidence against me in any Court. and then I met the old man in the passage; I told old

             I had been accused, and asked him how I should act upon it; he told me there was no danger, if I did not confess myself, and told me, if I had any in my house, to clear it away; he said, he had none in his house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you write a letter to the Hughes's? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. At any subsequent time did the Hughes's acknowledge they had received a letter from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You went into the service of Messrs. Alder and Ellis in October last? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you began to rob them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken up, were not you? - A. Mr. Alder wanted me to confess, and he gave me till twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You accused a person of the name of Reeves, did not you? - A. Yes, he had part of the money; I told Mr. Alder he was concerned in taking indigo.</p>
               <p>Q. And Reeves was taken up upon your accusation? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you went before the Grand Jury to find a bill against him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been tried? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why? - A. The Grand Jury threw the bill out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your wife? - A. She has lived with her father; she has not lived with me since the last day of the last year.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you never been in custody at all? - A. No.</p>

He and I went to Townsend's, that was between three and four o'clock; Jones was facing Townsend's, at a public-house, drinking a pint of beer, while I went over to Townsend's; Townsend had been to me on the 10th, in the afternoon, and asked me the meaning of sending these things to his house, a box nailed up; I told him it was indigo, that was taken from Messrs. Alder and Ellis, by Reeves and me; that we had quarrelled, and I was afraid him and my wife would discover where it was, I did not know what to do with it; I told him I would fetch it away that night, and that very same day I was accused by Mr. Alder of it; Townsend was frightened, and did not know what to do, and he removed it to Calcott's, in Fleet-lane; Jones and I went there, and it was taken into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same indigo that you had sent by the coach? - A. Yes, and the box was still nailed; I opened the box, and the bags, there were three different quantities in each bag; there were forty-three pounds in the bags, nine, sixteen, and eighteen; Jones examined them, and asked me what I would have for them; I told him four shillings a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a fair price? - A. The Manilla was worth about eight shillings, and the other, six shillings, and six and sixpence; he bid me two shillings and nine-pence; I desired him to consider, and not talk so; then he said he would give three shillings, and he would not give any more, and so I took it; the Manilla was weighed in that shop, and Jones took the weight upon a piece of paper; I took the East-India indigo into Fleet-market, and weighed it, Jones carried the box, and I carried the bags; Townsend was present at that time, he left us in Fleet-market; he offered me a two pound note and a one pound note; I told him I would not take a part of the money; so then he called a coach at the Obelisk, and put them in, and told me he would call upon me and pay me; I told him I would not let the indigo go without he paid me for it; then he ordered the coachman to drive over to Maize-pond, in the Borough; about ten yards before he came to his own house he stopped the coach, I carried the box, and he carried the bags, to his own house in Maize-pond; I took the sack away, and the paper bags were put into a box.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the box? - A. It was not unpacked then; then we went to a public-house, the sign of the London-bridge, in Maize-pond; his son came and brought a sack; then he went out and returned back again in a few minutes, with the money; he took a pen and ink, and reckoned up what it came to; it weighed a hundred and two pounds altogether; he said he would not pay for the odd two pounds; then he said he must have discount for ready money; he gave me fifteen pounds one shilling, and I gave him two shillings and sixpence discount; then I went away. (The constable produced the box and the bags).</p>
               <p>Whitney. This is the same box, there has been a mark upon it of 2s. 6d. which has been attempted to be scratched out, and a 3 put over it; but I am sure it is the same box.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the bags? - A. They appear to be the same, there is no mark upon them; they were made by my wife, they are not made like common paper bags; and the bags were in the warehouse, all tied round with this sort of string.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he apprehended? - A. The day after he had bought it, on Saturday the 12th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Pooley. Q. What trade were you before you lived with Mr. Alder? - A. A chimney-sweeper; I was a butcher by trade, and kept a shop in Fleet-market six years.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave off the business of a butcher? - A. I failed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave off the trade of a chimney-sweeper before you went into Mr. Alder's service? - A. I did not leave it off, I am in the business now.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you first began to plunder him of his property? - A. In November.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you carry on the business of stealing your master's property before you were discovered? - A. About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. To the amount of a hundred pounds, perhaps? - A. This parcel, I suppose, is not worth much less.</p>
               <p>Q. You stole a great deal besides? - A. I was concerned in taking more from my master.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you accused a man of the name of Reeves? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was indicted in consequence of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill was thrown out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he was not tried, and is at large? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined before the Grand Jury? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you were a witness against the Hughes's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them? - A. They were cleared.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present in any of the conversations that you had with Jones? - A. Townsend was present.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else was present at any of those times? - A. No; there were three or four persons saw it weighed in the shop.</p>

Yes: On Thursday the 10th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, a hackney-coach stopped at our door, and two parcels were left, a box and a bag; the next morning I removed them to a relation of mine, of the name of Calcott, in Fleet-lane, Fleet-market; in the course of that day, about four o'clock, Whitney came to me for these things, Jones was waiting at a public-house opposite, Jones came out; Jones and I, and Whitney, went to Calcott's; the same box and bag that were sent to my house were in the shop, and Jones and Whitney took them backwards into the yard; the box was nailed, and the bag tied; they opened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030046"/>them, and I saw that the contents of the box and the bag were indigo.</p>

            .</p>
               <p>The Legislature has been extremely careful in taking away the Benefit of Clergy from persons committing certain offences; to describe, with great exactness, what those offences are; and a prosecutor is bound, in drawing his indictment, to charge the offence correctly in the words of the statute; where property is taken, which is under the protection of the person, it should be so charged; and where the property taken is under the protection of the dwelling-house it should be so charged.</p>
               <p>I submit to your Lordship, that this property was not under the protection of the person of Mr. Finch, but was under the protection of the lock and of the chest, and of the house in which that chest was. I observe that the key, which was the only thing demanded of Mr. Finch, is not laid to be stolen, because it certainly was not taken from his person; if that is not considered to have been taken from the person of Mr. Finch, so as to warrant the prosecutors in including that in the indictment, still less could the guineas be taken from his person, which were contained in the chest, to which that key belonged. I humbly submit, therefore, that the guineas were not under the protection of Mr. Finch, or indeed of any of the persons employed to work the press, but were under the protection of the house, and the moniers, who were the partners in that house.</p>
               <p>If your Lordship should be of opinion that these guineas were under the protection of the person, and not under the protection of the house, yet I submit to your Lordship, that the Benefit of Clergy is not taken away in this case. The apprehension that it is taken away, appears to have arisen from selecting a single member of a sentence in the act of the 3d of William and Mary, which I contend ought to be read as connected with other parts of the sentence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. Your objection now rather goe to the sentence that is to be passed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. It goes to this, that if I am well founded, your Lordship will direct the Jury to acquit of the capital part of the charge.</p>
               <p>By the act of 3d William and Mary, chap, 9, it is enacted, "That all and every person or persons that shall at any time from and after the 1st day of March, 1691, rob any other person, or shall feloniously take away any goods or chattels, being in any dwelling-house, the owner, or any other person being therein, and put in fear, or shall rob any dwelling-house in the day time, &amp;c." they shall not have the Benefit of Clergy.</p>
               <p>Now for the purpose of supporting the capital part of this charge, this act is to be taken thus, the first member of the sentence is to be considered as having no relation to the second and third; but I contend that the latter part of the sentence is to be considered as referring to the former, and it should be read thus, "that every person who shall rob another person of any goods, or chattels, being in a dwelling-house," that the word"rob," therefore, refers to a person, and to goods and chattels, being in a dwelling-house, and cannot be considered as standing alone unconnected with the rest of the sentence. It appears to me that this must necessarily be the construction of this statute; and for this reason the Courts have always been particular in requiring prosecutors to prove the charge which they make, especially when it goes to exclude the Benefit of Clergy, as in the case which I now hold in my hand - an indictment was preferred for a robbery in the highway, and it was proved that the person was dragged from the highway to the dwelling-house, and the robbery perpetrated there; it was held that the evidence would not support the capital part of the charge. Now if the construction, which I contend for, was not the true one, the Court could not have directed the Jury to acquit of the capital part, for the robbery was the crime, and they would have rejected the words "in the King's highway," as surplusage. The case, that I allude to, is in Mr. Leach's book, page 47, Oatley's case, "At the Old-Bailey October Session, 1760,

            , in the King's highway. It appeared that the prisoners met the prosecutor in Drury-lane, dragged him through a court into a house, and there robbed him. Per cariam. This evidence will not support the capital part of the charge. The indictment lays the robbery to have been committed in the King's highway, but the proof is that it was committed in a dwelling-house."</p>
               <p>Now, if robbery may be committed any where, and it is not necessary to be stated where it is committed, and if that is a charge which excludes Benefit of Clergy, I submit to your Lordship, that this case could not have been so determined; but the words "in the King's highway," would have been considered as surplusage.</p>
               <p>Your Lordship perceives, therefore, that it is the opinion of Judges in construing Acts of Parliament, that whether it is a crime committed in the King's highway, whether it is committed near the highway, or whether in a dwelling-house, that the words "in the King's high<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030048"/>way," "near the King's highway," or</p>
               <p>"in a dwelling-house," are a material part of the charge necessary to be laid in the indictment, and necessary to be proved by the evidence.</p>
               <p>There is another observation upon the terms of this statute, which I trust will shew my construction of it to be correct. Benefit of Clergy is taken away from robberies near the King's highway, by the stature of Henry VIII. Benefit of Clergy is taken away from robberies in the dwelling-house of the party robbed, by a statute of Edward VI. The words are,</p>
               <p>"all and every person who shall rob any person or persons in their dwelling-house." - That appears to have been intended to give protection to persons in their own houses; but it did not go so far as to take away the Benefit of Clergy from robberies in the dwelling-houses of others. This statute of William and Mary seems to be the first statute that takes away Benefit of Clergy from robberies in dwelling-houses generally, and therefore I trust, in a case where the life of the prisoner is at stake, your Lordship will not extend the construction of this statute, when there is such a degree of ambiguity in it, and where it is doubtful, whether in the reading we are to stop at one comma, or go on to another comma. I trust, I have shewn that a real and efficient purpose is to be answered on my construction, namely, taking away Benefit of Clergy for the first time from persons committing robberies in a dwelling-house, and that your Lordship will be of opinion, that the Crown is bound to state where the robbery was committed: if in the highway, it ought to be stated in the highway, or if it is committed in a dwelling-house, it ought to be stated to have been committed in a dwelling-house: and that this indictment, not stating either the one or the other, does not charge the prisoner with an offence from which the Benefit of Clergy is taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. My Lord, I shall take the liberty of adding a few observations in support of the opinion for which Mr. Gurney has contended; and, I confess, I feel little difficulty in maintaining, that the offence, as proved, doth not amount to the crime of robbery; and that the indictment, in its present form, can be considered in no higher light than an indictment for grand larceny. To ascertain these points, the first thing to be inquired is, what is the nature of the offence? - "It has been proved by Mr. Finch, the prosecutor, that he was assaulted in a room in the Mint, that a key was taken from him; that, with this key, (which key is not charged in the indictment), a chest was opened, and cash to the amount of 1400l. was taken by the prisoner, but not whilst Mr. Finch was in the room, for he was forced into a closet;" and, on these facts, the question is, has this money been taken from Mr. Finch by robbery? - To prove it has not, we need only recur to Lord Coke's definition of the term robbery, 3 Inst. 68, where he says,</p>

               <p>"it is a felony at common law committed by a violent assault on the person of another, putting him in fear, and taking from his person his money, or other goods, of any value whatever; it is derived (says he) de la robe, both because in ancient times(as sometimes yet is the case) they bereave the true man of his robes, or garments, and also, that his money, or other goods, are taken from his person; that is, from or out of some part of his garment, or robe, about his person;" hence, therefore, if this derivation and definition are correct, (and my Lord Coke is a pretty good authority), it is manifest, that, where A is accused of having robbed B, it must be proved, not only that he assaulted him, but that he took from his person some property, no matter to what amount; it therefore follows, that if the property stolen was not taken from his person, the stealing can not be called a robbery, for it does not come within the term de la robe, as used by Lord Coke; then, in this case, as the money stolen was not taken from the person of Mr. Finch, nor from any garment about his person, but from the chest in which it had been deposited for security, it, by consequence, is clear it can not be considered as a taking by robbery. - But, it has been said, it was under the protection of the person, and therefore may be considered as taken from the person; this I deny; for it must, according to the proof, be considered as under the protection of the house, and chest, with the additional security of lock and key; and would be viewed in this light, had the indictment been framed on the statute of Ann, for stealing from the dwelling, &amp;c. - Again, it is not like, nor does it at all aproximate the case which has been put, where a man is assaulted on the highway, and throws his purse upon the ground, which the robber takes up; for, in such case, the purse was under the direct and sale custody of the person, and was taken strictly within the meaning of Lord Coke's definition, de la robe. - It has been also said, that as possession is coextensive with property, the money may, in this case, be considered as taken from the presecutor's possession; in my mind, the observation don't apply; and, if it did, it cannot be correct, thus generally stated; though I will admit, in particular cases, possession may be said to accompany the right of property; for instance, if a servant is intrusted by his master to carry goods to a customer, and those goods are stolen from him, an indictment may be well maintained which charges them as the property of the master; for the legal property continues in the master until determined by the delivery to the customer, and therefore he may he said to have the constructive possession, though the actual possession is in the servant; and upon this principle it is, that an indictment for larceny might be supported in the name of the master. From all these observations, therefore, it appears to me paradoxical to contend, that, in the present case, the money can be considered as taken from the personal custody of Mr. Finch.</p>
               <p>As to the form of the indictment, so much has been already offered, that little remains for me to add. It charges generally, that the prisoner robbed the prosecutor, omitting the locus in quo, which ought to have been added as a part description of the offence; for instance, it should have charged, that he robbed him "in a dwelling-house," or "on the highway, &amp;c." For it is in this way the Legislature has specified the offences from which Clergy is taken; as by 23 Hen. VIII. cap. 1, from robbery in or near about the highway; by 5 and 6

            VI. cap. 9, from robbery in dwelling-house, the owner, or any part of his family being therein: so by 3 Wm. and Mary, cap. 9, from robbery in a dwelling-house, any person being therein, and so under different circumstances by a variety of statutes; but in all those cases, indictments must pursue the Words, so as to bring the offence within the statute description; for otherwise a conclusion contra formam statuti<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030049"/>will not be sufficient; therefore, if the offence is not so stated on the indictment, or if it is so stated, and not proved as laid, the offender must be entitled to his Clergy. There is a case which has lately been decided, and as it has not been quoted, I will mention it. It was thus: A was indicted and tried for robbing B in the highway, and the prosecutor proved, that he met the prisoner in the street, where he assaulted him, and took him into a house, in which he robbed him; and on the trial I objected, that as the fact proved differed from the charge, Clergy could not be taken from the accused. This principle was not denied (before Mr. Baron Hotham and my Lord Kenyon), but the learned Judges ruled against the objection, not upon the ground contended for to-day, namely, that robbery generally is deprived of Clergy, though, if correct, that would have been the shortest and plainest answer; but, they observed, that the assault and robbery in the house should be considered as a continuation of the original assault in the street. -Hence it is fair, in support of my argument, to infer, that they did not consider robbery generally, wheresoever, or under what ever circumstances committed, as deprived of Clergy. On these grounds it is I submit first, that the offence, as proved, doth not amount to robbery; and, secondly, that as the indictment is framed, the charge is not of a higher nature than grand larceny; and therefore trust the prisoner will be admitted to his Clergy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Rooke. I will tell you how the case strikes me. I think the most material part of your objection goes more to the form of the indictment than any thing else: the objection must be founded upon the facts which appear in the case. I think it sufficient now to say, that I am not struck with either of your objections. Upon the evidence, I think the property was under the protection of this man's person, and I think the indictment is sufficiently set forth; if it amounts to any thing, they have set forth too much - they have set forth a robbery in the highway, which they need not have done. You shall hear the law laid down; and if, after that, you think you can make any thing of your case, I will hear you.</p>

Then the question which we have to try is, whether this man did make an assault upon Thomas Finch, and did take this property from him violently and feloniously; and if you think he did, whether it is the property either of the Moniers of the Mint, or the Bank of England, or the Keepers of the Mint, or of

            , who appears to have had a temporary custody of it. The general law as to robbery is so clearly defined, that it is difficult to make a doubt upon the subject: for the general law of robbery is this, that a person must be put in fear, but that if he is put in fear, it is not necessary to take the thing actually from his person: but according to the terms of Mr. Serjeant Hawkins's book, if he took any thing from a man openly, and before his face, which is under his immediate personal care and protection, it may property enough be said to be a taking from the person. When you attend to the evidence, you will see whether this property, which belongs either to the Moniers, or the Mint, or the Bank, or to

            , for the time, was not under his immediate and personal care and protection, that, I think, will be the great fact for you to attend to in the course of this business; for as to the circumstances of taking, the prisoner having, I think, manfully and properly stood forth in vindication of Dalton, and told the story that you have heard, there can rest no doubt at all as to his being the person; the whole will rest upon the circumstances under which he took it.</p>
               <p>There have been objections made, which, I think, go rather to the form of the indictment than the circumstances which appear in this case; one question that has been made, is, that this property was not under the protection of the person, but under the protection of the house. Now, as to that objection, I think it is clear, from what appears in the course of Mr. Franklin's and Mr. Finch's story, that the money was delivered personally to Mr. Finch, and that he had it under his personal care and custody; and whether it was under the protection of the house or not, may be immaterial, it certainly does appear, at the time, to be under the personal care of Mr. Finch. Then the great objection, that it ought to have been stated whether this robbery was in the highway or dwelling-house, is an objection upon the face of the indictment itself; and, if there is any thing in that objection, I will hear the Counsel by and by, in arrest of judgment; but here you have only to apply the general fact upon this indictment: whether you think this property was under the personal care and protection of Mr. Finch from whom it was taken.(Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence).</p>
               <p>Gentlemen. Really, after what has passed from the prisoner, it seems difficult to know what other observations to make; the prisoner is very far from denying it; he admits that he did come up to this Gentleman, who has, as it appears to me, the charge of this money, he had it under his protection; and he put Mr. Finch in fear, and took the money from him, in his presence, which the law calls a taking from him, in his presence, which the law calls a taking from his person. Under these circumstances, if you are satisfied, I think you must find the prisoner guilty; there does not seem to be a single observation that one can make, to lead you to doubt of the prisoner being the person.(The Jury found the prisoner guilty).(Mr. Gurney and Mr. Alley having re-argued the same points in arrest of judgment, the Court delivered their opinions as follow:)</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. One question, I conceive, is already disposed of by the learned Judge; with regard to the protection of the house, the learned Judge has stated his opinion, that it was under the protection of the person; and the Jury have found the fact that it was so. This is an offence against the Act of William and Mary, and under that Act, it is not necessary to charge it to be in the dwelling-house, that has always been the construction. If the offence is not taking from a dwelling-house, it seems the grossest of all absurdities to state it to be in a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179904030050"/>dwelling-house, when it is taking from the person, which is a different offence; and, although property may be in a house, I do not see but it may be under the protection of a person. I remember a case, where it was held by the Judges, that property taken from a woman was not under the protection of the house, because it was taken from her pocket; that proves, that a person, though in the house, may have the protection of property; however, that is not the case for our decision; the learned Judge has stated his opinion, that it was under the protection of the person; and it has been so found by the Jury. I am, therefore, of opinion, according to the usual construction of that Act of Parliament, that this indictment is sufficient.</p>
               <p>Mr. Common Serjeant. If we attend, first to the definition, and then to the words of the Act, I can see no doubt at all. The definition of robbery, is a person robbing another of money or goods to any value, and putting them in fear. What does the Act say? All and every person or persons who shall rob any other person - the very offence is robbing another person: but then it is said, that it is necessary that the place should be stated, and the indictment is wrong if they do not state it. Now the second Act of King William says, any person committing a robbery in a field or open place, that extends it. So it seems that any felonious and violent taking is a robbery. Oh, but say they, it should have been stated to have been committed in a dwelling-house, and a case is quoted in 1760; but here is a case in which that point was fully settled and set at rest in 1705, at the Old Bailey: - "Two persons were indicted for a robbery near the highway, and taking 13l. of J.H.from his person-Special verdict that J.H. went to an alehouse in Smithfield, and there was set upon and robbed. All the Judges at Serjeant's-inn held, that though the indictment be special for a robbery near the highway, and this in a house is not so, yet as the statute 3 William III. takes away Clergy in all robberies, the prisoners should not have the Benefit of their Clergy." That is the determination of the twelve Judges; but that is not all. Another case came before them - "Several malefactors took a house, and sent for a tradesman there, under pretence of buying goods of him, and robbed him there, and it was held to be within this statute. The device of charging a robbery in a dwelling house to be near the highway, seems to confound distinct offences. The 3d William and Mary seems sufficient to have reached the cases without any device of that kind; for that statute is so generally worded, that it takes in all sorts of robbery, either in the highway, house, or elsewhere, the words are, every person that shall rob another person." And therefore, as to this form of indictment, I am perfectly satisfied it is the right and proper form, because it is according to the definition of robbery, taking by force and violence from the person.</p>
