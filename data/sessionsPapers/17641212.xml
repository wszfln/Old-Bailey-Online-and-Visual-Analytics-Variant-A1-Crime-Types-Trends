               <p>Going through Fenchurch-street to the 'Change, this bundle lay by the side of a post; I asked some coachmen if they belonged to it? they said, No: I said I would take it up, may be I shall get a reward for it; I took it under my arm and went to the 'Change; they told me the Captain was not there that I went to speak with; then going over Tower-Hill, they took us up.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Ringrose. All the separate bundles were tied over with a cord: the man that fits in the bulk used to look after my things, when I was absent, but he was gone out with a pair of shoes.</p>

On the 18th of October, in the evening, the prisoner came and asked to look at a gold ring; I shewed him half a dozen; he draw'd his hand over them, and said none of them would do, and he should not steal above an hundred pounds, if I would show him the glass: I show'd him the glass; he put his hand down upon the rings, and said a guinea was too much; (I asked him that for one) he kept his hands over them for some time; then he said, Your servant, madam, I'll come to-morrow; and was turning to go. I said, Harkee, Sir, and took him by his two hands, and took a ring out of each hand; they seemed as if they stuck there with something; my daughter got hold of him also; he got away and left his cane. After my husband came home, my daughter went up the Minories, and he was taken, I believe in less than a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Mr. Harding. On the 18th of October, I was one of the grand jury; we had a dinner in the Minories; my daughter came and told me they had detected a thief; I ran home; my wife told me the man had left his cane, and ran cross the way; my daughter said she knew him; we went up the Minories, and about forty-doors from my house, we found him in the passage to the Three Kings: I took him by the collar, and asked him how he durst go into my shop to steal rings? he said he never was in my shop, and knew nothing of the matter: there was a sheriff's officer, who is a constable; I gave him charge of him; we searched him, and found but one shilling, fivepence halfpenny, and two farthings upon him: he told me he lived in Stanhope-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had been at Horn-fair, and coming back up the Minories, I went into the gentlewoman's shop, and asked to see a ring of about 12 s. I took a ring, and put it on my finger, and asked the price; she said, a guinea: I had then one in my hand; I said I wanted one at half a guinea; she snatched them from me, and said I came to rob her; my cane was lying on the compter; she seized that, said she, you have no money in your pocket; I took and threw a guinea on the compter; she ran between me and the compter, and in my flurry, I lost my guinea: I went away, and returned again for my cane; she would not let me have it; she said to the girl, go and call your father, he is at the Three Kings. I had drank a little; I went and asked for the Three Kings, and asked for a gentleman that keeps a Silver-smith's shop; they told me he was gone home, they having taken a thief in his shop: I said, I am that person that was in his shop: I staid till he came there; he seiz'd me by the collar, and said, I'll mell you! I said, hear what I have to say: he demanded where I liv'd? I said, in White-Horse-Yard, Catherine-street: they asked me to drink a glass of wine; I sat down: then Mrs. Harding came, and said, Say you took them out of a joke: no, said I, I shall not acknowledge myself a thief. After that, they told me to go about my business, but I would not go without my cane.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Harding. He never show'd any money to me, and he had not the ring on his finger; he did come back for his cane, but I would not let him have it; and he was gone again before my husband came.</p>

             That was about a month or six weeks before Mr. Manby had her again of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you buy her?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I bought her at Turnham-green; she stood there, where we call to water, going up and coming down, the farther Pack-horse. Mr. Clark, that lives there, told me she was to be sold; she was standing in the street, with a sack on her back, and the prisoner was by her. He said, if I had a mind to have her, I should have her on trial; so I took out one of my own horses, and put her in, and drove to London, and out again to Turnham-green. The prisoner met me on the road, and got upon the coach, and rode to Turnham-green. I asked the price of the mare, but cannot be certain whether he asked eight guineas or seven: I agreed to give him six guineas and a half: I think I gave him half a guinea earnest, and he rode the mare along by the coach to Staines, and paid him the remainder of the money, and he delivered the mare up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the mare?</p>

               <p>Bradley. I cannot tell; she is over age.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What is the mare worth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never intended to part with her, so I never set a price on her. She can be worth no less than 16 or 18 guineas.</p>
               <p>Bradley. The prisoner came with me to Turnham-green the next day; he said, she was his own, and he sold her because she was too heavy for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grinstead. I saw the mare in Mr. Manby's field, on the 17th of August, between six and seven at night, and in the morning she was gone. I was with Mr. Manby, when Mr. Bradley delivered the mare up to him; I know her very well.</p>

The prisoner came to my house, on the 21st of November, between four and five in the afternoon, and called for a pot of beer; he had a woman with him; he took her into a back room, where they were some time: after that, he came to the bar, and asked for a half-penny-worth of gin; I served him; the woman then I believe was gone: he then went into the back-kitchen, and spoke to the child over my wife's shoulder. When he was gone, my wife immediately followed him, and said to me, he had taken a silver spoon: I missed it immediately, as he was bidding a gentleman good night, about a yard or two from the door. I went and laid hold of his arm, and said, Sir, I believe you have got a spoon of mine, and insisted on his going back to be searched: I put him into the little room, where he and the woman had been together. I called for a candle, and as he was fumbling, I saw the handle of the spoon in his hand; I said I saw it; then he gave it into my hand: (produced and deposed to.)

I told him I was very agreeable to that, if the justice was. His wife was present: he desired leave to speak with her. He sent her home, and she carried the watch to my master's house: then I had word sent me it was there, and I was desired to come home.

My landlord said to him, you seem to be very much in liquor; if you'll go to bed, you shall have the key of your door, and if you have money, or any thing, deliver it to me, and I'll return it in the morning. He said he had no money, but he would deliver his watch: he put his hand to his fob, and missed his watch; this was after he had been in the house about three quarters of an hour: Mr. Butler and I were sitting on one side of the fire, and the prisoner and prosecutor on the other. When he said I am robbed, Mr. Butler said, God forbid: the prisoner said he never knew him to wear a watch in his life. He went out to call the watch, and the prisoner staid all night.

When we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120010"/> were coming back, near the justice's house, the prisoner said, let us go in at the sign of the Bell: Mr. Howell was very willing to make it up, but I said I could not discharge the prisoner without going to the justice. I asked the justice if it might be done? he said no, bring him before me. The prisoner had sent his wife for the watch, and that was carried to Mr. Crump, the prosecutor's master.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I live within four or five doors of Mr. Howell: he was drinking at the Antigallican-arms, and asked me to go with him: I said, where? he said, never mind where, I'll pay for you: he carried me into the Back-lane, and went into a house that I don't know again, and came out again; then into another; he called only for a pint of beer: when he came out there, I would have had him to go home: then we went to the Three Tuns, where he began to heave money about on the table: I said, let me take care of your watch; he being very drunk, put it down on the table, and bid me take care of it till next morning: I took it up after that, and instead of going home, he went to the house of Butler; there he wanted something to drink: he being so very drunk, I thought it best to get out of his company; I gave six-pence to go to bed: the reason I denied it, was, to see whether he knew what was become of it: if I had any roguishness in my heart, I might have sold or pawned it, but I never thought of keeping it; if I did, I wish I may die in the place where I stand.</p>

On the 3rd of November, the prisoner came to fetch out a handkerchief she had pledged before; she said, her name was Monk, and I delivered it to her: she then wanted to see some gold ear-rings; I reached down twenty-two, linked together, some with knobs, and some only wires, she bid me weigh a pair, which I did; they came to 5 s. 6 d. she reached to me, and took the whole link; then she said, weigh another pair, and kept the link in her hand. While I was looking down to tell her the price, she said, I'll give you 5 s. for the first pair: she laid the link down, and said, I have no money to pay for them, put them in a paper, and I'll call for them presently, and away she went: I looked at the link, and found there were but 18 pair; I ran to the door, but she was out of sight. As we set down in a book where every body lives that use our shop, we looked, and found her by the name Monk, and lived in Kingstreet, New Gravel-lane. I and our little boy went there; and, on enquiring at the third door, she came to the door herself: I took her by the petticoat, and said, you jade, you have robbed me. She said, she did not know me: I was in the street, and she on the threshold; her mother came, and said, you vile jade, you shall not hold my child: she tore my handkerchief, and threw me down, and both of them used me in a very bad manner: she shoved her daughter into the house, and I kept hold of her: she got her into a great chair, and sat upon her: the girl took something out of her pocket in a paper, and delivered it to her mother: I said, let me see it; she said I should not. My husband came, and staid by her, while I went for a constable: I never found my ear-rings: both the mother and daughter offered to pay for them, or to make me any satisfaction. She was taken before Justice Berry, who committed the mother to New Prison, and the daughter to Bridewell.</p>

               <p>Q. What is she?</p>
               <p>Crofts. They say she is a girl of the town, but I did not know that when I took her in; she used to come down to my room in a morning, to have a little water for tea. On the 20th of March, I was at home at dinner, and went to my work again with the key of the box, in which were thirteen guineas, all the money I had; the box was put under the head of my bed, and locked, and when I looked for my money, which was on the Thursday following, it was gone: the 20th was on a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Crofts. I had seen it about ten days before: my wife went to make the bed, and missed the box; it was found under the prisoner's bed, broke open; but the prisoner had quitted her lodgings on that 20th of March, and I never could light of her till the 21st of October. I could hear of her several times, that she was at the Goat and Black Horse, in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did she leave her lodgings?</p>
               <p>Crofts. She left them on the Tuesday, in the afternoon, before I came home from work, which was at six, or half an hour after. When she found I was after her, she removed to another place. I found her at last, in Duck-lane, within an hundred yards of my house: I heard where she was, and went to her: she had lodged with us at times, about three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Crofts. She said, How do you do, Mr. Crofts? I said, but very indifferent: how do you do? as hearty as a buck, said she. I said to the constable, there is your prisoner. Said she, must I go along with you? I said, yes. D - n you, she said, you have taken me at a disadvantage. When she came to the justice's, she denied it, and said, another woman took it; but we never saw the other woman before or since. She says, she left the other woman at Manchester or Birmingham: there was a woman at dinner with us that day, in my room, the room where the box was: she was a stranger to us.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor. I never missed the box, till the Thursday after that Tuesday, when she left her lodgings in the afternoon; then I found it under the foot of her bed, in her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she owe you any thing when she went away?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. She owed me 10 s. I did not know of her going: the lock of the box was broke all to pieces; my husband was at work when I found it: there was nothing of any consequence in it, except the 13 guineas, which were taken away; they were in a little purse, and my husband kept the key.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen the box before?</p>

               <p>S. Crofts. I believe I had seen it about four or five days before. On that Tuesday, she had a breast of mutton and turnips, and dined in my room, and a young woman with her that I never saw before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that young woman stay?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. She staid there a few hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did your husband stay?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. He staid no longer than his dinner hour; the prisoner and that woman both went away together, about two hours after my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue in the room all the time they were there?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Did not she agree that woman should lie along with me, unknown to her husband, for a week?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. No. I never saw that woman before or since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I lodged with them, on and off, two years. I never thought they were worth a guinea, or a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120012"/> quarter of a guinea, in the world. Their house was open to all comers and goers: that day that I went away, I came down stairs, and said I was very ill; the woman that lodged with me, got a dram; he, his wife, and she, got all drunk together; I laid down on the bed. I went with a friend into the country, and when I came back, I went to live where he found me; I did not go to his house, because I owed him some money: I am as innocent of it, as the child unborn. She sent me that day to pawn her gown.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Crofts. Did you ever send her to pawn your gown?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. No, I never sent her to pawn any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect when you had seen your money last?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I hit the chamber-pot against the box under the bed on the Sunday morning before it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you out on that Tuesday?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I never go out, from year's end to years end. I was not out that Sunday, nor the Monday neither: I did go out on the Tuesday to Tothill-street, on an errand, but I was not gone half an hour.</p>

               <p>S. Crofts. I did; but we have a little back-door, that has only a button to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know of your going out?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I don't know that she did.</p>

               <p>S. Crofts. I had seen her a very little time before I went out; she used frequently to come down to our room, pretending she could not be by herself.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back, how did you find that back door?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. Then I found it unbuttoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she used to come into your room by that door?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. She used to come sometimes by one door, and sometimes the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it easy to open that door?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. The button is withinside, but it may be opened with a knife very easily.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it buttoned when you went out?</p>
               <p>S. Crofts. I turned the button with my own hand, when I went out.</p>

It was usual with him to come in a morning, and beg the favour of the horn to pull up his shoes, as soon, or rather before that the shop was open. On Thursday, the 8th of November, when I went down in the morning, my servant asked me if I had sent any shoes out? I said no: then he said, on Wednesday night, two different pairs of shoes were brought in by two different workmen, which he said he was certain were stolen, and we suspected the prisoner.

I went up ten stairs, and stood there; he opened the door; a customer came in, and the prisoner at the bar, as customary, followed him, with his shoes about his heels; followed him thro' the shoe-shop, into the other shop: he passed by the press; my servant served a customer with a pair of heel-pieces; and in about three or four minutes, let him out at the back door. He followed him out, and began to take down the shutters; the prisoner returned into the shoe-shop while he was taking them down, and sat down upon a chair, opened the press, and took out four pair of stuff shoes, and, seemingly to me, put them into his side-pocket; he had cut the lining of his coat, so that as he got up, they fell down into the skirts of his coat: he then pulled open the sash above, and I saw him put his hand in: I did not care to see what he took. After my servant had taken down the shutters, he came into the shop: I went down, and said, Sam, let me have a pair of shoes:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120013"/> the prisoner stood on the threshold; he moved his hat to me, and said. are you going to my Lord Mayor's show? if you are, I can get you a very good place. I turned, and went into the leather-shop, and the prisoner said, A good morning. As soon as he was gone, I bid my man open the press door; he did, and there were four pair missing; he followed, and took the prisoner by the collar, about sixteen yards from the door: he brought him back, and six pair of shoes were found upon him: he had taken two from above, and four below; (produced and deposed to): I took him before Justice Fielding, who committed him: going in the coach to New Prison, I asked him where my goods were, having lost a good many shoes: he said, come to me; I took my brother and another person; he confessed to goods being at four pawnbrokers, which are here in court. I found many that I have not laid in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Evans. I was sober enough. I asked this woman at the bar for a lodging; she let us in, and told me I must pay a shilling for my bed, for us both: I drank a pot of beer, and had my money as mentioned, in a purse in my pocket, when I went to bed; I had seen it a little before. I awaked about seven the next morning, and found, out of three guineas I had, two were gone, and the half guinea and a 36 s. piece; I had 18 d. in silver: the shilling was taken out of another pocket and put into my purse, with the guinea that was left: I put my breeches under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman lie with you all night?</p>
               <p>Evans. She did. I told her I had been robbed, and searched her cloaths, but found nothing. Then I desired her to get up, but found nothing: I searched her hair, and all over her, but could find nothing; I am sure a 36 s. piece could not be concealed about her, but I must have found it:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120014"/> then I bid her go away, and told the woman of the house (the prisoner) that I had been robbed, and she must know of it; then we searched all the house: I did not search her, for she went out of the house, to lie with a man all night, for us to lie upon her bed on the ground floor.</p>

I charged the prisoner with it; she wanted to lay it to the other woman, but they all denied it: this was Sunday morning: I went to Deptford, to my ship, and on Tuesday night I came again, and found the prisoner and Magnab. She would fain have persuaded me that Magnab had my money: I got a warrant, and took them both up, and Justice Berry sent one to New Prison, and the other to Bridewell; after the prisoner was committed, she wanted to give me a note of hand.</p>

             with the cappillaire, and two five and three-penny piece: five shillings in silver, and a six-pence: she came back again crying, in less than half a quarter of an hour, and said she had been robbed: upon that I ran out to meet her; and people brought the prisoner in less than a quarter of an hour: there were Mr. Dixon and Mr. Pierpoint; then the girl ran out, and said the prisoner was the man that had robbed her, and that she would swear it: he pulled out about five shillings; we found none of the quarter-guineas upon him: I thought I did know one of the shillings; but I don't take upon me to swear it: he said he was coming from the Crooked Billet cross the hill, and was going to one Bell, a lifeguard man, and not meeting with him he was returning to that place; and then begged I would let him go, and that he was not guilty of it, and said the people had made a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a dark or light night?</p>

               <p>Colwell. If I live till the 11th of June, I shall be twenty years of age. I was not at home when the man came to order the cappillaire; my mistress sent me to go to Mr. Crisp's in Catherine Court.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Baudouin. How long after the man had ordered the cappillaire was it, that you sent this witness?</p>

I said I had been at the other end of the town, and I came as soon as I came home: he asked me to give him the change; I told him I would not; he would not touch the cappillaire: the change was in my left hand, two five and three-penny pieces, and six shillings and six-pence: he took hold of my hand, and found it shut, with the change in it; he twisted my hand round, and broke my fingers open, and took it away from me; then he ran, and I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he took the money?</p>
               <p>Colwell. He said nothing to me: there is an iron gate; he could not get through without going side-ways: I almost got to him: there was a black boy on the out-side of the gate; he said, What has he done? I said (in my hurry) he has taken a guinea: the boy said he would follow him and would not leave him: he ran after him, and I ran home and told my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that black boy's name?</p>
               <p>Colwell. His name is Guardaloup.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you light enough to see the man's person?</p>
               <p>Colwell. Every door has a lamp; and that door where I stood upon the steps. (Mr. Crisp's) had two lamps: the man stood before me there when he got the money out of my hand; he walked with me to that door; I asked him whether he lived there? he said, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he walk with you?</p>
               <p>Colwell. He walked with me from the middle of the court; that is not above twenty yards; he did not take hold of my arm till I got to the door; the lamp shone upon him; his face was white all over.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean?</p>
               <p>Colwell. His face was quite pale.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Colwell. I am sure that is the man that took the money from me; he had then a black coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Colwell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not frighted?</p>
               <p>Colwell. I was, when he took the money, not before; then I cry'd, Stop thief; the man has taken my money out of my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120018"/>Q. How long after you lost the money was it, that you saw the prisoner brought to your mistress's house?</p>
               <p>Colwell. It was not above half a quarter of an hour; they ran and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched?</p>
               <p>Colwell. They pull'd off his shoes and stockings to search him; he said he would leave his holland shirt with my mistress; and if my mistress would let him send home to his wife, he would send for the money that I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say it was a mistake, he was not the man?</p>
               <p>Colwell. At first he did; after that, he desired they would let him have a coach, for he would not go without.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever say he was the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Colwell. No, he did not; he wanted sadly to get away, but we kept the door pretty fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that man that you saw go side-ways thro' the gate, the man that robbed you?</p>
               <p>Colwell. That was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Guardaloup. What is your other name?</p>
               <p>Guardaloup. They call me Guardaloup, Guardey.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in England?</p>
               <p>Guardaloup. I have been in England three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been taught any principles of religion?</p>
               <p>Guardaloup. No; I know nothing of religion.</p>
               <p>He was not sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. to Colwell. Is this the lad that was on the out-side of the gate?</p>

               <p>The prisoner, in his defence, said, he was just come up on a furlough from Tilbury fort, having lately come from the West Indies; and landed out of a Gravesendboat, and was going along the key: that he never saw the box or bag till before my Lord Mayor: that he was asking his way to Tower-Hill, to receive his prize-money for taking Martinica, when they took him: that he had been twenty-six years and four months in the King's service.</p>

             about twelve months; I left my chest there, with a cloth coat, three waistcoats, a shag, a cloth, and a nankeen; a shirt, a pair of cotton stockings, and a pair of worsted stockings; twenty bits for carpenters use, made of steel; a guinea, two quarter guineas, and the rest in silver, to make up 55 s. all locked in it; I had the key; my landlady asked me if I should come back again? I said I was not certain; so she took in the prisoner: I happened to come home this day week, and found my chest broke open; I looked round the room, and found nothing in it belonging to me, but the bare chest, and a few trifling things: I came down and asked Mrs. Guest whether that man lodged with her? she said, Yes; and that he had been gone out about an hour: I told her he had taken all I had: she went up and found it so: looking round the room, I found a pillow-bier full of tools, and his own clothes upon them; she said he would come back again soon; that he was gone to the jolly sailors; I said, If he is as big as Goliah, I'll take him; we went out and saw him coming; when he came to the door, I said, you are my prisoner, till an officer comes: he said, What's the matter? what's the matter? I sent for an officer; this was in Mrs. Guest's house: I said, are not you a villain, to rob me so? said he, Countryman, don't be hard upon me: the officer came in; we took him to a public house; he had breeches on, that long to a suit of clothes of mine; we found a penny chip box, that my money was in, was thrown into the close-stool, and there lay his breeches over it in the close-stool; he acknowledged taking all the things but the money; he said he had not seen any money: he was asked how he came to put the box into the close-stool? to which he made no answer: he had left my coat and a piece of dowlas at Mrs. Murray's, at the Noah's Ark, where he had had a shilling in eatables.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Sims. He told us so; we found them there; some of the other things he had sold, and some he had pawned: in shaking the breeches he had on, out fell a piece of copper, that had been among my money, when in the chest: he was put into the watch-house, and the next morning carried before the bench of Justices in Whitechapel, and was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What were your clothes worth?</p>
               <p>Sims. The suit of clothes cost me five guineas, not three months ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Danislow. I am an officer; I was sent for to carry the prisoner to the watch-house: I found this coat at Mrs. Murray's (producing it): this pair of breeches the prisoner had on; (producing them and a waistcoat: deposed to by prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Mrs. Murray. The prisoner brought this coat and left it with me last Thursday, between 11 and 12 o'clock; he desired I would put it by till he called for it; he had had a shilling in meat and drink, and asked me for a lodging.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As to the money, I know nothing of it; I never saw it.</p>

On the 4th of October, Mr. Gyles, a brass founder, in Shoe-lane, came to me, and said his clerk had bought several parcels of brass of a woman, who called her name Wells, and particularly the day before, amongst which was a rough brass foot to a reflecting telescope, which had been broke to pieces, by being first made hot in the fire; I went and saw it, and it evidently appeared to be cast from my patterns: the clerk told me some conversation he had with that woman; that she said, she had been at Gibraltar, from which I concluded it must be the wife of the prisoner, as he had been there, and worked in my house. I desired him to take care of that brass, and if she came with any more, to buy it, and let me know; and in the interim I ordered my foreman to put a private mark upon my brass. On the 18th of Oct. Mr. Gyles's clerk brought another parcel of brass, which he said he bought of that woman the day before: on examining it, I found two pieces with that private mark: I then got a warrant, and took up the prisoner at the bar, and his wife; they were examined before Mr. Alderman Alsop; Mr. Gyles's clerk swore he bought it of the wife, and my foreman swore to the private marks. The prisoner acknowledged the woman to be his wife, and that he had part of that brass in his custody: I never knew the woman to come to my shop: here is part of an air-pump handle, which was part of the work he had to do for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Saunders deposed to the brass being the property of his master the prosecutor; and Mr. Cardel, clerk to Mr. Gyles, deposed, the brass was brought to his master, by the woman the prisoner owned to be his wife.</p>

               <p>The council for the prosecutor declined calling any other evidence.</p>

I said the prisoner gave them to me, and she had given me two yards and a half of lace: I shewed him that; he said his wife could swear to it, but he could not; upon which he sent for his wife. I took ten laced handkerchiefs out of a drawer, and bid her look over the lace; she did, and laid her hand on this handkerchief here produced, and said the lace upon it was her property, the same lace the prisoner gave to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it his business to come to you with any letters or messages?</p>
               <p>Answer. No; but he seemed lately to come very officiously to deliver letters, or to ask for franks. I think he came to me in that room where I used to sit, the very evening before the robbery was committed; either that evening, or the evening before; but I am pretty sure it was that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How was your lordship engaged?</p>
               <p>Answer. I was near my bureau, reckoning some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any opportunity of knowing where you deposited your money?</p>
               <p>Answer. He might, by coming up so very officiously, when I was busy at my drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many drawers are in that bureau?</p>
               <p>Answer. It has an ivory table that shuts down, and underneath it are five drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you robbed?</p>
               <p>Answer. We discovered the robbery on the 5th of December, 1763, in the morning; one of the drawers that contained cash was broke open, and the upper part was broke likewise; there were only two locks broke.</p>
               <p>Q. What might your lordship lose?</p>
               <p>Answer. I lost upwards of two thousand pounds, in bills and every thing; there were two bank notes, one for 100 l. the other for 30 l. and all the money that the drawers contained: in one drawer were four roloes in two tin boxes, that held an hundred guineas each, all new bright guineas; they were in the upper part of the bureau.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the bureau.</p>
               <p>Answer. It is a library book-case, with drawers underneath; one beneath was broke open; the upper part like a chest of drawers, with a flap that lets down: there are two little drawers on each side, and three large drawers: it is a sort of a desk; one drawer in that was broke; the two drawers that were broke, were the only drawers that contained any thing of property; that drawer that was broke underneath, contained about 75 guineas in a bag; the bank notes were in a pocket book, in a little drawer in the upper part: that pocket book was taken away, and another pocket book also: there were three banker's notes in one of them. In the middle of the room was a great library table, with, I believe, 18 drawers in it; they were all locked; none of them were broke open; there was nothing in them. There was a gold repeating watch stole, that hung by the chimney side; there were with it two seals; one had my arms on it: I lost also three gold snuff boxes; two of them were enamelled; two of them I bought at Paris; the other I gave forty guineas for in Pall-mall. I had received the 30 l. bank note of Sir

            , my banker, that very day.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the prisoner came up to you the night before, was your desk open?</p>
               <p>Answer. The desk was certainly open; I was counting money, either upon it, or on the table near it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your Lordship see any place where were marks, that might be supposed to discover where the robber went in or out at.</p>
               <p>Answer. Mine is a very large house; the window is at a great distance from where the things were stolen: in the morning, about half an hour after ten, I came from my bed-chamber into the r oom where the bureau is; the first thing that struck me, was that being broke open: it seemed very clearly to be done with a gimblet and chissel; and upon examination, we had a gimblet and chissel that exactly fitted to the holes and impressions which we saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they found?</p>
               <p>Answer. I think the house-keeper found them in a box, with nails and other things, in a place where they usually were for common use.</p>

               <p>Counsel. I would beg leave to ask your Lordship, whether it is not possible a man might exceed the bounds of his duty without any bad design? he might wait upon your Lordship by accident.</p>
               <p>Answer. To be sure he might; that's matter of opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came up the night before the robbery, had your lordship those two distinct parts open?</p>
               <p>Answer. This I know, the upper part was down; I cannot absolutely say the drawer was; it might be unlocked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Will your lordship please to declare what my character and behaviour was before this?</p>
               <p>Answer. He generally was pretty diligent at the door: I cannot say I ever had any reason to suspect his honesty before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your lordship remember he ever came there, when you was taking money out of any particular drawer?</p>
               <p>Answer. I do not remember that he did; but he seemed very officious, and would wait longer than his message required.</p>
               <p>Q. Those tools that were applied to the bureau, were they found in the room when you first came in?</p>
               <p>Answer. No: we imagined these drawers must be broke open by such kind of instruments; therefore the servants searched about for such.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in them?</p>
               <p>Answer. They will be shewn by and by.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his business when he came up the night before the robbery?</p>
               <p>Answer. He brought me a letter: and what strikes me a good deal, is, he came up again, under pretence of asking me for a frank, which he might have asked for, at his coming before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the second time be after the first?</p>
               <p>Answer. It was a few minutes after.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the evening might this be?</p>
               <p>Answer. It must have been about seven o'clock. I went to the opera about half an hour past seven.</p>

            . I have been acquainted with Weskett seven or eight years; and with Cooper ten or a dozen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell your plain story to the court and the jury.</p>
               <p>Bradley. A few days before this happened, it may be a week, Weskett told me my Lord Harrington wanted a valet de chambre.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he tell you this?</p>
               <p>Bradley. This was at Lord Harrington's. He desired I would clean myself, and come the next day to see my Lord. I went the next day: he then told me he had got better bread for me than to serve him: he then told me to come in the night, and to bring a brace of pistols; but the principal conversation was the night the thing was executed; but that night he hinted at something that I thought I understood him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Bradley. He said my lord was worth a great deal of money, and bid me bring a brace of pistols; he knew I had a brace that I had bought abroad: he said, you know what I mean; call such a night, and bring a tinder-box along with you. Accordingly I did go, and took them things with me: I don't recollect what night it was: it was not above a day or two after that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What pass'd when you did go?</p>
               <p>Bradley. He told me when I went, my Lord and Lady were gone to the opera; this was in my Lord's hall; there was nobody there but him and I; I believe it was about seven o'clock. He took me in at the door of the porter's lodge, and we turned on the left hand, and went to the hall fire; we whispered as soon as we got together; he bid me walk gently, and took me into a little room on the left hand, before I came to the hall: now, he said, nobody has a right to come here at all, and you shall stay here; I'll get you something to drink till the middle of the night, then we will have my Lord's money. He went and brought me a bottle of rum; I went and lay upon his bed; he told me that was his lodge: I shewed him my pistols and tinder-box; he took them from me;

             the curtain; he went out several times, and every time he locked the door.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he lock the door when he was within side?</p>
               <p>Bradley. No. He said my Lord and Lady would be at home about twelve o'clock, and all the family would be in bed about one, and that would be about the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave you for any long time?</p>
               <p>Bradley. He once staid an hour with my Lord's gentleman, as he told me; one was learning the other French, and the other was learning English of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know my Lord's gentleman, if you see him?</p>
               <p>Bradley. No, I do not. My Lord and Lady came home about twelve: there was a window; through that I could see the flambeaux as they came past: I staid till he went out and came in again, and said, all the family were secure: that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120030"/> was, as near as I remember, between one and two: then he bid me take a draught of rum, and said, Let us have courage, and follow me: then we went into the kitchen together; I did not know the way: there was a proposal about my getting out at a window: it was a great high window, and opened with a pulley and string: I said, This is a very hard thing, and refused it, because I did not know where I was going to, if I did get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he propose your going out there?</p>
               <p>Bradley. Because there would be the less probability of being found out. I said, we could make it answer the same end: I took my shoes, that were dirty, and daubed the window and wall, as if I had got out: I got upon the dresser to do it; then we went up stairs both together; we had a candle; we went along a sort of a gallery, and through a large room very elegantly furnished with glasses; we turned on the right hand into a little study; it almost like fronted the door; there was a sort of a bureau, which looked like a writing desk; he told me that was the place where the money was: now, said he, we must break this bureau; and accordingly he broke it open, with a chissel and gimblet: I held the candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the chissel and gimblet?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I don't know where he got them; he had them; there was a flap that seemed to me to be to write on, on the upper part.</p>
               <p>Court Look at this chissel: (he takes one in his hand).</p>
               <p>Bradley. It was a broad kind of a chissel, like this; I can't say this is it.</p>
               <p>(A gimblet is put into his hand.)</p>
               <p>Bradley. I can't swear this is the gimblet; it was one like this: I saw nothing made use of but a chissel and gimblet. When he had broke it open, he took the money out; some he gave to me as he took it out; and some he delivered to me coming down stairs; he took out two tin cases, and gave to me; he took three snuff-boxes, and gave to me; these were out of the upper part, where the flap let down; the snuff-boxes had cases upon them; we took and destroyed every thing about them as soon as we could.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of money did he give you?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I can't tell: there was an hundred guineas in one tin case, and ninety-nine in the other; and there were some guineas in papers; I can't tell what quantity; they were put together in a bag; he gave me the bag; I can't tell where he had it; I did not stay to see what was in the bag; I carried all away: I put the guineas that were roll'd up in papers in the bag, and the snuff boxes in my waistcoat pockets; he gave me a watch, I brought that away, but can't tell which pocket I put it in; he gave me two pocket books; I did not then know what was in them; but I afterwards: after this we came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the chissel and gimblet?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I know nothing what was done with them: we left the tinder-box with intention they should imagine it was done by somebody that did not know the house: when we came down stairs, he said I must not try to open the door, I should make a noise; he opened the door and delivered the pistols to me for my own security; and I went out directly: he said he would not shut the door, but leave it a-jar; he begged by all means not to see me for a fortnight or three weeks: I made the best of my way: after that, I saw by the papers, all the servants were taken up upon the occasion. The first time I saw him after this, was, a servant maid, an acquaintance of mine, call'd upon me, to go to the play: I there saw Weskett in one of the side-boxes: I was in the gallery; I winked at him and he at me; I met him as he came out, and left that person by herself, and went with him to a house under the piazza, as you come down from Covent Garden play-house, the bottom door; there we had a bottle of wine: he said all things were safe; and hoped I had taken care of every thing that he had delivered to me: I said I thought I had taken care.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry the things?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I carried them all that very night to Mr. Cooper's house, in New Turn-stile, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to carry them there?</p>
               <p>Bradley. Because Cooper and I had been intimate acquaintances: I lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know of this before you carried them?</p>
               <p>Bradley. No, he knew nothing of it; but he had a little suspicion I was going upon something.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to Cooper's house?</p>
               <p>Bradley. It must in course be past two o'clock: I went and knocked at his room door; the outer door was open; it frequently was left open for other lodgers in the house: I asked Mrs. Cooper where Mr. Cooper was? she very roughly answered,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120031"/> You know better than I do: I imagined she might think we had been out drinking together; I went down to a pease-soop shop by Temple-bar; he was not there; then I went to a night-house by Holborn Bars; there I had some brandy hot; I had all the things about me then: after staying about an hour, I returned to Cooper's house, and went and deposited every thing in a sort of a shed in the yard, under no lock: then I went again in search for Cooper, and met him by accident on the other side Temple Bar, that is, on the side nearest here; this was between three and four o'clock; we went and drank together, and when we got home it was quite morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention this affair to him then?</p>
               <p>Bradley. He had some reason to imagine I had been doing something; I said, in the morning I would tell him, which I did that day, or the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell him?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I said there were such things, and where they came from, in the manner I have told it here; and went and shewed him them; and said, the safest way would be to bury these things in your cellar, and you need not want money; we will bury them, that they never can be found: I gave him some of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things buried by day or night?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I am not sure which; because it is a dark celler, and we had a candle; he dug the hole, and lent me a wooden box to keep the wet from them: when I wanted money, I went there; I never had any about me; and Cooper had money from there several times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the notes?</p>
               <p>Bradley. All bills of exchange, and draughts, that did not belong to the bank, we took and destroyed.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you got, when you came to look at them?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I did not examine all the things thoroughly, for almost a month; as there was enough, I let it rest: I tore the pocket-books immediately, and put them into one of the boxes; I buried the bag, in which were the roloes, the tin cases; the three snuff-boxes, the watch chain, and seal, in the presence of Cooper; he saw them all; I never went there for money without Cooper, because he kept the key, fearing any accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that cellar always kept locked?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I believe it was sometimes locked, and sometimes unlocked; the place was full of wood; this was just as we go in at the door: there were piles of wood on each side; he used to remove wood every day: he sells wood, and keeps a chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell Cooper of this intended robbery before it was committed?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I never did, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bank notes?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I had several meetings with Weskett; he blamed me for not attempting to put the notes off here: I wanted to go abroad with them: he said, My Lord is well known at all the courts in Europe; you can't put them off without being known. Then I said I'd go to Chester fair, and put them off there: so I went: this was in July, called Midsummer-fair: there I put them off for cloth and bills: I had the 100 l. and 30 l. notes with me: I had two draughts; one upon Mr. Wimpey, in Newgate-street, that was for 12 l. and upwards: (he is shewed a paper) this is it, I am very sure; it is for 12 l. 5 s.</p>
               <p>Court. Look upon the back of it.</p>
               <p>Bradley. Here is</p>

            ." I was with Weskett when he went there to receive the money.</p>
               <p>Court. Look on this other draught. (He takes it in his hand).</p>
               <p>Bradley. This I received at Chester also: this is for 43 l. 9 s. I kept company as other merchants did: I said, I was a young one in dealing in linen; and they let me buy the linen as they did that laid out two or three thousand pounds: when I had done, I got a post-chaise, and came with my linen and draughts to London. I had Mr. Wimpey's accepted: then I went to Mr. Alderman Cartwright, and he gave me a draught on his banker, to be paid 2 month or six weeks after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Cooper know of your going to Chester-fair?</p>
               <p>Bradley. He did; he went along with me to the Swan and two Necks, in Lad-Lane, when I set out.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did you set out?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I can't tell the day: I went in the stage-coach in two days: I came to town on a Sunday morning, pretty early, and went to a house in Piccadilly: I had a lodging at that time in Swallow-street: I sent for Cooper, and said, The bank notes had been stopped, and I had like to have been taken into custody; (this I said in joke); he said, he hop'd not: then I shewed him the two draughts: he said, he would not meddle with them; and I said I would go and have them accepted immediately: we staid till it was due.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120032"/> When Weskett came out of Mr. Wimpey's house, he said he had received the money: he said he had signed his name upon the back of it, but it could not be known.</p>
               <p>Q. How many names were upon the back of it when you gave it to him for payment?</p>
               <p>Bradley. There were not two names then, as I know of: Weskett went with the bill of 43 l. in the same manner: I went with him into Birchin-lane, and staid till he came out; then he told me he had got the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Weskett and you used to meet together often?</p>
               <p>Bradley. We used to meet and drink together; we used sometimes to drink punch; sometimes beer; we used to find liquor, and Cooper used generally to find sugar and lemons; we used to meet frequently at Cooper's house: Weskett and I used to meet at a number of houses where he used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time furnish Weskett with any part of this money?</p>
               <p>Bradley. Yes; I gave him thirty guineas once, and fifty guineas once; we did not stand upon an odd guinea; we had no writing at all, fearing, if we were taken up, that would make a discovery; so can't tell the exact times; it was three or four months after the robbery; he had told us he had enough.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the amount of the cash you brought from Lord Harrington's?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I believe it was between 3 and 400 l. Weskett delivered the roloes to me as we were going down stairs; they were in a bag; I can't tell how many; they were in a canvas bag; I never looked into that bag for a great while; when the money was taken out it was loose, and there were bits of loose paper in the bag: the money was buried in a wet place in the cellar; the water came into the hole three or four inches deep: I think, when I did examine it, I found a little more than an hundred guineas. When I came to the bottom of Gray's-inn-Lane, I desired leave of the landlord to leave the linnen there: (I don't remember the sign). It was a house that I thought I might come from thence to Cooper's house, without being seen by any body that knew me: so I went to Cooper's house, and told him as I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a silver candlestick and standish?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I do; I remember taking the standish I think, out of the study: it was a silve r one; I think it was upon the table: there was a little candlestick also; I brought them both away, and cut them both to pieces in Cooper's cellar: Cooper let me in, and gave me a chopper to chop them: they were all left in this hole in the cellar. (A parcel of silver chopp'd to pieces produc'd in court). This appears to be them: the clasps were taken off the books, and put amongst the pieces. (He takes a piece of the clasp in his hand.) This is a piece of one, and the watch and boxes are what I carried away, which my Lord has swore to.</p>

               <p>Bradley. I came without force.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not a person come to you, and bring you there?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I went as soon as he told me Sir John wanted me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know that you was advertised on this occasion?</p>
               <p>Bradley. No: I had read an advertisement in regard to Walker.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did that man, that came for you, find you?</p>
               <p>Bradley. He found me in Wapping.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live there at that time?</p>
               <p>Bradley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your business there?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I went to meet Cooper; he was to bring me some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Cooper live at Wapping?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I believe he has lived there; he told me he would meet me there.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of clothes had you on when you was taken?</p>
               <p>Bradley. I had sailor's clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to wear sailor's clothes?</p>
               <p>Bradley. Cooper told me, the last time I saw him, that people were after me about a bastard child; and I thought I would not pay the money, because I knew somebody else was concerned as well as I; so I got these clothes for a sort of a disguise.</p>

               <p>Bradley. There had been other things between us, and he thought he could rely upon me more than on any other.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you take the tinder-box for?</p>
               <p>Bradley. To leave it there, that they might think it was somebody that did not know the house, or where to light a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cooper's cellar door always locked?</p>

            . I am steward to Lord Harrington. When Weskett was hired to be porter in my Lord's service, I gave him instructions as to his duty; to be particular in opening the door; that what letters he received for my Lord, to deliver them to his footman; and likewise every letter for Lady Harrington, to deliver them to the groom of the chamber, or her footman; and what were for the servants, to deliver them himself, and not to stick them up in the hall: he did so for above a year; while the family was in town, no man more careful, or more particular. I remember, some little time before this robbery, after the family came out of the country, I have knocked at the door once or twice before I have got in, and a footman opened the door; I asked where the porter was; I saw him coming down stairs: I have said, where have you been? he said, I have been up to my Lord with a letter: I have told him, he had my Lord's own man to receive letters; you should stay at the door. I have knocked at the door, and could not get in: I have given orders that nobody but the porter should answer the knock. Weskett always knew what time my Lord received his bills and money: he knew these bills were come.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he know that?</p>
               <p>Bevell. He knew from me; I told him I had received bills, and there were some tradesmen to be paid: I told him I had been to Sir William Hart's, in order to pay them.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had you to tell him?</p>
               <p>Bevell. I said I should send for them to the house, that he might get a crown or half a crown: he knew I had sent to a farmer to come on the Sunday morning to receive 200 l. and upwards; and that person was with me that Sunday when my Lord was getting up, and I heard of the robbery: he has come into the city for bills, and to have them accepted: then I thought him a very honest man: My Lord's footman and valet de chambre were newly come; and the prisoner was the only person in the house, that knew, by going up to my Lord, the drawers where the bills and money were, except a maid or two: he came into my Lord's room two or three days before the robbery: I was there, and when he came in, I walked out: the drawer was then out that contained roloes of money, and the flap was open. On the evening of the day after the robbery, we made a discovery of what things were made use of in breaking the drawers open; the housekeeper found a gimblet and chissel: I went and brought Mr. Philips, who is a better judge than I can pretend to be: both the house-keeper and he are here, to give the court an account of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Weskett's box being searched, to see if any money could be found?</p>
               <p>Bevell. There were about 18 guineas found: this was some little time after the robbery; it might be a week after: after we found out the robbery, I came to the porter's lodge, and said, There are but four or five of us could be concerned in this robbery: I searched his shoes, to see if they were dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any place that had the appearance of any person coming in?</p>
               <p>Bevell. No, none at all: I examined the out-side of the wall, where there was this appearance of dirt on the in-side the window; there was the print of a foot going up upon the dresser, as if a dirty foot had rubbed against the wall, under the window in the kitchen, and the window was open: there is a wall before that window: had a person got out at that window, they must get over that wall: it is about five feet high; I examined it well; there is moss upon it; so that if any person had put their foot or hand upon it, a mark must have been seen; but we saw no appearance of any such thing; from thence we did conclude no person could come in or go out that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Has Bradley described the rooms he has mentioned?</p>
               <p>Bevell. He has described them very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at Cooper's house?</p>

               <p>Q. How came you and Cooper to be together?</p>
               <p>Bevell. When he found he was to be committed, he called Sir John and me together, and told us of the things that were buried in his cellar: that Bradley and Weskett were the two persons that had robbed Lord Harrington; and that he had them of Bradley: he said he had known Bradley ten or a dozen years: that they first became acquainted by living in the Temple: he said, Bradley had come away from his place, from Mr. Commings's, about a month before the robbery, and lodged at his house: upon which I went with him into his cellar; I found, under a tyle and some earth, with some coals over them, two gold snuffboxes enamelled, the repeating watch, and some silver cut to pieces, the same as produced here, in a dirty bag; and in another corner, in a box not buried, a plain gold snuff-box: then I brought Cooper back to Sir

The first time he was taken up, we found fifteen or sixteen guineas in a horn; that was eight or nine months before; he said they were his property: he was taken up three times: I heard a foot over my head about the hour eleven, on the night of the robbery; I said to the maid, Is my Lord come in? after the robbery I recollected this circumstance, and related it to Sir

               <p>Mrs. Street. I am a Servant to my Lord Harrington: I was going up the great stairs on the Saturday night that the robbery was committed; and I saw Weskett in the long gallery, coming from the Mall-room; that room is joining to the room where the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night might that be?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Street. I believe it was very near 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you go through the Mall-room to the room where the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Street. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Philips. I saw the places that were broke open; there was a chissel and gimblet shewed me; (these produced here.) these are they: I tried them to the places where violence was used in wrenching the places open, and they exactly fitted to the places.</p>

            . I am one of my Lord's chairmen: I went away from the house as soon as the servants came down stairs, when it was rather better than twelve o'clock at night, the night the robbery was committed, and I know the door was shut after me; I always try, by shoving my elbow against it; a footman shut it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Bevell. Did you search well, to see if it was possible for any person to get in at any other place than the door?</p>
               <p>Bevell. I did; I searched all the windows of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120035"/> the house, to see if any marks of feet appeared, and all the locks and walls round the house: I could find nothing to lead me to believe they could come in any way but by the street-door, and there appeared no violence upon that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Weskett turned away, or did he go away?</p>
               <p>Bevell. He was turned away.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tompkinson. I am a servant in the family. When I came down, on the Sunday morning, the street-door was wide open; this was between, seven and eight o'clock: I was laying the fire in the steward's room, when the porter came to the door: he asked me if I had seen Old Wag? that is an old man that my Lord keeps out of charity: he said, Have you let him in? I said, no; but the door was wide open when I came down stairs: he turned away, and said, D - n it, who could go and leave the door open.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that old man used to come often?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Tompkinson. He used to come every day.</p>
               <p>Justice Spinnage. I was at my Lord Harrington's house, to examine the servants: I examined them very particularly: Weskett told me he had not been up stairs all the day before the robbery, nor the day before that: after he was taken up, I went and searched his box; there were fifteen or sixteen guineas in a drinking horn: I asked him how he came by that money? he said he received it of his Lordship; then he said he had no more; but when he was searched again, then was sixty guineas found: then he said he brought a good deal of money to Lord Harrington's when he came there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sparrow. I have known Weskett between three and four years; he has lodged at my house before he went to my Lord Harrington's, and he has three or four nights since he came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I live in Maddox-street: I keep a public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen Weskett and Bradley together?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I have, several times, both at the house where I now live, and the house where I did live.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Bradley?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I did not know him till last summer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they appear to come about?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. To drink a pot of beer and read the papers.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times do you think they have been together at your house?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I am positive they have been there ten or twelve times, I believe. About two or three months after Weskett left Lord Harrington's, he told me he had got some money, and desired me to put it by for him in my bureau: I put it in my waistcoat pocket, till I had an opportunity to put it by. There were seventy guineas of it; I counted it; and about three months after, he had ten guineas out of it: he said it would be safer at my house than at his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see Cooper at your house?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I never saw him till I saw him at the bar.</p>

               <p>Bevell. He was cautioned against going up stairs. I never knew of his going up stairs, till the last time of my Lord's returning from the country: to my knowledge, he had not been up to my Lord before.</p>
               <p>Lord Harrington. It was the business of my own footman to come up to me with messages. I can't recollect that the prisoner came up to me, till very lately: it was officiously, when he did.</p>
               <p>Weskett called nobody to his character.</p>
               <p>Cooper called Mr. Jones, with whom he had lived about five years and a half, down till February, 1763.

             used to cohabit together: about a fortnight ago, on a Saturday, about five in the morning, the woman (the deceased) came to our house; my husband got up, and let her in; she had nothing on but her shift, and a handkerchief tied over her head: I asked her what was the matter? she said Stoner was using her very ill, and she lay down behind me. After that, I went to the prisoner for her cloaths; he would not let me have them, and swore, if he could lay hold of her, he would have his revenge on her, he would kill her, and that she should never come within the door any more. After that, Mr. Holt went over, and the prisoner sent two petticoats, an apron, and handkerchief; she got up, and dressed herself. I went to the door, and saw the prisoner coming, and said to her he was coming: she ran into the backyard (this was between 10 and 11 o'clock): he ran after her, and took his knife out of his pocket; ( producing a small clasp knife) this is it; he ran it against her side: I strove to hinder him; but the point being broke before, it did not hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say at the time?</p>
               <p>Evans. He swore he would run that knife through her. While I had hold of him, she ran out into the street; he shut the knife, and put it into his pocket: in a little time, he followed her out, and took up a brick-bat, and threw it at her, but miss'd her; she ran towards Mr. Bullock's house, the sign of the two brewers, and he followed her down the court. Soon after, I he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120038"/> had killed her; I went to their lodgings, and just saw her before she was dead: she drew her breath about four or five times, and died: there was then only the prisoner,

            . I am servant to Mr. Bullock, at the Two Brewers, in Vine-street, on Saffron-hill. On the first of this month, the deceased came into the kitchen (it was near 11 o'clock): she sat down fronting the fire, and called for a pennyworth of warm two-penny; my master warmed it, and in the mean time, the prisoner came in: he bid her go home several times; she said she would never go home any more; he had a key in his hand, with which he hit her a blow over the arm: she begged of him to let her alone: he stood by looking at her, and bid her go home; she said she never would. He put the key in his pocket, and I saw him snatch something from the dresser, but what it was, I could not tell; he ran with great force up to her, as she was sitting; I saw him make at her breast, and saw a motion of his arm, but did not see a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing?</p>
               <p>Timonds. I did not hear him speak. She never after that cried out or spoke; I screamed out: she fell out of her chair, upon her right arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you saw that motion, was it that she fell?</p>
               <p>Timonds. She fell in about two minutes, or not so long.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you scream out?</p>
               <p>Timonds. I thought he was going to beat her: after that, he drew back, and stood in the kitchen; my master hearing me, ran in, out of the taproom; the deceased was not then fell down, but her eyes were working: while my master was gone to the door to call Mr. Gibson, she fell down; there was a case knife, with a long blade, sharp pointed, lying on the dresser: my master had just cut a piece of bread with it, for me to toast; the same was found upon the dresser, with blood upon it (produced in court): when Mr. Gibson came in, she was lying on her right side: my master helped her up upon his back, and he took her to her lodgings.</p>

            . I keep the Two Brewers. On the first of December, about two or three minutes before eleven o'clock, the deceased came into my house, and went directly through the tap-room into the kitchen, and sat down; she said, bring me a pennyworth of warm two-penny, I am very cold: there are two dressers join, and she sat between them, in a chair. After I gave her the twopenny, I went back into the tap-room: the prisoner came in, in about three or four minutes, and walked round the tap-room, and went out again, with a key in his hand. I said to him, why do you put yourself in such passions, for to expose yourself and wife? I do'nt remember any answer he made. In less than two minutes, he came in again, and went directly into the kitchen, to the deceased: somebody screamed; I ran into the kitchen, and saw the woman's breast open, and a little issuing of blood; I said, I am afraid you have killed your wife, Stoner; I don't know that he made any answer. I ran to the door, and saw Mr. Gibson, and said, I was afraid Stoner had killed his wife. He came in: I said, for God's sake, let us take her home: I helped her on his back, and he carried her home. My main care was to see that Stoner did not get away: I said to him, you must not go away; he said he would not; he went out into the street, and staid there a little while, and after that, he went to his own apartment. I sent for a constable, as soon as I had word that she was dead: after we had been at the justice's, we examined for the knife, and found this on the dresser (here produced) all bloody.</p>

            . On the first of December, I was at my own door, when the last evidence called me; I went in, and saw the deceased lying on the floor, in the kitchen, on her right side; he said Stoner was in the passage: I took and carried the deceased home, and laid her on her bed: I turned her handkerchief aside, and saw it was a fatal blow. I ran down stairs, and saw Stoner at the end of the court: I said, Stoner, good man, come up; he came into the room; after he was in the room, she fetched four or five fighs, but never spoke. Said I, O Stoner, she is a dead woman! He said, O Bett, shall I die for you? turning round, stooped down and buss'd her; after she was dead, he turned round in a sort of a passion, opened his cloaths, and whip'd his hand in his pocket, I thought, with intent to kill himself, by the motion he had: I said, hold, Stoner, one life, not two; and catched hold of him. I put my hand in his right hand pocket, and Mrs. Evans put her hand in his left, and she took that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120039"/> small clasp knife out of it: he opened the casement, that looks plumb on the deceased's mother's, and said, this is all through that snub-nose b - h, the sister, and that old b - h, the mother: when I go in the cart, I shall lay it all to their charge. There came assistance, and we took him before Justice Girdler, and he committed him to New Prison. The justice ordered me to go to see the prisoner: I went the next day, which was Sunday; there was one of the runners there; I told him, I came by the justice's order, to see the prisoner had no knives about him, and take off his garters; and about a quarter of an hour after he was locked up. I put my head to him, as he was sitting at the lodge fire, and said, Stoner, tell me true, Was that the knife that lay on Mr. Bullock's dresser? he said, yes, and all wicked people together: God knows the meaning of those words, for I do not. On the Monday, I went again, and Mr. Coleman with me; the prisoner was in the yard, making water: said I, this is a sad accident; you remember you told me you owned to the knife; he did not then deny it, but made no answer.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to examine the deceased, when the coroner sat upon the body: I examined it, and found a wound in the superior part of the sternum, or breastbone; but upon raising the sternum, I found a great quantity of blood under it; in making farther search, I found the pericardium wounded, and a great quantity of blood likewise; and upon farther enquiry, I found a wound in the right ventricle of the heart, where I believe the major part of the blood came from: I pass'd my finger into the heart, and that satisfied me, without making any farther enquiry: no person could live after receiving such a wound; it seemed to have been done with a picked pointed instrument: I compared this case-knife here with the wound, and it fitted exactly; it went through the sternum.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Timonds. Do you recollect how far the deceased was fitting from that part of the dresser where the knife was found?</p>
               <p>S. Timonds. I think she could not reach to where the knife lay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When I first went into Evans's house, I desired her to go home, and she said she would not: the night before she had lain out all night. I said, where you have been, you may go there again: I then walked down to Black-lion-stairs, to my boat. (I am a waterman). I had the key in my hand: when I returned, I went into Mr. Bullock's house; I said, Madam, do you please to go home? No, d - n my eyes, said she, if I do, and began to bridle her head at me, in a whore's fashion. I said, you have been whoring all night, and hit her with the key: she took up the knife, and said, d - n you, you dog, I'll be the butcher of you. I took hold of her arm, and whether she did it herself, or what not, I know not; but her design was for me: she tried to poison me within these two months; but as for doing it myself, before God and man I did not. Fourteen years ago, she has strove to do the same; she has hit me over the face and eyes with pots. When Mr. Gibson took her up, I helped her on his back; and before he came in, she haul'd me to her, and kiss'd me; and when I came into the room to her, Gibson said, she is dead: then I said, I'll die too. She has been a woman of the town twenty years, and I wanted to break her of it, but could not.</p>

               <p>When I was stopped, I heard the cry, Stop thief: I turned to see who it could be: a gentleman ran out of a house and laid hold of me: he said, Here he is: the man came up and said he had lost his hat: said I, What is that to me? I did reprimand him, and threaten to strike him, for accusing an innocent person: I struck at him: then he said he would swear I took it: I saw, when before the magistrate, he did not care what he said to affect me. Is it possible a man could see me at the turnings of two or three streets, and at the distance of thirty or forty yards? I am entirely innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What became of the other two men?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They ran after me, as I ran after the prisoner: I did not mind them; he must have thrown the hat away as he ran, but I did not see him do it.</p>

               <p>Q. What family have you?</p>
               <p>Warner. I have a wife, a maid-servant, and two children. On the 19th, I found my house broke open; they came over the water-tub, and then to the kitchen door, in the yard; that I fastened myself, with a padlock; I found the farther yard door open, and I found this knife (producing a case knife) It is not mine, and a large sauce-pan, on the outside of the yard door; the sauce-pan is my property (I did not lay that in the indictment): I then found my kitchen door open, and missed several things; the padlock was gone: I missed two large pewter dishes, several pewter plates, a pottage-pot, a tea-kettle, and a brass cock: I immediately suspected the prisoner; I have known him two years; he had worked with me as a journeyman; he worked with me the week before; we had had some words, and we parted: I did my best to find him out, and found him in Playhouse-yard, White-cross-street, that afternoon: he was within a few yards of Nesbit's mother's (that is an accomplice we have not taken): I followed the prisoner into 'Nesbit's mother's house; there was the prisoner's mother, who was telling him I had been after him three or four times that morning: he said, he could not think what I wanted with him (this I heard as I was at his back): I told him, if he would go along with me, I would tell him, for I had something particular to say to him, and to Nesbit too (they were both together). Nesbit said, he could not think what I wanted with him; they said they would go with me any where, where I chose: I said, to my own house: the prisoner and his mother went with me very quietly; Nesbit said he would follow, but did not. When I came home, I said, Watkins, I have great reason to believe you have robbed my house; I shall send for a constable  and take you up on suspicion, for none but you could do it: he said, if I would go into a private room, he would tell me what was done with the things; that he had neither sold nor pawned them, and that they were lodged in the second or third alley beyond the Roebuck, in Turnmill-street, Cow-cross. I charged a constable with him, and sent him to the Compter; he owned to the taking the things; he said he took the brass cock out of the water-tub, and stuffed a bit of paper in, that the water should not run out: he said the knife was Nesbit's, and that he (Nesbit) broke the padlock of the kitchen-door. I said it must be somebody that knew the door, that could do it; that part of the latch was off, and by putting his finger into a hole, he might lift it up, which people could not know but such as were in the house. I went immediately to search for my goods in that lost; there I found nothing but a flat tin candlestick, and the iron bail of the pot, with which it is lifted on and off the fire: the room below, was a lodging-room, where Nesbit lodged with a woman: while I was looking about the lost, the people below fastened the door, and went out; I came away. When we came before my Lord Mayor, on the Saturday morning, the prisoner told me he had sold the pot, tea-kettle, and brass cock, to Mr. Andrews, in Long-lane: my Lord put it off for that night, and ordered me to come again on the Monday. On the Monday morning, I got a search-warrant, and went to Nesbit's room, where I found two pewter dishes, and two plates (produced and deposed to); they were brought before my Lord Mayor, and he bound me over to prosecute. I went to Mr. Andrews, and he told me he had bought the pot, tea-kettle, and cock of the prisoner at the bar; the pot and kettle were knocked to pieces; there were no marks upon them; the brass cock I can swear to; I had bought it but a few days before, and put it in the tub: (produced and deposed to).</p>

               <p>Mr. Andrews. I live in Long-lane, and keep a founder's shop; I buy old brass and copper; the prisoner's father did keep the same sort of a shop as I do, in Barbican: he brought the pottage-pot, tea-kettle, and brass cock to me, about 10 or 11 o'clock on the Friday; the other man came with him, but I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a handle to the pot?</p>
               <p>Andrews. No, there was not: the pot and tea-kettle were knocked and bruised about, and broke in several pieces; the cock was as it is now. I asked the prisoner how he came by them? he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176412120045"/> his mother gave him them to sell, to buy some tools; that he and another had taken a shop, in Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street, and this man that came with him, was his partner: I gave him 8 d. a pound for the brass, 9 d. for the copper, and 6 d. for the cock: the pot weighed 6 pounds, the tea-kettle two pounds, and the cock weighed just a pound: the prisoner bought a file of me.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Which brought it in?</p>
               <p>Andrews. I can't say which did; they came both together: I was in the kitchen, and they laid it down on the counter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I paid Nesbit's mother half a crown for tools; I had some work that was in a hurry, and was going to Mr. Andrews's house, to buy a file. I met with Nesbit, and asked him where he was going? he said, to sell this old metal at Andrews's; we went together, and sold it: coming along, he said, I have got some other things; I said, where did you get them? said he, what is that to you. When the prosecutor challenged me with the things, I gave him the best information I could, where they were, and where Nesbit might be found. I never was with him in the house, nor no way concerned with him whatsoever.</p>
