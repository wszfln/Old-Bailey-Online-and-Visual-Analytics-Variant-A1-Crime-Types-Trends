"On the 28th of Feb., from in<lb/>formation I received, I went to a house in Green-court, Brick-lane, St. Luke's, with Hull, Redman, and Cole—I entered at the front door, went up stair to the door of the first floor room, found the door fast, and proceeded to force it open—I succeeded in forcing the upper part open sufficiently to be able to we into the room, and saw the prisoners there—Edmeads was sitting with his face towards me, and Burton was sitting sideways, Edmeads holding some<lb/>thing white in his hand, and Burton holding a large spoon close to that white</p>

               <p>substance in Edmeads's hand, with a pail between them—directly the door was broken open they saw me, and both put their hands out as if flinging something into the nice clear fire which was burning—I did not see any thing pass from their hands—I then noticed Edmeads put something white into his mouth—it was the same white thing as I had seen in his hand—Burton went towards a cupboard in the room, then came to the door, and put his shoulder against the door and resisted us very much as we were still trying to force the other part of the door—at last, with the assistance of the officers, I forced the door open, seized Edmeads by the throat, and four pieces of plaster of Paris came from his mouth—I looked at the pail, and noticed some melted white metal in it—Edmeads resisted very much—there was some plaster in the pail besides and water—I went to the cupboard I had seen Burton go to, and found two moulds, which I produce—when I first entered the room I asked Edmeads what he meant by this—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I said to Burton, "What game do you call this?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—we took them into custody, and took possession of the things I now produce.</p>

                  </hi>, I am inspector of counterfeit coin to the Mint. This is a plaster of Paris mould, intended to cast half-crowns—it bears the impression of both sides of a William IV. half-crown—it appears to have been used very much—here is another plaster of Paris mould for shillings of George III., 1816, which appears to have been very much used, and has both sides of the impression—here are three counterfeit half-crowns, all of which have been cast in the mould I have spoken to—two of them are finished, and one unfinished, as it comes from the mould—here are portions of two broken white metal spoons, of similar metal to the half-crowns—here is some more metal, which has been recently fused, and here are portions of counterfeit half-crowns, attached to it, as if thrown into the fused metal while hot—all these half-crowns have been cast in the mould I have spoken to—scissors are generally used to separate the get from coin—this file has white metal in the teeth—it is generally used to remove any surplus metal—this iron spoon has been used to lade the metal from the pipkin—it has metal in it now—the pipkin contains similar metal—I do not know anything of this box of composition—here is some plaster of Paris, the material of which the moulds are composed—these four pieces of white produced by Brannan, as coming from Edmeads' mouth are plaster of Paris in a solid state, but have no impression on them—a pail of water could be used to immerse the moulds into immediately, in cast of alarm, to destroy the impression, which would be done in a very short time—here is part of a mould, for fourpenny-pieces, but the impression is nearly obliterated.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been a publican? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four years—I have known the prisoner nearly five years—I had been there the night before this took place, and had some punch—I had not been drinking a good deal before the supper began—I was there from twelve at noon till twelve at night—I had been drinking before supper—the prisoner did not remonstrate with me on my conduct to some of his customers—as far as I remember, he made no remonstrance or complaint to me—I think this altercation took place about half-past seven—we had had supper then—I told Fry what I was told—that was after I had supped with him—I might have had a glass of beer at supper—I do not say that I drank more at supper—after supper I had 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of brandy—the prisoner was present while I was telling Fry what had happened—I was sitting in the left-hand corner of the room—I was not near the prisoner—I did not tee Mrs. Davis in the bar at all—Fry denied that he had tasted my punch—the prisoner also assured me I was mistaken, and that Fry did not do so—I did not hear him refer to his wife to satisfy me that I was in error—I swear he did not say he would inquire of his wife to ascertain from her whether or not Fry was present when the punch was served—I did not hear the prisoner say, "Hear what she says, that Fry left the house before the punch was served"—I did not say, "Oh, Mrs. Davis will say anything for Mrs. Fry, for she is as big a w——as you are a liar," nor any words to that effect—I made no allusion to Mrs. Davis whatever—I might have made allusion to the prisoner being a liar, about being concerned in this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. matter—I think I might have said he was wrong—I will not positively swear I did—I have letters in my possession to satisfy me that he was concerned in it—Davis did not say, "Come now, I insist on your going out"—I had a small cane with me—I did not flourish it about, and say I would not go out, I would go out when I liked—the prisoner did not on that take me by the collar and say he would insist on turning me out—we did not have a struggle in which I fell; nothing of the kind took place—he never laid hold of me, we never struggled together, and never fell together—I saw a policeman soon after I was outside the house—he declined taking any notice of my com<lb/>plaint—I was told that I appeared as if I had been drinking, and that Davis would not run away; that he was to be found to-morrow—I am sure I was not told I was too drunk for the charge to be taken—I told M'Caskery, the constable on duty, he might have gone in if he liked—the house was not shut up—there was light in the room—there were people in the house at the time—I swear the house was open at the time I spoke to the constable—the door was shut—it could not be closed if there were people in the house—on the next night, about half-past nine o'clock, I went to a chemist's—I have not brought him here—he dressed my wound on Saturday night—I found my head had been attended to when I was outside the house—some strapping had been put to it—I walked to the chemist's that night, and on Sunday and Monday—on the Tuesday Mr. Rouse saw me for the first time—I know Mr. Reeves, a publican—I called on him on the Saturday, the day after—I had some beer there, and tasted a little drop of gin and water—I have made a charge of</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, living in King's-road, Chelsea. Between seven and eight o'clock on the evening of the 12th of January, I went to the Cadogan Arms—I saw the prosecutor there—when I went in he was in the passage that forms part of the bar, close to the bar, walking about—he appeared rather intoxicated—in the course of the evening, he said I had partaken of five glasses of punch, which he had paid for the evening before, which I denied—he repeated it a number of times, till it became quite offensive—he did it in the early part of the evening—he accused me of it as soon as I came into the house—but as soon as supper was over, in conse<lb/>quence of his repeating this, I applied to Mr. Davis, and he applied to Mrs. Davis—he asked her, in M'Carthy's hearing, if I had partaken of any punch anywhere, and where the punch was when I had left the house—she answered, I bad left the house previous to her sending the punch into the room—on that Davis came back into the room, and asked M'Carthy if he was satisfied now—M'Carthy said, "Of course, Mrs. Davis will say anything for Fry, she is as big a wh——as you are a liar"—on this, Davis sprang from where he was standing, caught him by the collar, and in one moment they were both on the ground, Davis rather undermost—it was so suddenly, I cannot deci<lb/>dedly say whether it was the fire-place or fender struck his head—he fell in a direction towards the fire-place—they separated—Davis got up first—I helped M'Carthy up—Davis went out of the room immediately, rather shaking—it was a severe sudden tumble—M'Carthy's head was hurt—I looked at it and cut the hair off, it was bleeding a little—he said nothing about how it happened—I washed it and put a little white plaister on—the servant of the house brought the water—Davis was at the door—he did not assist in dressing the wound—he sent the servants to me—M'Carthy was perfectly sensible at that time—when I placed him in a chair, I said, "You are not hurt, are you?"—he said, "Ain't I though"—the first I knew of his having wounded himself was, his placing his hand to his head, and when I removed it I saw blood on it—I said I am sorry for what has occurred—I asked to look at his head—he said no, at first—he would not allow me—at last he did allow me—I saw an injury—he said, "What have I done that I should be struck with a poker"—I said, "You have not been struck with any poker here"—he did not say anything more—he remained there about an hour after the occurrence—I do not know whether he drank anything after it—some brandy was brought into the room—I do not know whether he partook of it, it was not used for any<lb/>thing that I know of—at the time he received the hurt, the persons in the room were Mr. Davis, M'Carthy, and myself—I am perfectly sure that, during the time I was there, Davis used no poker to M'Carthy—he did not touch one—he struck him with nothing—there was no blow of any kind struck, either with hand or poker, with the exception of snatching him by the collar—after he had been an hour in the house, he went away—I asked him if I should assist him home—he said, "No, he was quite capable of conducting himself," with some show of indignation—I then asked him if the potman should see him home—he refused—he walked away very fast out of the house by himself—from the time he fell till he was picked up, there might be two minutes elapse—after he was picked up till he left the house he was not insensible one moment—I should say he left the house between twelve and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080020"/>
               <p>one o'clock—I cannot say positively—his conduct to the customers in the coffee-room, that evening, was insulting in the extreme—Mr. Davis remon<lb/>strated with him, several times, on his conduct, and desired him to leave the house two or three times—his answer was, he should go when he liked—there was a cast-iron fender to the fire-place, with a very sharp edge and sharp points at the corner.</p>

Jones, 24, Little Guilford-street, Russell-square—I took him to an old man, named Windsor, who, I thought, might know Stewart, and a man named Holmes, also to Loosely, and M'Lean, and I took him to Holmes's wife, down at Court Garden, where Stewart used to live, as I was informed—I did not know any thing of Stewart before I went there—I heard what the people told Fletcher—we could not bear of any relation of Stewart—they told him there never was any relation of Stewart's, except a brother that went to sea many years before, and was supposed to have gone to America—Fletcher took a careful memorandum—he seemed to be writing down—we went to a grave-stone in the church-yard, and he took notes of what he thought proper—we found a grave-stone of Stewart—when Fletcher went away, he requested me to get all the information I could, re<lb/>specting any relation of Stewart's, and send him word, and I should be well rewarded for it, and gave me his address—as Windsor could read and write, I asked, whether it would not be better for Fletcher to correspond with Windsor, as it would encourage him to find out those who knew Stewart better than I could—in about a fortnight or three weeks after this, the prisoner Barber came down—he staid about six hours with me—he went into my commercial-room—some of my people told me a gentleman wanted me—I went in, and he said, "Is your name Hyatt?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Did you have a gentleman here, sometime ago, of the name of Jones?"—I said, "Yes, there was"—he said that he came from Mr. Jones, and Mr. Jones and him were all one party; that he had come to inquire after the relations of Stewart, who had died worth a great deal of property, and all they wanted was to find out the real owner for it—he gave me his name, before he left, as Clarence Peckham., Esq., Nelson-square—he said, there was a great deal of the property at Chelsea, and so had Mr. Jones said before—something was said about property in the Sinking Fund, but that was gone, and so had Jones said before—there was something mentioned about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that the pro<lb/>perty in the Sinking Fund died with him, but I think I heard that from Jones previously, in conversation with the old men—Barber said that to me as well as Jones—I took him round to the old people—they said there was a brother of Stewart's many years ago—they bad some account from Stewart that his brother was gone to sea, it was supposed to America—M'Lean, the last man we went to, agreed to meet Barber at my house—he came up, and had a glass of grog—Barber was in the front room—M'Lean came to the bar—Barber came out to him, and talked to him—I was in and out, and did not hear all the conversation—I asked Mr. Barber where this property was at</p>

               <p>Chelsea, as I had some friends there—he laid it was near the College—I said, "Do you know a gentleman named Eagle ton, surveyor of King's taxes, there?"—he said, "No"—I then asked if he knew Eagleton, who kept the Roebuck—he said he did not, nor did he know any such place—I did not press the inquiry—after he bad seen M'Lean, he said he would not trouble me fur<lb/>ther, he would go and see the old men himself, and he went out—I laid I was going to London in a week or so, and Mr. Barber asked me to come and dine with him, and get him all the information I could—I said I would endeavour to get all I could, and tell him when I came up; and when I came, I went to No. 52, Kelson-square—a woman answered the door—I asked if Clarence Peckham, Esq., was in—she asked my name—I told her Hyatt—she went away, then returned—I went into the passage, and Mr. Barber came—I did not dine with him—it was between nine and ten o'clock—I went for the sake of my word, as 1 promised—I told him I could not hear of any of Stewart's relations, except the brother before mentioned.</p>

               <p>it particularly, became it was a sort of excitement to me, a gentleman, as I thought, coming to me—I have repeated the conversation over and over again, and have made a great deal of inquiry, and that will justify what I have said is correct—there is no mistake about it—Barber said he came from Mr. Jones, that Mr. Jones and him were all one firm—I have not given two or three different versions of this—he said Mr. Jones and he were equally as one firm—he spoke as if they came from one place and one firm, and that is what he said.</p>

               <p>what it was—she said, "It is to know whether you will allow me to have some letters left at your address, under the name of Mr. Jones?"—I said, Yes"—she said, "Don't yon remember hearing me and my mother speak of some property that was coming to us?"—she said, Mr. Jones was the lawyer—about a fortnight or three weeks after, a letter came to me in that name—I took it the next morning to Mr. Wybrow's, at the Temple of Apollo, and left it in the shop—I think I saw Mr. Wybrow behind the counter—I told him to give it to Miss Richards—I received another note after that—I cannot tell whether it was a week or a few days after—it was roughly folded up, and had the same address—I took that also to Mr. Wybrow's—I saw no more of Miss Richards, after that, for a year and a half, or two years, that I recollect—I did not then learn from her, whether or not she had had these notes.</p>

Griffin"—the draft came back to me in this state—there is the word "approved" above the signature—I required to have the signatures of Stewart and Griffin to this, being a very peculiar case, and the instructions not being given very fully—I had no instructions furnished to me, which I can produce signed, or any document emanating from Griffin or Stewart—I required their signatures to the draft, being a very peculiar case, and in order that we might be sure the parties were cognisant of the fact; and more particularly because the re<lb/>gistrars in general, will not look at any draft-affidavits unless they can ascer<lb/>tain that the parties will really swear, in order that there may be no perjury—they will not look at it until it is sworn, unless under very peculiar cir<lb/>cumstances; and I therefore produced this signed—I think Fletcher brought it back, "approved," with these signatures upon it—I then took it an approved, to the clerk of the seat, and afterwards, by his direction, submitted it to the registrar, as is always the case—the affidavit was no at that time perfect—I afterwards received the draft back from the clerk of the seat—it was objected to from time to time; at length it was perfected—the registrar directed appli<lb/>cation should be made to the clergyman, having been informed this box was in his possession, to ascertain whether any will was contained in the box; and that. the answer should be submitted to him, the registrar—an application was made to Mrs. Stewart for that purpose—I think a letter was written—this is the letter I wrote—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was dated</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th August</hi>, 1840, <hi rend="italic">signed Frederick William Potts, and directed, Mrs. Stewart, 1, Southampton<lb/>terrace, Southamp­ton-street, Camberwell, and stated that the draft, approved by herself and Grif<lb/>fin, was not deemed sufficient, and requesting her to write to the clergyman of Great Marlow, for further particulars about her brother's property, to inquire whether there was any will, and to forward the reply to him, Mr. Potts</hi>)—after I had written that letter, Fletcher called again—he was informed of all that that letter states—it was gone through with him, and he went away, if I recollect, promising that the application should be made to the clergyman—I do not think he said any thing about his attorney on that occasion—I think it was on a previous occasion, when application was made to him to amend the affidavit, stating that certain amendments were required, he said that be would send his solicitor, Mr. Barber, a very shrewd, clever man—that was before I saw Mr. Barber at all—Mr. Barber then called—the circumstances were all detailed to him—I am not aware that he took any notes in writing, of the information I gave him—Mr. Barber, when I had told him this, said he would furnish me with the necessary instructions—Mr. Potts, upon seeing Mr. Barber there as a solicitor, said, he was very happy to see a professional man, he had not the pleasure of knowing Mr. Fletcher, and asked him who he was—he said he was a man of high respectability and large property, or some<lb/>thing to that effect—a day or two after, Mr. Barber called again—he brought</p>

He promised her that he would go down to Great Marlow and see her brother, and take a letter to him for her, which he did. On his return, he informed her that her brother had been dead ever since March, 1827. Mr. Jones called on her about a month since, and informed her that he was then going back to America, and she had neither seen or heard from him since. Mrs. Stewart was informed by her late aunt, that Mr. Jones was formerly a captain of a vessel trading from New York to Bristol, but that he is now a gentleman of independent property.

If your present application be on behalf of the party whom you represent as being a sister of the deceased, we have only to say, as we have before told you, that we are not satisfied that she is the sister, and as such we are not disposed to pay any more attention to it than to the applica<lb/>tions made by other parties claiming to be next-of-kin of the deceased.

Gentlemen,—In inquiring who is my client, and by what right such client asks for information on this subject, it must surely have escaped your recollection that I took the trouble to produce for your inspection the letters of administration procured by such client, Elizabeth Stewart, the sister of the deceased, toge<lb/>ther with an affidavit in support thereof. Such an administration was not obtained until every query suggested by the registrar had been answered to his entire satisfaction. Subsequently to this, I have supported the claim of Mrs. Stewart so entirely to the satisfaction of the Bank Directors, as to induce them to order the transfer of stock which had stood in the deceased's names to that of my client. With all due deference, therefore, I submit she is enti<lb/>tled to have her claim regarded in a very different light to that of the other applications to which your letter refers. I submit also that she is fairly en<lb/>titled to an answer to the inquiry contained in my last, without being driven to the expense and delay of a bill of discovery, or any other adverse proceed<lb/>ing.

               <p>this charge—this statement is in her handwriting—I communicated the statement to Messrs. Freshfield's office, by desire of Mrs. Dorey herself—the had some time before expressed great anxiety to make a statement, and put the prosecutors in possession of all the facts she knew.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The following extract from the statement was here read</hi>;)—"It is new about fourteen or fifteen years since I first became acquainted with the prisoner Flet<lb/>cher, who was then living in the London-road, and practising as a surgeon, having a chemist's shop there; I was then residing in Portland-street; I cannot speak with certainty of my age; to the best of my belief, I was about eighteen or twenty; both Fletcher and his wife expressed a great partiality for me, and I became a frequent visitor at their house. They introduced me to a Mr. Stokes; and represented him as a gentleman holding a situation in the Bank of England. Some time after my intimacy at Fletcher's, Mr. Fletcher and Stokes solicited me to go to the Bank; they said, if I would only sign my same and address for them as a bondswoman, they would and did give me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I wrote more than signing my names and went to the Bank, I think more than once, with them both, and to the Commons'; I did not understand the business at all; Fletcher and Stokes took the money in their possession, that was paid at the Bank, and afterwards went to an inn, with a Mr. Pizey, (or Pizley,) who acted with them at the Bank, Mrs. Fletcher, and myself; after a long conversation between Fletcher, Stokes, and Pisey, the latter left us; we then got into a coach, and returned to Mr. Fletcher's residence, in the London-road. I gave the money I received from their, to my mother; I was at that time living with her, also my sister Mrs. Saunders, and her husband; neither of them knew that I had any money at all given to me by Fletcher; I remained on terms of friendship with Fletchers, for some time; I cannot speak of dates with any certainty, but I know it continued up to the first Christmas following the trial Mr. Fletcher induced me to enter against Mr. Taylor, for breach of promise of marriage.—After exchanging visits with them, Mr. and Mrs. Fletcher said to my mother and myself, they could do much better for us than my being in the Pantheon. On our inquiring how, they said that Mr. Fletcher had a friend in the Bank of England that enabled him to get money, and he could get some for us; we again asked, in what manner, but they did not explain, beyond Mr. Fletcher observing to my mother, that if she would place herself under his instruction and direction, he would do well for her, and asked her if she would do as be wished in, every thing; she said she would, after Fletcher saying he would guarantee that she should do nothing but what was right; Fletcher, after this, explained what he meant by saying there were a great many sums of money in the Bank of England without any claimants, which was in the hands of the Commissioners, and as there were no relatives. left to claim it, it belonged as much to the public as to them, therefore he would represent her as a relation to some person deceased, who had left money unclaimed, and one of the clerks, who stood high in the Bank, would supply him with all the information requisite to take the money; Fletcher then men<lb/>tioned the name of Stewart, and said, that a man of that name had been dead some years, and left a sum of money, which by my mother being represented as Stewart's relation, could be easily obtained, but that she must place herself entirely under his direction, and leave her home for a short time to go to a lodging winch he would prepare for her; my mother assented, and promised to do as Fletcher directed. He asked, if I knew of any friend that would take care of any letters that might come through the post, directed to a Mr. Jones; I mentioned Miss Hawkes, and afterwards asked her, if she would take care of such letters, if directed to her care; she said the would, and the letters she brought to me, I gave, unopened, to Mr. Fletcher; I do not, on ever did know, their contents; I went to—the Bank of England with Mr. and Mrs.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080060"/>
               <p>Fletcher; Mrs. Fletcher waited with me in the Rotunda, while Mr. Fletcher went to look for his friend; whilst he was gone, the gentleman passed us; when Mr. Fletcher returned, Mrs. Fletcher told him Mr. Christmas had passed us, and we pointed to the office he went in; Fletcher went after him; after being absent some time, he returned, and we left the Bank together, Fletcher observing, I might be sure the gentleman I had seen would not risk the high situation he held, by giving information for him (Fletcher) to act on, if it were not legal. Fletcher took a lodging for my mother, at a shop in Southampton-place, (or terrace) Camberwell, in the name of Stewart, and my mother went and lived there in such name, and I, by Fletcher's direction, visited my mother as her niece. He said, he would not do any thing for me, if I did not give up my business in the Pantheon; that if I would do so, he would establish me, with his daughter, in some first-rate business at the West-end; I consulted with my mother about it, and she thought it best for me to do as he wished; therefore, I disposed of my stock in the best manner I could, and quitted the Pantheon, relying solely on Mr. Fletcher's promise of doing better for me. To revert to my mother's case, Fletcher expressed his regret at not having a person at command, who would say, that he or she had for a con<lb/>siderable time known my mother as Miss Stewart, and sister to the deceased, and, in other respects, to establish my mother's identity as such; on my asking him how he did not know of such a person, he said the fact was, he had employed all the persons he could in that way; that during the period of our not being on friendly terms, he had two rich cases, in one of which he was the principal, and, in the other, he had only a share, but that he realized a large sum of money by them; that a man named Briggs, and his wife, were the parties employed to take the cases; Fletcher said he had taken lodgings for Mary Briggs the wife, and mentioned those cases, to assure my mother that she was not endangering herself in any way. On my mother saying to Fletcher she knew a poor man, a tailor, that was much reduced in circum<lb/>stances; he said, tell him you will give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to identify you as Miss Stewart, and sister to the deceased Stewart. He (Fletcher) wrote out an account for my mother, to make herself perfectly acquainted with, and desired her to give it to Griffin after she had done so, that he might know what to say as to the particulars of the matter; at the same time, he said, she was to strongly impress on the mind of Griffin a belief, that Stewart was my mother's family name. Mr. Griffin lived in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square; my mother subsequently saw Griffin, the man now in custody on this charge, and made the proposition to him, which he accepted; she told Fletcher, that Griffin was quite willing to the proposal; he (Fletcher) then said, that was all he required, as Mr. Barber and himself would manage all the rest; I cannot say how long the case was in hand; Fletcher was fearful my mother would not live to go through the business; he took her medicine nearly every morning; she was then seventy-one or seventy-two years of age; I do not know of any other inquiries made, respecting the case, but those I have stated. The money was obtained, and Fletcher gave my mother between 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her trouble; I heard nothing further of the matter, except that the legacy duty was not paid, although it had been invested in the hands of Barber, the solicitor, to do so at the time. An official communication was made to Griffin, some time after, from Somerset House, upon which he came to me to know what to do; I said he had better take it to Barber, the solicitor; I gave him half-a-sovereign for his loss of time. Previous to my mother quit<lb/>ting the lodgings at Camberwell, Mr. Fletcher said he should not consent to my mother's returning again to Rathbone-place; therefore, much against her inclination and my own, I took a lodging in Tottenham-court-road; I do not recollect the number; it was a carver and gilder's shop, on the right-hand side</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080061"/>
               <p>of the road from Oxford-street; I am the only person that visited her, while the remained there; she was so unhappy, I told Fletcher I should have her home; he reluctantly consented, after she had been there about a fortnight or three weeks. In Stewart's business, I gave to Mr. Griffin ten sovereigns; I took them to his lodging in Duke-street, and gave them into his own hand; five from Fletcher, and five from my mother. Soon after this, I removed from Rathbone-place, to live in Tottenham-court-road; the Fletchers were then living in Southampton-place, Camberwell; I spent much time with them; he was our only friend and adviser; he frequently said he interested himself as much in my welfare as he could do for his own daughter."</p>

                  </hi>. I am gardener and beadle of Nelson-square, and have been so eight years last July. I recollect Mr. Barber residing in the square more than seven years—I think he resided at No. 52—the brass plate now produced was upon that door till within the last year or nine months—it was taken off when the house was under repair—(<hi rend="italic">"Mr. W. H. Barber, solicitor" was on the plate</hi>—I knew some of his clerks—Mr. Barber held his office there during the earliest portion of the time—I know a clerk named Peckham very well indeed—he came to the office every morning, I believe—if there had been any inquiries for Mr. Peckham, I should immediately have gone to Mr. Barber's to seek him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now managing clerk to Mr. Bramhall, a soli<lb/>citor, No. 5, Verulam-buildings, Gray's Inn—I was managing clerk to Mr. Barber—I went to him on 10th Feb. 1837, and continued in his employ up to the January of this year, about three weeks after his arrest—I had access to Mr. Barber every day while he was in custody, during that three weeks—I remember the parties from the Bank coming to see his papers—during that three weeks no alteration whatever had been made as to the position of these papers, with the exception of looking out such letters as were advised by Mr. Barber's attorney, and copies being made of them, all of which have been pro<lb/>duced to-day—I remember the case of Elizabeth Stewart being brought to Mr. Barber's office—at that time there were two clerks in the office directly employed by Mr. Barber, and a messenger—there was a gentleman having offices in the same house, whose business Mr. Barber had purchased, and whose clerks salaries were also paid by Mr. Barber, and who had to do his business, when required—I think there were five or six besides a messenger—this business of Stewart's was conducted in the office precisely in the same open way in which other business was done—a clerk who managed the business kept a diary of the transactions carried on there, and Mr. Barber also—I have carefully looked over that diary, in reference to this transaction, to see what entries were made by myself—this is the diary—here is an entry of 25th August,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080063"/>
               <p>1840, in my own handwriting—I made it at Mr. Barber's dictation, or from being told by him to what effect to write—at the time I made that entry I was perfectly acquainted with the events of which it is a short history, and if Mr. Barber gave the names wrongly, in the hurry of dictation, I altered them as the fact was—I very well remember Mr. Fletcher attending at Mr. Barber's office that day—I did not hear what his errand was—this diary is for the year 1840, and during that year it was always on Mr. Barber's desk, ready to be entered daily—it was open to the inspection of everybody—it was a book of access and reference—Mr. Bircham was not a partner at that time—it was open to his inspection when he became a partner—I observe two hand<lb/>writings of clerks in the diary, and that of Mr. Barber—James Macnamara is the other clerk—I cannot speak as to the number of times Mr. Fletcher attended at Mr. Barber's office, between 25th August and 23rd Oct.—I saw him coming frequently, sometimes daily, but I took no particular notice—he had been a client of Mr. Barber's since the autumn of 1838, or the spring of 1839—but with reference to Mr. Fletcher's calls, I should observe, a call-book is kept in the office, by which, the moment a gentleman appeared in the office, his name is put down by a clerk, and that book is here—every time any client called his name would be immediately entered by one of the clerks—that was a task generally performed by Mr. Macnamara—during the time I was in the office, Mr. Barber transacted very considerable business for Mr. Fletcher—it was not so extensive, but it was rather heavy business—actions for demurrage and freight, mortgages, rent-charges, and various things—it was what we call the superior business of a client—I was on very intimate terms with Mr. Barber, during the whole time I was his clerk—he treated me more as a son than a clerk—I never in my life saw Mr. Fletcher in his company, except at his office—he was so proud, that I had particular instructions never to assume any familiarity—I never discovered or saw any familiarity between Mr. Barber and Mr. Fletcher—there was a greater coldness towards Mr. Fletcher than any other client—Mr. Fletcher was rather repulsive in his manner, and Mr. Barber did not court him—I remember Mr. Barber going to Great Marlow very well indeed—I did not go with him—I made an entry in the diary at his dictation, a day or two before he went, of his intention to go, and I know of his absence from the office on that day—I remember the months of May and June preceding the 1st of Oct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now during the whole of those two months was Mr. Barber absent for a day from the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On one occasion he and I were at Rochester together, with the exception of that one day he certainly was not absent from the office during the whole of those two months—Mr. Barber's effects have been sold since this, both at his private house and his office—they were sold to defray the rent—Mr. Bramhall has conducted his defence gratuitously—several other friends have supplied funds to pay counsel's fee.</p>

ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first go to Mr. Barber's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 10th of February, 1837—I was never articled to him, I was to have been—I continued in his service from the 10th of Feb. up to Nov. 1839, when I left him to go into a large office for two months—I then returned to him, and have been with him ever since—I think it was in Nov., 1839, that I left him, and went into the office of Taylor, Sharp, and Field, Bedford-row—I cannot give the precise date, I think it was about the 16th of Nov.—I returned, I think, about the 19th of Jan. 1840—I have been in his service ever since, down to the time of his apprehension, without any intermission—I know a person named Hartung, a German—at least, I did know him when he was a client, I think about 1839—I called on him at the time I was at Taylor, Sharp, and Field's—I had some dispute with Mr. Barber's servant, in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080064"/>
               <p>consequence of slamming a door—he gave me some unkind word, and I left him, this situation offering on the same day—the servant's name was Charlotte Gallard, I think—Mr. Barber is unmarried, he never has been married that I am aware of, I never heard of any wife, certainly none ever lived with him—he had no wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the time you were absent from Mr. Barber's, did you not say to Mr. Hartung that if you chose you could hang Mr. Barber? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, no—I heard, through Mr. Barber, that such a statement had reached his ears, I was disgusted at it, and immediately wrote to Mr. Fresh field, emphatically denying it, that it was a gross falsehood—I believe somebody had told Mr. Barber—I heard it at the Mansion-house from Mr. Barber—I most certainly swear I did not make that statement—this is not the only transaction with Mr. Fletcher relating to the proving of wills—there are several others relating to the same business as the wills, relating to unclaimed dividends—there have been three of these transactions besides this, which form the subject of other in<lb/>dictments—there was another before, I think, or very nearly contemporaneous with this, which has not been made the subject of an indictment—those were the only ones that I am aware of—Oh, by the bye, I beg your pardon, there was another; there was one in which Mr. Bramhall, my present employer, received about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from unclaimed dividends, for which he was very thankful—that was an affair between Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Barber—Mr. George Robins, the auctioneer, was the party who died, leaving the dividends unclaimed—altogether there were three transactions besides this, forming the subject of an indictment—there was one, I think, before, or if not before contemporaneous with these certainly; and there was another, Robins' matter—I do not know at this moment of any other—that is six, I think—Mr. Fletcher was concerned in all those—there were others besides, in which Mr. Fletcher has not been concerned, I believe—I do not know when they began—I mentioned that because you were so anxious in your inquiry, and Mr. Barber's instructions are, that every thing should be stated—he has not given me instructions as to the manner in which I should give evidence—I have been instructing Mr. Wilkins in this case—Mr. Bircham became a partner. either on the 17th or 21st of Dec, 1841—Mr. Barber generally came to the office of a morning about a quarter past nine—he was generally there before anybody—up to the latter end of Nov., his office was at his residence, 52, Nelson-square—just at the time of my leaving him, he changed his office to Tokenhouse-yard—when I returned to him at the beginning of 1840, his office was in Tokenhouse-yard—he continued to reside at 52, Nelson-square, up to his apprehension—his office hours at Tokenhouse-yard were from half-past nine; he staid till half-past five, himself, and I was generally there till half-past six—I lived with my father at that time, on the Buildings, at Apothecaries hall—he has been there thirty years—I did not live in Nelson-square, but I used to be there about three nights a week, and spend the evening with him; to read and write, and enter up his diary—he had no family at that time that I know of—I have continued my intimacy with him up to this day—he has, I think, two children, but I do not know that they are his children, by any means—I never heard him say so, it was only from popular report I heard it—they never lived in the house with him—I was not aware of his having two children; it was too delicate a subject for me to talk to him about—I am perfectly aware that no birth ever took place in his house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Except as to popular report, did you ever know Mr. Barber had any children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By no means—my father is the head assistant in the warehouse of the Apothecaries' Company—he has been on the Com<lb/>pany's buildings I think about thirty years—Mr. Hartung is a client who got</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080065"/>
               <p>very angry with Mr. Barber, because he sent him in rather a heavy bill—he has often said he would like to hang Mr. Barber—I never said I could hang him—there were all together six of these transactions—the one not the subject of an indictment was a claim of about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the representatives of a person named Smith, in which Messrs. Lawrence and Blenkiron, of Bucklersbury, were concerned for the parties—Mr. Barber merely gave the information through Mr. Fletcher—the other matter, which we called in the office "Robins's matter," was a claim to about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. unclaimed dividends, standing in the name of Mr. George Robins—Mr. Barber communicated with the trustees, and I believe the property was recovered—Mr. Bramhall has frequently told me so—he got his information from Fletcher in that case, and the money has since been paid into the Court of Chancery—I used to go home three evenings in the week with Mr. Barber, to read letters that came, to draft answers, make up the diary, prepare business for the following day, and take his instructions upon those matters which I was attending to, which I could not consult him about in the office from the hurry of business.</p>

               <p>respect to some stock in the name of Slack—I cannot speak for a few weeks—I am not sure of the amount of the stock I told him of, but I think 3500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or thereabouts, in the Consolidated Three per cents.—I told him it was standing in the name of Ann Slack—I did not at that time give him any other description of Ann Slack than the name; but some little time after, upon the second inquiry, I gave him the description of Smith-street, Chelsea, the description that was in the books of the Bank—some time after Fletcher showed me a letter—I cannot say at what time, but I think it might be some few months after—two months possibly, or more—I cannot say ex<lb/>actly—I think it was thereabouts, but I speak from a very imperfect recol<lb/>lection—he said he gave me that letter to satisfy me as to the identity of the party who he had found out to be the owner of the stock, solely for that purpose (<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I do not remember the contents of the letter particularly, but I think I remember to have seen this signature—I think this is the letter—I compared this signature with this power of attorney, and the books of the Bank—after having done so I saw Fletcher again—I do not know how soon—I am not quite sure whether it might not be in the course of a day or two—to the best of my recollection I told him I thought there was something in the style of the writing, but I thought it a lighter hand; a younger hand, or something to that effect—I forget now the term I used—the letter was the lighter—I think a very considerable time elapsed before I heard anything at all about it again—I believe the next observation I heard from him about it was, that Miss Ann Slack, of Abbotts Langley, was not the person he supposed to be the proprietor, for she had never lived at Chelsea—I understood she had stated so—I do not think anything more passed with respect to it till the probate was brought in and registered.</p>

In 1842, I was a clerk at the King's Langley station, on the Birmingham Railroad—I recollect two persons coming in the latter part of Sept. 1842, to make enquiry about a family of the name of Slack—the pri<lb/>soner Fletcher is one of those persons—I do not know who the other was—I have no belief on the subject—they made inquiries of me—Fletcher inquired if there was any lady of the name of Slack, or a family residing in the neigh­bourhood of the name of Slack—I believe it was a lady—I named the family of the Slacks, of Manor-house—I then said there was a Miss Slack residing with Captain and Mrs. Foskett—Fletcher asked me if I knew the Christian name of the lady—I said Ann Slack, and that Mrs. Foskett was her sister—he asked me if the name of Ann was spelt Ann or Anne—I referred to a book of parcels delivery, and it was Ann—they, (I do not remember which, Fletcher, I believe,) asked me if I knew that she ever resided in Chel<lb/>sea—I said I did not know—I believe that was all the conversation I had—Mr. John Slack lives in the neighbourhood—he lives at the Manor-house—I gave them the particulars of Mr. John Slack's family, and Fletcher said</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live in Lincoln's-inn-fields. On the 17th of Dec, 1842, I accompanied Captain Foskett to the office of Barber and Bircham, in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, and had an interview with Mr. Barbar—Mr. Barber said he could give some information relative to some pro<lb/>perty—he stated, that he was enquiring relative to the representatives of Ann Slack—Captain Foskett gave him some information relative to Miss Slack—he said the description Captain Foskett gave coincided very much with the party for whom they were enquiring; but there was a discrepancy which could be cleared, if he could have Miss Slack's handwriting to compare with some document—I believe he mentioned documents—he did not mention what they were—I do not recollect anything particular that passed beyond that—Captain Foskett afterwards consulted me on the propriety of giving the hand. Writing, and a note was written by Miss Slack, purporting to be addressed to myself—this is the note, it was forwarded to me by Captain Foskett, to be given to Mr. Barber—I took it to Mr. Barber on the 22nd of Dec—I saw him—I merely left it with him—nothing passed—I received this letter two days after from Mr. Barber, enclosing Miss Slack's note.</p>

On the 8th of April I have entered some notes to the amount of 1530<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as being cashed—I received them from John Miller—among them was one for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not take the number or date—I entered the name at the back, which was Slack—if a bundle of notes are brought to me, I enter the numbers of the first and last note, not the intermediate ones—the intermediate ones are identified by a number printed on them—the No. 401 is printed on these—this 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, No. 91767, was in the bundle I took that day—I know it by a mark on the outside—I received them from Miller; be cashed them, and took an account of them—the number is entered in my book—it was paid for gold—Miller pays nothing but gold.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">Y</hi> ou did not mention that, I think? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—it was then I told him what is here—he said that on the occasion of my pressing him with the fact that he had been negociating on the subject of this pro<lb/>perty six months before his client had come to him—it was in reference to that—I put that point strongly.</p>

On the 19th of March before two o'clock in the morning, I heard a noise, and went to the window—I saw a cart standing at Mr. Johnston's premises—there was one man in the cart, and two or three out of it—I had not time to distinguish their faces—they threw a box on the shaft of the cart, and one inside—the men who were out<lb/>side lifted or threw it in—the man on the cart took the reins and drove off quickly, and the men walked off.</p>

I went to Mr. Johnston's, at seven o'clock in the morning, of the 19th of March, and made inquiry at the turnpike, I received information from Hathaway, and went to search in Dean-street—I knew that the prisoner lived there—it is about 400 yards from the turnpike—I went to a shed there, and found a cart—I called for Gummer—he came down stairs—I told him I had come to take him for being concerned with others in stealing cigars from Mr. Johnston—he said, "Very well"—he went up stairs—I followed him, and said he must go with me—he said, "Very well"—I told him of the cigars being stolen, and that his cart went through Whitechapel-gate about two o'clock—he said he had lent his cart to two men who took two of his rooms, to remove some goods, that he let the cart about twelve at night—I asked who the men were—he said he did not know them—I said it was late to let out a horse and cart to people he did not know—he said he should not have done it, only he had been drinking—I searched about the house, and did not find anything at first—I went with him to the station, and left Johnston there with two officers.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's-hospital On the 25th of Feb., Coventry was brought to the hospital bleeding, from a wound on the right side of the cheek, about an inch long, and of consider<lb/>able depth, and from one, on the inner side of the left arm, between four and five inches long, it went nearly down to the bone—they were certainly severe wounds—I saw nothing on the eye, the wound on the cheek was about an inch below the eye—a chisel would have produced the wounds—the one on the arm was a clean cut wound—I should think it would require a good deal of force to make that—he was in the hospital, I think, about a fortnight—that was quite necessary—he bled freely, but not profusely—I stitched up the wound in the arm—I simply applied cold wet lint to the other wound, without stitching it—the danger of such a wound, would depend very much on the constitution of the person, and treatment afterwards—it would depend a good deal on, whether it would produce erysipelas, or go off in a natural way and heal by the first intention—he was healthy, and it went on very favourably.</p>

On the 2nd of April, about eleven o'clock, I was engaged at Mr. Williams's, at the end of Cock and Castle-lane—I had been at Mr. Rhodes's brick-field, to cover the bricks from the frost—there is no pathway through the field—no one had any business there except those in Mr. Rhodes's employ—the pri<lb/>soner came up to me and said, "Halloo, what do you do here? you have got some one else with you"—I said no, I had not; there was the straw which I sat on, it would not take him long to look at it—the prisoner then knocked my hat off—I told him, if he did not let me alone, I would send for some one to put him out of my field—I meant my master, Mr. Joseph Banks, Mr. Rhodes's foreman—on that the prisoner hit me, then knocked me down; and as I was getting up again I picked up a small piece of brick, or a stone, and threw it at him—he then knocked me down again, and beat me about the head with his fist while I was down—he said nothing else—it was about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve—when he left me I was not sensible—I am getting a great deal better now, and hope you will have mercy on him—I had known him previously—he had nothing to do with the</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">surgeon, North-place, Ball's-pond.</hi> On Tuesday morning, the 2nd of April, I was called to attend the prosecutor—I found him bleed<lb/>ing profusely from three wounds, two on the lower left eyelid, and one on the right lower eyelid, but that was a very trifling wound; those on the left were about one-eighth or one-tenth of an inch in length, and about three-quarten of an inch in depth—his head was extremely tumefied from extravasation of blood, his eyes having bled—measures were adopted to relieve him—he was in a state of torpidity from concussion of the brain—they were rugged lacer<lb/>ated wounds, and were done by some obtuse substance; probably it might be done with the knuckles pressed violently—they might be inflicted with a brick; I cannot undertake to swear they were—it was supposed that he was likely to die from the concussion of the brain—the Magistrate, Mr. Coombe, came down in the evening, about six o'clock, to take the deposition of the man, when partial sensibility was restored—he is not well yet; he is under my care now—in time the eye will recover, but the maxillary bone is still much hurt—there is still chronic inflammation about the eye—blood has been ab<lb/>stracted, and incisions have been made to take away the blood which has been effused—he had a very violent beating indeed—the wound on the eye might probably have been done with a nail.</p>

On the morning of the 9th of April, about ten minutes past seven o'clock, I concealed myself in the parlour—Garrett came home from work—the first thing he did was to go to the salt meat tub, and take out the salt meat till he came to this piece with a piece of fat—he laid all the others on the salt beef tray—he laid this on the block till he had finished taking all the others up, and then laid it on the top of it, with the pork—he came and looked into the parlour, to see if he could see any one, and when be found be could see no one, he sent the boy out for some coffee; then he went to this beef, brought it up, put it on the scale board with, the fat; then went behind the door, took a piece of neck of mutton, and laid that also with "the beef—he then took a large cloth, went to the same place, took out a large piece of suet, and concealed it in the cloth—he then" took three pieces of flap of mut<lb/>ton, and laid it on the scale-board; Dunford then came in, opened his basket and Garrett put all the meat into it but the flap of mutton—he then put the flap of mutton in the scale, and then in the man's basket; and the moment he was putting the hammer through the end of it, I, said, "Stop, I will have no more of this game carried on"—I shut the street door, and shut both the prisoners in—I sent the servant to call my brother—Garrett then said he had done nothing wrong—I said, "This does not look like it—he had weighed none of it—I said I had seen him do it repeatedly.</p>

Travers—I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1837, when he was in the 12th regiment of Lancers at Hounslow—I saw him again last Dec—I was then living at Brigh<lb/>ton in service—he told me he had left his regiment, and promised to marry me—he staid at Brighton a little time—I left my place and came to London with him—I packed my own wearing apparel in three boxes, and went to the Roebuck in Tooley-street—I left my boxes there in charge of the prisoner to take care of for me while I went to visit my friends—I went on the 21st of Feb., and returned on the 27th—while I was away I received this letter from the prisoner—I know it is in his handwriting (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" London, Feb. 1844.—You will be surprised to hear what has happened; since you have left London I Was taken by one of our men, and only for treating him well for three days I should have lost my liberty; I was compelled to pledge all your things for the money, and in consequence will leave London, for fear of your trying to have me taken. I will stop only till you write, so that I may send you all the duplicates; but I will be very cautious about going where I have directed your letter to come, as I am in great fear. Direct to me at the Hare and Hounds, Islington, I dare not presume any more, but ask pardon, and will, as soon as I get work in some other town, send the money to roe-lease them. I remain still yours, &amp;c. C. <hi rend="smallCaps">CLAIR</hi>."—I went to the Roe-buck—the prisoner was gone—I afterwards found him in custody, and charged him with having robbed me—he said he would redeem all my things for me again—I never authorised him to pledge or dispose of this property—they</p>

I am a widow, and live at Kensall-green—the pri<lb/>soner is my grandson—he lost his mother when he was about three years old—I and my late husband brought him up—he married about two years ago, and ceased to live with me—he was brought up as a carpenter, and I allowed him to occupy an outhouse of mine as a workshop—before this matter hap<lb/>pened, he used sometimes to come pretty often, and sometimes stay away a long while—a young man and his sister lodged in my front parlour, and my servant occupied the kitchen—on the night of 29th of Feb. I retired to bed, with Snell, about nine o'clock, or a little before—I locked the kitchen<lb/>door, and took the key up stairs—I had used a comb before I went to bed, and put it into a table-drawer in the kitchen—there were three silver tea<lb/>spoons, three brass candlesticks, a Dutch clock, and a comb, safe when I went to bed—next morning Snell came up stairs—I went down stairs, and found the place had been broken open, and these things gone—there is a shutter to the kitchen window—it was made for a room up stairs, and the pri<lb/>soner had altered it for the kitchen window, four or five years back—he would know the shutter very well—I informed the police—two or three days after, the prisoner came, about eight in the evening—I was very much alarmed, and told him I felt very ill—I asked him to go for a doctor—I said that for the purpose of sending for a policeman—after he was gone, I sent for a police<lb/>man, who came directly—the prisoner returned—he was searched, and this comb found—I have had it five or six years—it is the one I had safe on the</p>

I was with her in the kitchen—we went to bed between eight and nine o'clock—I locked the door, and gave the key to Mrs. Todd—it was my usual custom—I slept with Mrs. Todd that night, and got the key from her—when I came down to the kitchen, about seven o'clock, I unlocked the door—there was some resistance from something placed against it inside—I found the shutter down and the window open—when I went to bed it was fastened as it usually was—the window was down, the shutter shut, and bolted with two little brass bolts—I did not observe any marks of violence, except that the two pieces of wood that supported the upper sash were taken out from outside—we had three tea spoons in use down stairs—we had used two of them the night before, and the third was in the mus<lb/>tard-pot in the cupboard—a Dutch clock was gone in the morning before I had combed Mrs. Todd's hair, not the night before—I saw it safe in the morn<lb/>ing, and put it into the table drawer with the brush—I found the comb was gone—the prisoner had not been there that day—there had been no one there that day that I know of that would have taken the comb—we had no visitors.</p>

Ferry lives in George-street, Shoreditch, Eglinton keeps a chandler's shop in Blossom-street, Norton-falgate, Jordan lives in Star<lb/>alley, Fenchurch-street—I have seen Jordan and Eglinton together frequently—about a quarter past one o'clock, on the 11th of March, I saw Jordan leave his house in Star-alley, and go up White Lion-street, Norton-falgate—Eglinton was standing at the corner of White Lion-street—Jordan passed by him without taking the least notice of him—I had seen them together before that day, at Eglinton's house—Jordan turned up Blossom-street and went into Eglinton's house—at the time Jordan passed Eglinton he pointed his hand along White Lion-street, and Perry was crossing from the City of London Theatre—I should say he could see Eglinton when he was crossing—Eglinton went into a public-house, and Perry directly after him—that was all I saw that day—about one o'clock, on the 19th of March, I saw Perry leave Bow Church-yard, where the pro-secutor's warehouse is—I followed him to the Black Dog in Long-alley, Moorfields—he went in at a sort of private entrance they call the "bottle de<lb/>partment"—he remained there nearly five minutes, and came out with Eglinton—they parted in Crown-street, and Perry went along Long-alley—on the 23rd I saw Perry leave Bow Church-yard, about twenty-five minutes past eight o'clock in the morning—I followed him down Bow-lane—he went into a coffee<lb/>shop in Great St. Thomas the Apostle—he afterwards came out and went down Garlick-hill—I continued having my eye on the coffee-shop in Great St. Thomas the Apostle—I saw Eglinton come out of the same coffee­house and go towards his house—I went to the Plough, in Plough-yard, Shore-ditch—after I had been there a little while Perry came in and went into the tap-room—she remained in a few minutes, and then Eglinton came out, and then Perry—they parted about the door-way—I then went after Eglinton and took him—I told him I was a City of London policeman, I should take him for receiving stolen property belonging to Mr. Sutton, of Bow Church­yard, from Perry the porter to the firm—he said, "I never received any stolen property that I am aware of, or yet to my knowledge"—I searched the house, No. 9, Star-alley, Fenchurch-street (I had seen Jordan go in and come out of that house on several occasions) I found three boxes of Scots' pills with this writing on them as it is now, "William Sutton and Son, late Dicey and Son, Bow Church-yard."</p>

About two months ago there was a barrow outside my master's shop—about a quarter to ten o'clock at night I was sent to take it down to the factory—as I went I trod on a bundle of fat outside the factory-gate, about the middle of the court—I put my hand down to the bundle, and found it was fat—I took the barrow into the factory—after the prisoner had shut up that night, I saw him come down the court and take up the bundle of fat—he put it on his shoulder, and I fol<lb/>lowed him with it to a little court facing his house, in Little Earl-street—I then went home—I knew he lodged in the front room on the first floor, at No. 6, Little Earl-street—I think there was about half a hundred weight of fat in the bundle—the prisoner was at the time employed in the factory in melting—there was fat in the factory.</p>

I was called on Sunday evening, the 24th of March, to this child—it appeared to have come by its death by drowning—I have no doubt at all about that—the usual means were resorted to to restore it, but in vain—I inspected the body after it was opened—it was a perfectly healthy child in every respect, and a remarkably fine child as ever I saw in my life—every part of the viscera was perfectly healthy, and every part was firm and strong—I am not a parish doctor, nor connected with any parish Union.</p>

On the 1 1th of Nov. last I bought four bills of exchange, on Hamburg, for them—on the next day I enclosed those bills in a letter, which I sealed with my seal, and addressed it to Messrs. Bolte and Co., Bremen, and, being indisposed, I sent my boy with the letter to the post-office—this was on Sunday, the 12th of Nov.—I have had communications since from Bremen on the subject of these bills—this is one of the bills (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) that I enclosed in the letter—I am very well acquainted with the houses of business in Paris, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184404080210"/>
               <p>I have inquired; there is no such firm as Bolte and Co., at Paris—this bill is not in the same state as when I sent it; a false indorsement has been added to it, which follows my indorsement to "Bolte and Co., Bremen"—"Pay to the order of Mr. H. W. Albert, value in account. Paris, 30 Nov. 1843. Bolte and Co."—I indorsed it "In account," because I had an ac<lb/>count with Bolte and Co.; and now this false indorsement is "Value in ac<lb/>count," as if Bolte and Co. had some account with Mr. Albert; that is very wrong—these other two bills (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) are part of the same purchase, and have my indorsement the same as the other—here is on one of them, "H.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was about four yards off; she said, "A boy has taken my purse," and she collared me; I had nothing on me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He had not moved from the spot, I turned round directly it was taken—I am certain he it the person—I did not lose sight of him.</p>

Sutton and Co."—he said, "You must be mistaken; I know Sutton and Dicey well, and have laid out hundreds of pounds with them; I will give you my address, Nicholas-street, Hoxton, and No. 9, Star-alley, Fenchurch-street, where I sleep"—he said he might be found when wanted—I told him he must come with me—he said, "Young man, listen to me, and I will be a father to you"—I told him I had no desire to hear any thing he had to say—he said he had a relation in a dying state who he wished to see, and if I wanted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at any time I could have it—I told him I could not listen to any such proposal, he must come to Moor-lane station—he said, "Very well"—on our road he said he had known Eglin<lb/>ton for years—I had not mentioned Eglinton to him—I said, "I have not mentioned any name"—he said, "No, I thought you saw me come out of his house"—he said, Saturday being a busy day it would inconvenience him a good deal, but he would go to Sutton's if I liked.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a linendraper, and live in High-street, Deptford, in partnership with my brothers. The prisoner was in our shop on the 30th of March, and I received information—I told the young man to go on serving her and let her go—after he had served her she was attracted to the other tide of the shop by a young man who was folding some shawls—I got into conversation with her, and invited her to come out and look at our window, which she did—I said there was one article I should like her to see—I took her again into the shop to another part—I then jumped over the counter, and said my young man told me she had got some handkerchiefs, and asked if she had any objection to be searched—she said "No"—I said to my young man, "Are you sure she has got the handkerchiefs?"—he said, "Yes, I will show you the same pattern in another colour "—these handkerchiefs were then lying at the prisoner's feet—I am sure they had not been there before—that part was three or four yards from where she stood at first—they are mine.</p>

On the 14th of March, a little after ten o'clock in the evening, the prisoner and another woman came to look at some handkerchiefs—while I was showing them some, my attention was aroused by seeing the prisoner try to draw the handkerchiefs from the counter—she then asked for some lighter ones, and while I was going to fetch them I communicated it to my employer, who told me to go on and serve her—I returned with the light handkerchief?, and the prisoner left the other woman, to decide on the handkerchief—I then saw the prisoner draw the handkerchiefs off the counter—shortly after she stooped, and I sup<lb/>posed picked them up, she made a wry face, as if she had a pain in her leg—after that she had some ribbon, which she gave to the other woman—Mr. John Smith was at the desk, and took the cash—he asked if I was certain about the matter, and I looked behind the counter and missed the handkerchiefs—these are the handkerchiefs I saw her draw from the counter—I swear to them—she was then invited by a young man on the opposite side to see some shawls, and then Mr. Wade took her outside—I looked at the place where she had been, and nothing was there—I looked at her dress, and nothing was clinging to it—she was brought back, and a place was cleared for her to go to—Mr. Wade said, "My young man has missed some handkerchiefs, will you allow me to search you?"—they said "Yes "—he searched the other woman first—I then saw the handkerchiefs on the ground in a crumpled state.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. I was disturbed that morning—I went down, and found the prisoner is the kitchen—he slept in a room opposite the stable, which is one staircase above the kitchen—he said that three men had entered his bed-room window, that he had followed them down into the kitchen, and, as he entered, he was knocked down; that he rose up, and was knocked down again, and, on his calling for help, they ran away—I saw the poker, which he attracted my notice to, lying on the floor, nearly bent double—he said one of the men struck at him with it, but had missed him—I did not observe any marks of violence on him, as if he had been knocked down—I went down the moment I heard the cry—be<lb/>tween my hearing it, and going down, he had not time to go up stairs and put on his stockings and trowsers.</p>

I have been keeping company with the prisoner nearly two years—on the 3rd of April, about half-past nine o'clock, he came to my mo<lb/>ther's house and stopped till half-past ten o'clock—when he left I followed him to close the door—he said he was going home to his mother's at Poplar on Thursday, and asked if I would write to him—I said I would by Mon<lb/>day or Tuesday—he wanted one before then, and asked if I had picked up with any body else while he was away—I said, "No"—he said was I going to give him up?—I said I was—he wished me good night and went away—he came again almost directly after, and knocked at the door—my mother opened it, and asked him to come in—he said no, he wanted to speak to Jane—I went out to him, and he said "You are going to leave me?"—I said, "Yes, George"—he said, "Oh you are, are you?" and he up and hit me with a knife across the neck—it was not a deep cut, it only just went through the skin—I was not much hurt—Mr. Downs attended me—I was going to give the prisoner up because he had got into bad company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had my arm on her shoulder; I was cutting my finger nails with a knife, and in putting my arm out to prevent her falling it scratched her neck. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He would not have done it, only he was in liquor; I believe it was not done intentionally, only to frighten me.</p>

                  </hi>. Last Wednesday night my daughter, who is a servant, came home about eight o'clock—the prisoner came about half-past nine o'clock, and stopped an hour or so—he was in liquor—I said, "George, we want to go to bed"—my husband had gone to bed—he jumped up and went out, and my daughter also—they had some words outside, and my daughter seemed very agitated when she came in—in two or three minutes he knocked at the door, and said he wanted to speak to Jane—he was very agitated, and looked very wild—I said, "George, come in"—he said, "No, I want to speak to Jane"—my daughter went out—in a few minutes I heard a scuffle, and heard her say, "Oh!" or "Oh mother!"—I jumped out of my chair, and saw her throat was cut and bleeding—I ran to the door and said, "Oh George, what have you done!"—I rushed in doors, bolted the door, ran up stairs and told my husband—he ran down in his shirt, and went to look for a policeman—a doctor was sent for—the prisoner had always be<lb/>haved very kindly before, and she is still very fond of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in the parish of Lewisham. On the night of the 19th of Feb. I was the last person up in the house—I went to bed about eleven o'clock—everything was then safe and fast—the skylight of the washhouse was quite safe—I came down about seven o'clock in the morn-ing—Dodd, my servant, gave me information—I keep the post-office—I found the post-bag opened, the letters taken out, opened, and torn; all my drawers open, and the things in them all out—I went to the washhouse, and found the lead-work and frame of the skylight completely removed—they had got in that way—the hinges were broken open, and the skylight entirely removed off—I know Bassett by his coming for dust occasionally—he had an opportunity of seeing the premises—he has been there several times.</p>

On the morning of the 2nd of March I heard cries of murder proceeding from the up-stairs window of Carroll's house—I heard people quarrelling very much—I went to the street-door, and demanded for the door to be opened—I did not see the prisoner at first, nor her husband—when I first saw the prisoner I said, "Mrs. Carroll, what have you got about? or what do you make this noise about? why don't you send for a policeman? if you cannot agree with this woman, have her taken up, don't ill use her like this"—Mrs. Carroll held two pair of boots in her hand, and said to the deceased, "When you pay me for my broken things I will give you your boots back, and not before "—the blood was then running down the left side of the deceased's neck from the back of the neck, and I saw a mark of a blow on her temple—it seemed a very heavy blow—the deceased had a fork in her hand—the prisoner's husband was standing by her side—the deceased beat the fork on the stairs, and called Mrs. Carroll very bad words indeed several times, and she said, "I wish it was one o'clock, for my husband to come home, I would have my revenge for beating me like this'—she addressed herself to Mr. and Mrs. Carroll—I did not see anything in Mr. Carroll's band—he might have had something, and I not see it—I went into my own room—I then heard the deceased woman repealing these bad words again, saying, "Don't strike me with a poker, I am not a man, I am a woman"—she addressed herself to Mr. Carroll—she said, "Mr. Carroll, don't strike me with a poker."</p>

I went down stairs, and Mr. Carroll followed me—in about half an hour the deceased came down stairs—I heard a quarrel about the boots and crockery between the deceased and Mr. and Mrs. Carroll—Mr. Carroll told her if she would replace the things she had broken he would give her the boots—they were then on a box in the room—a few minutes after, he com<lb/>plained that she had run the fork into his lip—I did not see any sign of that—the deceased had a fork in her hand, and was trying <hi rend="italic">to job</hi> it at him—I saw her <hi rend="italic">do</hi> that upon the landing, but did not see it strike him—there was a piece of broken long below stairs in his room where we were at this time—Carroll</p>

                  </hi>. I am the parish surgeon. About ten o'clock on Saturday morning, the 2nd of March, I was called in to see the deceased—both Mr. and Mrs. Carroll came to fetch me—they waited for me, and accom<lb/>panied me back—I examined the deceased, and observed she was bruised about the face—I did not observe that she had drank very much—I should think not—she was dead when I got there—I could not account for her death then—there were external bruises, but not sufficient—I opened her head on the Monday—externally there were marks of bruises over the left eye, and also a contused wound behind the right ear—on removing the scalp, there were large clots of blood effused, corresponding with the external marks—there was also evidence of blows being struck immediately behind the right ear—I should say that was not done with great violence—I saw the piece of tongs at the inquest—it may have been produced by that—a fist would not produce the wound behind the ear, it must have been something sharp—there was no wound on the temple, but three or four external bruises—in my judgment death was caused by concussion of the brain, produced by repeated blows—I should not think the blow behind the ear sufficient of itself, but, in combination with other circumstances, it would aid—it was the only wound—the other marks could be accounted for by blows from a fist or hand—if she</p>
