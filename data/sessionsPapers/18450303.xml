                  </hi>. I am landlord of the George and Vulture, George-yard. On Friday night, 10th Jan., I was in the hall, and heard screams—I opened the hall-door, then went to the hall on the opposite side of the passage, and found the two prisoners on the stairs with the last witness, all tumbling down stairs as hard as they could scramble—nobody was with me—the prisoners and the girl were on the staircase, and nobody else there—I collared them both, took them into the other hall, across the passage, and kept them in custody till the police came—they resisted—both used violence—I have not yet recovered the use of my thumb—Mr. Gatayes occupied this room—my house is in two parishes, but the part of the room in which the prisoners were first seen, and the door of the room, is in the parish of St. Edmund the King and Martyr, the door, the bed, and the chest of drawers, and the space between them—part of the room, is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill—it is generally the custom to lock the room No. 6—I had not seen the key hanging up previously—it always hangs in the bar, when the room is locked but if it is not locked, the last witness would have the key—I was present when Howell was searched at the station—a key was brought to my house by the police-inspector—I tried it myself to the door of No. 6—I did not mark the key, but it was one like this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—it opened No. 6—some rings are missing—we have had the room searched, and cannot find them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You know nothing about the rings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—we have a practice of hanging the keys up below—a guest could come and take his key, and unlock his room—when the servant called out, I saw Howell and Smith, about half way up the first flight of stairs, running down—there was no gentleman with me—one of the Waiters came out of the servants' hall, and was in the hall at the time, but I was at the foot of the stairs, and caught hold of them at the foot of the stairs—I swear I saw Howell half way up the stairs—a person could not have come in from the passage, and get there, after I heard the cry, without my seeing them, because I was on the alert—I had received information, and was waiting in the hall, in case anybody should come—I was close to the passage, and immediately crossed the passage into the other hall, to the foot of the stairs—the tavern is not a public thoroughfare—one entrance is in George-yard, the other in St. Michael's-alley—one in the parish of St. Michael's, Cornhill, the other in St. Edmund the King.</p>

I was in the room last before this transaction on the 10th of Jan., at half-past five o'clock—I came down and put the key in the bar—I had locked the room door on coming out of the room, and never went up again till half-past ten—I missed two rings which I had seen that morning in the drawer of my dressing-table—one was a snake ring, and the other a topaz—they were worth about two sovereigns.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you swear it was not the day before, and not that morning, that you had last seen the rings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was about ten or eleven the same morning—I put them into the drawer that same morning—I have worn them for ten years; but the snake ring was broken, and I put it off to have it mended—I did not wear the topaz so often—I never had an impression that it was the night before that I put them into the drawer—the snake ring was broken that morning—I was not asked that before—I have not seen them since—I recollect perfectly well lock<lb/>ing the door of the room that night, and taking the key down at half-past five, and putting the rings into the drawer—there was no lock on the toilet drawer.</p>

On the 10th of Jan., I was on the St. Paul's rank, Cheapside-end—about nine o'clock, or it might be ten minutes after, I was called off by the prisoner Franklin and the two others—I cannot swear to the other two prisoners, but believe they are the two—they told me to drive to the George and Vulture-yard, to pull up before I got to the George and Vulture-yard—I was told to stop in Lombard-street, which I did—one end of George-yard goes into Lombard-street—when I got there, two of them got out—I believe it was Smith and Howell—Franklin remained in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> for about twenty minutes—the two who got out went up George-yard—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a police-inspector. On the 10th of Jan. Mr. Warrener gave me five keys, which I gave to Burt—I saw Howell searched at the station, and some keys found on him—these are them—I locked them up at the station, and next morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, I tried one of them myself to the room No. 6—I got that key from the cupboard—I returned it to the cupboard again—I kept it till I gave it up to Burt.</p>

I made the ob<lb/>servation, which the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man states, that they were a long time; I walked up the yard, and heard the cry of "Stop thief!" I went and I followed the parties; several others were following; the policeman says there was no other person following; is it likely, that two persons should walk along in custody, without attracting the observation of a single individual? I say thirteen or fourteen persons were following; I was on the other ride of the way; if only Mr. Warrener and Fitzgerald were following, is it likely I should have been passing along there towards the station, if I was guilty? With regard to the bag found in my possession, I am a tailor, and use it in my trade to carry home my work in; I gave the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>

On Tuesday evening, the 24th of Dec, I made the doors of the shop fast about twenty minutes past eight o'clock—I returned to the shop about twenty minutes to eight on Thursday morning, and on going to open the shop door with the key I had locked it with, I could not; I was obliged</p>

               <p>to have a locksmith to open it—when I got in I found fifteen rollers bare, which had been covered with silk on Tuesday evening, and the coverings, which had been over them, under the stand—460 yards of silk, and 461 yards of linen were gone—I afterwards saw Shackell produce some of it at the shop.</p>

Soon after one o'clock, in the morning of the 28th of Jan., the body of the deceased was brought there—she was quite dead—I saw a mark on the left side of her neck—it was a black patch, spattered with blood and gunpowder, such a mark as I should expect to see from a pistol discharged close to the person, there was so much blood—there was a great deal of blood upon her clothes—I looked at her hands—there was no appearance of blood upon her hands, but they were slightly smeared, as if from the fingers of persons who had touched her wiih their bloody fingers—anybody who touched her clothes would have got smeared in raising her up—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mor<lb/>tem</hi> examination, and found a wound in the black patch, extending upwards to the back of the head to the top of the spine—I afterwards extracted</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly a confectioner, living at No. 203, Oxford-street. I am now messman to the Royal Artillery at Wool<lb/>wich—I have known the prisoner three or four years—in July, 1842, the prisoner was in my debt 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in that month he produced this bill of exchange to me to be discounted, or to give him the difference of it, and take what was owing to me—at the time he brought it me I said, "You must leave this for inquiry, I cannot part with my money in this way; I must know who this Samuel Roberts is"—I had discounted for the prisoner before, but never for an acceptor of the name of Roberts—I said, "Who is the bill from?"—he said, "A gentleman residing at Stafford, who resides on his own estate"—I said, "Is it for money or goods?"—he said, "For wine I have sold"—I first advanced him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the bill, for which he gave me this "I O U—he left the bill with me—I wrote to Stafford, and received an answer—I wrote a second letter to Stafford—this is the letter—it was returned to me as it is now by the post—I received an answer to this letter—before the bill became due I gave the prisoner the difference of the bill—I gave him 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more after I received the first letter—he owed me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. previous to that—he received in all 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I took for discount—the bill was presented at Cox and Bid<lb/>dulph's, where it is made payable, but was not paid—in consequence of that, and of what I learnt at Cox and Biddulph's, I applied for a warrant to apprehend the prisoner, and offered a reward for his apprehension—in Dec., 1842, about three months after the bill had become due, I received this letter—I have seen the prisoner write, and had communications with him, and have acquired a knowledge of his handwriting—I can swear to this letter being his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another letter</hi>)—this is the letter I received in answer to that I wrote to Stafford—I do not know the writer of that, nor this—(<hi rend="italic">looking at another</hi>)—it is a <hi rend="italic">fac-simile</hi> of the other—I can form no opinion of it.</p>

               <p>ascertained there was no Mr. Roberts, after the bill was returned into my hands—I then began to be diligent to know what had become of Casey, and I found he was in Whitecross-street—I took steps to find him—I looked for the drawer—the acceptor was of no use to me—I looked to the drawer—one was a man I did know, and the other I did not know—I cannot tell how long it was before I wrote to Mr. Roberts, of Stafford—it was no use to write to Stafford, because my other letters were returned—my letter that was returned was written on the 13th, and it was a fortnight before it came back to me—I wrote to make inquiries at Stafford, about a fortnight after the receipt of this, perhaps a month after the dishonour of the bill—this letter was returned after I advanced the money, before the bill was dishonoured—at the time of the dishonour of the bill I had reason to believe there was no such person as Roberts at Stafford, from my letter coming back—I believed, at the time the bill was returned to me, there was a person named Roberts at Stafford, who could pay the bill—I did not apply to any person at Stafford to pay the bill—I made inquiries at Stafford—I could not find the drawer—I continued to look for the prisoner up to the time of his coming here—I did not desire that his wife should pay the money—I applied to her to know where Casey was, that I might get the money—I did not threaten criminal proceedings, in the event of her not telling roe, but in the event of my not finding him—if the money had been sent, I should probably not have enforced proceedings—it is not unusual, when persons do not honour their bills, to grant a little indulgence—I have granted two or three months, and longer—I do not know where the Mr. Roberts, who I saw in the Queen's Bench, is now—I have not been looking for him, or in<lb/>quired at the Queen's Bench for him—I had never seen him previously, and have not seen him on the turf since.</p>

On Shrove-Tuesday, the 4th of Feb., (I think,) I left the things safe in the large box, and the box locked, and went out about a quarter to ten o'clock in the morning—my wife was ill in that room—I returned about a quarter to eleven—the large box was then moved—I missed it as soon as I came in, and found it in the wash-house—the hinges were both broken off—I missed the money—the tin box was taken, and likewise the small box with the watch and seals—I did not find Madew there when I came home—I expected she was gone to take some stockings for her mother, who was out at work—she told me she was going out and she went out before me, or pretended to do so, but I think they</p>

I went on my business, on my rounds through the north—I stopped at Manchester, not decidedly for Mr. Richardson, but in my business—I did something for him there—I did not settle an indictment for him, or pay any money, only my own business—I did not know that Mr. Richardson was indicted with a man named Thorn and another, for robbing a man at his gambling-house at Manchester—I heard there was some indictment or other, but I did not know the subject of it—I paid no money, nor did I do anything in connexion with any case, or indictment there against Mr. Richardson—I heard of an indictment, in conversation with some parties at Manchester—that was before our partnership—I did not pay any money to a merchant at Manchester on behalf of Mr. Richardson—I did not be<lb/>lieve the things I heard—I understood they were utterly false, that Mr. Richardson knew nothing at all of it, but that he was away from Man<lb/>chester at the time—I knew nothing about Mr. Richardson's previous habits or manners—I looked on him as a respectable man—we carry on business as "Brown and Company"—the tradesmen we do business with know it is Brown and Richardson, and likewise the bank—I did not say to a person who came to speak to me about Mr. Richardson a short time ago, that I did not know him—since Christmas last he has resided in Mount-street, Whitechapel-road—I did not tell a person who came to serve a notice, that I did not know such a person—I said he did not live there, and gave his proper address, No. 7, Mount-street—I have not been in any particular difficulty or trouble myself—I cannot get in my debts as I wish, that is trouble enough—twelve months ago lait Christmas I could not exactly get in my accounts, and I called on one or two of my creditors—I did not fail—I made over to them a portion of my debts, and they were to pay me the difference, and from that I should re<lb/>ceive a surplus of about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not send Tidmarsh to Jacobs—that—Jacobs sent Tidmarsh to me—I did not propose to give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if they would not prosecute the case further, but let the house be kept open till March, and then it should be given up—I did not make that proposition—I know Mrs. Fletcher, who, I believe, is indicted with Mr. Richardson—I know her house, No. 34, Duke-street, St. James's—Mrs. Fletcher has recommended me a few customers, and I have gone there occasionally to measure them—I never saw anything improper in the house—I have gone there at eleven o'clock in the morning—the house is kept by Mrs. Fletcher—I have never seen Mr. Richardson there—I never understood that that</p>

I have nothing to do with it whatever"—Tidmaish said, "Well, I met Moe Jacobs and Partridge on Ludgate-hill, and they told me of this, and likewise that I had better see the parties, and see if I could not settle it, as I knew Mr. Richardson"—Richardson said, "What is it they want?"—he said, "Oh, it is money of course they want; you know these parties, and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I dare say, will settle it."</p>

I went to Mr. Folkard's, a pawnbroker, in the Commercial-road-my attention was called to Emma Fuller offering a watch—I went out, and brought her back—I asked her for the watch she had offered to Mr. Folkard—she said she had no watch—Mr. Folkard identified her as the person who offered the watch a short time before—I put my hand to her bosom, and found this watch there—she said she lived at No. 9, Baker-street, which was true—on the 6th of Feb. I apprehended Fowler—I told her it was for stealing a watch—she paid she knew that very well—I took Barrett the same day—she asked me what she was taken for—I told her she was concerned in stealing the watch—she said if she ever found a watch again, she would burn it, sooner than write as she did to Mr. Watkins.</p>

In consequence of circumstances, I marked some pieces of paper, and directed my son to place them somewhere on Tuesday, the 11th of Feb. On the Wednesday he brought me a nose-bag full of corn, with some of the papers which I had marked in it—I can swear to the papers—the corn consisted of black Tartarian oats, with a few peas and beans—I grow these oats myself—there are very few of any kind grown about us, and very few Tartarian oats—I believe they were mine—there were a few peas and beans mixed with it when it was given out at night—the corn and the mixture exactly correspond with what I gave ont—there was very nearly half a bushel—the prisoner was going out on the Wednesday, to take a load of beans to Newington—he was then to go on to Truman's for grains.</p>

               <p>after the gentleman—he said he had lost his handkerchief, and he would go to Guidhall the next morning, but he did not—Grimes had tried a good many pockets with the back of his hand as he was going along.</p>

I and another officer watched the prisoners for half an hour—there were three of them at first, but one left—Grimes felt several pockets—they then crossed over by Messrs. Hoare's, and just before they got to Temple-bar, Bourne followed a gentleman and took his handkerchief—Grimes was close behind Bourne at the time—Bourne put the handkerchief into his pocket—I took him, and said, "I want that handkerchief"—he took it out—Stewart came up, whom I had seen occasionally with my brother officer—he never was with me before.</p>

About two months ago, I was in a public-house in Oxford-street with a man and two women—the prisoner came in—he knew the man that was with me, and they began talking—they treated me—I got drunk, and lost my recollection—I found myself, late the same night, at the prisoner's lodging at No. 2, Draper's-place, near Burton-crescent, New-road—I had not agreed to go there, nor was I at all conscious of going with him till I came to my senses in his place—it was dark in the evening when I awoke—I found myself undressed and in bed with him—up to this time I had been in service at a boot and shoe shop in Oxford-street—I had been a modest girl up to that time, and had not been in the habit of going with men—I had a half-holiday that day—in the morning</p>

I have known the prisoner about twelve months—I think I first saw Dodd about the beginning of Nov.—I remember when I and my wife went to the public-house the prisoner and Dodd were there—on that day six cocks were brought to my house by the prisoner—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for them—after I had paid him I went to the public-house next door—he and Dodd were there—my wife came after me to fetch me out—I do not recollect that I had seen Dodd before then—some beer was called for, but I did not drink any—I was about drinking, when my wife hit the pot, and it fell to the ground—I ordered some more cocks of tie prisoner, and received them three days afterwards, from Dodd—I paid Dodd 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I had not seen Dodd at all between the time he with the public-house and when he brought me the second six cocks, three and after—he would have had no means of knowing that I had ordered u more cocks except through the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, and live in Queen-street, May<lb/>fair. About one o'clock in the morning, on the 1st of March, I was in St. James-street, returning home—the prisoner took hold of my arm, and asked me to go with her, which I refused—she came with me as far as the corner of Bury-street—I told her she need not go any further, as I was going home—I felt in my trowsers' pocket, and my purse was gone—it had been there a few minutes before—I had only parted with a friend two minutes before—I caught hold of the prisoner's wrist—I told her I had lost my purse, and she must have it—I never let her go, but called, "po<lb/>lice!"—two or three women came up, and two men came—one of them tried to take her from me, but I kept her, and gave her in charge—this is my purse—it had four sovereigns in it.</p>

               <p>About nine o'clock in the morning, on the 20th of Feb., I was in his stable—the prisoner had the care of a loose stall and locker of my mas<lb/>ter's—I found in that locker two bladders of lard—it has no lock to it—about ten o'clock that morning I saw the prisoner come from the stable into the mess-room, where there are some cornbins, (one of which the prisoner had charge of, and kept the key of the padloek) with a peck measure with corn in it—it was large enough to contain a bladder of lard, which might be covered with corn—it appeared full—he went three times from the stable to the mess-room, on each occasion with the peck measure apparently full of corn—I do not know whether there was com in his bin in the mess-room—about half an hour after I went to the locker under the manger, and the two bladders of lard were gone—next morning, a tittle after seven o'clock, I was in the mess-room with Gilbert—we had a candle, and looked into the bin of which the prisoner kept the key—we saw a bladder of lard, partly covered over with corn—there was another bin in the mess-room for the carmen, which is divided into three partitions, but the prisoner's bin was by Itself—in the course of that morning I saw the prisoner go from the mess-room to the stable with this measure full of corn apparently—he had but one horse to feed at that time—it was not necessary to take a peck for one horse—in the evening we looked again into the prisoner's bin, and could not perceive the lard—we searched the hayloft over the stable, to Which you have to go by a ladder, and found two bladders of lard in a hand-bag, under some hay, between a truss of hay and a truss of straw; on the fight<lb/>hand side in going up—Mr. Binns, Brazier, and Gilbert, were with me—we took the bladders out of the bag, cut an incision in them, attd put a piece of straw into them, put them back into the bag, and left it in the same place—on the Saturday evening, about nine o'clock, we went agaift into the loft—the lard was then gone from where we had seen it, and we found it out of the bag, in a hole on the left-hand side, in the loft, and some hay placed over it.</p>

I saw the prisoner come from the warehouse about nine o'clock in the morning—he went in a direction towards the stable, but I did not see him go in—next morning, about seven, I went with Blenkard into the mess-room and looked into the corn-bin kept by the prisoner—I saw a bladder of lard partly concealed by the corn—I looked again in the evening, and could not perceive the bladder—we went to the loft and found two bladders of lard in a hand-bag—on the Saturday morning, about seven, I saw the prisoner go into the stable—that would be in the way to go to the loft—he was afterwards sent out—I went into the loft again on Saturday evening, and found the lard, not where I had seen it before, but in the opposite corner, concealed in a kind of shoot and covered with hay—on the Sunday morning I went to the premises about five, and after six I went with the policeman to the loft—I there saw the lard, to all appearance, in the same place where I left it on the Saturday evening.</p>

I sent the prisoner into the Borough on that Saturday, and on the same night I went with the other witnesses to the loft, and found two bladders of lard in the left hand back corner of the loft—they had been marked—I had seen them on the Friday evening in another part of the loft—I looked into the prisoner's bin on the Friday evening, but I could not discover the lard—the bin was nearly three parts full of corn—we could see about half-way over it—I desired a police<lb/>man should be sent for—I have the padlocks and the keys of the pri<lb/>soner's bin, and the bins of the three carmen—this key of the prisoners will not unlock the other men's padlocks, nor will their keys unlock his.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 551.) On Sunday morning, the 22nd of Feb., I went, about six o'clock, into the loft over the prosecu<lb/>tor's stable, and secreted myself under some hay—when I had been there about an hour and three quarters, the prisoner came up a sort of ladder,</p>

               <p>into the loft—he went directly up to the place where the lard was—he then came back, and opened a pair of folding-doors to let in more light, looked very cautiously round him, then came and put his hand on some hay within a foot of where I was, but there was a bag over my head, and he could not perceive me—he went back, shut the folding-doors, and re<lb/>turned to the place where the lard was, and he must have stooped down, as he was out of my sight—I had seen him upright before—he then went down the trap-door, towards the stable—I followed, and saw him lighting a fire—I went and told Mr. Binns, and then took the prisoner into custody—I examined the place where the lard bad been deposited before I went down—I can swear he had been there twice, and the hay that covered the lard had been disturbed, but the lard was not taken away—it was under<lb/>neath the floor of the loft, about three or four feet deep.</p>

On Saturday night, the 8th of Feb., about half-past nine o'clock, I was in Chapel-street, Somers-town—a man was exhibiting something and there was a crowd—a young woman told me something—I put my hand in my pocket and missed five shillings, which I knew was safe two or three minutes before—I had had five shillings and a sixpence, and the sixpence was left—the prisoner was standing by my side—wheirf the young woman spoke to me he went away—I ran after him—he had then got about half-a-dozen doors off—the young woman stopped him, and we gave him in charge—I had just before seen him pass something to another boy who was with him, and he whispered something to the other boy-the prisoner had songs in his hand—the five shilling were my father's.</p>

I lost this pair of boots on the 10th of Feb.—I had seen them ten minutes before—they are my husband's—on the Fridy evening afterwards, Mrs. Bullen, who lives in the same place, and keepn shop in the same line as mine, sent her boy over to me with the boots, to ask if they were not mine—I went and asked Mrs. Bullen, in the prisoner's presence, where she got them—she said the prisoner brought them to sell—she said she had been sent to sell them by a man whom she left in 1 public-house in Golden-lane—I said if she would show me the man I should be glad—I went with her to the public-house—there was no man there—I gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Frederick Folkard, a pawnbroker, at No. 160, Blackfriars-road. On the 13th of Feb., about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in the shop, and heard something move ill the window—I cast my eye towards it, and saw two fingers inside the window, lifting up a card of mourning rings—the window was not open, and the wires were up outside, to protect it—a piece of glass had been starred out—eight mourning rings were on the card, worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lifted up the flap of the counter, ran round, and as soon as I opened the door I saw the prisoner drawing them through the wires—I went to lay hold of him, but fell down—I got up and pursued—we have two reflectors inside the window, which show a light outside, and I saw his face distinctly—I was close to him before I fell—there was another one with him—I pursued him across the road—he ran down Wellington-street, and turned up Angel-place—I shouted out, "Stop thief!" all the way along as I went—I saw no one down the street—I did not see the prisoner go down Angel-place, the street is not straight, one house pro<lb/>jects out a little, next door but one from this court, and the moment I turned into the court the prisoner came back put of the court—it was no thoroughfare—I was, I dare say, three or four yards behind him when he ran up this place—I caught hold of him, and his hand was bleeding inside in the middle—I said, "Where is the card of rings you have taken out of the window?"—he said, "I have not got a card of lings; what card of rings?"—he kicked me, and tried to get away—he threw off his hat and scarf up Angel-place, among the snow—when I caught him he had no hat with him—I brought him back to the shop, and gave him into custody—the card was produced—it then had four rings on it, and one was picked up on the ground, and was produced by Mr. Coleman, a gentleman who was passing by at the time—this is the card and the rings—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—they belong to my master.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stock-manufacturer, and reside in Hemming's-row, Charing-cross. I was passing along Blackfriars-road on the evening of the 13th of Feb., between six and seven o'clock, and all at once heard aery of "Stop thief!"—I immediately stopped, looked round, and saw two per<lb/>sons running across the road—they both passed me—I stopped nearly op<lb/>posite a street—the first one that was running threw something from his right hand directly he passed me, and within about six or eight yards of me—thinking it was only a piece of paper, I let it lie for nearly a minute—a little boy who was passing said, "He threw something down"—I turned it over, and saw it contained rings—a lad named Hackett was taking it from him, and I took it from Hackett—it was a card containing four gold rings—this looks like it, but I could not swear to it—I took it over to the pawnbroker's, and laid it on the counter—it lay there till the police<lb/>man came in—I did not see anybody take it from the counter—there were four rings on it when I took it from Hackett—I felt in the snow, and found another one—I am quite sure that what I took from Hackett was what the man threw away—I saw the man's face when he threw it away—there was light enough for me to see his face—there was a lamp close by—he passed close under the lamp—it was the prisoner—I did not see what became of him after he threw it away—they both ran on—no one was fol<lb/>lowing them at that time—it was on the opposite side of the way to Jr. Folkard's that he threw the rings away, about fifty or sixty yards off it was not near Wellington-street—I think it was nearer the bridge, but I cannot say—I did not know the prisoner before—I saw the policeman take the rings off the counter—I am sure he took what I got from Hackett</p>
