            's servant, son-in-law to Mrs. Pollard; (looks at the knife) it is my master's property, my mistress is there; this was left in the house. This knife was packed up in a deal box with preserves and pickles and other things, I pack'd it up myself.</p>
               <p>Question to Mrs. Pollard. What may be the value of the things you lost that night? - The table cloths value 2 l. the shifts value 6 s.</p>
               <p>What were they worth? - I would not take 5 l. if I was to say 10 l. I should not say too much.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of July I went from my own house at Lambeth to Sadler's Wells, I saw a great crowd, I asked what was the matter, I was told there were thieves; I went to the door, and was forced into the passage; endeavouring to extricate myself I made a kind of attempt to get through the mob, I was seized by Mr. Stone, he laid hold of me, and said I suspect you: I said you are wrong; he said have you got any weapons about you?; I said no. I made no resistance, he took me out into the highway, he laid me on my back: they took me to the watch-house and searched me, they all know it. My watch was taken from me and 5 s. 6 d. in money; the watch was advertised, and the watch and money was restored to me; I keep a house in Lambeth Marsh: I have witnesses.</p>
               <p>KELLY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I went to sup with a friend near the foot of Black-fryars-Bridge. I was accosted in Lincolns-inn-fields coming home, by a well-dressed woman, she asked me to give her a glass of wine, I refused to go into any house, she said she knew of an uninhabited house which she could introduce me to. She went up to the door as if with intent to open it, she bid me enter; in a few seconds there was a loud rap at the door, I turned round, thinking it was the woman; I was immediately attacked by a number of persons, one gave me a violent cut in my face, I seized hold of his hand, and wrenched a knife or some weapon out of his hand, which was taken out of my hand, I remained insensible.</p>

               <p>On the 5th of August, at ten o'clock in the morning the prisoner came up to me in Spa Fields and demanded my purse, I was exceedingly terrified; he said, your purse. I said, what did you say? He said, damn you, your money, or you are a dead woman, and he presented a knife to my breast; he told me to make haste, for he would have my money, or I should be a dead woman, I put my hand into my pocket where the silver was, and by the agitation I was in, some of it fell into my pocket again; he immediately then put his hand into my pocket, and took out the silver that remained; he wanted my ring from my finger; he swore I had rings on; and I said, I have not; he said, if I did not give it him, he would cut it off: he immediately left me. I do not know which way he went; some persons came up, and I was carried into a house, I am very sure he is the man.</p>

Says the Alderman, can you see them, I said no; Harry is in the way, that was his servant: the coach was immediately ordered to stop, and one came on my side, which was the prisoner Davis, he demanded my watch, money, and pocket-book, used some illiberal language. The other who calls himself

            , was on the other side, I was much alarmed, I gave Davis my purse, containing 16 s. in silver; as I took my purse out, I meant to have taken care of my watch, but dropped it by the side of me. I satisfied the prisoner, who calls himself Davis, that I had no watch or pocket-book, and that I had given all my money; from which period to the time of their leaving us, Davis behaved exceedingly well. I think it my duty to state every circumstance; they had each pistols, but I was not under the least degree of apprehension from the prisoner Davis, his behaviour was exceedingly proper under such circumstances; after I had given my purse to Davis, Airey was exceedingly outrageous, he had robbed the Alderman of three guineas, and the other gentleman of about 14 s. he put his hand in to search the Alderman, and made use of a very improper expression; he put his hand upon the Alderman's thigh, and said he had more money; he said it was only a penny, or three halfpence; he behaved in a very unbecoming manner indeed, saying he would blow our brains out, blasting us, demanding our pocket-books and watches, I believe he saw my watch, he blasted, me, with his pistol in his hand, and put his head a little further into the coach, and he took my gold watch.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask Mr. Allen what information he gave to Bow-street when he was first robbed? - We gave information to Bow-street that we thought</p>
               <p>'the prisoners</p>
               <p>'short people, they might stand on the</p>

               <p>'as a dark man, and about 25 or 26 years of</p>
               <p>'age, they were both as much exposed as any</p>
               <p>'of the gentlemen here, Davis put up a</p>
               <p>'white cravat to his mouth, it was down in a minute, the other with a silk handkerchief the same, it was impossible to mistake them considering the length of time they were with us, they were differently dressed at the justices but I had no difficulty about them, it is is very disagreeable to me to be under the necessity of prosecuting, I did not swear to them on Monday because it was agreed we should all attend together.</p>
               <p>ALDERMAN KITCHEN sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you in company with Mr. Allen at the time of this robbery? - I was my Lord, but Mr. Allen has related it so very particularly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110008"/> I do not think any thing can be added to it, I am sure the prisoner is the man, but I cannot be so positive to Davis, as to Airey I never heard such a number of oaths in my life, I gave him three guineas, I asked him to return me one, he would not, he then seized my pocket, says he, damn me why did you not give me all, that was only three bad halfpence, I cannot swear to the other man, the other man leaned quite over me.</p>

            . To the best of my knowledge this is the last man that came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. I thought you said you could not swear to him? - Not as the man that injured me my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. But is he one of the men that was in the passage? - Yes, my Lord, I am positive of that, he is not in the same trade now that he was in then, he threw away his hat among the mob when he came out of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What conversation passed at the watch-house? did not the constable say if I left my card or address he would let me go? - The constable asked you for your address.</p>

               <p>I know nothing about the robbery; I went to the watch-house after my husband was stabbed; I was not present then, I said to the prisoner, says I, you villain, you are the man that stabbed my husband; the same morning he said, blast your eyes, you old cow, I wish I had ripped him open.</p>
               <p>Court. What condition was your husband in? - He was at the infirmary a month, he bled so much, his bowels were wounded, and he beg'd to die at home.</p>
               <p>Court. Is his life in danger? - In all probability he is a dying man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told her, says I, you are very much mistaken, I was not the person; I was taken to her husband, and he did not know me. I beg leave to say, my Lord, if I had done such a thing, I certainly should not have stood just opposite the place; I told him I lived at No. 69 in Holborn, and that I had got the key of the door in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Hunter. We have a man here that lay in the same room when this man was in confinement, we have found him out, since that will prove a conversation.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. For robbing his master my Lord.</p>
               <p>Mitchell. I heard the prisoner say to the man that lay with him, damn that man, whom I suppose to be Hunter, he may think that we are to be bubbled, but I was the man that came out last; that is all I have to say; he said he would be his death if ever he got clear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I hope you will not rely on any thing that man says, he is the arrantest thief in the kingdom, he was committed to Tothill-fields Bridewell for robbing his master.</p>
               <p>The constable. I had a warrant for this man to take him up, he is a Baker by trade, he goes there of mornings to help them to turn over their bread; they have frequently given him a little flour, the master was told by some neighbours that he had been guilty of this breach of trust, it was four pounds and an half of flour, a misdemeanor.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say, I do not know what to say, the man knows no more of me than he does of Adam, I have no witnesses, I was not arraigned, I did not think of being tried till the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. Notice was sent you, that your tryal would come on this morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes but I was not arraigned.</p>
               <p>Jury to Hunter. How come you to recollect the prisoner so much to swear to him so positively? - It is by reason that when he came out the last man I had a lanthorn in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110011"/> my hand, and I held it up in his face, and he had a long shag red waistcoat on when I saw him, and he had it on in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is there any other circumstances in the appearance of the man that enables you to swear to positively to him? - The features of the man, the waistcoat and great coat that he had on him.</p>

I was in St. George's hospital, I left the coachman behind, because he did stop, he came after me into the hospital, I know his No. 825.</p>

               <p>On the 19th of July I went to the prosecutor in the hospital, he told me he could find the man that robbed him, I went to the prisoner's lodging next morning, the prisoner was in bed my Lord, and a girl with him, this pistol, this stick, and these two cutlasses lay by his bed side, I desired him to get out of bed, he asked what he was apprehended for, I told him, he stood for half a minute and then he fainted away in the chair, I took him to the office, and in the office he acknowledged this hanger to be the prosecutor's, he told the other man that was concerned with h im. (Prisoner. You had like to have forgot that I believe.) He told us their names and where they lived, we went after them many times, and could not meet with them; the pistol was loaded with a piece of a picklock key and several other pieces of slugs, here is a charge of powder enough to carry five balls.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I believe that man said, that I said, that the hanger belonged to the prosecutor, that I confessed it in the Office, was you there at the time Mr. Dixon? - I was.</p>
               <p>What did I say when you came into the room to take me? - You said very little to me, because you fainted away.</p>
               <p>Did not I ask you more than once or twice what I was apprehended for, and you told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110012"/> me, the justice would tell me when I came to the office? - Perhaps once or twice while I was putting the things together, I took no notice of that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Gentleman said, he had lost a sword, and he did not know his sword, but he believed it was his property; my Lord, consider what this man's character is: I have an evidence that will satisfy you whether I know any thing of these things or not.</p>
               <p>- GRUBB sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at the taking of the prisoner. I had an information of this man; and I told Dickson if we went betimes we should find him in bed; Dickson went first and laid laid hold of him, and went round by his bed-side, and found all these things laying by his bed-side.</p>
               <p>Did you see all these things by his bedside? - I did, my Lord: I saw Dickson take them up. The prisoner asked what he was apprehended for? We told him it was for robbing the musician on the Brompton Road, that was cut so; he immediately dropt as dead for the space of two minutes as cuold be; he then begg'd for a little water and came to. Then Dickson examined the pistol, and I saw him draw the charge, it was loaded and primed; it is the same charge my Lord, that was in the pistol, then he was committed. He acknowledged it to be the prosecutor's hanger at the office. We had an information from him of the other men, and where the watch was, but we could not find them, nor get the watch again; it was sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If your Lordship took notice, he said, that Dickson broke the door open in the morning: I opened it myself.</p>
               <p>Dickson. My Lord, I try'd to force the door; I knew it was not safe to stay knocking: but whether it was opened or not I do not know.</p>

I got up, my cloaths laid in a chair, they found no money; they asked me where my cash was, I said I knew nothing of any: they found two swords or cutlasses, and a pistol. The young woman said, gentlemen, I hope you do not take this young man for any of these things that are here, because he knows nothing of them, these things were left by a young man last Sunday. I will call her.</p>

               <p>Do you know the two prisoners at the bar?</p>
               <p>I cannot say that I know the prisoners. On the 7th of August I had been out of town with my wife and daughter to dine with a family on Epping Forest. We were returning in the evening, at about half past nine or a little more, we were stopped coming down <placeName id="t17820911-8-crimeloc44">Islington Hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17820911-8-crimeloc44" type="placeName" value="Islington Hill"/>

                        targets="t17820911-8-off40 t17820911-8-crimeloc44"/> by several footpads; we had passed thro' the turnpike a very few yards, I suppose thirty or forty yards: the doors of the post-chaise were opened at one moment by a man on each side, they demanded our money and watches: the demand was made with circumstances of a very alarming nature indeed, for their language was exceedingly dreadful, by the man that opened the door on my side, that demanded my money, I gave him for answer, he should have it in a moment, I begged him in the meantime not to alarm the ladies; I put my hand into my right pocket, and pulled out my money, gave it him; he was disatisfied with it. I gave him full 4 l. I cannot tell exactly what it was, I gave him above 4 l. between 4 l. and 5 l. He said damn you, you rascal, you have not given me all your money, and having a hanger in his hand, he pulled back his hand in the action of going to stab me, and with a great deal of force. I begged him not to injure me, for I had given him all my money, and he should search me if he pleased. He was still discontented, but he forbore then to strike me; he called out to the man that was with my wife on the other side of the chaise, Damn you Jack, what are you about, search the seat, for he has not given me all his money. The man replied, I will be with him presently. A very few moments passed, in which the man that had taken my money was proceeding to look at it in his hand; he told me I had given him nothing but silver; I assured him he would find gold, and I hoped he would be satisfied. He asked me then how much there was - I told him I seldom knew exactly how much I had in my pocket at any time.</p>
               <p>During this time, the man at the other side had been rifling the ladies of what he could get; and that man came round to my door, I believe the same man; by which time, the person who had taken my money had looked at it, and I fancy knew what he had got. I then saw a new face present himself at the door, who I believe to be the man that had been on the other side; and at that instant that I saw this new face, I saw the man retreat a step back, that was the man that had come from my wife's side of the chaise, and he lifted up a hanger, I believe with both his hands, and he seemed to lift it up with very great might. I had not time or space to escape any blow; my right hand happened to be across the door, which was open, and he levelled at my right hand, and instantly, in the same moment in which I saw him retreat back and lift up the hanger, I felt the blow across my hand in the wrist, and instantly my hand dropt down. He cut it half through; he said not a word to me before the blow nor after; nor was a word said to me by any of the parties: they retreated behind the chaise.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110014"/>Feeling myself in this situation, I said to my wife, he has cut my hand off. It was very fortunate for me that we were not above a mile from my own house. If I had been kept five minutes longer in the chaise I must have died, if I could not have had relief.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you form any guess about the prisoner at the bar? - That will put me under the necessity of troubling your Lordship how I came to be the prosecutor in this indictment. These men came forward, first by the evidence of an accomplice, and then by their own confession.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the name of the accomplice? - Milbourne my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. Where was it that they made this confession? - They were taken up at Justice Willmot's office. I was sent to by the magistrate after the first Wednesday that they were brought there. There I saw the witness Milbourne and these two prisoners at the bar; they were under examination for a charge of murdering Mr. Hurd: when that charge was done with, the prisoner Caddie spoke thus to the magistrate; I know I am a dead man, therefore I care not what evidence is sworn against me; but there is a gentleman in court whom I know very well, and who has committed to Newgate two persons for a fact they are not guilty off, which fact he said was committed by himself, Stunnel and Milbourne.</p>
               <p>Did he say this in the hearing of Stunnell? - Yes my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did Stunnell say? - He confessed the same thing. I begg'd the magistrate to suffer me to interrogate them, having a good many doubts on my mind which I wished to clear up by the manner of my examination; and, my Lord, I did examine them one after another, in that way you may suppose a man may do that had some idea that this might be a game played upon him in the examination, with the the greatest care and caution I could bring it forward. They instantly and without hesitation disclosed to me in their answer every minute circumstance that passed in that robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you examine them separate? - They were in the room together, but I examined them one after another to the parts of the transaction which I knew each man, if he was concerned, could be able to answer. I should further acquaint your Lordship, that previous to my coming, the examination of the evidence Milbourne had been taken on paper, and before he had been brought forth with the others, and after these two prisoners had voluntarily and minutely confessed in their answers to me every circumstance, the confession of Milbourne taken before, was then read, and they agreed that it was true: one circumstance alone my Lord, has hung on my mind, I always supposed there were more in number, my wife supposed the same, and the post-boy concurred in the idea. In our idea there were five.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you found that belief upon, were there more than three that acted in the robbery? - As to myself I could not take upon me to speak, because I saw but the man at each door; but my wife saw them come up to meet the chaise just a moment before they stopped, and she thinks she saw five hats, and the post-boy thought the same; and these men persisted in it to me that there were but three.</p>
               <p>MILBOURNE sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know the two prisoners? - Yes Sir, the two prisoners and myself met that evening, in order to go out on the road; I believe on Wednesday evening, we had not been gone out long before we came to the city-road: there we saw a post-chaise and pair going towards Islington. On which we agreed to let it go over Tottenham Court-Road, and there to stop it; but before it came to Tottenham Court-Road, thinking we might be seen going through Battle-bridge, we stopped it about fifty or sixty yards below the turnpike. I stopped it, Caddie went to the right-hand door, Stunnell to the left, Caddie demanded the gentleman's money, and told him if he made any noise he would cut him; and the gentleman kept talking: the gentleman gave them his money, which Caddie looked at; Caddie replied, this is not all. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110015"/> gentleman said it was, Caddie said you have more behind you, and insisted upon searching, but did not; Caddie asked Stunnel what he was doing on the other side, Stunnel said, let me come, which he did, and he instantly made a blow at the gentleman; the gentleman cried Lord you have cut me, then we shut the doors and went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. We have nothing to say, and no witnesses.</p>

               <p>I am a pawn-broker in Broad Sanctuary, Westminster. I have the prosecutor's gold watch, which I received from the prisoner Claddenboul, he brought it the same morning about 8, and offered to pledge it for a guinea and a half; he offered it as a metal watch, I suspected him; he said first he had had it about a year and an half; afterwards he said about six weeks. I asked him who his Serjeant was, he was in a military frock dress; he said one Macmillan, in Stretton-Ground; I sent, and there was no such man, he was gone abroad. I asked him how he came by the watch, and whose it was; he said it was left him by an uncle at Canterbury; he said it was brought him up by a Captain of Horse; I asked him to produce that person; he said he would write to him. I was still dissatisfied; he then went and brought the other prisoner Taylor. I asked Taylor if he knew this man, he said he used his house, he kept the Duck, in Duck-lane; he said he knew Claddenboul had a watch, he had frequently left it in his care, and that he had at times lent him money on it. I said this watch is gold; he says it is metal; says Taylor, I always understood it was metal. I would not part with the watch, and I went to Bow-street, soon after the prosecutor came to give information of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110016"/> the loss of his watch, and he swore to it there. The prosecutor went home with me, and the people from Bow-street went to Taylor's, and he pointed out Claddenboul. I was not present when he was taken, but my young man was, the prisoner was committed.</p>

               <p>We went down to Westminster to look after Claddenboul; I applied to prisoner Taylor for Claddenboul, and he gave me every assistance about it. I told him it was the soldier he had been to the pawn-broker's about; he sent out a man, and the man returned back and told us where he was. I asked him to go with us to shew us the man, and he did, we took him; we desired Taylor to come with us, and he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then Taylor was in no shape backward to shew you the man? - He gave us every assistance in his power.</p>

               <p>I came off guard on Wednesday, and went to bed about 3 in the afternoon, and never got up till 5 next morning. I went to work, going through Westminster-Abbey, I met two soldiers, they asked me to drink, and then asked me if I knew of any place where they could dispose of a watch, I said no. I asked a woman of the town, she recommended to the prisoner Taylor's; they sent me to sell the watch, I offered it to Taylor, he looked at it and tryed it with aqua-fortis; he said he would give but a guinea. I came back and told the men; they said they would sooner pawn it; I took it to pawn, and then the gentleman stopped the watch but not me. I did not know what to say, I recollected in my own mind that the watch certainly must be stolen; Taylor said if they would let him have the watch for two guineas he would go and get it, and say it was mine, and that he had known me to have it a year. I never saw the soldiers after, they belonged to a marching regiment; but as I am no scholar, I could not tell the number on their buttons, they said they would satisfy me. I did not think of any thing of this kind, I sent for my Serjeant, but he is not come.</p>

               <p>Court. Give your evidence with decency, because remember one thing, that no part of this does you any credit, you stand in a very aukward situation? - I staid with the prisoner, the other girl went away almost directly, I bolted the door fast, and we went to bed, we had not been long in bed before I went to sleep, Sir, and I awoke about three quarters of an hour, and she was dressed and stood in the middle of the room with my breeches in her hand; when I went to bed I looked at my watch, and I put the key into the pocket along with the watch, for fear she should see any thing of the watch, and it should tempt her, and I saw the money in my pocket, I counted it, there was a new guinea, the last years coin, that I had hoarded up a long time.</p>
               <p>Court. Where did you leave your breeches when you went to bed? - I put them under the bolster; she dropt the breeches; I had not so much power to rise as I should at another time, and I went out of the room but could see nothing of her; I found my money and my watch gone; I went to the door and asked the people what I should do; says a man do not you move yet, hide yourself behind the door, stay and see if she will not come back, so I got and hid myself: and in about an hour in she came, then I took her; I found nothing upon her, we took her to the constable's at the watch-house, and she would not acknowledge, but going along she acknowledged the man that had the watch, and that she gave it to that other girl, I have had nothing of my watch or money again.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to bed pray? - It might be twelve, or between twelve and one; we set up a good while eating and drinking, we drank about two quarterns of gin and a pot of beer: when people are in such humours as them they do not take notice of such things.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that after the other girl went out of the room you had your watch and your money in your pocket? - I looked at it, whether she heard the rattling of the chain I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. You really took out your money to count it, and to see it? - Yes, Sir; I turned my back the other way and I took it out to see it, I saw the guinea, and the shilling laying like that, and I just wised it into my pocket again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, this man came down to New Prison to ask me if I knew any thing of the watch, I said I knew nothing of it; he said he would not touch a hair of my head. I have no witnesses.</p>

The policy of the law in order to correct a mischief so extremely injurious to the public credit, has made each of these offences a capital felony; it will be the object therefore of your inquiry to judge from evidence whether the prisoners both of them, or each of them, have committed either of these offences imputed to them in the indictment: perhaps in defence of the prisoner

             it may be argued she is a married woman, and charged as the wife of the prisoner John therefore intitled in point of law to some privilege which will protect her from the guilt of which she is charged. It behoves me to state to you, subject to the correction of the court, what I conceive to be the law in that case; I take it that the extent of such rule, if there is any such laid rule down is this, where a married woman in company of her husband commits a larceny, and nothing more appears, than that she was in company of her husband, at the commission of that offence, there a presumption is raised from the humanity of the law, to suppose, that the woman committed that offence under the dominion and authority of her husband; but that, as well as any other presumption, can only stand till there is a proof to the contrary; for I take it to be equally clear, that if from the evidence it should appear, that the married woman was the active person, and acted without the controul or interference of the husband, it would be clear in point of law, that she was involved in the same degree of guilt; if it should appear that it was not in the presence of the husband but distinct from him, I take it to be clear, that a woman in that situation has no privilege whatever; this I conceive is the law on the subject, the forgery now charged on the prisoners is, that of altering a bank note which originally issued from the bank, a bank note for 15 l. and by that alteration producing the operation and effect of a note of 50 l. the manner in which that has been effected has been this, it has been contrived by some method or another, to discharge the double e, and n, from the word fifteen, both in the body of the note and in the black letters of the note, and to substitute in their place the letter y, by which these two words appear to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110020"/> be fifty, the fraud on the public is just that sum between fifteen and fifty; I shall state to you very shortly what will be the evidence that will be laid before you, in order to satisfy you that the prisoners have been guilty of that offence. The prisoner has stated that from the number of council who appear against him, he has some reason to be alarmed, I would ease him of this fear, because every body knows, that the only use that is at this time of day made of council in criminal prosecutions, is merely to state with a little more accuracy, the facts, in order to shew immediately their connection to each other, and to disentangle them from that degree of obscurity which they would receive coming irregularly from the mouths of the witnesses, the jury ought to pay no attention to what is stated by council, but only to receive the evidence as it comes from the mouths of witnesses, on that they are to draw their own conclusions and to form their own judgment, therefore, I trust, the prisoner will be eased of any alarm of that sort; I shall discharge my duty simply in stating that evidence, and you will draw the conclusions.

In his judgment, this mode of fraud upon the public was the most easily effected: it being necessary in order to carry it into execution, that he should be furnished with letters of different sorts in order to compleat his forgery, for that purpose he applied himself to a Mr. Rayner, who was foreman to a Mr. Caslon, who is famous in this town as an engraver; Caslon recommended him to Mr. Hodgson who is an engraver on wood, and stated to be a person very likely to furnish him with such letters as he should want.

The prisoner said they were for a whimsical gentleman, and accordingly they were cut for him; he called and paid Hodgson for them and took them away; some time after he called again, and said these letters did not quite answer his purpose, and he wanted some numbers, as 2, 3, 5, 20, 30, and so on: respecting the letter y, I shall produce to you the papers marked by the prisoner, and the alterations he wished to be made by Mr. Hodgson in the cut of the letter y, a number of letters were cut and figures made by Mr. Hodgson, which were called for and took away by the prisoner

When you inspect the letter y. upon the note produced to you, and compare it with the letter y. produced to you, and the copy of that Hodgson's has engraved, supported by Hodgson's evidence, it will appear to you beyond doubt, that the alteration and the forgery in this bank-note, was made by means of this letter engraved by Hodgson under the direction and order of the prisoner: also that the prisoner John took away and had possession of this letter: shortly after this we find these notes so altered put in circulation; here there appears to be considerable art in John. In no one instance is he to be connected with the putting off these notes; the whole of that is left to the conduct and management of the woman: and there is no instance in which he can be connected with the putting off any of these notes. On the 8th of June, the note in the indictment was put off by the prisoner Jane; she went to the shop of a Mr. Alderson, Silk-Mercer, in Bridge Street, Westmister, where after having bargained for somethings,</p>

               <p>she put off to him one of the forged notes altered from 15 l. to 50 l. that note will be traced very accurately, so as to leave no doubt, and brought home to the prisoner Jane, negociated by her; in a very few days after it was discovered that this note was a forgery, and upon taking it to the bank it was found that a note of that letter, No. and date had been issued of 15 l. but none of 50 l. consequently from that circumstance, without more, they were perfectly satisfied that this was a forged note. There could be no such note issued from the bank; the inattention of the persons taking the note is wonderful, as there is such a space between the letter y and the pounds, that they must with a little attention have seen it: this caused an alarm as you may easily conceive, and the officers of the bank in endeavouring to trace the offender, had discovered that the prisoner had been observed to be full of money, and putting off notes, and buying goods; but though the most diligent search was making after him he was discovered by accident. A Mr. Wright fortunately saw the two prisoners alight out of a post-chaise at Winchester, and they were apprehended at Southampton. It will be unnecessary for me to state to you the number of notes, but I have proof it amounted to eight, as appears by the confession of the prisoner Jane on her examination. On the morning of their being apprended at Southampton, their trunk was opened and searched, on searching that, the sum of ninety and odd guineas, and a 15 l. bank-note was found; the money in the trunk, the 15 l. note in the pocket of the prisoner. In that trunk was also found a great number of experiments on thin paper, made to imitate bank paper, with letters of this kind of ground; and theimpression of the stamps cut by Hodgson the engraver; also a box of paste and a little brush, for the purpose of pasting these letters on, when the letters e e n were discharged from the real bank-note; they then pasted a thin letter y on this paper in their place: then they pasted a bit of thin paper as if it had been worn by carriage. On John was found a 15 l. bank-note, on which as it is stated to me, an attempt had been made to discharge the letters e e n in the body of the note, and it did not quite succeed; the paper seemed to have suffered in the operation and be made very thin; in the back of that note are figures cast up for the purpose of hiding the operation, which appears to be cut exactly in the same manner as these on the note circulated by the woman. From these circumstances you will draw what conclusions<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110023"/> you think fit, this will be the nature of the evidence laid before you; on this evidence, in the first place, it will appear clear that there has been a forgery of the banknote committed by somebody. The question then is, By whom is that forgery commited? In order to satisfy you that that forgery must be committed by the prisoners, or at least by one of them you will have the evidence of Hodgson, who will state to you that the prisoner was put by him in possession of letters capable of effecting that alteration, and that that alteration was effected by means of these letters you cannot doubt, when I produce to you the pieces of paper in black and white, found in the box of the prisoners, in which these corresponding letters are found to be marked; I conceive that no doubts can remain that the forgery was occasioned by these letters, and by the possessor of these letters. Crimes of this sort are always committed in secret, where there is no eye to see; we can can only judge of them by probability. The forgery is as capable of commission by the woman as the man: there is no greater degree of ingenuity or art in this forgery, when you are in possession of the instruments that will make the letters, than to paste with great neatness the letter y where the letters e e n stood before. With respect to the other offence, the disposing and uttering these notes, you will observe, there is no evidence against John, except his being in company with this woman, standing to him in the relation of wife, having cohabited together as man and wife for many years, and going together to Southampton; you are to judge whether he is not to be connected with her in the crime of disposing of these notes. Gentlemen, these are the circumstances of this case, which I shall leave with you. I shall call my witnesses; and I trust, when you have heard them, you will be convinced, that the prisoners are both of them guilty of the offence charged in the indictment.</p>

            ? - He called on me from Mr. Caslon.</p>
               <p>What day was it? - I cannot recollect the day Sir, about the 16th of May.</p>
               <p>For what purpose? - He wanted two letters cut to stamp books for a gentleman in the country.</p>
               <p>What passed? - He came from Mr. Caslon to get two letters cut in wood, I said I did not think it would answer the purpose, being a single letter, as if there was a line round it, because there is some difficulty to stamp a letter perpendicularly by the hand, I do not think any man could; and I told him if there was a line round it, it would stamp better; but he said he was a whimsical gentleman, and it was to mark his books where the authors names ended with a y. I told him it made no difference to me, I would cut it as I was in that way of business. He called again and paid me 1 s. a-piece.</p>
               <p>What kind of a letter did he describe he wanted to have cut? - A text y.</p>
               <p>What were the directions he gave you? - He brought the second time a paper, he said he believed the gentleman would want some numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, if so be that they answered the purpose.</p>
               <p>Look at that paper? - The prisoner brought this as a direction for more stamps, he paid for the two marks, I believe about the 20th of May, and he came, I am not clear, but I think in June; and when he came the third time he brought these two papers, he wanted these numbers that are wrote; he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, but he left the body of the y to me; I said he had better send me drawings; he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, it was left intirely to me, only the body of the y was to be for the size of - the black letter that was to be cut. I cut these numbers that are written down, and I drew them according<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110024"/> to my own fancy; I did not draw the y's according to that copy, as he said the gentleman did not understand drawing, I thought it was left to my judgment, and therefore, I drew them according to the common method of text letters. (The prisoner desired a chair for his wife which was granted.) I drew it according to my judgment of making that letter, there are many variations in the manner of making it, but I drew it according to my own judgment; I cut all thom numbers that he had written down, and he came and paid me 2 s. a piece for them, I made proofs of the whole that he had from me, there was 20.</p>
               <p>Look at this? - (paper with proofs shown the witness) These are the marks that he had from me, I made them with my own hand.</p>

               <p>Look at that? - This is what came afterwards, he had all them marks from me, and paid me 2 s. a piece; some time after he came again and said the gentleman wanted a set of marks a size smaller; it was some time afterwards, I cannot tell the date, and these that were to be done was marked underneath by a line, which may be seen, I fancy in the proof; the tails of the y's some of them were to be turned the other way as appears by this proof, when he gave me directions to do this, he was not clear which way the tails of the y's should be turned, and he said he would write to the gentleman, and desired me to leave the tails unfinished, he said he would call in two or three days; in a few days he called and told me how to finish them, and said his servant should call for them, he was obliged to be out of town himself; a woman called for them, whom I have seen since in New-Prison.</p>
               <p>Look if you see her now? - It is the prisoner at the bar, there was 14 and she paid me 24 s. for them, this paper is the second that was done afterwards.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Can you fix the time when you delivered him the first letter? - The 20th of May.</p>
               <p>The last May? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were the letters? - Two y's.</p>
               <p>Which way were the tails of them turned? - The proofs are there.</p>
               <p>He came from Mr. Caslon to you recommended, I understand? - Yes; I do a great deal of business for Mr. Caslon.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether he said the gentleman he wanted them for, resided in England or Ireland? - A few miles out of town he told me.</p>
               <p>Was you acquainted with the prisoner at the bar before he came from Mr. Caslon? - Never saw him in my life that I know of, only he said he came from Mr. Caslon.</p>
               <p>You say the woman at the bar came for the last marks, did you ever see her before? - Not that I know of.</p>

               <p>I am inclined to think that you are mistaken? - I am not mistaken.</p>
               <p>Those that the woman fetched away, were the last that were done? - Yes; they were tied up in a bundle, she did not see them.</p>
               <p>You did not make any more? - No Sir; I never heard any thing about them afterwards.</p>
               <p>In all probability you never saw the woman again? - Not till I saw her in New-Prison.</p>
               <p>When you saw them in Prison, you went to look at this woman as a person that belonged to Graham taken up for the forgery of the bank-bill? - I was sent to see if I knew them, and then I knew her to be the woman.</p>

               <p>Counsel for Prisoner. How do you know that, Sir, you see the note is an incompleat note, there are other letters introduced, what means of knowledge have you, that the note there is not in its original state? - I issued fifty 15 l. notes, this is one.</p>
               <p>You have a paper in your hand with your name to it, it was not in the condition it is? - I can swear it was only for 15 l.</p>
               <p>Why? - It does not correspond with the entry.</p>
               <p>Did you see the entry made yourself? - No. I see it is a 15 l. the f's are not made in the same manner, they are double f's.</p>
               <p>Pray Mr. Boult I have not a doubt about the truth of what you say, but I would have you speak no further than your knowledge goes, do you see all the bills that are issued from the bank? - No, nor I did not see this issued.</p>

               <p>But do not you frequently alter your plates? - Yes.</p>
               <p>In order to make a variation, and to prevent forgery? - But never I believe with a single f.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110027"/>Where did you see him first? - At the sign of the George at Winchester; on the 11th of July last I saw a post-chaise come in, I saw Mr. Graham come out and Mrs. Graham, she was in a scarlet riding dress, I saw a hair trunk like this, whether this is it or no I cannot say, (a hair trunk produced). What day were they apprehended? On the 13th.</p>
               <p>What occasioned their apprehension? - When I came to London, I mentioned to my master the governor of Tothill-fields Bridewell, that I had seen Graham at Winchester.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. Do not tell us what your master said.</p>
               <p>You had orders to go in pursuit of them? - Yes; I apprehended them at the Coach and Horses at Southampton.</p>
               <p>Did you search the prisoners? - I searched Mrs. Graham, and found nothing particular on her, she had a guinea, and a shilling or two; and the man that was with me, Gregory, searched him and found a 15 l. note and some bits of paper, there was upon the table 31 guineas and a half in gold, that I swept off with me, and put into a purse.</p>
               <p>Where did you get that trunk? - I asked her after he was secured, what is become of your hair-trunk, that I saw with you at Winchester? says she, Sir, I have sent it away; I says to Mr. Gregory, Bob, you take care of them, and I will go and enquire about that; I found the trunk up one pair of stairs in a bed-room, and Mrs. Graham had the key of that room in her pocket, she gave me the key of the room, the trunk was shut, it was opened afterwards at Winchester; the key of the trunk was delivered me by the maid whom I sent to search Mrs. Graham.</p>
               <p>When the trunk was opened, what were the contents of it? - The first thing I found was a little gallypot of paste; she wanted sadly to put her hand in for a handkerchief, but I said she must not before Lord Banbury and all the gentlemen; I found a paper with 69 guineas and 2 half-guineas; searching further, my Lord, I found some paper and some stamps.</p>
               <p>Was there any wearing apparel in the trunk? - A great deal, I have half a dozen things.</p>
               <p>Were any of the things that were in the trunk claimed by either of the prisoners before the magistrate? - The shirts were claimed by Mr. Graham, and the money.</p>
               <p>Produce the other things that you found in that trunk. (Produced the gallypot that the paste was in, and the bottle that the ink was in, the cloth that the stamps were in, and some thin paper, with a number of impressions of letters on it, and particularly one paper with y's stamped on it, where some of the y's appear to be cut off, and a paper with great and little y's.)</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Where was you when Mrs. Graham was searched? - I was in the room with Mr. Graham, she was taken into a private room to be examined by women.</p>
               <p>So that all that you know of the key where the trunk was, is that the maid gave it you? Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>In whose possession has the trunk been? - In my possession mostly; these papers never were out of my possession.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentlemen of the jury: we had seven witnesses here this day who would have spoken to many particulars that would have entirely proved our innocence; of these witnesses we are deprived, but by what means I cannot comprehend; they were a short time ago in the lord mayor's parlour, and were seen by Mr. Wilson; since which they have all been ordered to go away, contrary to our knowledge; the meaning of this manoeuvre heaven alone knows. They would have proved the meaning of the stamps, I had a commission to procure them for a gentleman, at Thames-street, to be sent to Mr. O'Hara of Dublin: I applied to the type makers, they directed me to the wood-cutters; I delivered the stamps, when made, to the gentleman, who if he had been called here would have acknowledged it. The notes likewise could have been accounted for by respectable witnesses, householders, two of whom met Mrs. Graham,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110029"/> and the other came up in the course of finding them. Having been deprived of our witnesses we are sold, were it not for the honour of these gentlemen that are to judge of the whole matter, they are men of honour, they are men of virtue: our confidence therefore is in the Almighty God, and in them. You will please to recollect, that the date of the issuing of the first note is considerably before the procuring of the first stamps, therefore the impression on that note could not be the effect of the impression of that stamp; besides, upon a supposition that I had any hand in the matter, had it been necessary for me to make letters or y's, I could have done it with a pencil or a pen, and the jury will find that none of them do apply. Gentlemen, this is for the last stake of our lives; we are the parents of ten children, nine of whom are now alive, we therefore hope the jury will do us justice.</p>
               <p>Jury to Alderson. What day did you receive the note?</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner is talking of a thing that has not been given in evidence.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prosecution. The note I was talking of was a note paid to her on the 27th of May. Hodgson was paid for the first letters on the 20th of May. The note given in evidence on this indictment was taken by Mr. Alderson on the 8th of June.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired about 10 minutes, and brought in their verdict.</p>

            ; on Saturday 27th of July last, within a few minutes of ten I was standing behind the compter, and heard a smashing of glass, I found the window broke, the corner of the wire was cleared of every thing that lay there, there were two cards of lace, which I had laid there myself about three o'clock in the afternoon; I had a pen in my hand for the purpose of marking them off, these laces were then gone, and a parcel of stockings which lay in that corner which I cannot identify, the two young men run out and brought in the prisoner at the bar, he had a handkerchief which he was dabbing his hands with, he had cut the fleshy part of his hand and all his knuckles, which were then all bleeding (the handkerchief produced, all bloody) I found nothing upon him at all, I never saw him from that time to this. Two or three people were passed by, but I had not the presence of mind to lay hold of them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I stopped to look at some buckles in a window, and immediately some body came up to me, and took hold of me, and put my hands behind me, and told me I had broke a window and taken some things out of it.</p>
               <p>Court. Were there any shutters or any thing of that kind in the window, to prevent his seeing you in the shop? - No my Lord.</p>

               <p>I was standing in the shop at the side of the counter, I heard the glass break, clapped my eyes on the prisoner, and saw his face from the reflection of the candle, and his arm dragging out the stockings: I run and saw the prisoner running, he made a full stop, and turned round to look at some buckles, I caught him in my arms, we did not observe the blood till we came to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Raby. They correspond exactly by the ends, the broad arrow is not on them.</p>
               <p>Court. Do not you put the broad arrow on every part of the King's stores ? - No, my Lord, the broad arrow is put on them in the mill where they are rolled and made, if we were to put the broad arrow on them, it would cut them in two.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the broad arrow on every one of these? - It should be, my Lord, admitting the broad arrow to be on them, I could not swear that they belonged to the crown, they are frequently rejected from the office.</p>
               <p>Court. Till you do find the broad arrow it will not be deemed the property of the crown?</p>
               <p>Mr. Young. I suppose fifty men could not do it.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you find any broad arrow? - No, my Lord.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Line-house-reach, a man was coming with these iron hoops, he asked me to row him up, and then to lend him a hand into the cart, and follow the carman; I was very lame, he stopped at the half-moon in Brook's-Market, I took three or four out, they took me up, I desired to send for the man, they said no; a gentleman came by at the time, who is in court now.</p>

               <p>Season. He said he hoped I would be as favourable as I could.</p>
               <p>To Rock. Was any body else in the boat? - Nobody, nor at Arundel-stairs neither.</p>
               <p>Jury. How could you keep sight of him, as you was upon land? - He could not row very fast against the tide, I lost sight of him several times.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of Excise, I saw a mob in Leather-lane on the 13th of August, to the best of my remembrance; I knew the prisoner, he said the man that hired him was at a public-house just by, but the constable would not let him go. I offered any thing, and all the money I had, and even to leave my commission with the landlord, but they would not let him go.</p>
               <p>Court. Did it never occur to you to ask the man's name? - I went about my business.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you the public-house? - I think it was the half-moon, I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Season. My Lord, I was the first that had him in custody, and there was no such offer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mr. Young. Do you know that there were one hundred bundles delivered into the boat? - Yes, I can declare on a certainty from examining the clerk at the wharf's account, and the clerk of the cooperage.</p>

               <p>Martinius. What wine was this that was in the bladder and in the bottles? - I believe it was red wine.</p>
               <p>To Simeon. What wine was it and where was it taken from? - I know nothing more than the man's own confession; he unpacked it in the presence of the constable, I tasted it, and found it to be red-port, it has been in his possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any seal upon the bottles? - No my Lord.</p>
               <p>To Simeon. What did Buston say when you brought him back? - He appeared by his countenance as I thought to be guilty, he desired to speak with me in a private room; he then begged I would not prosecute him as we had got the property again, I told him I could not pass over it.</p>

The prisoner went down into the yard, and I went with the other to shew him the house; while I was going up stairs, he came up, and went into the parlour, and took the things mentioned in the indictment: I saw the watch that instant, I missed it directly. I went out and cried stop thief, and two men took them.</p>

She said I should be sent for a soldier, and that I had robbed her of a dollar and an half-crown piece, so we were both sent to prison. Next morning I was discharged.</p>

I shewed them some flowered muslins, then they desired to look at some plain, then returned again to the flowered, and had one yard and a quarter, at 6 s. a yard, and went away, nobody was in the shop at the time, and nobody came in after. I saw the muslin till they came in, and missed the muslins directly, I followed them into Bell-lane; they went into a public-house, and

               <p>About a month before I was robbed, two of my countrymen came with the prisoner to my house; I never saw him after till I was robbed. On Sunday night, between twelve and one, the 29th of July, I was laid down to sleep, I thought I felt something under the bed: I made the house fast, I got up and felt about, and went to bed again; my husband is at sea, I thought it was the cat, a considerable time after I heard something fall and break, and I heard a foot twice, it frightened me, as I had buried my sister; I called my mother, she brought a candle, I found the prisoner under the bed, as he came out one of my silver buckles was in his hand, I snapped it out of his hand, and my mother took the other out of his hand: the watch was hanging at the head of the bed, over the drawers, I said you have taken my husband's watch, he denied it, my mother advised him to give the watch and go about his business, and he would not give it: I kept him till the watchman came, he said, if you say another word I will cut your bloody liver out, then he immediately flew to the window, broke a pain of glass, and threw the screw out, threw up the window and leaped out, it was a one pair of stairs room, they are small houses, I never saw him but once before.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to begin your story with telling us that you had never seen him but once before; why did you suppose it would be enquired into? - Because I told it all as it happened, I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your mother here? - No; my mother is ill, she is always ailing, especially since my sister was buried.</p>
               <p>Court. She was able enough to get up and fetch you a candle? - Yes; in a very great fright.</p>
               <p>Court. What became of the man after he jumped out of the window? - I did not know his name, the men told me his name was Bob, I did not know his other name.</p>

               <p>I hope you will enquire into this woman's character, and see how she gets her bread, she is nothing but a common prostitute: I am a stranger in London, and when I first came to London I had a great deal of money, this woman picked me up, I used to work on board, and I was going to take a boat to go on board, and she called me in, I told her I had no money, and she gave me this watch, and told me to leave it for some money, or to take it with me; so I went to this watch makers, as I was in liquor I thought I had lost the case, and I gave it him to make another; I left that other watch with the man for half a guinea. This woman came to me in Newgate, and offered if I would leave her monthly money, and my will and power, she would make it up, and I would not agree to it.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. How came she to give you the watch without the case?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She gave me the case and all as I suppose, but there was another man began to quarrel with me, and in the quarrel I dropped the case, this man hit me over the head, this woman struck me twice and I jumped out of the window, I went on board and came on shore again, then I was taken up and sworn to.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never was in Newgate, I looked through the gate, a gentleman called me and said, do not go too near, I only went to the gate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She was in the ward indeed my Lord, and gave me 6 d. and the people would have killed her if it had not been for me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is that true? - I went withinside the gate.</p>
               <p>Court. You said just now you was not there? - I looked through the gate; he has been discharged from his ship, he has got a rupture.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it true that he hindered the other prisoners from hurting you? - No, my Lord, I only looked through the bars.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord there was Beaty and some more saw her and spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Akerman. Do you remember this woman coming into the prison? - My lord, it is impossible to remember, we let in two thousand people of a day, but Beaty can tell, he is not convicted of a felony, he is only for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>- BEATY brought from Newgate and sworn.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at that woman in the red cloak ? - I know the woman's face very well, I saw her last Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110047"/>Court. Where did you see her? - In the prison of Newgate, in the middle ward, the common side, she came there in company with another woman to see the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Was she up stairs or down? - She was up stairs, my lord, in the middle ward one pair of stairs, they all three came into the ward together as I was writing at the table.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you hear any conversation that passed between them? - The prisoner told me she was his prosecutrix, and I got up from where I was writing, I spoke to her, and she sent for a pot of beer, she said she came to settle with him, and that was what she wanted, that would satisfy her, that if he would pay her for some matter that had been committed, that she did not want to hurt him.</p>
               <p>Court. How long was she there? - The pot of beer could not come up, and the prisoners understanding her to be the prosecutrix, and knowing she had found a bill they went to use her ill, I begged of them not, as it would hurt the poor man.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is it true what this witness says? - I never went any further, but looked through the gates.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it is not true that you went into the prison, and through the gates?</p>
               <p>Beaty. It is a certain fact that she was there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Curiosity led me in there, I did not understand the place.</p>

I saw the prisoner's wife at a chandler's shop, says she, this is the way my husband robs his master, I am going to sell the soap, I took the soap which is the same that was at my master's house; the prisoner was called in and owned it.</p>

               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen, my wife was out late at night, in the morning we had some words, she said she would go and do something or other that would hang me before night; about two hours after I went to my work, this soap was brought and one piece had his stamp, he said it was his property. The beginning of May I bought a quarter of an hundred for my own use, and the 3d of August I bought one hundred weight for a friend, half of it was stamped, and the other half not; a little piece I kept for my own use, this is the very piece, I said I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Seagrave. What did his master accuse him of? - Of taking the soap.</p>
               <p>Court. But taking it in what way? - Of stealing it, I believe he confessed that he did steal it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say that he stole it? - He said that he took it.</p>
               <p>Court to Whitchurch, Did he buy soap of you? - Yes; my Lord, and it was a different kind of soap.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. The 11th of July about 7, Minshall came to me and desired me to go to his yard, as he suspected he had got a horse-stealer; I found the prisoner sitting in the yard and the horse by him, it was a dark bay horse, he said it was his own horse, he said he bought it at Hounslow first, then at Kent. I took him into custody, and before the justice I heard him say, he opened Smith's stable-door, and took the horse out about 4 o'clock; the horse was delivered to Smith that afternoon.</p>

               <p>I was present when Tenton said he had stole the watch, he said he sold it to Woodley; Woodley said he would give it me, but he had not bought it, one of these women had left it in his care; he then went into his bar, and took down a pint pot with a bit of paper, and this watch was wrapped up in it: Price said if it was his, there was T.P. marked in needle-work in the inside case.</p>

               <p>I rely on your mercy: I look on it I am in the hands of very wicked people. It was a very wet night, I went into Mr. Woodley's about ten o'clock, and stopped half an hour; the prisoner was much in liquor, he asked me to drink, and where I lived; I told him he might go up stairs, an acquaintance lived there, the bed was down and made; he said, God bless me, I could not have thought so good a bed had been in this distressed place; says he, what shall I give you to lay with you all night; I says, Sir, you could not go to offer any body less than a crown; he said, I think half-a-crown is enough; I said make me a present of that; he said, undress yourself first; I said no, but there is no harm done, go down stairs again. There was a shelf behind the door, there were a dozen and an half of Queen's ware plates, two large dishes, and a bowl; he staggered against the door, and threw down the shelf, and broke the things; a little girl in the next room told Brady and Denton they were broke: he refused to pay for them. He took up a poker and hit me, and he went to hit at the cupboard with the poker, we pulled the poker backwards, and he fell down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Rose called four witnesses who gave her a good character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Woodley called three witnesses who gave him a good character; and one of them said he saw him lend some money on a watch, but could not tell what watch.</p>
               <p>To Price. Did you see what was thrown down? - I heard them fall, and I turned round, they were a yard and an half from me; they were behind me, I never saw them till they fell, it seemed to be a board a yard long, and they seemed to be broke before, they seemed like white plates; there might be eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there a candle in the room when you went up? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoners; they robbed me on the 4th of July last, about nine or ten at night. I was at a private house in <placeName id="t17820911-40-crimeloc208">East-Smithfield</placeName>

I fell asleep, at about twelve they had taken my money, put it upon a chair, and had called in the watchman to look at it, they had a candle burning, they took eighteen guineas and two Spanish dollars. I awaked, and they asked me how that money came there, I asked them what business they had with it, and I went to bed again and staid till morning, I put up what money was left, there was forty guineas on the chair; I had fifty-six guineas, and a guinea in gold, and a guinea in silver, and two dollars in my breeches pocket, I earned it at sea; and at twelve o'clock they had taken eighteen guineas, and left me forty; that forty guineas was on the chair, I counted it, and missed the eighteen guineas and the two dollars. I went to bed with Sullivan again, the other went home; I only went to bed with one.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to go to bed again so quietly, when you found you had been robbed? - It was dark, and I had no where to go, I thought I might as well stay as go into the street.</p>
               <p>Court. When the watchman was there, and you found you had been robbed, why did not you charge him with them? - I do not know, I staid there all night; they did not take any thing more from me.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the watchman you had been robbed? - Yes I did, but they swore they had not seen a farthing of my money: I do not know the watchman's name. When I got up next morning, I asked this woman about my money, and she said she knew nothing of it, and she fetched the other, and they both swore very much, enough to fright me; I had them both taken up: I was sober and sensible, I had been drinking a little, I am sure I had the fifty-eight guineas in my pocket, and a knife and a key, which the landlord of the public-house brought me the next day out of his parlour, they were altogether in a jacket pocket, the money was in a cut purse.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutor. Was your coat all over mud? - No.</p>
               <p>- MAYNE sworn.</p>
               <p>I attend the public-office in East-Smithfield; Brady wanted to let the prisoners go, they were very much in liquor, I took them to the office and searched them; they had no money in their pockets nor in their rooms, except in Sullivan's room there was an old pair of woman's shoes just at the foot of the bed, I shook them, and heard some money jingle, and between the two soles I found four guineas in one of them, she said it did not belong to her.</p>

               <p>I have known the prosecutor nine months, he came to me and engaged me for the night, he was in liquor, and fell down in the mud; I asked him where he had been, he said he had been two hours and an half looking out for the house, he said two women had shoved him down. He sat down, and drank very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110052"/> much in the public-house, and went home with me, and this young woman went home with me; he sent for a pot of beer, the public-house was shut up, when I came back, this young woman stood at the top of the yard, she said he was a very comical sort of a man; when I went in again he was asleep, and the money on the chair, I waked him, and he said he had been robbed; I called in the watch, and the officer of the night, and told them that the man said he had been robbed; the officer desired him to put his breeches on, and come along with him to the watch-house, and he would take charge of us; he would not go, he said he was not robbed. This man is only set on by people who want to swear away my life.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Did you ever cohabit with that woman before? - Yes, once or twice.</p>

The landlord and landlady turned me out, and said where I was robbed, there I might go. He knocked me down six or eight times, and beat me as long as he liked. The woman owned to my watch, after she was taken up.</p>

               <p>I asked a young woman for a bed, and this gentleman was in her room, I went to a public-house with a young man, and he gave me 6 s.

               <p>My house was robbed on the 8th of August, I was from home; I left the house five minutes after four, and went to Mrs. Cotton with intention to spend the remainder of the day; about a quarter before seven a servant came from Mr. Kinder to inform me that something very bad had happened at my house. I went home immediately, and the maids were crying, by that time I found every thing in the greatest confusion, I went up stairs, I found every thing thrown out of the drawers, the drawers open and the locks broken and every thing thrown about the room, I then went into the room where the prisoner Charlotte was sitting on the bed in the back room, nothing had been touched in that room; the moment she saw me she clung round my neck and said, my dear mistress, and repeated it two or three times over, I said Charlotte do not mind for they have not hurt you; I staid some time with her, and casting my eyes towards the ground I saw the buckles were out of her shoes, why said I,

What was the value of all those things together ? - Two or three hundred pounds; the money was in the bureau in my chamber; the principal part of the place was in the front chamber, some of it in a closet in the chamber where I sleep, this cupboard was full of spoons and some silver salts, there was also below stairs some gravy spoons and a waiter, and some spoons which we have constantly in use, they were carried up in a basket every night, and brought down in the morning, the basket had been brought down in the morning with the plate, and carried up again, the plate was always kept there, there were several knife cases, the spoons were taken out; I have at different times lost many things; I had missed money out of my bureau: Charlotte lived with me at that time, the other servant did not; I suspected her fellow servant that then lived with me; Charlotte had lived with me almost three years.</p>

               <p>I went to the house of Mrs. Fortescue about six in the evening, before I went in, I went to the kitchen door and window to get the servants to come and open the door to me, being intimate in the family I did not ring; I went to the kitchen window, I saw no servants, I was going back to ring, I discovered the hall door was open, I had been a riding, I gave a smack with my switch; I heard a female voice or voices, which I thought to be fits, and seemed as though some woman was knocking her elbows and head against the floor; I was going up, and I discovered this hanger upon the harpsichord, (producing a hanger) that rather alarmed me, thinks I there may be thieves above, and they may be murdering either the ladies or the maids, I went to a neighbour and said, I wish you would let me have your servants to go back to Mrs. Fortescue's, there was nobody at home at this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110060"/> neighbours, but the footman I sent to Mrs. Courteen's for some some of his servants, I followed the servants in, they rushed up stairs, and then called to me to come up, I went up stairs, and found the rooms in the utmost confusion, things tumbled about, I went to the maids, in came Mr. Cotton, Mrs. Trehearn, and Mrs. Fortescue; Mr. Cotton and I agreed to take the maids, and examine them separate, we examined Charlotte first, we asked her in what manner the thieves attacked her, says she I was sweeping the room, and they came to me, one of them said, I will do for you, (I think she mentioned two or three) because you gave your mistress an account we intended to rob the house a fortnight ago, and hit her on the breast, under the left side, with the but end of a blunderbuss (her breast was not examined) and then tied her to the bed-posts on the floor, we asked her how happened the little spots of blood on her apron, I think she said, she believed that came from her nose, there was no blood, but a few drops on the bottom part of her apron, says I, how come you tied, she told me, the men tied her, where did they get ropes; she said they had master Fortescue's skipping rope, she said they had robbed her, she had a valuable pair of buckles, Mr. Cotton and me examined the other maid, and found their two accounts vary very much.</p>
               <p>Court. In what particular did they vary? - The other said she opened the door, a man knocked or rung at the door, and said he wanted her mistress, she immagined he wanted to look at the house which was to let, he had no sooner got in but one or two others rushed after him, and got possession, and obliged her to go up stairs, and shew them where the valuables were, one said a little after four, the other said between 4 and 5.</p>
               <p>Court. That is much the same? - One said they were gone about half an hour ago, and the other said they were gone an hour or two ago, when we had gone through their examination, Mr. Cotton and I privately agreed to secure them, as parties concerned.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not observe, Sir, in this account you have given any material variation in the accounts of the two maids, did they tell you at what time they were tied to their bed ? - I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>he return? - Between ten was much in liquor, and in my lap; and he went to a public-house and ordered some beer, and there I understand he threw some money about, so he did when he came in again, and I seven guineas, five gold, the piece of larger than a guinea, I took it to be a thirty-six shillings piece; in the meeting he told me had received 8 l. of his own money, and that the half-crowns and that piece of gold was not his property. On Saturday his sister was to come; he went and bought me a new hat, and Mrs. Goodall and he went somewhere, but where I do not know.</p>

               <p>Mr. Reynolds. A letter came to me from one of the Justices of the peace for Middlesex, informing me that the prosecutrix of the prisoner at the bar had been enticed into Newgate to the prisoner, and that the moment she came to him, a woman sitting upon the same bench with him had got up, and immediately accused her with robbing her of the cloak she had on, and an apron, and of various other articles, and that he was fearful of some trick in this business; it struck me as something very extraordinary, and I took some pains to enquire into it; I sent for the woman into my room and examined her very particularly and took down what she said, the next day the woman that accused her seemed to be very plain in her story and to have the appearance of truth, I desired my Lord Mayor yesterday in the afternoon to appoint a meeting to examine into this business, and after we had been with the people for about four hours, the prosecutrix in this business acknowledged that what the woman had accused her of concerning the robbery was true, and that she would restore the goods; and the keeper of the Compter went and found the goods as she directed him, she therefore appears to be a very improper evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord I wish to be indulged in a few sentiments.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. You need not say any thing.</p>

               <p>Where were the other six? - I do not know; it was pretty nigh eleven, as bright a night as ever I saw, but I did not see any moon to my knowledge, but a very fine light night, they were with me four or five minutes, as near as I can recollect.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110071"/>Prisoner Counsel. No moon that night? - I believe there was not.</p>
               <p>Believe, why do not you know? - I did not see; I have not the least doubt in the world but they are the men.</p>
               <p>How near was you to the man with the one eye? - Close to him.</p>
               <p>He let you look at him? - The man behaved very civil, I assure you, I received no damage.</p>
               <p>No, I do not believe you did; you went afterwards to the King's-head in St. Giles's? - Yes Sir.</p>
               <p>Who keeps that? - Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Did you sit down to drink at all? - Yes I did.</p>
               <p>Were not the prisoners sitting drinking in the house? - No Sir, upon my soul.</p>
               <p>Your soul is gone long ago; how long did they stay ? - As soon as ever I saw this Vercol, he put me all in a trouble, I went and told the constable of the night my story.</p>
               <p>Then these men and you never were drinking together in the least in the house? - No Sir, not at all.</p>
               <p>What box did you sit in? - They sit in the box facing me.</p>
               <p>Then you had a full view, and you told the story of being robbed? - No, I did not Sir, I said nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Then upon your oath you did not sit down in the box with these two men, and tell them the story of your robbery? - I told young Stevenson out of door, I did not tell him in the box.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him that these were the men? I told him that was the man, one of them.</p>
               <p>But you are as clear about one as the other ? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How came you not to tell them about Past? - I do not know whether Past was at Mr. Reynolds's that night; I did not trouble my head with any body but Vercol.</p>
               <p>Did not you take up this man in liquor there? - Mr. Reynolds came and said all out.</p>
               <p>Just now you said there was not a man there? - No, I said not a man drinking, I had some words with Mr. Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoners account before the justice for where they were all the day of the robbery? - I really cannot tell, I did not mind that over and above so much; I am very clear of the men, positive of the men, God forbid I should offer to hurt mankind for the sake of a half-penny or a farthing.</p>
               <p>During the time you drove for Mr. Davis how often was you robbed? - Never.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Davis that you had been robbed of your fare frequently? - Never told him so in my life, so help me God, once, I vow to God I never did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis is here present? - I do not care.</p>

I pulled off my coat and waistcoat, and laid them on a chair by the bedside, my fob being bad, I put my watch, chain, and seal into my side pocket, and I thought it was safe there; we went to bed agreeable together, upon which the prisoner at the bar said she would fetch Elizabeth Young up, Young came up, and we agreed together; Young asked me what I intended to give her, I put my hand into my pocket, I had a guinea and an half, and a silver sixpence, and four or five halfpence; I shewed her what small change I had, I gave it her, which I belive was the value of 8 d. or 9 d. I told her I would give her the remainder when I changed my gold below stairs. In putting on my cloaths I missed my watch, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110078"/> I charged Young with it, in searching her I could not find it on her; the prisoner absconded and I kept Young till she told me where the prisoner lived, and we went and found her at her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Court. It was when Young was in the room that you missed your watch? - Yes, we searched the prisoner and found nothing upon her, then we carried her to justice Sherwood's, I told her if she would confess where my property was, I would pay all expences and get her a coach to her own habitation, as she was in such a wretched condition at that time, till at last she confessed she had pawned it for a guinea and a half at one Mr. Lieufe's in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Court. This was after you had promised her that in case she would confess you would pay all expences and send her home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. A confession obtained by promises ought not to operate against the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Pray what do you call a little drop? - I had drank some gin with these women but I was sensible; when I got in I took and pulled my pouch out.</p>

               <p>Court to Welch. Are you sure the coachman was one of the persons that gave charge of him? - I am sure of that to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Court. What is it to take an oath? - To tell nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>And if you do not speak the truth, what is the consequence? - It is a very bad thing.</p>
               <p>Sworn. I live with Mr. Griffin; I was left to take care of the shop on the 8th of July in the afternoon; as soon as Mrs. Griffin was gone out, the prisoner and another woman came in and asked for half an ounce of worsted, the prisoner did not like the colour; she came behind the counter, and said the gentleman used to serve her from there, she kept her eyes on the parlour; there stood a glass by the window, and a chair and two cloaks on it; she went up to the other woman and whispered; and she asked me to let her look at her eyes in the glass, she had two very black eyes; I said I would fetch it, and they both followed me into the parlour, the prisoner stood at the window with the glass and talking to me, and asking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110086"/> me if she should not lose her eyes while the other pocketed the cloak, I heard something rustle like silk, I saw her with the other cloak in her hand, I saw her throw it down, I looked her full in the face, and she said, child what do you look at me for? we have not any thing, and I said, I thought there were two cloaks on the chair, and they went away; a gentleman came in, and I ran to my mistress. The prisoner held the glass, and I am sure she could see what the other did, the prisoner was one of the two; she is very remarkable, I have seen her several times in mobs in the streets.</p>

               <p>I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Griffin. I suppose the value of this cloak is not quite forty-two shillings? - If I should say it was not, I should say it in the behalf of the prisoner.</p>

I said pretty well, that was all that passed.</p>
               <p>To Haywood. How is that? - The coachman stopped, and Anderson was near the coach, he asked me if I bought household furniture, I thought he wanted to buy some, or sell some, I cannot say whether Woodson did speak to me, he might say some particular words, I was called in a hurry up stairs, and I have partly forgot what was said.</p>
               <p>Court. Suppose you remember any part of it as you only forgot it partly, tell us the part you remember? - He did say there were goods in the coach, and if they were not bought he would throw them into the street.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110091"/>Did not he ask you to buy them; did not he press you to buy them? - The words said were, that I might as well have them as any body else, what they were I never saw, nor would have any thing to do with them.</p>

               <p>Court. Do not fancy that you come here to entertain me or any body else, you ought rather to be ashamed of yourself; tell your story decently, Sir. - That I know well, I said, says I, I must go down to the necessary says I, and take care of them two bundles which I leave among you.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did you leave the two bundles with? - Them two women.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you leave the two bundles with the women that had robbed you of the money? - Yes, they kept me in the necessary for half an hour, for they fastened me in till I was quite saint, at last I heard somebody open the door gently, the people below began to beat and abuse me, and cut a terrible place in my head, it was not well for three weeks; I cannot tell who it was that used me so, I was in such confusion, thinking I had been so weak to go up to these women, I was quite raving mad as it were.</p>
               <p>Court. You was glad to get away? - They drove me out; I never recovered my things again; in about an hour, or an hour and a half afterwar ds I took up the women; a young man picked me up, and came up to me and said, I can tell you where your bundles are and the people, I went to his master who is a Brewer, he said you shall not want for money, here is half a crown; we went to the justices, and in half an hour they brought in three out of these four.</p>
               <p>Counsel for prisoner Carey. Why master Dolly, you do not seem to be sensible of the ridiculous figure you cut here at all? - How so.</p>
               <p>That you was such a fool to go with these women in the manner you did? - I know it very well, I have been sensible of that long before this.</p>
               <p>You drank some gin too? - Yes, two or three half pints.</p>
               <p>Drunk when you went in? - No.</p>
               <p>But you was not sober? - No.</p>
               <p>But very drunk when you came out? - To be sure.</p>
               <p>Then having been robbed of your money, you thought the safest place you could leave your property in, was with the people that had robbed you? - I thought to get the money if I left the things.</p>

The prisoner Layfoe was in the same room, sitting on a chair near the door; he had this file in his hand, (producing a file), and when he saw me he immediately dropped a piece of money that he was filing the edges of like a sixpence; the file he laid on a chair, there lay upon the chair by the side of him a parcel of unfinished sixpences and shillings, in the window near Weatherby these lay, which appear to have been already filed, (more sixpences and shillings) on the window where Weatherby was at work, were two sixpences and a shilling the sixpences and shilling had been filed, and rubbed with this cloth and sand-paper (produces the shilling that Weatherby was at work on) there are four shillings I that found in the back window in the same room, and three sixpences by them. We found crucibles, metal, sand paper, and aquafortis, and files; here are the patterns from which the good ones are made; the sand was already damped, and some of it had been used, there was some metal on the mantle-piece, the crucibles were quite hot; the two prisoners were without their coats, Weatherby had his shirt sleeves tucked up, and Layfoe had his coat tucked up, but not his shirt; one of them had his slippers on, I cannot say which, their hands were dirty: I saw them both very plainly at work, one had a sixpence, and the other had a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. I think you say the outward door was wide open? - Yes; I let myself in.</p>
               <p>The door of the room was shut, but not fastened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And they used no violence? - Behaved as civil as could be; they said, it was all over.</p>
               <p>Did they not tell you they had been playing at skettles? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they not tell you the room belonged to one Cresswell? - No; I have heard it belonged to him, I have seen him once since.</p>
               <p>Why any other man might not have taken up a shilling as well as this Weatherby? - I do not know, I should not chuse to do it myself.</p>
               <p>You are wiser than him, do you swear that when you came into the room, these men were actually at work? - I do swear it positively, Sir.</p>
               <p>I should suppose a very innocent man might rub shilling ? - Weatherby was rubbing a shilling with them nippers; he said he was a dead man, and it did not signify making any words.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner; I knew nothing till the pawnbroker's lad brought the handkerchief to the Rotation office, I saw it once before, but I did not pawn it; the pawnbroker said the prisoner pawned it. I know nothing about the taking of them, Sir, the prisoner told me he was distressed for a guinea, to take some things out of pawn that were lent him by a woman, I borrowed a guinea and took them out, that was three days before he was taken up, and they were put into different pawnbrokers to receive more money on them: the prisoner paid me the guinea, and took the remainder of the money; they were all at one pawnbroker's. There was a marcella petticoat flounced, a silk handkerchief and hood, six muslin aprons, five shifts, one shut, some pocket handkerchiefs, but I cannot recollect the number, and a pair of silk stockings, these things were pawned at other pawnbrokers; I pawned them all but the shirts.</p>
               <p>Court. Were all the things that you pawned at the other pawnbrokers taken out at the desire of the prisoner? - Yes, Sir; from the first pawnbroker's they were taken out by his desire, he said that a country woman gave them him to pledge for her, and he wished to take them out, and pawn them at other pawnbrokers, for more.</p>
               <p>After he was taken up you went with them, and shewed them where the things were pawned? - I did.</p>

I have his countenance full in my mind, I know him again, without any exception; his countenance was so imprinted on my mind, that my conscience is very clear in averring he is the man: he gave me three cuts across the hand, the breadth of my fingers asunder, the tendons were all laid bare.</p>

               <p>HANNANEEL DA COSTA sworn.</p>
               <p>On Sunday the 28th of July, I desired to be reminded that I had a draft to pay for 220 l. to be sent from Messrs. Hankey to Mr. Blands, and desired a draft might be wrote, and left in the banker's book, and that I might not go out the next morning without signing it; on the next morning when I came down stairs, I found the prisoner already in the compting house, he reminded me of this draft; I asked him if any of the other clerks were come, he said none, I said then it is time enough to sign it; the clerks usually come about ten, this was a little after nine: he came a second time and reminded me of this draft to be signed, and I told him to stay; he came a third time, and said he was going to fetch some bills, which had been left for acceptance on Friday, and was going by the door, and would carry that; on which I signed it, and gave it to him to place it at Mr. Blands, to whom I had made it payable: I went out, I did not tell the prisoner to receive the draft in banknotes, nor did I say you must nor receive it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell him either to leave the note at Blands, or to get the money and carry it to Blands? - He asked me no questions, and I cannot tell but it was one or the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it that it was the intention of your mind that it should be so, or did you tell the prisoner in words that he should do one or the other? - It is usual in the mercantile line, to send drafts to one banker to receive it at another.</p>
               <p>Court. But there was nothing upon the face of the draft itself in which Bland was any way concerned, therefore it must be by your positive orders that he must do one or the other? - I gave him no positive orders, the word money was never mentioned; I think I might say, take this draft and carry it to Bland's.</p>
               <p>Are you certain that nothing passed from you to the prisoner, which imported that he was to carry either the draft or the money to Bland's ? - Positive.</p>
               <p>Should you know the draft again? - Yes. (The draft read.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I believe you have got most of the money again ? - Seventy pounds; the first I heard of his being taken was from himself, that the major part of my property was safe, and that he had left the remainder with his wife; I have had 70 l.</p>
               <p>The other I believe is safe ? - I should hope so.</p>
               <p>It is in the hands of some officer or gentleman ? - It is in the hands of the court.</p>
               <p>You advertized him not as being robbed; you had no conception of that then? - I cannot say the words of the advertizement.</p>

The woman was pulling off her petticoat, a very greasy dirty petticoat; in the room were laying some halfpence, in a pocket, a paper, and in a waistcoat some more, they were all counterfeits; in the breeches that were laid by very dirty and greasy, was one of Rothwell's knee-buckes.</p>
               <p>Court. How do you know that? - He was buckling the fellow one, and I compared them, the breeches and waistcoat appeared just to be taken off.</p>

               <p>I rung at the bell, and was answered by a young woman in the one pair of stairs, I bid her open the door, she said she could not and would not; while I was arguing with her, I heard the window break, and Carpmeal cryed out, here they all are, they are come out of the cellar; we got in at the parlour window, I went into the cellar, there was a hole at the bottom of the stairs, there was a quantity of halfpence, 5 l. or 6 l. worth, (the half-pence produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to Clarke. Are they counterfeit halfpence? - I should think they were.</p>

               <p>Court. Nobody knows better than you do, you know the business of coining, pretty near as well as any of them? - Yes, my Lord, they were, the large press was in one cellar, the small press in another; the large press was fixed in one cellar, and that blank between the dies, and a candle burning by the side of it; there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110106"/> several more pair of dies which are here, ( produced) in the other cellar there was a cutting-out press, and these pieces of copper laying near the press, and only one row of cecils cut out, a quantity of blanks, together with some sheets of copper; somebody must have been at work, as nobody was in the house but them; where they cut out the blanks there is generally four or five.</p>

               <p>I acknowledge myself guilty; the young man came to see his sister, and Mrs. Child was in bed.</p>
               <p>To Clarke. Did any part of the house seem to belong to Mrs. Child? - That was doubtful to me, when we came to go away she took and locked up all the things in one room, and gave us the key; her apron was dirty, I do not say she had been at work.</p>

               <p>Jury How was the bed? - It was unmade, this was in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Then, the time you was there, you took no particular observation? - I never expected to be called upon.</p>

               <p>What made you listen to the conversation ? - I was going to address the prisoner and he interrupted me.</p>
               <p>You made no minute of this conversation? - I did not, my attention was drawn at the time towards the prisoner, because I was going to speak to him; I am not perfectly sure as to those being the very words, but they were to that effect.</p>

               <p>Where was this conversation? - It was just going out, just as they came out to me, out at the door, at the Bank door.</p>
               <p>Where there? - Pretty near the outward door going into Bartholomew-lane.</p>
               <p>And nobody else near? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You did not come to town on purpose for this business? - I did not, there are people in town that can justify what I say.</p>

               <p>- MILLS sworn.</p>
               <p>I have conversed with the prosecutor two or three different times in the middle of August about this business; I have dealt with Mr. Groves some time; I never saw the prisoner before now; Groves said if he could get his money, he did not care if the prisoner went to the devil; he said he had got a note for 120 l. and this money was in part of it, and if he had paid him his interest, he should never have thought about it; it was agreed to take the money from a Mr. Dupree, but a Mr. Shackelford came down to my house and said, he would lay me five guineas he would have Berthaud hanged, and he would have him hanged if his brother would not: it was owing as I understood, to this Shackelford that the prosecution was set on foot; for Groves seemed very sorry, and said, he would not have a man hanged upon any account, and that if it had not been for Sheffield he would have taken the money.</p>
               <p>Counsel for Prosecution. You made no minute of this conversation? - No.</p>

               <p>To Groves. Did you ever say in the presence of Mills that the prisoner might have kept the money? - If he had paid me the interest I should not have known any thing of the matter.</p>

               <p>Court. But that is not the question, Did you say, that if he had paid you the interest of the money, he might have kept the money, you would not have prosecuted him at all? - I never said any thing of that.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you say so or not Groves? it an easy question, why do you hesitate? - I said so far as this, if he had brought me the interest, I should have known nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the reason you do not give an answer to the question? - Yes, Sir, if he had given me the interest of the money, I said so to him, I said, if the prisoner had brought me the interest -</p>
               <p>Have not you heard what Mr. Mills has said?</p>
               <p>Mills. He said there was a debt about 30 l. besides the money, which would very high make up 100 l. if Mr. Dupree or any body would pay it, he would not hurt him.</p>
               <p>Groves. I said, I would not hurt the man if I could help it; but I could not help it: I never said, that money was in part of the money.</p>
               <p>Mills. I will challenge Mr. Groves if he can say I have told one syllable of untruth.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Messrs. Drummonds; on Saturday morning a waiter brought a letter, which I gave to the person appointed to open letters; he said he was to have five guineas; Mr. Aston came some little time after, and said the servant had robbed him; I told him we had paid two drafts, and shewed him the drafts, which he declared were not his handwriting. On the Monday morning a person who is one of the witnesses came with an order for the payment of ten guineas; I have the order; I think Mr. Chaplin brought it, he wrote his name, at my request. (The order read as in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Aston's hand-writing? - I thought I did, but I was deceived.</p>
               <p>Do you know it sufficiently so as to swear to it? - I think I do.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear whether it is Mr. Aston's hand-writing or not? - No, I cannot, tho' at the same time I believe it is not.</p>
               <p>You are acquainted with Mr. Aston's hand-writing, are you? - I have seen him write several times.</p>
               <p>Why do you not believe that to be his hand-writing? - Because I have compared them, and the difference strikes me more forcibly.</p>
               <p>Did you pay the money? - I did not, we detained the person that brought it, and sent for a constable.</p>

The prosecutor followed him into a court, and then they searched for about an hour; then they found the prisoner at a house in that court: while they were getting into the first room, the other companion came out of another room; and they found the purse between the bedding and the tick; it is the same purse, he never got any of his money again: he is sure the prisoner is the man who snatched the purse. They had only three pints of ale in the whole, and he had not above half a pint to his share, as they drank none of the last pint, and he was very sober.</p>

               <p>I belong to the excise. On the 1st of this month I was near Northumberland-house, and I saw this foreigner and another man run up to two men, and he charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110115"/> them with robbing him of fourteen guineas; neither them were the prisoner. While we were finding them, the prisoner came down the court and asked what was the matter: the foreigner laid hold of him, and said he belonged to them. He spoke bad English, and whether he said fourteen or twenty guineas I do not know; he said he had been robbed by them men, first, that they were the persons that robbed him.</p>
               <p>Court. How did the prosecutor describe it; let him speak it as he did, to the witness? -</p>
               <p>Greenough. He said dey take a de money.</p>
               <p>Court. Ask the prosecutor if he saw that man, Greenough? - Not that he remembers.</p>
               <p>Greenough. Ask him if he does not remember my assisting him to take the men? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Court. I dare say not: I have a great mind to commit this witness; it was impossible for that foreigner to make him understand; I have no doubt but this is one of the gang.</p>
               <p>Constable. My Lord, I detected this witness under the table at the justice's, talking to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Jury. It will be a great justice done him, I believe, to commit him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg the prosecutor may be asked if he knows the nature of an oath, and the consequences of taking a false oath? - He says he knows it very well.</p>

He said the woman's name was Wood, and she had pawned some buckles, at Mr. Young's a pawnbroker, in Leather-lane: I went there, and Young shewed me seven pair of buckles, which he found on her, which I knew to be my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110117"/> own; I was sorry to find these buckles pawned by this woman, because I placed the utmost confidence in her husband: we put the woman in custody, and I and the officer went directly to Wood's house, in Coppice-row, facing Cold-bath-fields; he opened the door to me, I went in and found him at supper with his children; it was then ten o'clock, in the evening, or rather more. I said to the prisoner, here is a very unfortunate affair has happened, let me speak to you; I did it out of delicacy and feeling for my man, whom I had occasion to respect; I took him up into his garret, the work-shop, I told him then that his wife had been to pledge some of my buckles, and that she was in custody; I asked him what right he had to have finished buckles in his house; he said with a great deal of tremor and fear, and some degree of hesitation, though he stammers a good deal, he said, he had taken from me the seven pair of buckles. I told him I was very sorry, I rebuked him much; you know I have been injured in my property for years past, I never thought you was the man, I am sorry to find you are; he went down on his knees, in great confusion, begged my pardon, hoped to God I would forgive him for his family's sake, and said he should be totally ruined; if I would forgive him, he would make me great restitution. I told him he knew I had always told my men, and especially at our annual dinner, that as they never wanted work, I would prosecute the first man I found out; and I was determined to search the house, I told him to sweep up his filings; he had twenty-four pair under hand, he begged to carry his youngest child to Clerkenwell prison to his mother, who suckled it; we went there, we searched the house, and found as in the indictment, the value of the whole is 422 l. they all bore my name, except three pair; they were examined by myself, and my foreman, and they are all my own, I can swear to them all.</p>
               <p>Court. How could so very large a quantity be gone together without being missed? - I have been in a large way of business; it has been the usage of the shop not to weigh it; I had suspected some of my men, and in the year 1777 I took two or three houses in the adjoining court, and so shifted those men I disliked, but reserved the prisoner as a man I respected from his diligence. I lost these things in the course of ten years.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. I understand you are one of the greatest buckle makers in London? - Indeed I am not.</p>
               <p>But one of them you are; now what mark is there, Mr. Smith? - There is, or should be, G. S. on one side, and the hall mark on the other.</p>

               <p>Some of them might be sold out of your shop? - They might, I have sold many hundred pair; he acknowledged taking the seven pair.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner ever buy from you to the amount of between six and seven hundred pair of buckles? - He never bought but one pair for his wife's wear.</p>

               <p>On the 12th of July the prisoner came into Mr. Farrer's shop to look at some lace; I shewed her some, another person came in, they did not appear to have any connection; the prisoner put a card under her cloak; I saw her; she bought half a yard, and paid for it; I let her go out of the shop; I took her, and saw the card drop on the floor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not he stop me then? - I did not think of it then.</p>
               <p>Court. That is a very odd reason indeed, that you should see her steal your master's lace, and not think of it. - Yes, Sir, I thought of it, but I thought I would let her alone to see whether she would take it or no.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you say so at first?</p>
               <p>(The lace produced and proved.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent; they took every thing off but my shift.</p>
               <p>Court. Was that after she dropped the card? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. For what purpose was she taken up stairs then and stripped? - To see if she had any thing more.</p>
