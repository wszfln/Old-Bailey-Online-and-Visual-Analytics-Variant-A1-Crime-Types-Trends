                  </hi>. I reside with my father, at 49, Westmoreland-place, City-road—on 6th November, I was servant to Mrs. Gedley, of 5, Artillery-court, Chiswell-street—on 6th November I was sent by her to Mr. Thorpe's, in Bunhill-row—it is about ten minutes walk—about ten minutes past 6, I was coming back with 4 mantles in a bundle which had been given to me at Mr. Thorpe's—when I got into Bunhill—row I saw the prisoner—he came up to me—I had seen him in the early part of the afternoon—I had been two or three times to Mr. Thorpe's—him walking up and down Bunhill<lb/>row once or twice, I can hardly recollect which—there was somebody with him; that was about 4 o'clock—as I was coming back with the mantles, about ten minutes past 6, he came behind me, and tried to snatch the bundle from me, but I held it so tight he could not get it away—I began to scream, and he caught me by the throat, and tried to throttle me, and dragged me across the road—I fell down at the corner of the court where he dragged me to, and then he got the bundle—before he got the bundle the other one who was with him came and gave me a kick at the side of the head—I did not see so much of that man as I did of the prisoner—he was like some one that I had seen before—I have seen a good many persons like him—I tried to follow that man, but he got away—on the 11th I was taken to the station-house by a policeman, and then saw several persons—I picked out the prisoner as the person who had assaulted me—I heard the charge read over to him, and he said he could prove that he was at his young woman's house from 2 o'clock till 10 in the evening—I had previously given a description of the man to the officer.</p>

I am the wife of William Downey, and keep a lodg<lb/>ing-house in Green Arbour-court, Bell-alley, Goswell-street—the two prisoners lodge with me; they sleep in separate rooms—on Saturday afternoon, 29th November, Merritt returned from his work between 2 and 3 o'clock, washed himself, and had his tea—he then left, and came in again just, as the officers came, about 8 o'clock—on the Saturday evening before that both the prisoners were at home, and slept at home; I mean the Saturday that Merritt was taken—on Saturday, 29th, they did not sleep at home; they both went out between 8 and 9 that evening, and did not return that night—they came in at half-past 8 next morning (Sunday) together, and brought a steak with them—they did not go out at all on Sunday—I make their beds—there was no necessity to make them on that Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of the City of London—on 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. October, I was called upon to examine the four quarters of a cow; the three inspectors were there at the time—the meat was in a very bad state from disease—it was emaciated, charged with disease, serum, as they term it, wet—the animal had suffered from inflammation of the lungs and pleura at the time of death—the person who had dressed the meat, had removed the diseased portion as far as he possibly could; that is the pleura lining the ribs—the surface had been smeared with warm fat, which gives it a some<lb/>what smooth appearance, resembling the natural condition of the pleura—the meat was not fit for human food—the diseased state of the animal was, in my opinion, perceptible to the eye of an experienced person—it was condemned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the matter with this cow? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Inflamma<lb/>tion of the lungs and pleura—the kidneys were very much enlarged; that arises from many causes—it arises from congestion of the kidneys—I have noticed that cows which have been kept in cow-houses, and fed on uncom<lb/>mon food, have very great enlargement of the kidneys—from the emaciated condition of the animal, I should say that inflammation must have lasted a week or ten days; an active inflammation resulting afterwards in very severe appearances—I believe the cow had been killed.</p>

I have been for six years employed in Her Majesty's dockyards, Portsmouth and Woolwich, but marrying young, and having a sickly wife, I was unable to save but little of my earnings; so, when the Admiralty came to discharge so many of us, it found me with a wife and two children dying. I buried them, and endeavoured to get em<lb/>ployment, but could not. I applied to the parish; they gave me stone-breaking. I earned eightpence in four days, and was then obliged to give it up, my hands being so bad. Hearing that my mother's brother had a farm at Highgate, I came to find him out. I went into this field, where the hay<lb/>stacks belonging to the prosecutor were standing, for a necessary purpose. After that, I was lighting my pipe, when the stack caught fire. I was frightened, and ran away. I pray you to have mercy on me; I have three small children, and no one but the parish to see to them when I am gone.</p>

I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—on the night of 9th December, I saw the prosecutor there—he was wounded in four places—one wound was over the left shoulder, about two inches in length, and an inch in depth—one on the same side, between the eighth and ninth rib, about an inch and a half in length, and the same in depth; a small one on the right side of the abdomen, and one on the back of the left-hand—they were wounds likely to be made with a sharp knife—they were incised wounds—he bled a good deal—they were not serious wounds, but were near dangerous places.</p>

I am a cab-driver, of 10, King-street, Commercial-road, Lambeth—about twenty minutes to 1 on the morning of 8th Decem<lb/>ber, I was driving my four-wheel cab in Parliament-street; Mr. and Mrs. Emanuel and their daughter were inside, and Amelia Adams and a child were sitting by me on the box—I was on the near side going towards Charing-cross—two omnibuses going towards Westminster, had passed just before me, and a Hansom's cab, driven by the prisoner came, meeting me on the wrong side, going at the rate of twelve or fourteen miles an hour—I hallooed as hard as I could, but he took no notice—I do not know whether he heard me or not; the rain was coming down very hard—he struck my cab on the near side of the dash-board; between-my cab and the pavement—it upset my cab, and knocked us all off—I called for help, and a constable came and pulled the child out and took her to the hospital—she was not quite dead then—her name was Harriet Amelia Adams—Amelia Adams was also injured; she was in the Hospital with the child—she is the person I describe as my wife—I saw the prisoner a few minutes afterwards, but can hardly tell whether he was drunk or sober, for I was worried.</p>

I am a cab-proprietor—on the evening of this accident, I was being driven in the prisoner's cab, coming from Westbourne-grove and going to Camberwell—he took me up near the Royal Oak, about two miles and a quarter from the scene of the accident—a collision with another cab took place in Parliament-street—my cab was going towards Westminster-bridge, and the other cab towards Charing-cross, on the near side—it crossed from behind two omnibuses which were going towards Charing-cross, and got on the off-side of my cab, which caused the collision—the four-wheel cab came from behind the omnibuses, and seeing the Hansom coming down the road, of course it went to cross to its wrong side, which it did, and ran against the near shaft of the Hansom, and then the four-wheel went on the wrong side and <hi rend="italic">toddled</hi> over.</p>

I am a watchman at the Old-buildings—I saw this accident happen—I was standing at a doorstep, and could see right across the street—I was right opposite the cabs at the time of the collision, and on the park side, nearest to the four-wheeled cab—I saw two <hi rend="italic">busses</hi> on the park side, going towards Charing-cross—the four-wheel'd cab was behind them, and the Hansom on the other side, next the Thames, coming towards Parlia<lb/>ment House—the collision was more towards the Thames side of the road than the middle, but it was about the middle—the four-wheeled cab attempted to pass behind the <hi rend="italic">busses</hi>, to get past them—he went rather too much out of his road, and got into collision with the Hansom coming down—they appeared to be both going one pace—I saw the driver of the Han<lb/>som's cab after the collision—he appeared much flurried by the fall—the other cabman was flurried too, and excited from the fall, not from drink—I talked to him a good deal after that—the Hansom's driver did not seem drunk—I only saw him before the collision for a minute or so, as the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> was between me and him—the Hansom's cab was nearest to me when the collision took place—it was <hi rend="italic">obligated</hi> to go by, to clear itself—it only de<lb/>viated, as I thought, to avoid the four-wheel, which came out from behind the <hi rend="italic">busses.</hi>

                  </hi> (?) I am a single woman, living at 7, John-street, West, Islington—I know Clements—I lodged at his house, about five or six weeks back, at Mary Ann-terrace, Bethnal-green—I have seen Yates there three times—I remember his telling Clements something about Kemble and Austin—I was in the back parlour, and the two prisoners in the front—I heard him say, "George, they're caught," but he did not mention the names—Clements' name is George—I know something about Austin, because Clements showed me the newspaper—I made no reply, but read the paper, and saw that they were taken—he said, "Look that over," pointing to the article which I was to read—it was a whole newspaper, not a part of one, and it contained the account of Kemble and Austin—I do not remember the name of the other man—I heard nothing more pass that night—Yates came there again after that—Clements said one night, when he came home, "I shall put it away till it is all settled," referring to some property that was in the house—that was all be said—nobody made any reply to it—Yates was not there then—I heard nothing about the property till Clements said that—he said it to me and to his wife—we were not talking about it—we were not talking about the men being taken, nor did he say anything about that—I cannot say how the conversation began, or how he came to say he should put the property away—nothing was said about Yates—I have seen this dressing-case at Clements' house—that was part of the property which he said he should put away—it was one of the boxes, and it was there when he said he should put it away till it was all settled.</p>

               <p>mean to say that you had all these things of Yates?"—he said, "yes, I did"—I asked him how long he had known Yates, and he said, "About nine years"—we then left the house, and as we came outside with Clements, we told him that we were going to his mother's, that he might accompany us if he liked, or he might be taken to the police-station—he said he should like to go; so we went to his mother's house—I told his mother that he had said he left some property there—she said he had done nothing of the sort—he then said, "Mother, I have told the truth; you had better give up what is left"—his mother then pointed to a writing-desk, in which were the fittings of this dressing-case—I asked him who he had bought them of—he said, "I had them of Yates"—there were also two or three little memorandum books, and a pencil-case—Kemble, Austin, and Horn, were convicted here last November Sessions—I was in that case—there were six indictments against them for stealing property from different gentlemen's houses, in which cases they used a very fleet horse and gig—one was sentenced to fifteen years, another to four years—Yates' wife was tried then and acquitted—I was in search of Yates at that time, and had been from 13th October—I went fre<lb/>quently to the house where he had formerly lived, and could find nothing of him—I was in search of him till 9th December, when I took him—I told him that I took him for being concerned with Kemble and others, who had been convicted, for robberies, mentioning Mr. Bowley's as one, of 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of jewellery; that Simpson had stated that he received the property from him, and pledged it for him—Yates said he had never given him any property to pledge—I said, "What made you abscond, for I have been looking for you, and could not find you ever since they were tried?"—he merely said, "I abscond"—he did not say "Yes," or "No"—I took him in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a smith's labourer, of No. 1, Gregg's-court, Minories—on 25th December, I was walking in Whitechapel, towards Ald<lb/>gate—I looked on the other side of the road, and saw a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> there—I crossed over, and saw Deitz on the top of a man named Murphy, who was on the ground—Deitz was striking him with something which he had in his right hand, like the blade of a knife—I called out, "He has got a knife," and then Henrie ran and attacked me—we had a scuffle—he gave me three or four successive blows on the top of my head, which wounded my head—it bled, and a surgeon was sent for from the police-station to bandage it up—I had not done anything to Henrie—I only hallooed out that Deitz had a knife, and then he attacked me—Deitz did not say anything to me—he did not leave the other man to come to me—my head is not well yet—the sticking-plaister is on it yet—I suffered from it a good long while.</p>

I live at 13 1/2, Shoe-lane, City—about 2 o'clock, on the night of 28th December, or morning of 29th, I had left a friend in the Commercial-road, and was coming home—I had just reached the London end of the Commercial-road, about the sugar bakeries, and was at the corner of a street, when a man suddenly darted at me, and struck me on the mouth, cutting both my lips very severely, both top and bottom, and my tongue after<lb/>wards became very sore—his hands were instantly in my left-hand waistcoat pocket, but there was nothing there—I just had power to call "Police," and he was in the constable's arms momentarily—I cannot say that I was exactly sober, but I was not drunk, as my writing on the charge sheet will prove—I walked quite straight—I am sure his hand was in my waistcoat-pocket; but what money I had was in my trousers' pocket.</p>

               <p>and spoke to him—about half-an-hour afterwards I was new the same spot, and saw him rush out and strike the prosecutor, who had just time to cry out "Police," and I had the prisoner in custody before he knew where he was—I could have seen if the prosecutor had struck him first, and am satisfied that he did not, because I was watching.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner.</hi>) I am sixteen years old this January—before I was taken into custody I lived at my father's in Fenchurch-street, and was in the employment of Messrs. Plank and Smith—I went into their service in September last as office boy at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—in November, in consequence of losing the key of one of the cupboards, a new one was made—with that key I opened one of the drawers in a writing table in my employer's office—from that drawer I took the key of the iron safe, and out of the iron safe I took Messrs. Plank and Smith's cheque-book—I have known Nash about twelve months—he was in the service of Smith and Co. wholesale druggists, Bush-lane—I used to see him every day—I saw him the night before I opened the sale, and took the cheque-book—I knew there was a cheque-book in that safe before I opened it—I told Nash what I was going to do—I told him I was going to forge a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he said he would mind the money for me, nothing further—the next day I took this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of the cheque-book—it had nothing written on it then, only the number 798 (<hi rend="italic">this cheque was dated</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th November</hi>, 1862, <hi rend="italic">on Messrs.</hi> Hankey's for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">and purported to be signed by Plank and Smith</hi>)—I filled up that cheque, and took it to the bank—the figures 798 are not in my writing—that was written on it—I got ten sovereigns for the cheque, which I took down to Nash—he was in his employer's office in Bush-lane—I gave him the whole ten sovereigns in the cellar there—I went down with him to the cellar—I told him where I had got the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from—I told him I had forged a cheque—I saw him again after that, the next morning—we bought some meerschaum pipes with some of the money, the day after I got it—they cost</p>

Hankey for</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">signed Plank and Smith</hi>)—I took that cheque to the bank, and got gold for it—Nash came up to the office for that—I told him to come the night before—I gave him the whole 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was all in sovereigns—when I gave him that he asked me if I could get any more, and I told him "Yes"—I bought a magic lantern with part of that 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Mr. Merritt's, in King William-street—it as to cost about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short, and I told Mr. Merritt to send it to Bush-lane, that is, where Nash was in employment—I went with the person who took it, and told him to pay the boy 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he did—the watch I bought from Nash wanted mending, and he took it to Church-lane, Whitechapel—I had not had it when it was taken to be mended—he did not tell me where he was going to take it to—I afterwards went with him to where it was—I never kid possession of it till after he said he had taken it to be mended—I went with him to 'Goldman's, the watchmaker's in Church-lane, Whitechapel—it was not finished, and Mr. Goldman asked Nash to give him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and he should have another one—he banded him another, and said, "If you give 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. you shall have this one"—this is it(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Nash paid him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of it, and promised to call and pay the other five another time—I afterwards told Nash that my father was going to see about the watch, to see if he had won it at a raffle—I had told that he had won it at a raffle—Nash said, "Well, go and pay Mr. Goldman the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and tell him, if anyone comes after the watch, to say that he broke the other, and was obliged to give this one in exchange"—Nash went to pay the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he told me he had paid Mr. Goldman 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and Mrs. Goldman said she did not like to take it, because she thought there was something wrong, and that he gave her half-a-crown to say nothing about it—between that date and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. December, I was in the habit of seeing Nash daily—I went to Messrs. Hankeys again on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. December—before going there, Nash said to me, "Can you get any more?" and told me to get a lot next time—that was two days before—I told him I would—I took another cheque out of the cheque-book, the same way as before—with the exception of the number to pay, it is written by me (<hi rend="italic">this was dated </hi>2<hi rend="italic">d. December, 1862, to pay No. 806, 251. on Messrs. Hankey, signed Plank and Smith</hi>)—I took it to Hankey's, and got five sovereigns, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., notes, and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note for it—I gave all that money to Nash—he came up to my employer's office for it—the next day after that I was taken into custody—I was bailed, after being examined before the Magistrate, and on the next day Nash came up to my father's house, and told me that Mr. Gale had been down to the office, and had asked him whether he had seen me with any money, and he told him "No"—he then said he had burnt the notes, and I told him if it was ever found out, I should tell what he had done with them—he said he could not help it, he had burnt them—that was on 4th December—the next day I saw Nash again at Messrs. Smith's, in Bush-lane—I asked him there if he had burnt the notes, and he said "No"—I asked</p>

               <p>him why he told me he had, and he said he had only done it to see what I would say—the next day, the 6th, I saw him again, and asked him if he had the money at home—he said, "Yes," and told me he had not spent any of it—I did not ask him to do anything with the money—I was afterwards taken into custody, and committed for trial, and he too.</p>

I went to the house in question, and saw the wife lying on the floor, the prisoner kneeling on one side, and Wilkins on the other, steadying her head—she had a wound in her throat—I said, "Oh! dear, what is the matter?"—the prisoner said, "My wife has cut her throat"—the wife shook her head, and pointed with her right hand to the prisoner, who repeated that three or four times, and she did the same three or four times—he then began to cry, and said, "I was in bed at the time"—he said, "My wife poured some gin out of a bottle, saying, 'Here, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, drink;' I said,' I will not have any more to-night;' she said 'If you do not drink I shall throw it over you, and with that she took the razor from the black bag, and screamed out, 'Oh! <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, I have done it; pray forgive me'"—I said to the prisoner, "There has been no one in the bed; the clothes have not been disturbed"—he made no answer—he then cried, and said, "Oh! my dear Annie; if you die we shall both die to—gether," and made a moaning sort of noise—Dr. Groves then came, and I had sent a constable for Dr. Kirby—I took the prisoner to the station, and when he was in the cell, he said that the reason he brought the razor with him was that they had agreed to get up early in the morning to come to the Old Bailey to see a man hanged, and that Annie found fault with him for coming out in the morning with a long beard, and he should not be able to get shaved; that the quarrel was about that scamp he saw her with on Saturday night, in the Edgeware-road, and that his sister Esther knew all about that scamp if she liked to speak.</p>

I live at 2, Angus-court, Big-market, New<lb/>cattle—my son is married to the prisoner's wife's sister—in the early part of April, 1862, the prisoner and his wife came to my son's house, where I was residing, and remained about eight weeks—his conduct towards his wife was very bad—he ill used her very much, struck her about the free and head, and knocked her down on the floor, when she was sitting in the room with me getting her tea—that was done more than once—he said that he would have her life, and he would be hung for her—I have seen him with a razor in his hand in the back shop, and sometimes he was pretending to make a great deal of her while he was pinching her about the arms, making her black and blue; I have seen the bruises frequently.</p>

I live at 132, St. Albans-place, Edgeware-road—I was called to the house on the evening of 16th November, and found the prosecutrix with a curved wound in her throat, extending across the front of the neck, but not further on the left side than on the right—it was completely through the windpipe, and extended slightly into the gullet; there was a small opening—the vocal chords were severed, which prevented her speaking from the moment the severance took place—I thought it was a dangerous wound, and had her dying deposition taken—I cannot state from its character whether it was inflicted by her or by anybody else.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the general behaviour of the captain kind and considerate to all the crew, including the deceased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the general way to punish them was to take a rope's end—I did not see or hear of his inflicting punishment with any other instrument than this—the deceased shipped as cook and steward—he had no bed or hammock; other men bring beds on board, but he came on board without one—I once heard one of the men, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hart, say, "Say you are ill"—two of the sailors put the deceased on the sails, and the captain went to where he was lying and brought him nourishment from his cabin—the lad had diarrhoea; I have seen him going very often—I believe he remained two days covered up by the sails before he was taken down to the cabin—the sails were down below; the reserved sails, on which he was placed—up to that day I did not believe, from his appearance, that he was really ill—I spoke to the captain, and by his orders he was removed down below—the sail was in the forecastle, not in the captain's cabin—he remained there a day or two, and was then con<lb/>veyed away from the forecastle by the captain, and placed in a berth in the captain's own cabin, in which he made him a bed—it was a very different place to the forecastle; much more comfortable—he fell ill about ten days before we came to London, and, from that moment till we got into the river Thomas, the captain was unremitting in his attention upon him, giving him brandy, and stimulants, and everything he could, to nourish him and keep him up—it was five or six days before he died that the captain took him to his own cabin—while in the forecastle, the captain frequently went to him and took him things, and when he was in his own cabin he continued that attention till our arrival in the Port of London—the deceased cut his finger—I did not see him do it, but the crew told me how it occurred—I did not see the captain dress the wound and put balsam on it; I dressed it once—the deceased said that he fell and met with an accident some time before—he had a wound on his leg or foot; that was occasioned by the ship rolling very much—we had spar-wood on deck, and a single piece went adrift, and went against his foot—the vessel, at times, rolled and lurched, so that the spars and casks were rolling about the deck, and the sea was continually running over—I suffered injury by a spar striking me—during the whole voyage the lad never complained to me about ill-usage at the hands of the captain—among other cargo, we had some boxes of turtle—the chain was coiled on deck—I did not see the deceased fall over the turtle boxes and chain in one of the lurches of the ship, but I heard about it—I know that he also fell into the coal-hole and injured his head—he had a out over his eye—I asked him where he got it, and he said that he fell down and cut himself—after he was placed in the sail he was delirious, and out of his mind occasionally—I went to see him, and he was rolling and tearing about, so that, between the rolling of the ship and his rolling about, he may have injured himself—he had two shirts, one pair of trousers, and no bed, when</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the deceased delirious the day he was under the pump? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I saw him—he became delirious, to my knowledge, on the day the captain took him into his own cabin—he was two days on the sails; he then became delirious, and was taken into the cabin—I did not exactly imagine that he was about to die; I hoped he would get better—I thought he was ill, but I never thought he would die—the captain was very anxious that he should get better—the nourishment which the captain ordered for him was after he got so bad, but he had his food in the forecastle—I did not hear Dr. Giles give his evidence—all the seamen were not punished till their bodies were covered with bruises and cuts—others were not punished to that extent—the deceased was never beaten, to my knowledge, so as to bruise his body—I did not see him fall down the coal-hole.</p>

                  </hi>. I was boatswain on board—I remember the deceased lad, William Curtis—I saw the captain strike him once or twice, on the return voyage, with a small bit of tan stuff—I heard the captain tell the policeman to go and find the piece of rattan on board—I remember the captain fetching him up from below—he went down and hid himself in the coal bunker on the day that the mast went down, and the captain gave him a few strokes with the rattan, and told him to come on deck—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it was always the same piece I think—I do not remember his beating him more than twice, and the second time was the pumping—the deceased refused to pump, and was beaten a little by the captain—I do not remember whether he laid all day beside the pumps; I think he did till towards the afternoon; he was then put on the sails, and, I believe, the captain ordered him to be taken into the galley and warmed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After the day when it was apparent that he was ill, you never saw the captain strike him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—when he was struck with this, his clothes were on—the captain never took his clothes off—the captain was kinder to the crew than a great many I have been with—this lad had the same rations, and food, and attention, that every one of us had—there was plenty of food and everything on board the ship—we used to help ourselves to what we liked, the provisions were not weighed—there was plenty of bread, and rice, and everything; and the captain wanted the deceased to be taken into the cooking galley, because it was warmer there, and he afterwards had him taken to his own cabin—I have sailed with cruel captains.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on Wednesday, 17th September, I was called to see the deceased—his body was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050063"/>
               <p>lying at an undertaker's shop in the West India Docks—I was called there with a view of accounting for the 
death of the man, in order that he might be buried, but I refused to make any statement without a post mortem examination—I received the Coroner's warrant to make one—it was the body of a youth quite eighteen; he might be nineteen; muscular, and well developed—the face, arms, hands, feet, legs, and, in fact, the whole anterior surface of the body, except the chest and upper part of the abdomen, was covered with wounds and bruises—there was one of par<lb/>ticular severity on the left instep, and another on the left foot—the hands were badly wounded—there was a wound on the left elbow, and a bruise above it—I opened the chest—the internal part of the body had very little fat—there had been on the right side a pleuracy of, I should think, a month's duration—there was adhesion, which I broke down in making the examination, and on the left side were some very old adhesions, they may have been six month, a year, or two years, indicating former attacks of pleuracy—the lungs were very much congested; the liver and heart were very healthy; the heart unusually firm—the gall bladder was very much distended; I pressed a considerable quantity of bile out of it—another thing which struck me was the staring and reddened eye of the corpse—the eyes were wide open and very red; the stomach very flat and quite empty—from the distended state of the gall-bladder, and the emptiness of the stomach and small intestines, I formed an opinion that the body had not had any nourishment, and formed the notion that somebody should be combined with me in the examination; and I examined the body no further—that examination was on Friday morning—on the following Tuesday, an inquest having been opened by the Coroner, the prisoner requested that a relative of his should be present—he was allowed to have Dr. Bristow—Dr. Edmunds was also called in; and Dr. Edmunds, Dr. Bristow, and myself, performed the second post mortem—on opening the head, the brain was large; it certainly was congested, but not to any extent—the membranes of the brain were much congested; a highly vascular state; which we always find from long exposure to cold—the captain was present also at this post mortem, and I stated my firm belief that the boy had not had anything for a fortnight, that being my previous impression—he said, "No, not so long as that; it is eight days"—that was said in the presence of us all—I should say that the inflammation of the pleura had existed a month—a great many of the wounds might be produced by this rattan, it is a very severe instrument wielded by a powerful man—they were round wounds and several of them would be accounted for by this knot—as to the wounds on his hands, if a man is punished he generally puts his hands and his face together, and he would only get the flicks on his face; it would not he in<lb/>tended to hit him on the head—there was not enough to cause death, with<lb/>out violence—
death resulted from exposure to cold, want of food suitable to his condition, and ill-usage, blows—when I came out of the <hi rend="italic">Lord Hood</hi>, where the inquest was going to be held, the captain was walking up and down—I did not know his name or who he was; he said, "What do you think of this case, doctor?"—I said, "It is a bad case"—he said, "What do you think it was done with?"—I said, "A rope"—he said, "How big a rope?"—I said, "About an inch thick"—he said, "No; it was not done with a rope at all, it was a rattan thong; do not make matters black against me and I will give you a sum of money, "or" some money"—I walked up to the beadle and said, "This man is attempting to bribe me," and walked away—when I got home I found that a Captain Stone had been and left a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050064"/>
               <p>message; he came again: it was the prisoner, he was shown up into my study and sat down—after some little conversation he said to me, "I punished the man, in fact all the crew punished him; he skulked; they all tell me you are a clever fellow. I shall give you 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to brush over the affair"—I said, "I cannot take your money, you will excuse me," and he went away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not tell you at the time he mentioned the rattan, that he never struck the lad with anything else, or was guilty of any ill-usage whatever, and that he had not acted cruelly to him during the whole voyage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he never said a word about having nursed the lad, and having him in his own cabin during the last ten days of the voyage—I have told you all he did say—he did not say that for the last eight or ten days before they arrived, the lad was in a state of delirium, and that his jaw was so locked that they could not get anything in—he said that he had offered the boy brandy when he was very ill, towards the last two days, but he thought his jaw was locked and he could not take it; but the jaw was not locked—I do not think he accounted for the lad not having had food by reason of the fact that he could not get it between his jaws, that his jaws were locked—I will swear he did not tell me so—it is my impression that he attributed his not having had food for two days to the fact that his jaw was locked; but he did not use the term "food," he said, "I tried to give him a little brandy, but could not because the jaw was looked—the post mortem was commenced on Friday, the 19th, and was continued on, I think, the following Tuesday—I opened the chest on the first day, but not the head or the abdomen, because I thought somebody else ought to be associated with me in so grave a case—when I stated my belief that he had had no food for fourteen days, I had not examined the abdominal viscers, but I could feel that the large intestines were empty—there were hardened feces in the rectum, because it is the receptacle for them—I mean to say that where man has been without food for eight days, there would be feces in the rectum, because it is by the continuance of food that they are forced out—it was not there to any great extent—I found none in the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> joins the <hi rend="italic">rectum</hi>—the appearances in the lungs were produced by cold, and are con<lb/>sistent with ordinary disease, irrespective of violence, and the vascularity of the brain also; the lungs were very healthy, but were congested by cold; the lungs may be healthy and yet inflamed—the appearance of the mem<lb/>branes of the brain might be produced by cold; there was no disease in the brain, it was only congested—it was just the state you would be in, if you were lying down drunk and exposed all night to the cold—cold produced it, I said so at first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Am I to understand you to tell the jury that this little rattan would inflict flesh wounds through the clothes of the man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He had no clothes on—I was not on board, but the captain said his clothes were blown over<lb/>board, and he laid naked on the sails—he did not say that he had flogged him when he was lying naked on the sails—it is my firm belief that some of the wounds were produced by this rattan, whether it would inflict such wounds through the clothes would depend upon the thickness of the clothes—if he had very thin clothing it would make no difference.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. and M.R.C S. I am a Licentiate of the College of Physicians, and live in Finsbury square—by the Coroner's directions I examined the deceased with Dr. Giles; that was the second examination on the Tuesday—it was the body of a well made young man about nineteen or twenty years of age—I have heard Dr. Giles's evidence—I do not take so</p>

               <p>serious a view of the external appearance of the body as he does; I should not put it into such strong language—there were several wounds on the hands and arms, and on the left elbow, and from twelve to fifteen trivial skin wounds on the face, not scratches but trifling abrasions, not injuring the texture of the skin and yet well defined marks—over the left eyebrow was a lacerated wound five-eights of an inch long, extending through the thickness of the skin, and surrounded by a little extravasated blood into the texture of the scalp—there were several wounds on the fore-arm, an abrased wound on the back of the hand, and a severe wound on the last knuckle of the right index finger—there was a severe contused wound on the left elbow, which was probably produced by a fall or a blow, probably a fall—several more wounds on the arm and wrist, and a severe wound on the second knuckle of the middle finger—there were no wounds on the front of the chest or abdomen, or on the trunk at all—on the right groin was a contusion, probably about a week old, and on the front of each thigh, were some pale red patches, such as might be produced by any bruising shortly before death—on the back of the right heel was a scratch from two to three inches long, which had not divided the skin throughout, and which might have been pro<lb/>duced by dragging the deceased over a nail on the deck, or some such thing as that—I should say it had been produced in that way—there was a round wound in front of the right instep, near the base of the great toe, and several more wounds and bruises about the legs—I did not see a second wound on the right foot; there was no wound there—I am sure it was the right instep; there was a similar wound on both insteps—there was a wound on the left leg, Dr. Giles is in error there, his memory has not served him; it was the most severe wound of all, and was on the front and outer side of the leg, about four inches above the uncle—there were several more wounds and bruises also about that leg, and there was a round wound in front of the instep, precisely like that on the right foot but a little more recent in date—the wound on the left instep was older than that on the right, and I should think that on the lower third of the leg was more recent still, that was the most serious of all, and was surrounded by a diffused erasypa<lb/>litie inflammation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not understand you to say that it contributed to the death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but it was the only one in which the question could be raised—I should say that it was more than a week old, perhaps two weeks—the wounds were all under process of healing—we then turned the body over, and on the back of the trunk were scars as long as the hand, to which I am unable to give any name; they may have been years old, certainly many months, and not five or six weeks only—they were scars above the loin nearly twice the size of a man's hand in extent—the hand and abdomen had not been opened, but the chest had—I now opened the head; the skull was uninjured, but the membranes of the brain were adherent to the top, to the extent of a shilling; the membranes throughout were fiery red and very vascular, as also was the ball of the eye—the brain was hard and firm—those are the results of exposure to cold—I then opened the chest; the heart was healthy and exceedingly firm—the langs healthy, but largely con<lb/>gested at their lower portion—the right lung and the right side of the chest were perfectly healthy, the left lung was adhering to the wall of the chest by pleuretic adhesions, probably years old—I then passed to the abdo<lb/>men, the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> was loaded with feculent matter from one end to the other—the stomach and small intestines were empty but perfectly, healthy, and their appearance was inconsistent with starvation, and so were all the appearances</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050066"/>
               <p>of the body—I then examined the lining of the intestines, which was healthy throughout, that is important as excluding some forms of disease—the liver was healthy, but the spleen somewhat softened, more soil than usual—the kidneys were healthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is not inconsistent with starvation is it, to have the stomach empty, it is generally empty, is it not, from starvation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but it becomes transparent, you can see food through—the appearances which were the result of disease were hardly sufficient to account for death—the appearances I saw, aided by exposure to cold, would be sufficient to kill him, especially if aided by harsh treatment or flogging—I ought to say that there were no linear marks, such as would be produced by stripes—the knot might do it, if it was struck in this way; but my impression is that it did not—they were perfectly circular, and were in process of healing, there<lb/>fore, it is pure speculation for me to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were the bruises you observed such as might be pro<lb/>duced by his being on board ship in very tempestuous weather, and being thrown about against the masts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say that all the wound on the limbs might be produced in that way, and also by the hands, including that which I consider the most serious—the serious part of that was the in<lb/>flammation, not the wound itself; it was an ordinary skin wound—it might be produced by a piece of logwood rolling about, or kicking a man's shins would produce it, and if he was in bad health and untended, that would cause inflammation—a delirious patient on board ship might cause some of those injuries—that one on the elbow was, I believe, produced by a fall; it is just the point where the body falls—the wound on the forehead might be produced by his sleeping on deck, and falling against the gunwale or capstan; we see such wounds every day produced by the same means—the wound on the leg, which was in process of healing, was not dangerous—it had begun to heal, but had become inflamed by exposure to cold, and it might get irri<lb/>tated by the salt water—the appearances I observed in the brain and lungs might have been caused by exposure to the cold, and to the salt water, wholly irrespective of the man being struck any blows at all; all the internal disease might be produced irrespective of any external violence, and I believe had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the internal disease be sufficient to cause death, without exposure to cold or violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not without exposure to cold, and violence would further contribute to accelerate it—if violence was com<lb/>mitted within three weeks or a fortnight, it would influence the lad's death; any violence would contribute to it, and the disease, without the violent would not in many cases—if the boy, in delirium, fell about among the cargo, I should not expect to find wounds on his trunk; they would be about the arms and legs, a man generally falls on his hands—wounds on the trunk might be caused by falling about the deck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any marks on the knees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Trivial marks, such as might be made by the man kneeling on a rough deck, but not wounds in the proper sense of the term; a man might graze his knees kneeling on the deck.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the City of London detective force—I have been engaged in the investigation of this matter—on Monday, 27th October, I went to the house of the prisoner Griffiths, at No. 2, Brown's-buildings, Winsen-street, Birmingham-heath-we obtained admission to the house—we proceeded up stairs to the front room on the first floor—I saw Griffiths just inside the door; he was coming to open the door as I pushed it open—he had his coat off and his shirt sleeves tucked up, and his hands were covered with black ink—I found in the room a printing press, it seemed to be in use, and on the printing press there were twenty-one forged Bank of England notes, without the date or signature to them—there was a bed in the room, and on the bed there were twenty forged 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes finished, wrapped up in gutta percha, and twenty 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. forged notes—in the parcel containing the twenty tens, there was half a sheet of rupee paper, which I now produce—close to the fire place there was a small square stove, with some charcoal in it; and, on the top of that stove, there was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note plate, which they call a "mother plate," that is, the body of the note with<lb/>out the date or signature—on a table, in the same room, there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England plate, called "a mother plate," containing everything, except the number, date, and signature—in the same room, behind the door, we found two other copper plates, called water-mark plates; they are for patting the water-mark in the note—I also produce a date and signature plate, which I found along with the two water-mark plates; the signature is that of W. P. Gattie—after we had searched the house, I asked Griffiths if he had any more plates besides those found—he said, Yes, he had some buried in a field (Mr. Inspector Man ton and Mr. Tandy of the Birmingham police were with me), and he said if we would go with him he would show</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050068"/>
               <p>us where they were—on the road from the house to the field, he entered into a general conversation respecting the forgery of these notes—he said that he had been engaged in manufacturing forged Bank of England notes since the year 1846, and he had printed all the forged Bank of England notes that had been issued for the last seventeen years, and he had, to the best of his recollection, printed on the genuine paper stolen from the mills, the number of one hundred and eighty 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and twenty 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, for a man named Buncher, and twenty 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes for another party—after walking some distance we came to a field, and after digging in the bank for some time, with the assistance of Griffiths, we discovered a quantity of plates, which Mr. Manton has in his possession—we then went to another place pointed out by Griffiths, and there found some more plates and some notes, which will be produced by one of the other witnesses—Mr. Manton has possession of all the plates found connected with the Bank—Griffiths was examined at Birmingham, and afterwards brought in custody to London, and examined before the Lord Mayor.</p>

Portal's mills to the Bank of England before it has been glazed—I have examined all the other notes that Mr. Murfill has produced; they are all our paper, none of them have been glazed—they are all on Bank of England paper manufactured at Messrs. Portal's, and all in the sized state, before they are glazed—somewhere about August last, a considerable quantity of paper was missed from the mill—the piece of rupee paper produced by Webb, if the Government of India paper, for ten rupees, that is as manufactured at Messrs. Portal's mill—that has not been sized at all; it is in what is called the dried water leaf state—the wet notes are dried before they are sized, and while in that state we call them in the dried-water leaf state—I can't tell with certainty when we first began to make rupee paper—it might be three or four years ago—we never issue rupee paper from the mill in this state—it is always sized and glazed; this is unsized.</p>

                  </hi>. I am twenty-one years of age, and am a son of George Brown, who was a carpenter at Mr. Portal's mills, at Laverstoke—I was in the habit of assisting my father at the mills—I first became acquainted with the prisoner Burnett, between May and Christmas, 1861—he was then at the Three Horse Shoes, at Whitchurch—he was living there with his sister-in-law—I saw him there very often—he did not make any application to me to get anything—his wife said something about the paper at the mill, and after that he said that he knew some one that would print them and pass them—my first conversation was with Mrs. Burnett, and after that I had a conversation with Burnett, and he said he knew somebody who would print and pass them—he asked me to get some paper from the mill—I told him I should not do anything of the sort—he asked me several times to fetch it; I told him I should not do it at all—Mrs. Burnett asked me several times also—at last I took some paper from the mill—I took three sheets in the first instance; that forms six notes—I took it from the side of the size-drying machine—(<hi rend="italic">referring to a model produced</hi>) this model repre<lb/>sents the size-drying machine—the paper is put in at the further end, and in passed between felt blankets and rollers, two of which are heated, and it comes out dry at the other end—two girls work at that machine; one at each end; one puts the paper in and the other takes it out—the paper is between the blankets from the time it goes in till it comes out—there is a part of the machine near the lower end of it, at which a man can get his hand in between the blankets (<hi rend="italic">pointing out the position on the model</hi>)—the machine is constantly in motion—the paper is put in as it is supplied to the person who has to put it in, two or three sheets together, one on the other, laid long ways on the blankets—the girl who puts the paper in stops doing so sometimes, but the machine still goes on—there is sometimes a few spaces short—they don't fill it out regularly—if anybody stops to speak to the girl there is very often a break in the supply of paper—I was aware of that—I have pointed out to the Jury the place where a person could get their hand in between the blankets, and abstract the paper—that is on the side next to the wall, as represented on the model, between the wall and the machinery, and towards the end of the machinery where the paper comes out—I got the three sheets of paper from that place—I could not be seen by either of the girls who were at work at the machine—it was part of my duty as carpenter to be about that machine to see that it worked properly, and to alter it if it did not; to see that the blankets did not crease, and that they went regularly—it takes about twenty-five minutes from the time of the paper passing in till its coming out of the machine—the three sheets of paper that I first took were plain paper, that is, paper without any denomination of the value of the note that is to be printed—it has the water mark and every<lb/>thing else, but without the amount—I gave those three sheets of paper to Mrs. Burnett at Whitchurch—that was, I think, about May or June, 1861—after I had given them to her, Burnett said he knew some one that could</p>

               <p>print them and pass them, but be said he must take them to London—he asked me several times to get some more—he said I might as well get a few more, and go to London with them for a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi>—I told him I would see if I could—I did do so—the second time I took five sheets of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note paper—I took that from the same place as I took the other—I took them to Burnett at Whitchurch—I had several conversations with Burnett about the paper—he asked me to get some more—I told him I would not, and he said if the other was <hi rend="italic">tumbled to</hi> he should very likely <hi rend="italic">split</hi> upon me—"tumbled to" I understood to mean "found out"—I then told him I would see if I could get a few more for him—I took nine or ten sheets of "fifty" next—I took those from the side of the machine, the same place as the other; I got my hand in between the blankets, and took them out—that was the third time that I took any—as I was leaving the place on that occasion I met Richard Brewer, and he asked me what I had got in my pocket—I told him I had not got anything—he said, "You have; you have got some paper"—I said I had not, it was only a piece of wrapper—he said, "It if not; it is some paper; you had better take it out, and take it back; I don't want to get you into a row, or else I would tell the governor of it"—I told him I would, if be would not tell on me—I went to put it back, and Mr. Deusatoy was in the machine-room at the time, and I had not the chance then—I took it down into the carpenter's shop, and Brewer came down to me a little while afterwards, and asked me what I was going to do with the paper, whether I had put it back—I told him I had not the chance to put it back—he asked me what I was going to do with it, and I told him—I took it for Burnett of Whitchurch—he asked me what Burnett did with it—I told him he knew some one in London who printed it and passed it—he asked me if I knew who it was—I told him I did not—he told me to put the paper back as soon as I could—I had not an opportunity of putting it back—I took it to Burnett at Whitchurch—I told Burnett what had happened with Brewer—next day I saw Brewer—he asked me whether I had put the paper back—I told him I had not the chance, and I had taken it to Burnett—he said he should not take any more if he was me, he should leave off at that—Burnett then went to London—I saw him again two or three days afterwards at Whit-church, and be gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said I was to give 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Brewer, and keep 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself—I took the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Brewer the next morning, and gave it him—I kept 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. myself—I told Brewer that Burnett had sent the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—he said he did not want any of Burnett's money, and he did not want to have anything to do with him—I told him he might as well have it, and he then took it—he asked me if I knew who Burnett took the paper to—I told him I did not know, but I heard him tell his wife that <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> had not got the plate done yet—Brewer asked me if it was Fred Lancaster—I told him I did not know what name it was—he told me to ask Burnett when I saw him again what the man's name was, where he took the paper to—he said he thought he knew Burnett before to-day—he asked me how much paper I had taken to Burnett, and what he got a sheet for it—I told him I did not know what he got a sheet for it, I thought he did not get anything out of it, not particular—I told him I had taken three sheets of plain, and five of tens before, and ten fifties, and that Burnett took them to London—when I next saw Burnett I inquired of him who the man was—he would not tell me—I asked him whether <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi> Lancaster was the name—next morning I saw Brewer, and told him that Burnett would not tell me what the man's name was—he said, oh, that was all right, he should find out some day, he dare say—Burnett asked me to get him some more paper—I told him I would see</p>

               <p>if I could—I told Brewer that Burnett wanted some more paper, and he said I was to get as much as Burnett wanted—I afterwards got twelve sheets of plain—I took them from the side of the machine, where I got the other—I gave them to Burnett—the next morning, or a day or two afterwards, I saw Brewer—I told him that I had given Burnett some more paper—I told him what it was, twelve sheets of plain—he said that was all right—after that I told him I thought about going to London to get work—he said it was the best thing I could do—this was at the latter end of June, 1861—he said I was not to mention his name at all to Burnett about getting any of the paper—I afterwards saw Burnett—he wanted me to get some more paper—I told him I was going to London—he said I might as well get some more paper before I came away, he should not be able to get any afterwards—I saw Brewer, and told him what Burnett had said—he said I could please myself about getting some more—I did take some more—I took about forty sheets of plain—I took them to Burnett—I left the mills a day or two afterwards, and came to London with the Burnetts—we were all at Stratford—we did not live in the same house—I stayed in London about five weeks—I did not get any work in London—I lived with Burnett—he supplied me with money—after that five weeks I went back to Laverstoke—I saw Brewer there, against the mill gates—he asked me how it was that I had come back—I told him I could not get work in London—he asked what I was going to do—I told him I should stop at home, and see whether I could get work there—I came down by myself, not with Burnett—about six weeks before Christmas I was in the bar parlor of the "Prince Regent" at Whitchurch, and Brewer came in—he asked me to have a glass of brandy and water with him—I told him I would—he asked me when I was going home—I said I was going directly—he said, "We may as well go together then, I want to speak to you on the road"—this was about 10 or 11 o'clock at night—we left about a quarter of an hour afterwards—Brewer went out first, and I followed him—we walked to Laverstoke together, that is about two miles—on the way he asked me if I knew where Burnett was gone to, if I could find him—I said I knew where his brother lived, and most likely I could find him—he said he wanted me to take something to London for him—he said it was Bank paper—I told him I did not know how I should manage to go, being out of work—next day I saw Brewer against the mill gates, at 4 o'clock—he told me not to take any notice of him then, he would come up into the shop to me presently—I went to my father's shop, and Brewer came about half-an-hour afterwards—my father was in the shop at the time; Brewer said he wanted to borrow a saw, because my father was there—he saw my father, and said he wanted to borrow a saw—I lent him one—he went away with it, and came again in about half-an-hour—my father had then gone away—he told me he had borrowed the saw as an excuse, because father was there—he then asked me if I had ever had any letter from Burnett concerning the other paper—I said I had not, and I told him that I would give it up altogether, I would not have anything more to do with it—he said he wanted me to take some paper to London for him—I said I did not know how I should manage it, father would want to know where I got the money from to go with—Brewer said he did not know how he should manage it then—I told him I thought of going to Portsmouth to my brother's till Christmas—he said it was the best thing I could do, and come up again at Christmas, and make out that I had come to see my friends—he asked me if I wanted any money to go with—I told him I had enough to go with—he said I was to be sure to come up again at Christmas—after that I went to Portsmouth—I saw Brewer again two</p>

               <p>or three times before I went—I met him accidentally—he said I was to be sure to come at Christmas, I was to come back and see him, but I was not to take any notice of him when I did see him—a fortnight after Christmas I came back again to Laverstoke—I got there in the afternoon—I met Brewer as he was coming out of the mill-yard about 4 o'clock—he said I was not to take any notice of him then, but meet him at the Red House at 11 o'clock at night—the Red House is in Whitchurch, about two miles from Laverstoke—I went there about 9 or 10 that evening, and saw Brewer—he was in the parlor—I was in the tap-room—Brewer came out, and I followed him—we walked on to Laverstoke—he asked me if I was sure I could find Burnett—I told him most likely I could—he said I was to be sure and not say anything to anyone about him—he said he wanted me to take two parcels, one to Burnett, and one to a woman in black whom I should meet at the Waterloo Station—he said the parcels were paper—he did not say what they contained—he said I was to stand on the platform till the woman came up to me, and he said he would write and tell her what sort of a <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> I was—he said she would have a hat on—he asked me when I thought of going—I told him the next day—he said I had better stop till the day after, so that be could write to her—he gave me two parcels, one for the woman, and one for Burnett—I waited a day in order that he might write—I opened the parcels—there was one hundred sheets of plain Bank paper in the one for the woman, and one hundred sheets of fives, and seventy-six of tens, in the one for Burnett—Brewer said I had better go by the parliamentary train, and then the woman would meet me there—I went by that train—when I arrived at the Waterloo Station I waited on the platform, and a woman in black came up to me—she asked me if I had got anything from Brewer—I gave her the parcel, and she gave me half a crown to get some<lb/>thing to drink—I took some pains to find out where Burnett was, and eventually I ascertained his address from his mother—I went to him and gave him his parcel—he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said I was to give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Brewer, the other 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to pay my own expenses—I stayed in town two days—I then went to Portsmouth—Burnett came down there to me two or three times—I stayed at Portsmouth till about a fortnight after Easter—I then went to London to Burnett's—after I had been there about a week he asked me to go down and see Brewer, to see if I could get any more paper from him—I agreed to go—he gave me money to go with; I don't exactly know now how much it was—I went and saw Brewer the same afternoon—he said I was not to take any notice of him, but to go down the lane and he would come down to me—I went down the lane, and he came to me, and asked me what I was come for—I told him that Burnett had sent me after some more paper—he said, "All right; come into my house at 11 o'clock to-morrow night—he said he wanted me to take a key to London for him, and get one made like it, for fear the other one that he had got should break—(<hi rend="italic">a key was here produced by Webb</hi>)—that is exactly like the key—he said he dare say Burnett knew who could make one like it—nothing more occurred then—I saw Brewer again next night at his house, and he gave me two parcels, one to take to Burnett, and one to give to the woman at the Waterloo Station that I had taken the other to—they contained paper—I never counted them—he told me it was Bank paper—I did not go direct to London—I went to Portsmouth first, and then from there to London—I gave one of the parcels to the woman at the Waterloo Station, the same as I did the other.</p>

               <p>me first while I was stopping at Mr. Kidd's house—I don't know who sent him—he said he wanted to see me about the Bank-note robbery—I did not tell him all about it then—I told him at first that I did not know anything about it—he did not become a little persuasive upon that—he let me go again—he let me go on the Saturday, and came again on the Monday—he had brought me up to the chief office—he did not have me in custody; I went up with him—I never tried to get away from him; I was about an hour at the chief office—I told him then that I knew nothing about it, and he let me go—I saw him again on Monday.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you on your solemn oath, whether you did not cohabit with that girl? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I did; from about Christmas, and I was doing so at the time the reward was offered—I took that girl to the house where my mother and sisters were—I did not sleep with her that night—I can swear that—I did not sleep in the same room—she slept down stairs with mother, in my mother's bed—I was not living with her—my mother knew I was cohabiting with her, and my father also—she was About seventeen years old—she wore a hat, a black dress, and a black shawl—the premises close about 5 o'clock—at 4 o'clock they would just be about leaving—it is Mr. Shenton Dusatoy's duty to close the premises, all the mills, and to see that everybody has left them—neither my father nor I could get into the mills after they were closed—there were no keys at my father's; he had one key for</p>

               <p>the shop, that was all—that would not get one into the mills—no paper was left on the machine at night, they always emptied the machine every night; the robbery from that part of the machine must have been effected during the daytime—the paper is put at night into a room in the mill, this room (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out on the model</hi>)—that would be the duty of Mr. Marshman, who was looking after the machine, and then it was locked up—it was about May or June, 1861, that Brewer detected me coming out with some paper—I think Brewer lived at Whitchurch at that time—I am not certain—from that time I and he perfectly understood each other—I considered we were engaged together in plundering our employers—I never had any talk with him about how much he was to get by it—he asked me several times what Burnett was going to give me out of it—he did not learn how much I had got out of it—it was some time after that I was at the Prince Regent with him; that is just out of Whitchurch—it was there we had some brandy-and-water—George Voukes keeps the house—he has a wife, no servants—I am not sure whether it was Mrs. or Mr. Voukes who served us with the brandy-and-water; it was one of the two—I was well-known there—I don't know whether either of them are here to day—I have not been taken down to see them by the detectives; I have not been down there at all—the detectives asked me who served us, and I told them I knew it was one or the other of them—I don't know which of the officers it was that I said that to—I did not learn that he had been down to make inquiries—it was about six weeks before Christmas that Brewer borrowed the saw—it was not on that occasion that be gave me the key—I believe this to be the key he gave me—it was the second time I went there that he gave me the key, just after Easter, 1862.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>exactly—I left the public-house about 10, I think, or between 9 and 10—I can't be positive whether it was not ten minutes after 10 that I left the public-house—I can't say whether it was after 10—I have not said that it was after 10, that I am aware of; I could not swear that I have not—I am not sure whether or not I told Webb or one of the detectives that it was ten minutes after 10 when I left the public-house—I am sure I never said it was ten minutes past 10—I am not sure whether I said it was after or before 10; I said it was about 10—it might be between 9 and 10; I can't be certain—it might be after 10; I can't say—the public-house is kept by Fraser—I had some beer there, and then I went to Brewer's house—that is about two miles; it is not between three and four miles—I walked there—there was no one at Brewer's house but himself and his wife—I got there about 11, I think—I left Brewer's next afternoon about 3 o'clock, not before; I dined there—there cannot be the least doubt about that—I know Freefolk-bridge; that is about three hundred yards from Brewer's house—I had not been out of Brewer's house at all before 3 o'clock, when I left—I did not meet my mother that morning; I never saw her at all when I was down that time—I was not crossing the fields with her—I do not remember at any time crossing the fields with my mother, when she was crying—I am quite cer<lb/>tain I did not about that period—I have never been charged with anything before of any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BOVILL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you first told the detective that you did not know anything about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—at that time I was not aware whether anybody had been taken into custody—at the time, I told what I knew about it—I was quite aware of it—when I did make the statement, I was not aware whether anybody had been taken into custody—I did not know that Burnett had been taken into custody on this case; I knew he had been before—at the time I told Mr. Hamilton what I knew, I did not know whether anybody else had told the whole story—I did not know that Burnett had made any statement; he was not in custody then—I have no hope or expectation of obtaining a single penny of the reward—I never heard whether Burnett was to have anything, or when—the paper is deposited in a place called the pack-room—there is no outer door to that room—you get in against the end of the machine-house here (<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>)—there is a way in there—that door is called the machine-room door—it sometimes goes by the name of the north door—you go through that door, then through another door, and then into the pack-room—I don't know whether the key that Brewer gave me would open that north door or the pack-room door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you cohabited with this young woman; what do you understand by cohabiting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Keeping company with her—she was the daughter of the woman where I lodged—I had no marriage engagement with her; I never said anything about that—she was not the woman that I had to meet in London by Brewer's direction—it was Mrs. Burnett who first suggested to me to take the paper—before I took any, I had been spoken to by Burnett once.</p>

               <p>1861—I met him at Whitchurch, at the Plough, first, and at my sister's, the Three Horse-shoes—in April I spoke to him about getting paper from the mill; that was by Burnett's direction—I remember his bringing some paper from the mill; I saw it; it was plain paper; it was given to me, and I gave it to Burnett—after receiving that paper I and Burnett went to London for some days—we stopped at 7, Milton-crescent, Euston-square—I stopped at home, and Burnett went out—when he came back he brought some money with him; I did not see how much—after that visit to London I and Burnett went back again to Whitchurch—I saw Henry Brown there again, both at the Plough and also at my sister's, the Three Horse-shoes—I remember his bringing some paper—that was about a fortnight or three weeks after our return to Whitchurch—after that I, and Burnett, and Brown, went up to London—we stopped that time at a public-house in Drury-lane; two nights and one day—on the afternoon of the day we returned to Whitchurch; we dined in the Strand—I saw Burnett give Brown two sovereigns when he parted from him in the afternoon—we did not go back to Whitchurch till the next day—I saw Brown repeatedly after my second return to Whitchurch; I can't say how often; I saw him on several occasions—I remember Brown asking a question about a person named Lancaster; he asked Burnett if the man's name was Lancaster that he was giving the paper to—he said it was not—he said Brewer wished to know—I remember Henry Brown leaving Laverstoke—before he left besides the paper I have mentioned, he brought more; I can't say how much—I remember the day of the fire in Tooley-street—I and Burnett went up to London that day—we stopped at Stratford that time, at Burnett's brother's, the Railway Hotel—while we were there, Brown came and stayed there two or three nights—he afterwards had a lodging in the neighbourhood—we stayed in Stratford six weeks that time—we then went back again to Whitchurch—I can't remember how long we remained there then, but some time—we left somewhere in October, '61; I can't state the day of the month—I remember Brown coming to our lodging in Long's-court, where we lived after leaving Whitchurch in October, '61; that was just after Christmas, '61—I went with Brown to look after Burnett—we found him at the Victoria Theatre, and went to a public-house together, and then returned home—Brown had some of the bank paper with him at that time—Brown stayed at our house that night—Burnett went out next day; Brown stayed at our house in the meantime—when Burnett came back he had some money with him; I did not see him give any of it to Brown—I was given to understand that he took some of the paper with him when he went out; I did not see it—I remember Burnett going down to Portsmouth in the year 1862; he said he was going to see Henry Brown—I went with him once to Portsmouth; that was in March, 1862—I re<lb/>member after that seeing a parcel of paper that Brown brought—that was after Easter; it was in London—I did not see what was done with that paper—Burnett took some of it out; be said he had to go out the next day—I did not see any money when he returned—he went again the next day, and brought back a joint of meat—I went myself to Strutton-ground, I think, in August—I went with Burnett—he took some of the bank paper with him—he went to a butcher's shop; I know that it was Buncher's—I have gone into the shop myself on several occasions—I went to take some paper—that was when we were living in Angel-place; it was after I had been with Burnett—when I went with Burnett I merely waited for him; I went into the shop; Burnett passed through into the back parlour—I did</p>

               <p>six day weeks there would be 60,000 notes in that week—a great many thousand notes were kept in this room—we ceased to use these pack rooms for keeping paper on 16th July, 1862—that was after the discovery that paper had been taken—there was a means of getting to these pack rooms from outside the mill, by the north door (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—after going through that door you would have to go through two other doors in order to get to the inner pack room—between the end of June and the 11th and 12th of July, we had some sized bank note and rupee paper in store in that room—we were constantly making Bank of England paper (<hi rend="italic">refering to the books</hi>)—in the week including 20th June we bad two vats, one on rupee paper, and one vat on Bank of England—during the week, including 7th July, we were making Bank of England plain, not fives or tens—the next week we made rupee paper, but there was no deficiency then—in the week ending 4th July, we were making Bank of England and rupee—we had three days work to make in that week, belonging to the former week, so that we made a week and a half—in the following week after 7th July, we were making Bank of England plain—we made more than a week's work of that sort of paper, so that we went into part of the next week to finish it—we made two vats of rupees, in the week ending 4th July—it generally takes about nine or ten days from the time the paper is made in the vats, until it is sized, sometimes more, sometimes less—this key produced by Webb is a master-key, which opens all of the doors, except where there are larger or different locks—it is such a key as I should look up with—it would open the north door, and both the other doors by which you would gain admission into the pack room—I heard that that key had been lost—I do not recollect it myself—I remember its being found—I cannot say the date—it was on the 6th, 7th, or 8th September, 1862, on a Monday—it was found in the door at the bottom of the stains, going up to the rag engine room—I had heard of its being lost three or four years before—William Brewer had the key of the mould office—I don't think that key would open the north door or the pack room doors—I don't think it would open any door, except that which it was intended for—Richard Brewer ought not to have had any key except the key of the mould office—after mill hours the doors were locked—the gates were not locked—they were fastened on the inside—the large gates were fastened together, and the wicket gates left open, until the carpenter went home, and then they were fastened up—it was his business to lock those gates—Richard Brewer has made application to me for my key after mill hours—I lent it to him on one occasion—I think it must have been at the latter end of 1861—that was the master-key that would open every door, except where there was a strange lock on it—he was not away above ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with that key—he brought it back to me again—he asked me after that to lend it him, but I believe I did not—I have several times gone with him, and opened the doors, and 1st him into the mould office, and I have seen him out again, and locked the door, and come away—once when he was in the mould office he asked my permission to remain there after the mill hours, and I said, "Mr. Brewer, if you remain, I shall remain with you," or, "You will compel me to remain with you"—I think that was either the latter end of July or August, 1862—he said, if I would not stop with him he would inquire of Mr. Charles Dusatoy, my brother—rupee paper is never sent out in an unsized state—Bank of England paper is never sent out sized and not glazed—during the time I have been at the mill, we have always had as occasional amount of deficiency of paper—the machinery will tear some, and the men are careless—in 1862 we discovered larger deficiences than could be accounted for in that way—it is, of course, expected that every sheet put</p>

               <p>into the machine should come out—we found larger deficiencies than could be accounted for by carelessness or injury; that led to inquiry; and we ascer<lb/>tained what the deficiencies were—we always had deficiencies (<hi rend="italic">looking at the things found at Brewer's house</hi>)—this piece of brass is intended for a knotter to extract knots from the pulp—it has slits in the bottom of it—the width of guage of those slits is the same as our knotters used at the mills—after the pulp has been made, it is passed through a knotter, with slits in it of the same guage as these—the effect of that is, to allow the fine pulp to pass through, and to keep back the knots—it goes inside this wooden box, and works up and down—the stuff goes through, and leaves the knots behind—there are openings at the bottom which we call rabbits, to allow the pulp to pass out—here is a wooden frame with brass bars, with holes in them—that is the foundation of a paper mould—in the state it now is, it would do for any sort of paper—it would make paper the size of a bank note, with a proper deckle fitted to it—a deckle is a frame that fits on the top of the mould, to form the edges of the sheets; it is afterwards taken off—in order to form a water mark it would require to be completed—this is merely the foundation—in 1862 the mill opened at 5 o'clock or half-past 5—I always open it—there is a night watchman; he comes off duty at half-past 5, when I open the mill—the women leave off at 4—the men are generally employed a little longer, sometimes till 5 or half-past—I am the last to lock up—I dose the mill when the men have left it, generally from a little after 5 to half-past 5.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you known the prisoner long? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I first became acquainted with him about seven years ago—when I went to the White Horse, in Orchard-street, Cummings was not standing in the bar, he he was lying on a sack in the tap-room, partly asleep and partly awake, but I awoke him up, and showed him the paper—I had only been in the house and drank with him before; I never had the slightest connection with him in my life—I have asked him to drink if he was in the house, he was no pot companion—he took the paper in his hand and held it up—I will not be certain whether he had his spectacles on—I am not such a fool as to find him asleep with his spectacles on—immediately I awoke him I gave the paper into his hand—he held it up, looked at it, and could tell what it was, of course—he had spectacles on just now; I do not know that he is in the habit of wearing them—I have seen him with them once or twice—when he had looked at the paper, if I am not mistaken, he gave it to me back again, and I gave it to Burnett in the public-house—the piece of paper was in Cummings's possession three or four minutes, just while he looked at it—I gave him the roll of paper, in the public-house, on the evening we were to have started down to Birmingham—I had not the slightest idea it was bank paper—I did not see it, but I know it, because it is not fessible at all that he would pay the man's expenses down to Birmingham if it was not—the parcel was in a round roll, there was a piece of common white paper outside, but no string round it; it was screwed up—I do not know a man named Jackson—I know Burnett.</p>

I live at Islington—I was with the last witness when the chaise broke down at Tottenham-cross—Cox drove us to the Fountain, and I went in there, and shortly after that I missed my friend—I was then inside the house—I went outside and looked—the prisoners And the cart were still outside then, and a third man—I then proceeded alone on my way towards Hackney Church—when I had got a little distance the two prisoners ran after me; the other man remained a short distance behind—Cox took hold of my arm, and forcibly detained me; they made use of very abusive language—Cox said, "Come back and ride, we will take you where you want to go"—I said I wanted to have nothing to do with them, as I was quite satisfied they were blackguards—I then called the aid of a police-constable, 46 N, and said, "Protect me against these men"—the policeman said, "Have you any claim against this gentleman?"—I think he used the words "this gentleman"—Cox said, "No"—as near as I can tell, the constable said, "Now, my lads, you had better go back the other way, and not interfere with the gentleman; he does not want anything to say to you"—he then said to me, "If you walk on, sir, I will see they don't follow you"—I walked on—they had not moved, but were still in the same place—when I had got some distance the same men drove up in a cart, and stopped behind me—they all three got out of the cart, and hustled against me, and pushed me about—I received a blow on the back of the head; from whom I do not know—it rendered me insensible, and I fell—when I next became conscious I was being forcibly held down in the cart, and was being driven rapidly down a lane—I cannot say whether it was one of the prisoners or the third man that held me; it was very dark—they stripped off my top coat, my body coat, waistcoat, and hat—I was conscious then—they took a ring off my finger, and about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money from my trousers' pocket, and some other trifling articles—they had great difficulty in getting the ring off, and one of the prisoners said, "Oh, cut the finger off"—one of them, Blackin I think, tried to take my boots off—I kicked him, and after that I had a severe struggle, and threw myself over the back of the cart, and injured myself very much, as we were going rather quick, though not very—I called out "Police," and ran after the cart—policeman K 32 came up, and joined in the pursuit—he ran After the cart, and stopped the horse—Cox was then wearing my overcoat and hat—he took the coat off and threw it in the road, and threw the hat at me—the constable then took the two prisoners in custody—the third man ran away, and escaped—this hat and waistcoat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are mine.</p>

About half-past 7 on this evening, I was on duty in Lower Clapton, and heard a cry of "Police"—I ran to the spot, and saw Cox holding the prosecutor by the arm—he was trying to get him to go back and ride with him; he said he promised to take him to Shoreditch, and not to leave him halfway at the Fountain—the prosecutor would not go, and asked me to protect him from these men—he said, "I wish to get away from them;" I said, "Very well, you can get away, and if you go away they won't follow you now"—he went on his way, and they turned back—I told them they must go away from him—that was about 200 yards from the public-house—I saw Cox back to the public-house, and when I got there I saw the two other men with him for the first time—I stood about there for more than five minutes, and saw that they appeared to be settled, and with no intention of following him—I went about fifty yards further on, and presently I saw the cart going on with the three men—they were all dressed something like they are now—they followed in the direction which the prosecutor had taken, and I took a short cut down Clarence-road towards Hackney, and thought I should arrive there in time, but I saw no more of them till at the police-court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cox's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor's friend hired me to fetch a hone and cart.</p>
               <p>I ran to Stamford-hill-gate as fast as I could go, and got them out of the stable; and when I came back he bad hired another man to take his trap, and gave him the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said, "You have hired some one else;" he said, "Yes, you won't have anything to do with it now, you may take your horse and cart back again." He went into the parlour of the public-house, and the landlord said he would not draw him any thing; he said to roe, "That man will have to pay you 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going for the horse and cart." I went into the parlour, and asked him if he would give me the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said he was not going to give any 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said, "You will have to pay the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>" I did not abuse him; I spoke very civilly. After a great deal of persuasion, a gentleman said, "You had better pay him;" and at last he pulled out about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his hand, and the gentleman gave me a half-crown, a shilling and a sixpence, from it, and said, "Now Cox, you see about getting home and out of the way, away from him." The prosecutor was very tipsy. On going outride he said, "I have paid you the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; you will have to take me part of the way home, down to the Fountain at Clapton." I drove him there, and we all had some beer there, which I paid for. The prosecutor came out of the bar and ran off, and Rowsell came into the parlour. I asked him where the other one was gone; he said, "Oh, he is outside." I went out, and asked him if he was not going to ride home; he said, "No," The policeman came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050110"/>
               <p>up, and asked if I had been insulting him, and he said, "No." He then shook hands, said "Good night," and walked on. Rowsell afterwards came out, and said, "Where is the gentleman?" I mid, "I do not know." I got up in the cart, drove on, and overtook him; I asked him if he would like to ride; he got up in the cart himself, and said, yes. he would. He sat on the other side of Blackin, who was in the cart. I drove the horse as properly as I could. Blackin was intoxicated, the same as the prosecutor. The pro<lb/>secutor said, "You drive me to Wick-lane;" and when going along Wick-lane, he pulled off his things in such a way and stared at me, that I thought he was mad, and then he pitched out of the cart; he and Blackin both went out of the cart together. The prosecutor hallooed "Police;" the policeman came up and said, "You stop." I had pulled the reins up very quickly. I stopped, got down, and told the policeman what he had done. This constable took us all to the station; the other policeman held the prosecutor, as he was so very much intoxicated. On getting there, he locked him up till Sunday, because he was not capable of taking care of himself; and they locked us up as well. I am as innocent as any baby.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Blackin's Defence.</hi> I was going towards Tottenham, and saw the accident; the prosecutor asked me to lend him a horse; he said he would give me a shilling when he got to Old Ford.</p>

Mr. Nellum—he told me he was acquainted with parsons and doctors—he did not tell me he was a tutor—he told me he could write to the parsons and borrow money of them, because he had paid come of them money when he went to church—I have heard, since the 17th, that Reeves was a gentleman, and tutor in a gentleman's family—I heard of it at the police-court—I saw a doctor there, who stated to the Magistrate that he was a tutor in his brother's family; but I went to his lodgings, and to five different houses where he bad lodged, and the landladies all said he had left—I never mentioned before to day about the request being made that I should take my boots off, because they never asked me about it—Reeves did not tell me that the other man was his son; but in the house he called him his son, to the landlady and her daughter—I never knew, till the 17th, that he had a son—he did not tell me he had one the first time I met him—I did not say anything to the Magistrate about Reeves saying that the third man was his son—I did not say anything about the person asking me to smell his handkerchief—on the Sunday morning, when I was at Reeves's house, he sent out and got fourpenny-worth of meat, and stewed it for dinner—on the last occasion, he said he had no "money; and I bought some celery, meat, and potatoes, going home to his lodgings—I never said to the Magistrate that he said he had no money, because they never asked me.</p>

Q.</hi> You saw a man near there first, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I did not catch hold of him—I did not then see all the four windows open, I did afterwards, when that man ran away—I thought it extraordinary to see four windows open—if he had got in at either of the other three windows, he could not have got into the bar without forcing the door—the prisoner did not tell me how long he had been there—I asked him his name, and he refused to tell me—I know now that his parents are respectable, and well off—as for as I know he bears a character of respectability and honesty—I know that every person who knows him would give him an excellent character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a manufacturer, carrying on business at Bradford, in Yorkshire—some time last year I had business transaction with a person named Richard Pearson—the first was on 3d June, and they continued till the middle of July; at that time he was indebted to me, for goods supplied, 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or: there more—I received 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him; he owed me 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in the middle of July, I saw Pearson and the prisoner at the Bowling Green hotel, at Bradford—I went there expecting to see Pearson, and Newman was there when I arrived, in the large chamber, along the Pearson—Pearson took me into a small room, and afterwards went out and called Newman into the room—he said to him, "Come here, if you please, I have been telling this gentleman about your owing we this 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Newman said, "It is so; I am a man that ships a good deal, and I am expecting some money in the course of two or three weeks, or it perhaps may be rather longer, and you shall be paid every penny"—he then went out—I saw him once or twice after that, on the same day—I saw him three times that day at the Bowling Green hotel—Pearson was present twice when I saw him—Pearson said, in Newman's presence, the second time I saw him, that Newman was a man that shipped a good deal, and he was likely to do a tradesman a deal of good, that he was a man of great wealth—I said they might go and look some goods over—I next saw Newman, somewhere about the middle of August, at the Bowling Green hotel—I said to him, it would not do; the payments not having been made in an honourable sort of way, and I was surprised—he made a statement, that the accounts had not come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050119"/>
               <p>from abroad, as they ought to have done; I had no occasion to be at all frightened, and he showed a telegram he had got—he had it in his hand, and he said there were both money and goods coming to a large extent—he mentioned Russia and other places; I did not particularly notice—he said I need not be frightened, for all would be paid in a very short time—that is chiefly what he said—the whole amount of goods I supplied after the middle of July, was somewhere about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—after I first saw Newman, about 28th or 29th of August, I supplied 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, I think—it was after the middle of August—it was in consequence of what Newman said, that I allowed the further credit, from the middle of July, from his conventions with Pearson; but for Pearson's representing Newman to be a rich man, I should not have supplied more goods, because be bad missed his payments—I next saw Newman, in September, about the 11th, I believe, at the same hotel, at Bradford—Pearson was with him—there was some conversation about a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque on that occasion—it was owing to Mr. Newman that I got that cheque—I have not got it now; I destroyed it—Newman said that he had got a notice from abroad that there was a large sum of money coming, he thought he would have it in a day or two, but he was certain within a week, so that it would be certain to be there before the cheque was due—I am not certain whether the cheque was given to me on the 11th, or whether it was due on the 11th—I got no money on account of it—it was dated a week forward—before I destroyed it, I presented it; not myself, it was sent up. and I had it back again, and destroyed it, perhaps it might be a fortnight afterwards—it was made payable to me, from Pearson, on the London and Westminster Bank, I believe—at the Utter end of October, I received six bills of exchange, from Pearson, at the Great Northern hotel, at Leeds—Newman was not present then—I afterwards saw him at the Junction inn, at Bradford, and had some conversation with him about those bills,—as soon as I went in, I pat two bills down on the table and said to Mr. Newman, "Those bills ought to be endorsed by you; will you endorse them now"—I said, "Here is Mr. Pearson here, says you ought to endorse them"—Pearson was there the whole time—I let them stop on the table half an hour or forty minutes, and Newman walked about and never said a word—Pearson said they belonged to him, and he ought to endorse them—there was no pen and ink there, and I thought I would go out and get some—just as I came in, Pearson and Newman were talking about these bills, and Pearson said, "You ought to endorse them, for you know they are bills that I got from you"—Newman said, "I should have endorsed them, but for his (meaning me) stopping the 625<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills from being discounted"—he said nothing more—I let them stop about twenty minutes longer, but he did not endorse them—those bills were three of the six I had received from Pearson—they were not in part payment of my account—they were not given to me—they were given to another party—I received the six bills at Leeds, at payment towards my account—I never saw the 625<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills, to which New<lb/>man adverted—these are the six bills I received (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I can't exactly tell you when I received these two (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was previous to getting the six bills at Leeds—I got these two from Pearson—I never had any conversation with Newman in respect of these two bills; they were paid away directly—I never got any money on those two bills, or upon the six—they are all due—after I saw Newman in the middle of July, I got a cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him, which was dishonoured—I believe I got that about 17th September—that is the only sum I received at all, except 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after this</p>

I am a manufacturer, trading under the firm of Demas Ellis, and Co., Dudley-hill, Bradford—before August, I had oc<lb/>casionally done business with Richard Pearson, of Noble-street, City—at that time, about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to me by him—after that, on Thursday, 11th September, Pearson introduced Newman to me, at Brad<lb/>ford—Newman was not there then, but Pearson had some conversation with me, and also sent me a letter—on 18th September, the prisoner called at my place—he said, "I am Newman, Mr. Pearson has told you about an arrangement which has been made between him and I"—he had a number of bills with him—I think the amount he showed me was about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; and he asked me to discount them for him—I told him I could not give him be cash then, but perhaps I could in the course of a week, but I could give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then—I wrote out a cheque on the bank, and went and got a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and twenty sovereigns, which I gave him; he was to have the remainder afterwards—he gave me bills to the amount of 411<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them, dated September 17th, for 86<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think there were four others; five altogether, of which this is one—on those I gave him the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him how it was that the bills came down with Richard Pearson's name on, and not his, and he said, "Because I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186301050122"/>
               <p>given Richard Pearson authority to collect my accounts, and to send them down here," and then, in my presence, he put his name before Richard Pearson's—the bill that I have spoken of, is drawn by Bernard and Co., and accepted by Pollack and Co. of Bush-lane; it is endorsed by Bernard and Co., Pearson, and Newman—Newman endorsed that and the other four also—I took the balance of Pearson's account out, and sent two back, and two I got discounted by a party, who appeared to know all about them—I said I would take 80 per cent for them to take our name out, and he gave me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the other 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I meant I would take 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a hundred to keep our name off, and the party said he would take the responsibility of the bills—somebody gave me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for those two bills, and the other two were returned to Pearson, and this is the fifth—I returned the two to Pearson before they were due—I had to take this bill up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a woollen manufacturer at Dewsbury, about nine miles from Bradford, in Yorkshire—I made the acquaintance of the prisoner in last August, I believe the latter part of August—he was with a person named Richard Pearson, and a man they call Johnson—Johnson came first before the others—I saw them at my warehouse at Dewsbury—they there picked out a parcel of goods to the amount of 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Johnson, in New<lb/>man's presence, spoke about Mr. Newman's wife having a farm in her own right at Dorking; inducing me to give him credit, and that he was a man of money, that some of his relations on his wife's side were very rich, and his friends abroad were wealthy—Newman told me himself that he wanted the goods to ship off to Naples—he said the blankets were for Garibaldi—I asked them for references, and amongst others they gave me references to Demas Ellis, and Co. and Jeremiah Walton—I wrote to them, found them satisfac<lb/>tory, and sent the goods to Richard Pearson, 6, Noble-street—I was to send them there, because Mr. Newman stated that he had not a warehouse in Fenchurch-street, but Mr. Pearson had one—at that time I received an acceptance from Mr. Pearson—it was laid in London several weeks; it was due yesterday, and I have sent it to my bankers; I have not got it now—it has been several times to the office of Mr. Holmes, the prisoner's solicitor—it has been there for them to pay us the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance—I have not been able to get the money—Newman called on me in Dewsbury by himself after the first lot of goods were obtained and bought a lot of goods—I cannot speak to the amount—I did not send them—I looked them out and marked them—they were woollen goods—he gave us an order for some blankets—we got the material spun ready, but in consequence of what we heard we did not complete the order, and are using it for something else—that was about September—I cannot speak exactly to the amount of that order—he said He</p>

               <p>wanted 10,000 blankets altogether, and that he must have 1,000 a month—the price that I set on them was a shilling a pound, and a pair of blankets would weigh ten pounds, that would be 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the lot—I received a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note from William Senior, and twenty sovereigns; that was in September, perhaps the 19th or 20th—I live nine miles from Demas Ellis, and Co.'s place—William Senior is the principal partner in the firm of John Richardson and Sons, a firm of thirty years' standing—Mr. Newman had left the note with him, and he sent it to me—he asked me to give a reference to the people in our neighbourhood—I received this letter from the prisoner about the money on 19th September, and I also received this letter signed R. Pearson, from Newman personally—(<hi rend="italic">This being read, was dated 16th September, 1862, from Noble-street, and stated that any goods which Mr. Newman might select, suitable for his markets, the writer would be agreeable to become a party to the transaction, and that he had every confidence in Mr. Newman, from what he knew if him and his family connexions</hi>)—I saw Pearson several times, and the prisoner also—I have told you of all the goods they got from me—I got three bills of exchange prior to the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these are they; I endorsed them last week—I got them from the prisoner, I believe, on 16th or 17th September, I cannot say to a day—it was after the goods were obtained, and after the order for the blankets had been given—it was while I had that order; those were all the bills I received—the prisoner wished me to be referee, to get some goods from a man called John Bruce, and another man called David Lee—I told him I could not become reference until my mind was satisfied that I was right in doing so; if any one called I would give the references I had got from Demas Ellis, and Co. and Walton, but not on my own strength, unless I had my money—I heard other things that were not satisfactory, and I refused to give references—I saw a lot of bills in his possession, as thick as this book, with stamps on them, and along with them were the three that he gave me—he said the bills would be right, I should be perfectly safe in taking them—I said, "I suppose if I write to these parties it will be all right?"—he said it would—he then gave me two, and said, "You had better take a third"—I took them, and said, "These are nothing, there is only Richard Pearson's name here, there is not yours"—I said, "You are represented to me as a man of wealth, these are nothing"—he then said, "Oh, I will sign them then," and he endorsed them in my drawing room—when that was done, he was going to sign my name in his bill-book—I said, "Hold on, these are not cashed," but he took the bill-book and insisted on writing my name—I still told him I was not satisfied—he said he would go to Bradford the following day, and he sent 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day following, it was left with a gentleman for me—he afterwards, on 26th, asked for that 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back in cash, that is the only cash I ever did receive, and, I suppose, all I ever shall—the reason Newman gave me for wanting it back was, that I had not carried out my part of the agreement, to give a reference—I stuck to the 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a lawyer's letter about it, but I still stuck to it.</p>

Smith, of Fenchurch-street, would engrave it—in consequence of that I drew the cheque, and struck out the word "Bearer," and made it "or order"—I did not authorize him to get the money or endorse the cheque—this sheet of plates was shown to me by the</p>

I am station-master at Charlton station, on the North Kent line—the prisoner has been a porter there for about two years—he occasionally assists me in collecting the tickets from the passengers arriving there—as soon as he collects them it is his duty to bring them into the office, and they are put into a box and sent to London—the third-class fare from Charlton to Woolwich is 1d; there are no return tickets between those stations—the up tickets are green, and the down are brown—they cannot take tickets at Charlton station to bring people back from Woolwich Arsenal—on 9th December the prisoner collected from the train due at thirty-four minutes past 5, and after its arrival, about 6 o'clock, I looked at the place where the tickets collected ought to be deposited—the prisoner had not brought them into the office, and I found them placed on the signal-box—I examined them, and there was one missing—I judge of that, because there are consecutive numbers, and 2341, I think it is, was not there—there were the numbers before and after it—Mary Ann Atkins came by the train arriving at Charlton at half-past 7 from Woolwich Arsenal, and I collected from her that identical ticket—the prisoner was employed in the station on 13th December to col<lb/>lect tickets, and after the arrival of the 5.34 train, I looked to see if any tickets were missing, and missed Nos. 2661, and 2662, 2663, and 2604—Mrs. Atkins and a child arrived at 10.3—my brother collected the tickets then and I went to him and took out of his hand the tickets 2663 and 2664, which I handed over to the constable—these are the three tickets I speak of—I do do not know what has become of Nos. 2661 and 2662—I commu<lb/>nicated with my superiors, and the prisoner was given in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bodychan Sparrow, of No. 1, Melville-place, Lee-road—the prisoner has been in my service four months—on Saturday, 6th December, I obtained leave from my husband to let her go to the theatre—she promised to return that night by the 11 o'clock train—she did not do so—her sister called the following evening, at 5 o'clock—my husband went to church in the morning, and while he was gone I missed the jacket—my husband went to the police-station, and a policeman called the same evening—we did not wish anything done on Sunday evening, and in the meantime her sister came, at 5 o'clock—the policeman went up stairs on Sunday evening with the under nurse, and brought me down word that the box was locked—on Monday he returned with the key—I saw him open the box, and saw some of my property in it—tips is my shawl—I had mined it for quite six weeks before—I have had it two or three years—I have no doubt about its being mine—this ribbon is also mine—I cannot say about these gloves; they might, or might not, be mine—I had spoken to the pri<lb/>soner and the other servants when I missed this shawl—I asked about it several times—the prisoner had no authority whatever from me to take these things and put them in her box—the shawl was hanging up in a dressing-room, behind the door, before I missed it—the first night the prisoner came to my house there was some difficulty in getting her box open, and I lent her a great many loose keys—I afterwards allowed her to keep one of them—I have never seen it since—she came down, and said she was much obliged to me; she had found one; and I said she might keep it.</p>

On Monday afternoon, 22d Decem<lb/>ber, about half—past 5 o'clock, I was on duty in the Kennington-road, and saw the prisoner driving a cab from London towards the Horns Tavern, at the rate of about ten miles an hour, on his wrong side: the off side—he turned round the corner at the same rate—there is a paved crossing there for foot passengers—he crossed over that sharp against the kerb—the deceased lad was stepping off the kerb with a basket of grocery on his head,</p>

               <p>at the moment the horse struck him, knocked him down, and the cab passed over him, quite rolling him over—I did not see the wheel go over him, but the cab passed over him between the wheels, and from the lowness of the wheels it doubled him up—I cannot say whether the horse trod on him—the prisoner continued at the same speed, and I followed, overtook him, and asked him if he was aware he had run over a lad—he said, "D—and b—r the b—y lad; why did not he get out of the way"—I then observed that he was the worse for drink—I made him go back—the lad was lying on the crossing, bleeding from the face—I picked him up, and put him into, the prisoner's cab—I then got in myself and told the prisoner to drive on to St. Thomas's Hospital—he refused to do so though I asked him three times as I was sitting in the cab—I was obliged to put the lad into another cab, with the waterman, to go to the hospital, and I took the prisoner to the station—he appeared quite capable of driving, and could stand very well, but he had been drinking—he was very violent, and was arguing with the people who got round the spot—I went to the hospital the same night, and saw the lad—he gave me his name and address—his face was covered with blood, but I could not see where the wound was.</p>

I was walking home to Clapham on this evening, close to the deceased, on the same side—I saw a cab driving very fast from the corner; nearly ten miles an hour, I should think, and supposing some acci<lb/>dent had happened, I ran after the cab, and met Mr. Stebbing coming back it—it went round the corner very last, decidedly faster than it ought,</p>

               <p>and the off wheels went on the kerb on the off side of the cab, which made it rock—the wheels actually went on the footway after he turned the corner—I saw the lad put into the cab—the prisoner did not assist in any way—another man was getting up on the box, who said that if the prisoner would not drive he would, but the prisoner seized hold of the reins to prevent him driving—the boy was taken away in another cab—the prisoner was a little in drink, but perfectly able to stand.</p>

Q.</hi> In what direction were you walking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the City towards Clapham on the Horns side—I did not see the boy knocked down—the cab had proceeded twenty or thirty yards from the foot crossing, before the wheels went on the pavement—the foot pavement is about fifteen feet wide there; about the width of the jury-box, or perhaps not so wide—I do not think the kerbstone in very low at that point—I think the foot pavement is all flags, I pass over it every day—I will swear that the kerb is more than three inches high from the gutter—the road was not under<lb/>going repair to my knowledge—I cannot Bay whether there were or were not any rough Macadamized stones twenty yards from the crossing.</p>

I am one of the house-surgeons of St. Thomas's Hospital—the deceased was brought there on 22d December, suffering con<lb/>siderably from a shock—there was no fracture to be detected outwardly—the skin of his right eye was just torn off, and there was blood about his fact, which appeared to have come from his nose—I attended him with another medical gentleman, until the evening of the next day, when he died—I made a post mortem examination on the 24th—the small intestines were ruptured, and there was also a small rupture of the liver—all the other organs were healthy—these injuries were quite sufficient to cause death—I have heard the evidence—in my opinion those injuries were likely to be inflicted by being knocked down in the way described.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was here read as follows</hi>: "What the policeman has said is false; the horse could not go above six or seven miles an hour. The boy was right in the road. I was going very steady, about six or seven miles an hour. I had not got to the crossing. I was nowhere near the crossing, and when the boy fell down I stopped and got off the cab. He was put into my cab, and I was going to take him to the hospital, when a man came and pushed me off the wheel as I was getting up, and said I was drunk and not fit to drive, and he would drive. I took the reins and said he should not, and while we were talking about it he was taken out of my cab and put into another cab. I hallooed two or three times to the boy. I did all I could to pull the horse off. I was very sorry, indeed, of course I did not run over the boy for the purpose. I went next day to the hospital and saw the boy. I said, "You must have heard me holloa." He said, "I did; it was not your fault." He said he had been up two nights at work at his shop. I was not drunk. I had just come from changing horses, it was a pure accident.</p>

I am the wife of George Bowers, of 36, Herbert's buildings, Waterloo-road—one night in December, between three and five minutes past 12, I was walking down Waterloo-road with my husband and Mary Ann Trybeck, coming from market—three persons accosted us—the prisoner was one of them—he said to my husband, "If you hit that woman, I shall hit you"—my husband asked him what woman he meant—he said, "That girl coming down the road," and he pointed to some girl coming down the road—my husband asked him what he meant, and he said if my husband hit that woman he should hit him—I said, "Mate, you are labouring under a great mistake, no one was interfering with that woman or with you"—he told me to mind my own business, and used improper lan<lb/>guage</p>

               <p>—I told him it was my business, and he hit my husband a violent blow—it out his eye open—he hit me in my eye and blacked it; it was a violent blow—he did not knock us down—after I came out from the crowd I missed 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a great crowd collected—when the prisoner hit me in the eye, another person who was with the prisoner, hit my husband too—the other seemed to be acting in concert—I had blows from several of them round—the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was loose in my gown pocket—I am confident the prisoner is the man—I have no doubt in the least about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Mint, and have been so for many years—counterfeit coin is invariably electro-plated before it is sent into circulation—here are batteries, acids, antimony, sand, a frame for making a mould, tins for holding a mould, and a ladle for melting metal, with metal in it—this get has been attached to a coin, and, most likely, to a shilling—when coin it removed from the mould, it is usual to file it, to take away the mark of the get; but at the present time they make it almost perfect, and the file is less used than it was formerly, on account of the formation of the mould—the <hi rend="italic">nurling</hi> is more complete—the only thing wanting here is the mould—there is plaster of Paris in this basin, and a piece of glass, for the purpose of putting it on—here are files for finishing the coin, with metal in the teeth—then comes the finishing part of it, the battery coating it with silver, and then the sand to clean the coins—this is the sort of battery which is used for coating counterfeit coin—it could be used by an electro-plater, but it would be on a very small scale—the antimony is used to mix with the other metal to make the coin sound better—there are some strips of paper here, which may be Used for wrapping the coin up. in when it is made—there is plenty of silver leaf, which is put into the battery, and the action of the battery puts the silver on to the coin—the sand is used to take away the brightness after it is completed—sometimes they put on grease, or black stuff—there is here a little pot containing grease for that purpose.</p>
