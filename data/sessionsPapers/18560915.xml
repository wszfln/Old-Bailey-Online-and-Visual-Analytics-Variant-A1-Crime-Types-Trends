                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. I am in the service of Mr. Nicholas Dawson, a linendraper, of No. 17, Crisp-street, Poplar—the prisoner was in his service as an apprentice, in 1854—he then left, and was in prison—on Sunday evening, 17th Aug. last, I saw him at my master's door, about half past 6 o'clock; I opened the door to him—he said, "Is Mrs. Dawson in?"—I did not answer; my fellow servant, Mary Phillips, came up, and answered him—he said he was the brother of Mrs. Dawson—I let him in—Mr. and Mrs. Dawson were at chapel—the prisoner came into the sitting room, kissed the child, and told him he was his uncle—(he is not any relation to Mr. and Mrs. Dawson)—he said he had come from the country—Phillips said he had come quite unexpectedly—he said no, he had written to Mrs. Dawson on Saturday evening—she said Mrs. Dawson could not get the letter until Monday morning—the prisoner then said he would come in and go to bed—I went up stairs after my bonnet, leaving him in the sitting room—I went into a room on the second floor to get my bonnet—I saw the prisoner run up the stairs to the third floor—I then recognized him, and ran down stairs, and cried out "Police!" and said that it was Alfred—I did not recognize him at first—while I was at the door, the prisoner came down; he came as far as the corner of the counter in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150002"/>
               <p>shop, and said to Phillips, "Miss, Miss Gooding sent me for the writing desk"—he had the writing desk in his hand—it had been on the dressing table in Miss Gooding's bed room, on the second floor—he must have passed that room in coming down from the third floor—I had seen the desk in the room when I went to fetch my bonnet—I did not recognize him at first, because he was dressed much more shabbily than when he was there before—I am sure he is the person—this is the desk—Phillips brought it to me afterwards—she is not here—she is still in Mr. Dawson's service; she was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Rigby. The prisoner has been in their employ for four years, since I have been there—he has been in the habit of taking his hone and cart to London, and other places, when we are short of a man—he has the control of the corn house and the hay house—when he has gone out, there was no one to control him in what he took; he took what he thought proper—I have seen him once or twice, when he has come back, bring his nosebag and empty out what he has brought back—on 5th Sept. I sent a boy for some sacks, and then I went down and shot out a couple of sacks of potatoes on the top of the chaff, and there were several cotchells there, which is about as much as an old man can carry—my opinion is, that there is not sufficient for the prisoner's horse in the bait sack, but there is too much in the two sacks—my opinion is now, that the prisoner did not intend to steal—I never heard anything against him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police inspector</hi>). On the evening of 2nd Sept., a few minutes before 9 o'clock, I was in a galley on the river, near the Custom House—I know Banks as a waterman—I saw him there in a boat—he went to a barge that was lying afloat off the Custom House—I afterwards ascertained that barge to be the <hi rend="italic">Lord Clarendon</hi>—whilst he was proceeding there, I heard a whistle; it appeared to come from the direction of the barge—Banks then rowed his boat to the barge—I heard some one stumble from off the barge's cabin bead into the boat—Banks then rowed his boat ashore to the East Custom House-stairs—I saw that there was then a second person in it—when the boat got to the stain, that person jumped from the boat, and ran towards the steps leading to the street—that man was Bryant—he was stopped, and brought back—he smelt very strongly of rum—he had been drinking, but was not affected by it—he appeared to be quite conscious of what he was doing—he ran very nimbly from the boat, much more so than a drunken man could have done, for about fifteen yards—I asked Banks whom he had brought ashore—he said, "I don't know; I plied him as a fare from the stairs"—I said, "I know better, for I saw where you rowed your boat from, and you know all about it"—he said, no, he did not—he had not rowed from the stairs, but from between the two stairs, about the centre of the Custom House—I told him so—he then said, "Well, I know I did for I was waiting for him"—I then sent the constable, Dell, off to the <hi rend="italic">Lord Clarendon</hi> barge, and afterwards went myself; I saw Sholl there—he was the Custom House officer in charge of the barge—Dell said to me, in his hearing, "Mr. Thomas, there is a white bundle in the hold"—I asked Sholl who he was—he said, "I am the officer; is there anything <hi rend="italic">up</hi>?"—I said, "Yes; I have every reason to believe there has been a felony committed from the barge"—he said, Oh, impossible, it cannot be; there has been no one here but myself, and no one could get here without my knowing it"—I then asked him what the barge had in it—he said, "Tobacco leaves"—I said that I had two parties in custody on suspicion of stealing—I first showed him Bryant—he said, "I don know anything of him"—I then showed him Banks—he said, "Yes, I know him</p>

               <p>as a waterman, and that is all I know of him"—he appeared quite sober; he did not smell at all of liquor—I found no rum, or smell of turn, on board—I then proceeded to search the barge, in Sholl's presence—I found the hatches closed, the tarpaulins over the hatches, and the hatch bars over them, all apparently secure—I then went down into the cabin—I found the door leading from the cabin into the hold—the hatches being fast, that was the only way by which anybody could get into the hold—I found sprinkled on the steps of the cabin a quantity of small, broken tobacco leaf, and the same on the cabin floor, towards the door leading into the hold, and also from the door leading to the case containing tobacco—in the hold, and between the case and the door, about four feet within the door, I found a quantity of tobacco tied up in a white apron—I called Sholl's attention to these appearances—he said, "Well, it certainly does look very suspicious, very queer indeed; nobody could come here without my seeing them; I have been here by myself, as I told you before"—he then became very excited indeed—he was then in the hold along with me—I pointed out the bundle to him—he said he knew nothing at all about it; that was the first he had seen of it—I examined the cases in the hold—one was unsound, and broken—a piece of the case was broken off, and lying down on the barge's ceiling; the head of the case was partly raised, and there was a vacant space in the tobacco inside, of about six inches in depth; I judge that would be about 30lbs.—the case was about three feet six, square—I then took Bryant and Banks to the station, and in about an hour and a half returned to the barge—I found Sholl in the cabin—the cabin floor had then been swept, or rather the particles of leaves I had left, were all gone, and I said to him, "Why, the cabin floor has been swept since I have been away; have you swept it?"—he said, "No; it is not my place to sweep cabin floors"—I then walked into the hold, and saw the case, and said, "This case is not as I left it"—when I left it the piece was lying on the bottom of the barge's ceiling, and when I came back it was put on in its original place, as far as the nails would admit, and the tobacco in the case was lightened up, so as to give the case the appearance of being full—I said to him, "This case is not as I left it"—he said, "How can that be, when there has been nobody here but myself? you are a d—scoundrel, sir, for insinuating such a thing; I see what you want plainly; you want to get a case up against me"—I took a sample of the tobacco in the case, and afterwards compared it with some tobacco found on Bryant—it exactly corresponded—6 1/2 lbs. was found on Bryant—there was about 4lbs. in the apron—I reported to my superintendent, Mr. Evans, what had transpired, and, in consequence of his directions, I went two days afterwards to Sholl's resi<lb/>dence—I found him there, and told him that he must consider himself in custody—he said, "You don't mean that, do you?"—I said, "Yes"—he asked me whose authority, and what authority I had—I told him, "As a police inspector"—he said, "Where is your authority?"—I showed him my warrant card—he said, "I don't mean that; I want to know who sent you here?"—I said, "Superintendent Evans"—I told him I took him into cus<lb/>tody for being concerned, with two others in custody, in stealing 10lbs. of tobacco from a case in the barge <hi rend="italic">Lord Clarendon</hi>—he said, "It is a bad job; all I know about it is I was asleep"—I had seen him on the previous morning, Wednesday, standing at the corner of Water-lane, Thames-street he bade me "Good morning," and asked how I was getting on with the case—I said I was going before the Lord Mayor with the two prisoners—he said, "Well, it is a bad job; unfortunately I was asleep, but I don't like to</p>

               <p>tell the Board that"—that was the first he said about being asleep—I found nobody on board the barge but him at first, except Dell, the constable, whom I had sent there—the barge will carry from sixty-five to seventy tons; it is nearly as long as this Court; it is a river barge, with a cabin at one end, rather raised above the deck—you enter it by a little scuttle, or hatchway—his place would be in the cabin, or on deck, I suppose.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the police, but have lately received a pension. On 10th Sept. I went to ft house in Flower and Dean-street, Spitalfields, with some officers—on entering the street, there were a great number of persons, who called out, "<hi rend="italic">Jack I Jack Sheppard!</hi> here comes the b——<hi rend="italic">coppers!"</hi>—I saw Brown and Langdon put their heads out of the first floor windows of the house, without their hate or coats on—I rushed up stairs, followed by other officers—I saw Langdon leave Brown's room and rush into an adjoining room, and the door was closed—I broke the room door open, and saw Langdon come from a table, and sit down on a chair by the door—the drawer of that table was open, and in it I found two files, with white metal in their teeth, at if they had been recently used—on the table was this little pot, containing sand and water—we secured these articles, and put them into Brown's room—at the time I was forcing the door open, I saw Brown (I believe it was) run up stairs—he had nothing on but his trowsers and shirt and boots—on entering the room, I saw Sullivan sitting near the window, which was open, and two shillings were near her, bearing date 1819—this was the front room, out of the window of which I had seen the men put their heads—I then proceeded up stairs, where I had seen the man run—I found Brown in bed—I called him by the name of <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and shook him two or three times—I said, "It is nonsense for you to play these tricks with me; you are not asleep, I know"—(this was in the room over the room I had seen them look out of; it looked on to the parapet of the house)—Brown said, "I have been asleep, so help me God; I have been up all night"—I asked him to get up, he refused, and I was compelled to pull him out of bed—at that time he put on his trowsers and boots, and became very violent—after he had been secured he attempted to butt me with his head, and stamped with all his force on our toes—after he was secured he said, "If you will let me dress myself I will go with you quietly"—I said, "That we will do, you have no clothes here"—he said, "No, they are down stairs"—I took him down to the room where I had seen him put his head out of the window, and in that room, on a bed, was his coat and handkerchief, and waistcoat and cap—I addressed Sullivan, and said, "What have you got about you?—she said, "Nothing, Sir, but good money"—I said, "I must have it," and she took from her pocket this bag, which contains 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money, consisting of one half-crown, florins, shillings, and one sixpence—the half crown bears the date of 1818, which corresponds with the half crown which will be produced—we secured the prisoners, and took them to the station—there was a mob outside, of I suppose, 2,000 persons—they were very riotous, and began to unharness the horse from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> that we were taking the prisoners to the station in.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a police inspector, but have retired On 1st Sept I went, in consequence of information, to No. 23, Chapel-place, Coram-street, Russell-square, with other officers—I found the front door open, I proceeded up stairs to the first floor—I pushed the room door in, and found the two prisoners; they were sitting close to a bright, dear fire—on seeing me enter, they both jumped up—the woman picked from the table a quantity of counterfeit coin, and flung it towards the window, which was open—a portion of it fell on the floor—at that time the man threw from his hand a plaster of Paris mould, and commenced stamping on it—he had neither coat, waistcoat, nor hat on, and his shirt sleeves were tucked up—I seized him, and pushed him into a sort of cupboard—he resisted violently, and the female prisoner seized me behind—by the effort of the officers, she was pulled from me, and both the prisoners were taken to a distant part of the room and secured—I picked up a portion of the mould which the man had thrown down, it is for making 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pieces—I saw on the mantelpiece eight counterfeit shillings unfinished, of the date of 1820, and three counterfeit sixpences—on the fire I found this ladle, with white metal in it in a fused state—inside the fender this plaster of Paris mould, which is complete, with this counterfeit shilling in it—the <hi rend="italic">get</hi> is to the shilling—the mould was so hot I could not hold it—the shilling is of the same date as the others, 1820—I found on the table a galvanic battery, in full play—there was a good groat attached to the wire, and six counterfeit groats were in the deposit place undergoing the process of electro plating—there was a piece of glass with plaster of Paris on it—I saw these two files found on the table, with white metal in their teeth, some plaster of Paris in powder, and some white sand; all the instruments for making counterfeit coin—this battery cylinder was in the cupboard—I took the prisoners to the station—they were asked their names and address; the female prisoner said she was not married.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Mary's Hospital The prosecutrix was brought there in the beginning of July last—I was called down stairs, and found her in the waiting room lying on a couch—her face was covered—I uncovered it, and found it very much blackened, and there was bleeding from the right eye—the face was also very much swollen—she was removed into the ward—I afterwards examined the right eye—it was destroyed, the iris was protruding; the eye itself was completely destroyed—there was a lacerated wound over the outer part of the orbit, above—the bone was bared—it was such a wound as would have been inflicted by stones of this description tired from a pistol—I considered it a dangerous wound at the time—she has been under my care nearly up to the present time—she has completely lost her eye—I cannot say that she is out of danger yet, she might have a relapse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an M.D., of the University of Edinburgh, and live at No. 1, Howley-place, nine doors from where the prosecutrix lived. I heard the report of the pistol as I was reading in my own room—I went out into my front garden to see what it was, and a woman came in a great hurry—I went to see the young woman; I found her lying on a bed bleeding pro<lb/>fusely from the eye and the forehead—I examined it; I found the integu<lb/>ments severed from the frontal portion of the bone, and falling over the cheek, and a small portion of the bone exposed—the eye itself was burst and gone—it was such a wound as would have been inflicted by stones of this description fired from a pistol—I should say it could not have been caused by powder alone; you might have had a contused wound, but not the integuments dragged from the bone—I-should think powder could not have done that.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 8, York-terrace, Albany-road, Old Kent-road, with my father and mother; I am sixteen years of age. On Tuesday, 22nd July, I was at Charing-cross, near Buckingham-court, about 12 o'clock in the day—I saw the prisoner Thomas there—I had seen him before, several times—I had seen him in the Albany-road; he asked me if I wanted a situation—this was by the Admiralty—I had gone on there from Buckingham-court—he stopped me there, and asked me if I wanted a situa<lb/>tion—I said, "Yes "—he asked me if I would go and change a cheque—I said, "Yes"—he asked me if I knew Coutts's—I said I did—he said if I would make haste, he would get me a situation, and peak as if he had known me a long while—he mentioned the name of Mr. Robertson—he pointed over the way to Whitehall-place, and said it was where the door was open—he then gave me the cheque in a piece of paper, and I put it into my pocket—I then left him—he told me I was to get it <hi rend="italic">short;</hi> that I was to take it to Mr. Robertson, his <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>, if he was not there, and give</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150040"/>
               <p>it to him—he said <hi rend="italic">short</hi> meant notes—he pointed out the place where I was to take it, in Whitehall-place, No. 22, I understood him—I then went to Coutts's, I presented the cheque to one of the clerks there—they kept me there about a quarter of an hour, and then the clerk wrote on the cheque "Ordered not to pay "—he, afterwards, gave it to me again—I took it, and went out, and went to Whitehall-place, where the prisoner had pointed out—I knocked at the private door, and a footboy came to the door—I inquired for Mr. Robertson, and he said he did not know any such name—I went next door, there was a door open, and a lot of names written up in the door way—I did not see the name there, so I came out, and crossed over the road to No. 2, thinking that might be the place—I went in there; there was a man having his dinner in the hall, and I asked him, and he said I was to go over to No. 22—I went over there, and saw Thain, the detective officer—I did not know him at that time—I asked him if he knew a Mr. Robertson—he said, "It is about a cheque, is it not?" and I said, "Yes sir;" of course, thinking he was Mr. Robertson—I gave the cheque to Thain, and he and I went into No. 22 to inquire—they said there that Robertson bad been dead eight years—I was afterwards with Thain for eleven days looking after Thomas—I saw him at the corner of Fleet-street on 5th Aug., about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon—Thain was with me at the time, about two or three yards off—Hillyer was with Thomas—I went and spoke to Thain about them, and they went on, and went into an ice shop in Fleet-street—they were there two or three minutes—Thain told me to keep out of their sight—I kept away as much as I could—Thomas came out first, and went towards Temple Bar; that was when I saw him—Hillyer came out a little while afterwards—Thomas stopped all at once when he came out—I think he saw me—Hillyer came up to him—Thain kept beckoning me to keep back—I saw them talking together—Thain then came up and took them into custody—this is the cheque.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer. I was desired to go to Coutts's bank, in the Strand, on 22nd July—I found the lad Davidson there—upon his leaving the bank I followed him—I had no communication with him before he left the bank—I do not know that he was aware that anybody was following him—he went along the Strand, down Charing-cross, and turned into Whitehall-place—he went to a house in Whitehall-place, and from that house to another, and then another—he was carrying something in his hand—I was standing on the pavement in Whitehall-place at this time—after he had gone to three houses; he asked me if I knew the name of Robertson—I said I did not—I said, "Is it about a cheque that you have been to Coutts's bank about?"—he said, "Yes, it is," and he gave me the cheque, which he had in his hand—he then gave me an account of how he became possessed of it, and gave me a description of the person from whom he said he had received it—after this it was arranged that he and I should go about the principal streets to look for this person, and we did so until 5th Aug.—in the afternoon of that day we were at the corner of Fleet-street and Bridge-street, on the south side of Fleet-street, and the lad drew my attention to the two prisoners—he said, "That is the party that gave me the cheque"—in consequence of what he said, I followed them—they went along Fleet-street, and went into an ice shop, ten or twelve doors up—they remained there about three or four minutes—Thomas came out first, and turned towards Temple-bar—he stopped a little, and then Hillyer came out, and walked towards St. Paul's—he afterwards turned round, and joined Thomas</p>

               <p>—I do not know where the lad was when Thomas stopped; I told him to go away out of sight, but to keep sight of me—when Hillyer joined Thomas I saw them talking together—upon that I went up and took them into cus<lb/>tody—I said, "Gentlemen, I wish to speak to you over at the station house"—they said nothing at that time—I took them over to the station—I then told them that I charged them with stealing a bundle of letters of letters from the Post-office receiving house, in King-street, Covent-garden—Thomas said, "I know nothing at all about it"—Hillyer said, "I am sure I don't; I should like to see my solicitor"—the station sergeant asked them their names and addresses—they refused to give them—I think they said, "We decline giving any address "—I afterwards got from them the names of George Thomas and Henry Hillyer—they did not give any address—I searched Thomas, and found on him a duplicate, a key, and a penny; I did not search Hillyer—I learned from Davidson that his parents lived at No 8, York-terrace, Albany-road, Camberwell—I found Hillyer's residence to be No. 24, St. Mary's-square, Kennington—Thomas's mother lives at No. 2, Paragon-place, New Kent-road—I have not been there—that is about ten or twelve minutes' walk from the Albany-road—it is in the same neighbourhood.</p>

I enclosed in it this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I sealed the letter, and took it to Mr. Grigg's, the post receiving house, in Regent-street—I saw a young man in the shop who registered my letter—I received this receipt—it was about 2 or 3 o'clock in the day—the note was quite clean at that time, it was a new note from the Bank of England, there was no writing on it—I had received it from Messrs. Hoare and Co., my bankers, shortly before—I had other notes with consecutive numbers in my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I assist in the Post-office receiving house, in Regent-street, kept by my uncle. On 14th July, shortly before 3 o'clock, I remem<lb/>ber Miss Brook coming in with a letter which she wished registered—I called down Mr. Vesey, who was at dinner—I saw him receive a letter from Miss Brook, register it, and put it on a desk on the counter; he then left the shop—it was then approaching to 3 o'clock, which is one of the periods at which the letters are collected—I was about to begin to take the letters out of the box, when a young man came in and asked for a sheet of note paper—I served him, and he paid me and left the shop—I asked him if I should put it in a piece of paper for him—he said no, he had a piece of blotting paper himself—I believe the prisoner Thomas to be the man—after he had left, a second man came in; that man had on a white hat—I believe Hillyer to be the man—he asked the price of a match box in the window—I told him, and showed it him—he looked at it a little, and said he did not want to buy it that day—he then went out of the shop—I got the letters out of the box and took them to the desk to tie them up, and I then found that the registered letter was gone—I called Vesey down, and stated what had happened—between the time of Vesey going away after placing the letter on the desk, and my missing it, I do not believe any per<lb/>son had come into the shop but the two men, who I believe to be the pri<lb/>soners—I have no recollection whatever of any person coming in the mean-time—I should say I missed the letter from four to five minutes after the men had gone—it took me two or three minutes to take out the letters, and I immediately went with them to the desk, and missed the letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, in the employ of Messrs. Hewitt, of Barking. I have been in the employ about six months—during that time I served on board the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>, which is one of Messrs. Hewitt's smacks—the prisoner was the captain, and, besides that, he was commodore of the fleet—he commanded all Messrs. Hewitt's vessels—they may have twenty or thirty vessels—I sailed from Barking, in the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>, on 26th April—in the course of that voyage we were fishing off the Skilling, which is off the Dutch coast—it is on the high seas—I remember the boat of the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> coming to our smack one Monday morning—Mr. Bullen, the master of the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi>, came in it—the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> is not one of Messrs. Hewitt's smacks—I do not rightly know who is the owner of it, hut Mr. Bullen is the captain—I have seen him on the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi>—the prisoner had gone on board the <hi rend="italic">Industry</hi> on the Sunday evening, and he came on board the <hi rend="italic">Enterprise</hi>, in Mr. Bullen's boat, on Monday morning—they ordered as to get a pair of bridles out, and pot them into the <hi rend="italic">Industry's</hi> boat—bridles are ropes which fasten on to the fishing nets—they are about five-inch ropes—they are for trawling the nets—they may be about eighteen fathoms long—we got them out of the vessel's stern, and coiled them into the <hi rend="italic">Industry's</hi> boat—they were new—after that we put the upper nets into the boat, by the prisoner's order—that is the upper part of the fishing net—one part goes on the ground, and the other over it—the net was in the fore part of the vessel—we got it, and put it into the <hi rend="italic">Industry's</hi> boat—the boat was let go, and went away to it's own vessel—the prisoner stayed on board his own vessel—Ryder, of the ship <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi>, had come before this transaction with Bullen—when Ryder came I had orders from the prisoner to unreef the main halyards, and reef a new pair—the old main halyards were put into the <hi rend="italic">Tigers</hi> boat by the prisoner's order—we were at sea eight weeks—in the fore part of the voyage Ryder had a bucket and a tin kettle—the prisoner was on board the <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi>, and called out for us to bring a lead line—our boat took the lead line to him, and came back—I did not go with the boat; two apprentices went with it—I did not see them deliver the lead line—the boat went with it, and came back without it—the <hi rend="italic">Tiger</hi> was not far from us, forty or fifty yards—the boat returned, and came on board our own vessel, and then Ryder's boat came for a bucket and a tea kettle—the bucket was new—the tea kettle was half worn—I did not hand them into the boat, but I saw it done—they went into Mr. Ryder's boat, and the boat went on board the <hi rend="italic">Tiger.</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). On 16th Aug., about 9 o'clock in the morning, I saw Lawrence; he had a pony and chaise, and drove from Upper Thames-street to Rutland-wharf, Mr. Green's warehouse—I watched him, as I had done previously, and saw him back his cart under the archway of Mr. Green's warehouse—I then saw Barnes go on to the mill floor, and shoot through the ceiling three parts of a sack of corn—I saw him take the sack, wheel it up to the post, and empty it through the shoot into another sack that Stiles was holding underneath; he then fetched another sack partly rail, and shot the contents of that also through the shoot into the same sack, which made the sack full—Stiles then tied it up, lowered it into the cart, and Lawrence got into his cart and received it—another man in Messrs. Green's employ then came out of the mill, which is another part of the premises, and brought a sack half full, which he handed up to Lawrence in the cart; his name is Randall, he is not to be found—ten minutes after<lb/>wards I saw Lawrence at a public house in Earl-street, with two other men, not the prisoners—after they had been there five minutes they came out; he turned his cart round, and went up Rutland wharf again, with two more men of Mr. Green's—when he bed got some distance, I and May stopped him—I said, "We are police officers, and I want to know what you have in those sacks "—he said, "Only some sweepings, Sir, from Messrs. Green and Sedg<lb/>wick's"—I said, "Let me look at it"—he opened the sack, which was half full, and I found it contained sweepings mixed with split beam—he then opened the other sack, and that I found contained oats, but the mice had got into it, and apparently eaten it—I said, "What did you give for it?"—he said, "I gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the sack of oats, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the men to get some beer with, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for this bit of stuff," meaning we smaller sack—I said, "Who did you pay?"—he said, "I gave Stiles 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave Randall four sixpences"—I then took him to the station—about a quarter past 10 o'clock went to Messrs. Green's, and Stiles was sent for into the counting home—said to him, "We are police officers: what account have you to give of the sacks of corn which you have sent away by the man Lawrence?"—he said, "I only sent away a sack of sweepings, for which I received 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Mr. Green asked Stiles, in my presence, if he had received any other money—he said, "No"—he asked him if he had received any money for beer—we said, "No"—Barnes was afterwards sent for—I told him that we were police officers, and said, "You have been assisting to send away some sacks</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Green and Sedgwick, corn mer<lb/>chants, of Rutland-wharf. Barnes and Stiles were in our employ for some years; we placed great confidence in them—we have sometimes sweepings in our warehouse—the prisoners have a right to sell them, and pay the proceeds to the clerk, which is entered in a book—we had some oats in our warehouse, no person had any right to sell them—I have seen this corn and sweepings; we had such corn in our warehouse, and I believe it to be our's—the sack of oats was bitten by rats, but was of considerable value—the oats found in the sack are worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the sweepings, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is an entry on 16th Aug. by Stiles, "1 sack of sweepings, Lawrence "—the clerk does not come till 9 o'clock, and when he comes, Stiles would hand over the money to him—we had split beans in the warehouse; he had no right to sell them as sweepings, not to the extent that they are there—here is more than ordinary, there should be only one fourth—my impression is that these must have been split beans placed pur<lb/>posely there—there was scarcely a handful of sweepings among the oats, it was scarcely to be called sweepings—I told Stiles that Lawrence had been taken to the station house, and that some oats were found in his possession, which I examined—he first said that they were sweepings and were on the floor, but I told him I had seen them, and examined them, and should give him in custody of the police; he pleaded very hard for forgiveness, regretted that things should come to such a pass as that, and begged roe to look over it—he said that Lawrence gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for beer—I then told Barnes that Stiles was taken into custody on a charge of stealing the corn—he first said that he did not deliver anything; then he said, "Only just a little;" then he said that he delivered more, and pleaded hard for mercy—they had both been in our employment sixteen or seventeen years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 40, Webber-street, Old-street-road, and am foreman of the works to Mr. George Myers, of Lambeth. The three prisoners were in his employ, Clark and Brown as plumbers' labourers, and Perry as plumber—on 13th Sept. Mr. Myers was engaged in building the Oriental Bank, in Broad-street—the three prisoners were employed there—they were all the men that were employed about plumbing—I was on the watch, and saw them cut off some lead pipe—I could not see which of them it was, but it was one of the three, and the other two must have seen it; they were not above a yard from each other—I then saw them cutting it up into lengths nine inches or a foot long, but could not see which it was of the three—it was new pipe, and those lengths could not be used in the building—Clark beat the pipe with what is called a <hi rend="italic">dresser</hi>, which is used in the trade—they next rolled out part of a sheet of lead, which was sent to be fitted to the gutter and flat—I saw them all three rolling it; I am sure of that—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150058"/>
               <p>they were in the basement, and I was under the stairs, observing them, pro<lb/>posely—Perry, the plumber, cut the lead, and after it was cut Brown went to see what o'clock it was, and came back and said, "It wants 6 minutes to 12"—I could not observe which of them cut the lead off, as the cellar was very dark, but I saw them unroll it and cut it, and I found the knife after<lb/>wards—I saw Perry cut the sheet of lead; he and Clark rolled it up, and, when Brown came and said that it was 6 minutes to 12, Perry and Clark fastened the lead round Clark's body, while Brown kept watch, with the door of the basement in his hand, which leads towards the stairs where I was—they could not see me from that door; I was at the side of the stairs, about ten feet from where they had the lead—Clark and Perry put all the length of pipe they had cut up into the sheet lead; and when they had fastened it round Clark's body, and the bell rang 12 o'clock, Perry walked out—Clark walked after him, and put the key into his pocket—I followed them, and detained Clark and Brown till a policeman was sent for—Perry stood by—I took Clark to the station, and saw the lead found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Sidney Young and Charles Magnay—I carry on with them the business of ship builders, and have done so for forty years. In the early part of this year we had, I suppose, about 300 or 400 men in our employment—we had regular times of work, and for going off work—in the summer time the men commenced work at 6 o'clock, and worked from 6 till 8, then from half-past 8 till 11, from 20 minutes past 11 till 1, from 2 to 4, and from half-past 4 to 6 o'clock, making altogether nine hours and forty minutes—having had considerable expe<lb/>rience in these matters, I found that those intervals were of the greatest possible inconvenience, and productive of the greatest possible evils, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150060"/>
               <p>the subject of universal complaint on the part of all—practically we found it so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of that, did you issue a notice, altering the times, the effect of which would be, to give ten minutes more to the men in reality, but to prevent those constant intervals of cessation from labour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sanctioned the issue of that notice by my partners—this is the notice—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To the workmen employed in this dockyard. We have long been sensible of the great evils resulting from the unnecessarily frequent inter<lb/>ruptions of work, under the existing division of the hours of labour. While it is a source of continual dissatisfaction and complaint on the part of the shipowners, it is certain that the greatest real injury falls on the workmen themselves, most of whom are employed by the job, and any waste of time is consequently a deduction from the Amount of their earnings. This waste does not result from too many hours being devoted to rest and refreshment, but from the too frequent cessations from work, which causes indirectly but inevitably a serious loss of time, without conferring any benefit whatever on the workman. And finding that the system does not prevail in any port in Great Britain, except that of London, and that even there it is exclusively confined to the private dockyards on the river Thames, and cannot therefore be alleged to be necessary for health or comfort, we hereby give notice, that from and after the 3rd of May next, the hours of work, which are at present in this establishment, from 6 o'clock to 8, 2 hours; from half past 8 to 11, 2 hours 30 minutes; from 20 minutes past 11 to 1,1 hour 40 minutes; from 2 to 4, 2 hours; from half past 4 to 6, 1 hour 30 minutes; in all, 9 hours and 40 minutes; will be regulated as follows: Commence work, 6 o'clock; breakfast, 9 to 10; allowance, none; dinner, 1 to 2; tea, none; leave work, half past 5; total, 9 1/2 hours: and from 2nd Nov. to 2nd Feb., commence work, daylight; breakfast, 9 to 9 3/4; allowance, none; dinner 1 to 13/4; tea, none; leave work, dark. The workmen will perceive that by this alteration no addition is made to the number of working hours per day, which will in future be shortened by ten minutes, and is less than at any port included in the statement below, while the extension of breakfast time to one hour will enable very many who reside at a distance from the premises to enjoy that meal at their homes, instead of being compelled to resort to the public house. They will also, we doubt not, duly estimate the great advantage of leaving work at an earlier hour, by which their oppor<lb/>tunities for improvement, comfort, and recreation will be greatly extended; and on the whole we trust their good sense will prove to them, that the change we thus announce, while promoting that order and regularity which employers and employed in every establishment ought equally to desire, is calculated in an especial manner to advance the interests, physical and moral, of the working classes, whose social improvement we are ever anxiously desirous to promote. The bell will be rung five minutes before, and the gates be closed punctually at the above times, and the gatekeeper has strict orders not to admit any workman except at the above hours of admission. Young, Son, and Magnay, Limehouse Dockyard, April, 1856."—<hi rend="italic">To this was appended a statement of the hours of work at fourteen out-ports, showing that at none were the hours of work less than ten hours, that at none was there any morning allowance, and, with two exceptions, none in the afternoon</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). We issued a second address, dated 13th May—this is it: ("Limehouse Dockyard, May 13th, 1856. We have intimated to our workmen that on and after 17th instant we purpose to amend the division of the hours of labour in this establishment, so as to assimilate it in principle with that maintained in every important outport of the country; at the same time that it reduces in a slight degree the period actually devoted to labour by the existing practice. We very deeply regret to find that a measure which we conscientiously believe is calculated equally to benefit our workmen as ourselves, has met with what appears to us the most unreasonable opposition from the shipwrights of this port. The mea<lb/>sure is briefly to be described as the substitution of two intervals of one hour each, and cessation from work half an hour earlier than heretofore, in place of four intervals, one of one hour, two of half an hour, and one of twenty minutes; a system which has acted prejudicially against the general interests of our trade, is fraught with the most pernicious effects to many of the workmen, and must be more or less detrimental to all of them. This sub<lb/>stitution is founded on the practice pursued at Aberdeen, Dundee, Leith, Sunderland, Newport, Liverpool, White haven, Greenock, and also at North-fleet; in every one of which the actual time for work exceeds from half an hour to an hour, that which we propose it should be here. We have offered to refer the decision of the desirableness of this change to the arbitration of any impartial person or persons on whose judgment the shipwrights and our<lb/>selves can mutually rely; and so anxious are we, frankly and fairly to test the question, that we now, moreover, thus publicly intimate our readiness to submit the case to such a tribunal, even though the shipwrights decline to commit themselves to abide by it's issue. We hereby give notice, that we are prepared to enter into an engagement, guaranteeing employment to shipwrights, for twelve months from the date hereof, on terms either by the job or the day, equal to the highest rate paid in the other established dock-yards on the river; and that the hours of work shall be regulated entirely in accordance with their wishes, based on the principle of not exceeding the time, at present actually expended on work, of not exceeding two intervals during such period, and of leaving work not later than at half past 5 o'clock, and on Saturdays at 4 o'clock. Young, Son, and Magnay.") Then came this address, of 15th May, signed by Frederick. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To the ship-wrights of the port of London. Shipwrights and brother workmen—Your privileges have been unfairly interfered with by Messrs. Young, Son, and Magnay, of Limehouse, who have altered your hours of labour. It was resolved at a special general meeting, held at the Edinburgh Castle, Step<lb/>ney, on the 16th of May, 1856, 'That the alteration in the hours of labour, proposed by the above firm, was a violation of your rights; and the meeting pledged itself to resist it by every legal means in their power until the obnoxious notice given by the above firm was withdrawn.' We beg, there<lb/>fore, most distinctly to inform every shipwright, that the dispute has not originated with the men. We make no new demand; but when on a sudden a notice is issued to the effect that it is the intention of Messrs. Young and Co., to deprive us of certain regulations or privileges which we have been, in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150062"/>
               <p>quiet possession of from time immemorial; regulations which custom and time have legalized, and the tacit agreement of the firm had ratified, we think it very just and proper to bring the matter forward for your serious attention. We have made no new demands: had we done so, in consequence of non-concession, then we might have been deemed unreasonable in our conduct. Augustus H. Frederick, president. Thomas Marr, secretary, May 15th, 1856.") In reply to that we issued the following address, (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To the general body of shipwrights, now in the port of London. A placard has been circulated, signed, 'Augustus H. Frederick, president; Thomas Marr, secretary:' in which we are accused of having unfairly inter<lb/>fered with your privileges, and violated your rights. We shall not stop to inquire, whether you have authorised these individuals to speak in your name; but we denounce the charge as untrue and calumnious. If 'customs and habits' had been confounded with 'rights and privileges,' rotten boroughs would have still existed, and reform in every department, political and social, would have been impossible. We have simply to reply, that we con<lb/>sider the pretended rights, to which the placard refers, as real wrongs to the workmen; and the supposed privileges as real curses. It is this conviction that has induced us to propose a change, which has unexpectedly called down on us the unscrupulous denunciations and violent opposition of pre<lb/>sident and a secretary of——what? We appeal from this tyrannical decree to your individual judgment; we propose actually to diminish your period of daily labour, and so to regulate it's intervals as to accord with the practice I of the country at large; and thus promote your interests, your comfort, and respectability. Let every man examine for himself, and determine by calm consideration of our published propositions (which may be obtained on appli<lb/>cation), whether our description of these propositions, or that of our calum<lb/>niators is the true one. But this we are quite ready to discuss; and to revise, modify, or withdraw them if proved to be injurious or unjust to you; and we have already offered to submit the whole question to impartial arbi<lb/>tration. We ask you whether, in offering such a course, we manifest any disposition unfairly to interfere with your rights and privileges?' When<lb/>ever or by whomsoever these are assailed, it will always be our pride and our pleasure to make common cause with you in their defence. But we can<lb/>not tamely submit to the cruel proscription to which it is attempted to subject us; and we appeal with confidence from this injustice and wrong, to your fairness and independence. We throw ourselves on that public opinion, which will finally decide justly. Young, Son, and Magnay, Lime-house Dockyard, May 17th, 1856.") Then followed this other address, signed by Frederick. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To the whole of the shipwrights of the port of London. Shipwrights and brother workmen,—We are extremely sorry to be under the necessity of making a second appeal to your good sense. Your president and secretary have been assailed by Messrs. Young, Son, and Magnay, as being calumniators. That we most emphatically deny, and throw it back from whence it came. The special general meet<lb/>ing at the Edinburgh Castle, Stepney, tells those individuals they were authorized to speak in the name of the whole body of shipwrights in the port of London. We still maintain your privileges have been inter<lb/>fered with unjustly. We have nothing to do with rotten boroughs. We shall not stop to inquire into that matter. Our cause is too sacred, or it would not have lasted for the last century and more; therefore, that proves to us it is right, and not wrongs and real curses, as denounced by Messrs. Young, Son, and Magnay. They also say, 'The violent opposition</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150063"/>
               <p>of a president and secretary of what?' They knew of what when they wanted the society's assistance. Why was not this tyrannical question resorted to half a century ago, or so late as three months? No, became then your services were required for your country. The port of London have nothing to do with the regulations of the outports. We adhere to the system of the port of London. Let every shipwright judge for himself in the matter now before him, and use his own discretion. Augustus H. Frederick, president. Thomas Marr, secretary.")—The 3rd May was the period originally fixed for the alteration to come into operation—we found that there was an unexpected opposition raised to it, and we also found that by 3rd May many of the men who were opposed to it, and who were engaged upon jobs, would not have completed them by that time, and we thought it more prudent to postpone its coming into operation until after that work was completed, which we did, first to the 8th, and subsequently, I think, to the 17th—several of the men were under contracts at that time—the result, however, was that they left their work unfinished, and all of the men left the yard on 3rd May, leaving the contracts incomplete—in consequence of that, we endeavoured at last to obtain labour elsewhere, but not till after a considerable interval, during which we hoped they would be inclined to come to reason; but they did not—there is a public house called the Union near our premises, overlooking our yard—there is a room at that public house that commands our yard, and that room was occupied from soon after 3rd May—during my continual attendance at the premises I constantly observed shipwrights, very many of whom I knew personally, seated at the window of this large committee room, and congregated around the door of the house, and opposite the gates of our establishment, in considerable numbers—I noticed some of the defendants, Gale, Mumford, Reeves, Edward Hopper, and Brown very constantly, very frequently Frederick, and John Hopper; I should not like to speak positively to any others—they were generally seated at the window, smoking pipes, or in consultation apparently, in con<lb/>versation at all events with each other, and with the persons who were assembled around the premises—the persons in the committee room appeared frequently to be in communication with the people round our gates—this continued, I should think, more than a month before we took any steps for obtaining workmen elsewhere; during that time our work was at a complete stand still, to our great inconvenience—at the end of a month we endea<lb/>voured to get other men; we sent to Gloucester, Ireland, and other places, and advertised in the public newspapers, offering twelve months' employment, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, to those who were inclined to come into our employment-some persons came up; I think the first who came were from Gloucester; I do not recollect that I saw them—I saw a great many of the men who came up from the country—I saw the whole of the first number of the Jersey men—I met them myself at the South Western station—I think that must have been on 24th July—before that I had some conversation with Edward Hopper; I cannot give you the date of that; it must have been in the course of the month of June—I found him at the counting house—I said to him, "Hopper, I am a little surprised at the active part you are taking in this business, because, although the obligation that I know you are person<lb/>ally are under to my firm does not claim from you any gratitude, or ought not to induce you to go to work for us on terms that you yourself are not satisfied with, I think it is not becoming in you to take so active a part as you are doing in preventing other persons who are willing to come into our employ, from doing so"—his reply was, "I am not interfering, Sir"—I said,</p>

               <p>"Hopper, will you look me in the face, and tell me that you are not inter<lb/>fering to prevent other men from working for us? did not you, last Friday week, yourself accompany, in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, three of the Gloucester me from Limehouse to the Great Western station? did not you there pay them money to induce them to go back?"—his reply was, "Well, sir I did"—I said, "And do you dare to tell me that that is not an inter<lb/>ference?" and I added, "Did you not, on the arrival of these Gloucester men, yourself meet them at the Great Western station, and there endea<lb/>vour to dissuade them from coming down to our employ?"—he said, "I did"—"Well," I said, "and dare you tell me, after such an avowal that you have not interfered to prevent other persons from coming into our employment?"—I am not aware that he made any specific reply, but he cer<lb/>tainly looked a little confused; and I then said, "Now, Hopper, tell me how came you to know that these men were coming from Gloucester to enter our employ?"—he replied, "Our letters from Gloucester told us that"—I simply said, "It appears that you have lost all consciousness of the dis<lb/>tinction between moral right and wrong; you do not seem to think it is at all disreputable to tell me so barefaced an untruth"—on 26th July I was on the premises the greater part of the day; at an early hour in the morning considerable crowds were assembled, evidently instigated by the fact of a large body of men having arrived from Jersey—there were at all times some considerable number of persons, but there was on that morning an unusual assemblage—I think forty-two men had arrived the previous day from Jersey, the greater part of whom had been accommodated within our premises for shelter and protection—I had slept at my son's house the pre<lb/>ceedings night—the numbers of persons assembled fluctuated, but I should suppose there were at all times from 50 to 100, after the hour of 9 or 10 o'clock—there appeared to be a good deal of excitement among them—I remained there till later in the afternoon than 1 o'clock—at half past 12 o'clock a good many of the men were going out to their dinner, and by that time the number had increased considerably; then there might be, I should think, 300 or 400 persons, and they continued to increase during the hour's absence for dinner, and the greatest number were assembled about half past 1 o'clock, when it was expected the men would return to their work—I should say there were then from 800 to 1,000 persons, and there were continually shoutings and expressions—I am unwilling to tax my memory with the precise expressions, but they conveyed to my mind that there was a feeling of great exasperation among them; so much so that I sent to the police office for assistance—I dispatched a letter to the sitting Magistrate, telling him that I apprehended a breach of the peace—after sending a second time, we got the assistance of the police—I saw the defendant Brown there, and Reeves also—at the time I saw Brown, he was standing quietly at the back of the crowd, next the public house—Reeves was mixed more in it, but I saw nothing of him at the commencement; I did afterwards—he was standing quietly at first—I did not afterwards see him or Brown conduct themselves in any other manner—Reeves addressed me at a later period, in the height of the riot—my son, Mr. Sidney Young, was standing with me, and with a good many of the officers of the establishment, watching, and for the purpose of affording any protection we could—something induced him to go into the crowd, and I saw him struck—I did not see that which led him to go forward—the men came back from dinner about 2 o'clock—very few of them succeeded in getting back—I saw several attempting to get forward towards the yard, and they were obstructed and prevented from</p>

               <p>was doing—I said, "I do not know"—Cousins is a draughtsman, I suppose; and he was supposed to be at Gloucester—when I said that I did not know how many were coming from Wales, he said that he understood there were two to come from Wales; I said that I had not heard of any coming Wales, but not being in Mr. Young's confidence, I was not aware whether such was the case or not, but he appeared to know more about it than I did—he said, "Oh, bless you! we know all about it when anybody is coming to town"—this was before the train arrived, and when it arrived we went up in company together, to see whether there were any that looked like shipwrights—we walked up and down, and could not see any that looked like shipwrights, and Mumford said, "I do not see any that look like shipwrights," but when they were getting the luggage out, some two or three men stepped out, and conversed with one that was there, I do not know whether it was Gale or Mumford—I went up, and they left the one they were talking to, and came to me—I told them where I came from, and that I came to see after their luggage—they looked after their luggage afterwards, and I put it in a place of safety, and got a lodging for them, to prevent bringing them to Limehouse that evening—a railway officer took us under an underground passage, and left Gale and Mumford walking a little distance from us—just before I left I looked back, and saw them, but lost sight of them, and we went into a coffee house, and engaged lodgings—the men said that they should like a little refreshment, and we went into a public house—Gale and Mumford were there, and conversed with the men across the table; they said that they were out on strike, and the cause of it was that their rights and privileges were being unjustly interfered with; that Mr. Young was as good an employer as any one on the river, and that it was merely a difference of opinion in the right of beer time, but it was a right and privilege, and they could not consent to give it up—the Glouces<lb/>ter men looked at me, as if waiting a reply—I said, "What these men have told you is true, except that it is not a right; it is merely an old custom which exists in the port of London, but not on the river Thames, not even at Northfleet"—Gale and Mumford said that it was the unanimous opinion of a meeting of 2,000 shipwrights—I said, "It was not unanimous, for I know a man who approves of the new terms;" and they did not say any more on that subject—they entered into a little desultory conversation; and when the men were going away, Gale, Mumford, and myself stopped, and had a little something at the bar, and Mumford went into the parlour again, and said to the men something in an undertone, which I did not hear—Gale followed; he seemed speaking; and we came out again—before we came out they insisted on sending some more refreshment to the men in the parlour, at their expense; that was done, and then we left, and came down to Limehouse together, leaving the men behind; they came in an omnibus to the railway—when we got to Limehouse, I was going home, and we bade each other good night, and they said, "We must go to the Union public house, to see our mates; they are there waiting for us"—I had left instructions overnight for the men to come to Limehouse, but in the morning I went to stop them, to keep them in town all day, and not to come down till the evening—Mr. Young had given instructions for that—when I got out of the station in Fenchurch-street, I met Gale and Mumford, who said that my men were waiting for me at the Great Western station at Paddington—they were coming from the City way from Fenchurch-street to the station, and I had got out at Fenchurch-street station, and was going to the west end—I went towards Oxford-street, and met an omnibus, with three or four</p>

I live at No, 19, Park-place, Haggerstone—the prisoner will be twenty years old next birthday—my former husband's name was M'Leod—the prisoner has always gone by the name of Wood, which is the name of my present husband—the prisoner was only two years old when I was married—his mind has always been weak the same as it is now—he has never been able to get his own living, except two months, when he worked for Mr. Copeland—at one time he used to go out with a stool and bow, and scrape with it, as if he had an organ—he had a box of playthings like a child, and had a piece of wood and some pieces of twine tied round it—he called it his hurdy-gurdy, and used to sing and play it—he was in the habit of tying the cat up while he was playing with his playthings, that she should not run away—he tied the cat round the neck a great many times—I cannot tell you how many times—he tied the cat, not to hurt her, only told her to lie still on the bed—he would show the cat his playthings, like as a child would do, and he would take his books and show his pictures to the cat—he would do that a day or two before he was taken—I bought him a pair of boots, and he cut them all up with a slice-maker's knife, and also a satin waistcoat that I bought him he tore up—he gave no reason for it—I beat him for it—that was about two months before this charge—I asked him why he did it; all the answer he gave was he would never do it again—he has always been acting in that way.</p>

I had the prisoner with me about April or May—I observed his conduct during about a month; in my judgment, he was of unsound mind—I was not aware of it when he entered my employ—I ascertained it afterwards by observing his actions, and so forth—he wrote this book to give it me, it should have been an account of his time—here is a date supposed to be Sunday—here is "Toms Cabin" occupying two pages—here is "On Monday, got drink"—the next days "Holiday," or "whole day;" I am not certain which—on one occasion Mr. Glass, a publican, died, and I said to the prisoner in the morning, "Mind you are here at 2 o'clock"—he did not arrive till 20 minutes past 3 o'clock—I asked him the cause of his absence, and he said he had been witnessing the funeral of this gentleman—he purchased a white apron for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and that was marked on it in charcoal, and he wore that four or five days going to and from the factory—he said Tom's Cabin was a small public house in Margaret-street or Gloucester-street, where he was in the habit of spending his time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watch maker and jeweller of No. 26, Brick-lane. On the Wednesday night, near 12 o'clock, my premises were all safe—after I retired to bed, I heard my dog bark, he made a great noise, and got out of bed and checked him—my wife did not feel satisfied, and she get up, looked out at the back window, and saw a light—I got out of bed, and saw a light reflected on a shed at the back—my wife said; "The house is in flames!"—I rushed down stairs, and as I was going down, a case if watch movements, which was on the counter, fell on the floor—I opened the street door, and two men rushed out; one was stout, with a cap and jacket, one seemed taller than the other—I called out, "Police! stop thief!" but being in my night dress, could not follow—from the prisoner's size I should say that he is one of them, but I could net swear to him—my window shutter was wrenched at the bottom, and the bolt bent, so that they could lift it—I have compared the crowbar, and the dent fits exactly—it was deep, it had wrenched away the paint, and gone into the wood above; then is a stone sill at the bottom—crowbars used by carpenters are not turned up in this way—I never saw one turned up like this, and the point is hardened steel—I am of opinion that the marks must have been made by an instrument of this kind and size—I missed nine watches and seventeen silver spoons, two butter knives, one with a silver handle, and one mother of pearl, two silver snuff boxes, and one scent box, value altogether 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my window looks to the front of Brick-lane—by opening the parlour window they got an entrance into the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hawker, and live at No. 3, Wine-court, White-chapel. On 27th Aug. last, about 3 o'clock in the day, I was near Petticoat-lane—I had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with me, all in silver—it was in my left pocket—I felt it last when it was taken from me—there was a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> in Petticoat-lane, a fight between two boys—I was looking on—I saw these two men with a female—I had never seen them before—I said it was a pity to see them fighting, and some one gave me a blow in the face—on my receiving that blow, Benjamin said to me, "Don't interfere with the boys fighting; come with me, and we will have something to drink"—I went with them to the Horns public house, and I paid for two pots of ale, which we had in the parlour—we then came to the bar, and Benjamin called out for a quartern of whiskey, for which I paid 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Benjamin put something into it from a pot which stood by, which made it look like sherry—it was white before—I drank part of it, and they the rest—there was no harm in what the prisoner put into it—a person came in and asked the landlord for change for a sove<lb/>reign—the landlord said he could not do it without going up stairs, and I gave him change—we afterwards left, and went to a beer house, and had some beer, and I began to feel rather queer—I said I had better think about going home—Benjamin said, "We are going your way, and will accompany you"—we left the beer house, and all went together—we went to Thrawl-street, Spitalfields—Benjamin had said before, when I said about going home, "You had better come home with me and have some tea"—after this, Cornelius went into a house, and a female met him, and I went into the passage of the house—when I got into the passage, Cornelius came out of a back room, and gave me a blow upon the face—it partly sent me to the ground—while I was falling, Benjamin gave me a blow on the side of the face, and I fell to the ground—the woman, when I was on the ground, tore part of my hair out of my head—Benjamin leaped on me, with his knee across my chest, and said, "Kill the b—"—I bled from the mouth and nose—I found they were after my money, and I took my hand from under me, and felt in my left hand pocket, and the money was there—Cornelius put his hand also in my pocket—I seized him by the arm—I never saw any money, but I thought he, Benjamin, took something from Cornelius's hand,</p>

               <p>and then made his escape with the woman—I held Cornelius, and afterwards took him to Brick-lane, and saw a constable in Brick-lane—my money was all gone—Cornelius was taken to the station house, and I charged him with assaulting me and robbing me—I was taken to the hospital, and afterwards, while I was there, Benjamin was brought to me—I am sure that Benjamin is the man that escaped.</p>

I hawk round the streets with a barrow of crockery—I was going to buy some goods in Sun-street, Bishopsgate, to go to market—no one that I know of knew that I had this money—I was very drunk—I was drinking from 3 o'clock till 8—I can swear that these are the men who took my money—I am sure that I felt it when on the ground—the reason I did not charge Benjamin at first, was because I was the worse for liquor—the reason he came up quietly was that we had several struggles in the street, and he saw the constable, and thought it would be better if he went quietly—it was about sixty yards from where it took place, that I gave him into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners in their defence put in the following paper</hi>: "On the morning in question we went into the Horns public house together, and there saw the prosecutor drinking with a woman; he accosted us, and asked us to take a glass of ale with him; we did so, and he left the public house with the female; we saw no more of him till about 7 o'clock in the evening, when we accidentally met him, very much intoxicated, and bleeding from the nose; he knocked up against the prisoner Benjamin, and upon our reasoning with him, he struck Benjamin in the chest; the prisoner Cor<lb/>nelius then went up to him, to endeavour to make peace, upon which he asked him to go and have some drink with him, at the same time shaking</p>

               <p>his hand; Cornelius then advised his brother Benjamin to go away home, which he did, and not notice an intoxicated man; the prisoner Cornelius then walked a little way with him for peace's sake, when he met two policemen; the prosecutor then gave Cornelius in charge for an assault only, but the policeman refused to take him, on the grounds that he had not witnessed the affair, and advised complainant to summon him, and told prisoner to go about his business; the prosecutor, finding that he could not get hold of the prisoner by fair means, then said, 'Well, if you won't take him in charge for the assault, I shall charge him with robbing me,' and the prisoner Cornelius was then taken into custody; at that time no mention was made of Benjamin being concerned in robbing him, until the following day, when he was arrested. We beg to submit, that the man must have been during the day in bad society, and being in a state of intoxication, was robbed by some one, when in a fight with some people, as he himself admits, and that, meeting us, he gave us unjustly in charge; besides, if he had been robbed by Cornelius, would he not have given him in charge for the robbery in the first instance, instead of the assault?")</p>

(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>); I have kept them till now—I had no other security, no other bill, or acceptance—I had one other transaction with him, but which I had given up six months before; it was for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—these two acceptances are dated 22nd Dec., 1855—when I first got them, I took means to get them discounted, hut could not; I did not get any more of them, but I had them in my pos<lb/>session at the time I have deposed to—I did not know that he had no banker's account until we were before the Magistrate; I had made no inquiry, I got a friend to make inquiry as to his status and position—I did not get the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till some days after—that would bring me to about the middle or towards the latter end of Jan.—I heard that he had applied to take the benefit of the Insolvent Act, and was in gaol in Lancaster Castle, and I then had him taken into custody, and brought up here—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150090"/>
               <p>I have heard of people being whitewashed; I hare not gone through the process myself—I have been bankrupt—I suppose that it was his intention to get rid of all his liabilities in that way; of course, if he went through the the Court he would, so I had him brought up from Lancaster Gaol, and lodged quietly in Newgate—I did not mean that he should get through his liabilities, and rob me—on the second day after that, the father of the pri<lb/>soner sent that bill to Messrs. Tucker's—I have never had the bill from Tucker's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If, in point of fact, he committed the fraud you represent, why did you let seven months elapse before taking steps, and only when you heard that he was going through the Insolvent Court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was not till 6th March that the letter was written from my eldest son to his brother, send<lb/>ing a note to Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If he cheated you in Jan., why did you wait seven months before you gave him into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I did not know where the bill was gone, and was not desirous of punishing him, and did not think he would be guilty of such an act as appropriating the bill to his own purposes.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not know perfectly well that the Cresswells had notice not to pay the bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was on the ground of my having been cheated—proceedings were taken by Messer's. Tucker, I did not take them—I do not mean that the Messrs. Tucker are the parties who, in reality, are at the bottom of this prosecution—I do not know that an endeavour has been made by the father to obtain the money from the Tuckers, and that they are at the bottom or this prosecution—I do not know whether Mr. Tucker is here; I have never seen him—it was he who arrested the prisoner, I only know what for from hearsay—the repre<lb/>sentation on which I parted with the bill was made in the presence of Graham, whom I had known from the early part of 1854—after the trans<lb/>action of 4th Jan., I applied to get these two bills discounted—I had the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill in my possession up to the middle of Jan.; I tried to get it dis<lb/>counted after 4th Jan. till I returned it to Mr. Graham; it was drawn by Graham, and accepted by the prisoner—I held it, and afterwards returned it to Graham in the latter part of Jan.; not all the three, but the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was not aware that the prisoner had any banking account; he always represented to me that his uncle, Hugh Shaw, had a banking account, and was a man of great respectability and position, before the day I got the bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With respect to the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, on what account was it drawn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was drawn for a moiety of the share of a slate mine, lease, of which I was the lessee—in the latter end of 1855, I had a take note of the Henry slate quarry—this bill was drawn by Graham, and accepted by the prisoner on account of my share in that quarry—I never endorsed that bill or made myself liable upon it—the prisoner was the pur<lb/>chaser of the share—Graham was a party to that purchase, he drew the bill on the prisoner; Graham was to hold one quarter of the mine; he and the pri<lb/>soner were to be jointly interested—I found I could do nothing with the bill, and returned it just as I received it, without endorsing it—the lease of the mine is made to me, and is dated Nov., 1853—I agreed to take them at that date; I did not pay any consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what way was their value increased so that the one-half was worth 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had expended a considerable sum of money in opening the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not you to have a share of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I took the trouble of discounting it in furtherance of the arrangement contemplated with respect to the slate quarry—at that time I and he were partners—he was to pay 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his share, the bill was for that—he was to pay 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as purchase money, and the other part of the bill I was to have met—the purchase money was 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the agreement (<hi rend="italic">this was doted</hi> 27<hi rend="italic">th Dec.</hi>, 1855, <hi rend="italic">between the witness, the prisoner, and Graham, and transferred half the beneficial interest in the date quarry from the witness to the prisoner and Graham</hi>)—If I had obtained discount for the bills, I should have handed the money to the prisoner for his own purposes—he was not to manage the quarry, I was to manage it—he could have had them if he had asked for them—nothing was said about that at the time the bill for 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given—it was in March that I first discovered that I had been cheated—I did not positively know where the prisoner was, from that time, till I heard he was in Lancaster Gaol—I suppose he was at his place, Grafton House, Ashton-under-Lyne—I suffered from March to Aug. to intervene without prosecuting him, because I was very unwilling to do anything to damage him, a young man, In his future life, and therefore I declined to the latest moment taking any steps; and more than that, the representations he had made to me of his connections in Manchester had taken effect upon me; and I was still more anxious because one of his uncles I had known for a great many years, Mr. Edward Buckley—I made no charge against him till I heard that he was in prison at the suit of Tucker—I had not the least to do with his arrest by Tucker—the bill was produced before the Magi<lb/>strate (<hi rend="italic">A letter was here read from the defendant to Messrs.

The prisoner lodged with me—I saw the child alive in it's mother's arms on the Sunday night—it looked very bad, and I thought it would not live long, and on Tuesday morning about 10 or 11 o'clock, I saw it dead—I cannot say for certain whether I have ever seen her suckle it: yes, I make a mistake, I have—I think it must have been four or five months old—when I saw the child last alive, the prisoner seemed rather stupified; I cannot say that she had been drink<lb/>ing—she appeared sober to me; and I saw her on Wednesday, after it was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exami<lb/>nation of the child on the 23rd, I think—it was in a state of extreme emaciation—there were no external marks of violence—there was nothing externally to account for death—I found every organ perfectly healthy, the brain, the liver, and the kidneys—the stomach was collapsed, and remark<lb/>ably small—the gall bladder was perfectly charged with bile, sufficiently to digest food—the stomach did not contain anything, not even the usual mucus which is secreted—if there had been any nutriment swallowed by this child within twenty-four hours of its death, I should have discovered it—the bowels were in the same condition as the stomach—want of food, starvation, was the cause of its death—I do not know whether I ought to say want of food, I cannot say that food was not given—there may have been some incapacity in the child to take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The child died by reason of nothing coming into the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from inanition; that is my judgment—it might have taken the nipple of the breast, and still not have drawn food—I have known the nervous system arrive at such a condition as to incapacitate a child from receiving food, even if offered; but I do not say that that was the case—there ie frequently paralysis of the muscles of the throat, the swallowing muscles.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the appearances on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb/>tion quite consistent with death from starvation, or from natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared to me death from starvation, the want of nourishment—assum<lb/>ing that the death was caused by inanition, I should say that that had been going on, according to the observations I made, for some weeks—I have met with many cases in which infants refuse the breast, which I cannot trace to any reason, but not at that age; I have known it when they are born, and no one can assign a reason for it to the present day; but I never knew a child refuse it when it has once taken it, unless there was disease—if the nervous energies were weakened, there would be no <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, appearance indicative of that state; it would be out of the power of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150102"/>
               <p>science to detect it—it may certainly have existed in this case—I have heard that the prisoner's breasts were full or milk, and it would be a relief to her to suckle the child—if she had been denying the child milk for weeks, she must certainly have given suck to some child, or she would begin to get dry; after three days the breasts would begin to sink; it attains it's height on the third day, and on the fifth or sixth day she would have no milk—in my judgment, she continued suckling the child until a recent period before it's death—I have heard the evidence as to the milk coming from her breasts and therefore it is my opinion that she must have given suck recently, if she had such a full breast as to be overflowing, as the office has stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would the breasts be before the milk would go altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three days—is my opinion, the child being without milk for three days would not bring on that emaciated appearance that I saw—it must have been sinking for some weeks, a month, or I should my more—if the mother had given it tuck within two or three days, it could not have been as I saw it—if the mother had a breast of milk, some child must have had suck, but I do not believe this child had—if disorder of the nervous system prevented the child sucking, the mother would remain un<lb/>relieved—I am not assuming whether she had any other child to draw the milk—it was evident that this child had not received milk for some time; there was no muscular fibre and no blood when I out into it, and so humours, they were all dried up.</p>

               <p>—I told him to come out; he did not seem to make any appearance, but kept shouting inside—I hit the door, and drove my hand through the door—made a second hit, and the door went in with me—Grady came out, with the hook in his hand, and make a stroke at me to split me down the head—I put up my hand—I had a piece of paling in my hand—I defended that stroke off—Maloney then came with a piece of wood, a piece of quar<lb/>tering, and he struck me with it between the elbow and the arm—that made me drop the piece of paling—I then ran away again, and I received two more strokes on my head with the bagging hook—they are here now—Grady came after me through the crowd, with his two hands on the hook, and made a blow to split my head—I stooped my head, and received the blow between my shoulders—I fell down, and I heard him say that he would cut the head of any other b—that came after him, a policeman or any one else—I then became senseless.</p>

On Sunday, 31st Aug., I was playing in a field near Surrey Canal; I saw the three prisoners there—I know them as being about the street—I am sure they were there—they were gambling and tossing with money—Cook lost his money, and I heard him say, "What a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> it would be to set this place on fire!"—it was then about half past 4 o'clock—they then went across the field, over the ditch, and into the shed—when Cook said that, they were about fifty yards from the shed—he did not point to the place—it was on the same side that they were, only they had to cross a ditch—they all three went into the shed—I went after them, to see what they were going to do—I old not go into the shed—I stood on the bank of the canal—I looked into the shed—Cook had said this quite loud before me—when he said, "What a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> it would be!" the other two made answer, and said, "Yes, we will do it"—I could see them when they were in the shed—I saw Fowler strike a lucifer, and give it to Hawthorne—Cook scraped up some shavings, and Hawthorne made a hole in the middle, and put the lucifer in it—I saw the smoke come from the shavings—the prisoners all went off together running—the fire was towards the back of the shed, close to the wood—I am sure of that—I did not remain any longer—I spoke to Smith, and he and I ran away—Smith had been playing there before, and after I came across the ditch, I saw Smith again, and I pointed it out to him—I turned round afterwards, and saw the flames, after we were running—we had run about 100 yards then I turned round and saw the flames—the shed was not burnt down altogether, there is a piece of it standing up now—I did not go back to look at it, I went home.</p>
