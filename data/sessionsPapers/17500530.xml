               <p>Q. Were is this letter?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I lost it, but the purport of it was, that there was a certain lady of quality that had some business to do to some houses in Wild-street, and a friend of mine had recommended me to the prisoner, and he would recommend me to the lady to do this business. I went to the prisoner's house in Queen's-square Bloomsbury, I was ordered up stairs, there was the Prisoner sitting with a book in his hand, he desir'd me to walk in and sit down, and brought a chair to me himself, he desir'd me to drink a dram; I never saw or heard of him before in my life; he told me the lady would not be there 'till three o'clock, and ask'd me to dine with him; I said, I expected some company to dine with me at home, so I would go home and return again by four o'clock, I did not stay with him above half an hour the first time. When I went again at the time appointed, I saw a person whom he called my Lady Gunston, he recommended me to do the plumber's work to some houses of hers in Wild-street; she immediately reply'd, she had some work to do but did not think to do it then, but as soon as it was to do I should do it. As I was going away he desired I would come again the next day and dine with him, which accordingly I did; after dinner he began to complain of the hardship he had received from the present government, and especially of one Mr. Carrington, a messenger, he gave him as many ill names as possible; then he ask'd me if I should like to go to France, saying, he was going, having an order from the King of France to come over, and that he had been with the French ambassador, who told him he would not give him above 150 l. for his passage to France, adding, he would not go without money enough to pay his debts; I told him, I believed I should go to France or Ireland this summer; he told me if I would go with him to France, he would get me a captain's commission in a regiment in France, and at the least it should not cost me above 100 l. which I could very well afford; then we began to drink healths, he drank Prince Charles, the French King his master, all which healths I drank. Late at night he drank damnation to the Protestant succession, which I refus'd to drink, and wanted to leave him; he told me he had 900 l. lay in Sir

We went towards dusk, when there I waited in the coach some considerable time, the prisoner came out, having had some discourse with Sir Daniel, and desired me to walk in, I did, Sir Daniel was sitting at the corner of the compting-house, the prisoner said he wanted to talk with Sir Daniel, and beg'd I would go out, accordingly I did, and walk'd about on the pavement; then he came out and said Sir Daniel expected the money very soon for him, then we drove away. Coming to the black horse in the Strand, he said he was very dry, we stop'd there, the servants had a pot of porter, and we another in the coach: then we drove to the corner of the lane, put his servants in a house there and went to my house, my wife had never seen his lordship before; we went down to Mr. Drummonds, were he said he believed he had some money; he ran up stairs, I waited in the hall; then we went from thence to his own house that night, there I parted with him, but I was a little in liquor, I think he sent a servant home with me but I am not certain; the next day my wife and I went to his house and din'd with him, in the afternoon he took me into the closet, and the same discourse went on between us, that is, insisting on my going to France, and to be a captain in a regiment, telling me my cloaths should not cost me anything, he should have money enough to pay for them himself. We staid there pretty late, he and one Mrs. Pearce, whom he kept company with, came to our house, he lay with me, and she with my wife; she went for his housekeeper, she is a bricklayer's wife; all the time during this we had continual discourse in the same way.

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300004"/>Pearce. There were three suits order'd and made, and I had them all in my custody. After that we were continually together every day, still holding on the same discourse.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are the cloaths?</p>
               <p>Pearce. They are now in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay down the business of a plumber?</p>
               <p>Pearce. No, I did not; I had a fore-man who did that for me. I was at the Prisoner's house three or four nights without the knowledge of my wife, and design'd she should not know any thing of my agreeing to go abroad, thinking at the same time there was enough at home to supply her with what she might want. 'Twas on the day the last earthquake happen'd, (at the time of the shock we were at breakfast at the Prisoner's house) that we agreed to go to Windsor together, in order to be conceal'd for his taking me abroad. On Sunday the 11th of February I went to Windsor; and the Wednesday following the Prisoner was sent for to London ; and I went to Reading, and from thence to Ockingham, returning the same evening, as did the Prisoner at the bar from London. Then we both went to Reading; and whilst we were there, a messenger was sent for him, so he was oblig'd to go to Windsor, upon what business I know not. On the Friday following I went to Henley fair, and the Prisoner came to London, and return'd on Sunday night to me at Reading; and Mr. Holmes, a plumber there, and an old acquaintance, came to us on Monday morning, and brought some money, of which I was a little short, to bring me away. The Prisoner too brought me some money, which, he said, was from Mr. Nevel, a silversmith. We had the same discourse before Mr. Holmes, and he told him that I had engag'd myself to go along with him, and that I was to be a captain in the French King's service.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you design to go to France with him?</p>
               <p>Pearce. Yes, I did. We fix'd upon several days to set out, but could not raise money.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the cloaths after you had wore them?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I gave the Prisoner my key; and as we wanted a little money, the Prisoner, with my consent, sent them by his servant to pawn for ten guineas to one Singleton by Red-lion-square; of which sum I had three or four guineas, the rest the Prisoner kept. I was in Windfor at the same time, and, to tell the truth, did not design to carry on the business of a plumber any longer.</p>

            . I am a taylor. I took measure of Mr. Pearce, by and for whom I had orders to make the cloaths, at the recommendation of the Prisoner, who, when I took measure, directed me in regard to their being made; and this I made, (holding the coat in his hand ) the other two are made in a richer manner than this.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you expect was to pay you?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. I imagin'd Mr. Pearce was to pay me, but I am not paid yet, neither have I demanded the money, tho' he has ask'd me for my bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with Mr. Pearce before?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. No; I was not: but with the Prisoner I have been acquainted these five or six months, to whom I one day went, who inform'd me of his having got me a very good customer, and a man of fortune too, in which quality I then look'd upon the Prisoner, and express'd my obligation to him for his kindness: He then wrote a letter to Mr. Pearce who happen'd not to be at home that day. I believe I call'd the next day, but did not see either of them till one day the Prisoner chanc'd to be at Mr. Pearce's house, when I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you arrest the Prisoner at the bar for the money for those cloaths?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. No; I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you used to make such cloaths as those for plumbers?</p>

               <p>Osbridge. Yes, I did; and I heard he was a man of fortune.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know they are regimentals of any country?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. Really I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ordered them to be made in that form?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. The Prisoner at the bar. They were both together, and told me to make them as rich as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the fashion of England to make them so?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. It is, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you directed to put the lace on in any particular form?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. I had no particular order; my order was to make them as rich as I could, and to put the lace on according to my own mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you look upon to be debtor for them?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. I enter'd in my book Mr. Pearce debtor.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Pearce. Who had the money the cloaths were pawned for?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300005"/>Pearce. I had some ; the reason was, none of my friends would let me have any money down.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you a fortune lately left you?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I do not know what is coming to me as yet, it is in the executor's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any more money than what you speak of?</p>
               <p>Pearce. I receiv'd about eight guineas at Windsor, which were given to the Prisoner by Mr. Nevil, a silver-smith, and which were to keep me there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Osbridge. Where was Mr. Pearce determined to go when these cloaths were ordered to be made?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. Upon my word, I judg'd it might be to the jubilee, but cannot be positive. I heard him say they were not fit for England, and that he should go abroad with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to name the jubilee?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. I have heard it nam'd among the servants in the Prisoner's house, and heard the Prisoner say THEY were to go, but I did not hear it from Mr. Pearce; nor do I know whom the Prisoner meant by that expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear Pearce was to go to France?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. No.</p>
               <p>

            . I live at Windsor, and was in company with Mr. Pearce and the Prisoner at Mr. White's, at the Mermaid, about the latter end of February, where they had been drinking, and were fuddled. Mr. Pearce, who sent for me, and I were school-fellows, and our fathers were partners together. Their discourse was upon military affairs, of which I told them I knew something, and drew out on a bit of paper a machine, that I had invented some time ago, for putting the infantry and cavalry in disorder. The Prisoner d - d the D - and the Protestant Succession ; and upon my asking him the reason why he did so, he said, that he was one of those unhappy gentlemen taken in a ship coming over to assist P - C - in recovering his right; and that he was delivered over to Mr. Carrington, in whose hands he had been almost three years, and whom he would shoot through the head the first time he saw him: he further told me that he had inlisted Mr. Pearce in the foreign service as a captain, and wanted me to go in that station, telling as an encouragement for me his having enlisted Mr. Pearce. Mr. Pearce had one of those suits of cloaths on, and said he had some more, and that he was to be a captain in the Prisoner's company: he added, upon his honour, that I should be joint-engineer along with him (meaning the prisoner) under the King of France; that he would give forty thousand pounds for my machine; that they were going every minute, and that the cloaths he had on were to be his riding-suit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner say he had enlisted Mr. Pearce ?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He told me twenty times so, and that he had the cloaths made for him. He said likewise that he could make the Dauphin of France drunk, and carry him to a bawdy-house when he pleased; and that he had a house at Orleans in France.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Pearce contradict his being inlisted ?</p>
               <p>Holmes. No, he did not, but actually said he was a captain, and wanted me to go along with him. We had this discourse between us at Mr. White's, up one pair of stairs, I believe on the left hand side. I went about seven in the evening, stay'd till about eleven or twelve o'clock at night, and smoak'd a pipe with them. During this talk there were none but us three in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. White there?</p>
               <p>Holmes. He was there at the beginning of the night, and, for aught I know, he might be there when I was gone, but not when this talk was.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Was no body else there but us three?</p>
               <p>Holmes. Your doxy and Mr. Pearce's doxy were there, but not with us when we had this discourse.</p>

            . I keep the Mermaid at Windsor. The Prisoner and Mr. Pearce came to my house on Sunday night about the beginning of February, and two ladies with them. They staid there almost a week, then went away, and afterwards came again, and staid near ten days. I remember Mr. Holmes was several times with them in that time, and they were frequently in company together in the dining-room. The Prisoner had on, I believe, a scarlet coat, trimmed with gold. One evening we went a fishing; but I heard nothing of the discourse. Indeed, I heard Mr. Pearce and the Prisoner talk of going to France, and that they were to set out such and such a time, but that they were to go to Oxford first.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Pearce first came to my house, he came upon a letter I wrote him on the influence of Lady Gunston, wife to Sir John, who was chairman at Westminster for a considerable time. She told me she had a house to repair in Wild-street. When Mr. Pearce came, he asked me my business with him. I told him I expected the Lady in a few minutes; but he said he must go home to dine with company, and that he would be with me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300006"/> again about three o'clock. He accordingly came, as did at the same time Lady Gunston, and they came to an agreement. I then ask'd him if he would drink a glass of punch. Some time after the Duke of Hamilton's health was toasted; upon which some of the company asked me where he was; to whom I made answer that he was in Rome, he having left London in order to go to the jubilee, and I added that I would go to him there. Pearce said he would be at an equal expence in order to go too : and, upon my telling him tradesmen could not dispense with so large a sum, he inform'd me that his father had left him 20,000 l. and that he could spare 500 l. as well as any tradesman in England. He then look'd upon a scarlet coat, which he said was well made, and ask'd me who work'd for me. I told him Mr. Osbridge, whom he desired me to send for, which I did, and Mr. Osbridge came, took his measure, made the cloaths according to his desire, and brought them home. Early on Sunday morning, he, and one miss Williams, whom he keeps company with, came to my house, and insisted on my going to Windsor, telling me he had a four-wheele chaise with two horses, and two saddle horses. I said I was very ill, and could not go; but he would take no denial, but oblig'd me to go with him. I ask'd him how much money he had about him, he said about a guinea. I told him I had not much, and therefore did not care to go without more. He then mentioned his being acquainted with one Mr. Holmes, who would supply him, as he should return in two or three days. We got there very late on Sunday night, and on Monday morning Mr. Holmes prepar'd a fishing-boat, in order to take the diversion of fishing. Afterwards I told Mr. Pearce it was inconsistent with our interest to stay here; but, said he, to tell you the naked truth, I am so much in debt that I am afraid of being arrested. An express was now sent for me; I was arrested, and the gentleman, who gave bail for me, is now in court. I was to have been in town in a limited time, to have satisfied him for it; however, I left Windsor. Pearce insisted on my returning again, to do which I was very unwilling; but he insisted upon it, and accordingly sent his chaise and two horses for me. Upon their arrival I was sitting at Mr. Johnson's door, and was told he wanted me upon earnest business. I went, and when I came there, he told me he had not money enough to defray the expences; he spoke to one of my servants, and desired him to pawn the cloaths. The man did, and brought him the money. Afterwards Mr. Pearce went to Reading, and said positively, he would not return home. He wrote to his wife, and call'd her a d - d bitch of a whore, and that he would never cohabit with her more, and that he loved this woman's little finger he had with him, better than he did her whole body, and that he would settle something agreeable upon her, as soon as his fortune came to his hands. By his intreaties he prevailed on me to go to Reading with him. After we had been there two days, some men came there, Mr. Holmes was one; he came just as we were going to dinner: I asked him if he would not dine with us; he told me he had just dined, but he would drink with us. While we were at dinner, he entertained us with a machine, saying, he could make it with iron graffles, so that a thousand men should beat twenty thousand, and cut them to pieces, sword in hand. I told him it was impracticable ; he told me he had shewed it to the D - of C - ; I asked him how he paid him? he d - d him, and said, his h - was too thick to conceive the meaning of it. I returned after dinner, and came to town, in order to settle my affairs, and can make it appear I never inlisted a man in my life; it is below me. Mr. Attorney-General mov'd against me last Sessions; and Mr. Carrington took the most disorderly steps that man could, in order to take away my life. Mr. Pearce was so punctual to the time of our return, that I said I should return in six months; and he agreed to my time, for in that time, said he, I shall inherit my father's fortune, and improve the liberal education he gave me, hoping I shall turn out an honour to my country.</p>

            . I was in company with Mr. Pearce three or four times at the prisoner's house, and never heard a word of inlisting. I have heard him and the Prisoner talk of going to the jubilee at Rome, and was with them when the taylor was at the Prisoner's house, and understood those cloaths were to be made fitting for Mr. Pearce to go to the jubilee; which was mentioned to the taylor in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to pay the taylor for those cloaths?</p>
               <p>Cennet. I do not know that; but I suppose each was to pay for his own cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear of their going to France?</p>
               <p>Cennet. They talk'd of going through France to Rome.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Prisoner had inlisted the Prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Cennet. No; nor had I any reason to think so.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman is the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Cennet. He is an Irishman.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300007"/>Cennet. I never saw him till the last races in Tothill-fields; and coming by Bridewell, somebody said the Earl of Desmond was Prisoner there, which induc'd me to go in, and I never saw him afterwards till I saw him in Queen-square. I get notes discounted; and he sent to me a note of Mr. Pearce's, of 54 l. 18 s. which I carried to a distiller in the Hay-market, and told him the Prisoner would take 10 or 20 gallons of rum, and allow the discount besides. I left the note, and the distiller went to Mr. Pearce's, and made some enquiry; but then he said he was told by some other person that it was a sham note. I went to Queen-square, where I found Mr. Pearce, and we went to the distiller, whom he said he would pay; but the distiller not thinking proper to discount it, I return'd it to the Prisoner at the bar.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Cennet. In Round-court in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you for your trouble in going with this note?</p>
               <p>Cennet. The Prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you deal in?</p>
               <p>Cennet. I deal sometimes in liquor, sometimes in Irish linens, sometimes in Irish stuffs, and in getting notes discounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a house-keeper?</p>
               <p>Cennet. No, I am not, Sir; I am a lodger, and have a second floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you and the Prisoner been very private together since this?</p>
               <p>Cennet. I was never half an hour together with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear the Prisoner say he had inlisted Mr. Pearce to serve the French King?</p>
               <p>Cennet. I believe he did own to me he had prevail'd with Mr. Pearce to go abroad to Rome, and that they were to go together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Pearce say he was to go into any foreign service?</p>
               <p>Cennet. I cannot recollect I ever did. If you please you may ask Mr. Pearce if I was not the first person that wrote to him to put him on his guard.</p>
               <p>Q. Guard! for what?</p>
               <p>Cennet. That the Prisoner should not take him in for a good deal of money.</p>
               <p>Pearce to the question. I receiv'd a letter to take care of a sham Lord, or else I should suffer by him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cennet. Did you know who was to pay the taylor for those cloaths?</p>
               <p>Cennet. I heard the taylor say he had got a draught on Mr. Pearce for 100 l.</p>
               <p>Q. to Osbridge. Had you a note of Mr. Pearce for the payment of these cloaths ?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. I never had a note for these cloaths.</p>

            . I am a goldsmith. About the beginning of February there was wrote down in my book that I was to wait on the Earl of Desmond. Accordingly on the Monday following I went to his Lordship's house, who gave me an account of some plate, which I did not like, and therefore departed. He sent for me again, and said he would give me a draught upon as good a man as any in England, meaning Mr. Pearce. Upon enquiry I found the draught was good, and I have it here. I therefore went a second time to my Lord's house, and Mr. Pearce was there, whom I ask'd if he did accept the draught; and he said he did. I then deliver'd a hundred pound's worth of plate at his Lordship's house. This is all I know of between them. Mr. Pearce has been out of the way ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Osbridge. Did Pearce ever employ you to make his servant a suit of livery ?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make them?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. No, this affair has stop'd it, they are not finished.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they to be?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. They were to have been a brown coat, with a silver shoulder-knot, scarlet waistcoat and breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing Mr. Pearce should not be bound in point of law to pay you for these cloaths you have made, what will you do?</p>
               <p>Osbridge. Then I must lose it.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you not demand it of the Prisoner?</p>

            . Mr. Pearce came to our house in Queen's-square, I was house keeper to the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a house or a lodging?</p>
               <p>F. Pearce. It was not a lodging, it was a whole house, the Prisoner took it by the month, he had a cook there, and other servants.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This witness was always in my company when gentlemen were with me. I was under great obligations to her, she supplied me with money to see counsel last November.</p>

               <p>F. Pearce. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Pearce and the Prisoner first acquainted ?</p>
               <p>F. Pearce. My lady Gunston wanted a plumber, and as they were drinking, they talk'd over the election affairs, and duke Hamilton's name came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300008"/> up. The Prisoner said, he should see him soon. Mr. Pearce said, he should be glad to go along with him, for he could afford to spend seven or eight hundred pounds, as well as any tradesman in London</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he to go?</p>
               <p>F. Pearce. To the jubilee. Mr. Pearce came the next day to dinner, the Prisoner bid him consider upon it, saying, it was a great expence to go; he said he did not care for that, and insisted on going along with the Prisoner. He ask'd the Prisoner who made his cloaths ; the Prisoner told him, Mr. Osbridge. Mr. Pearce desired he would send for him, which he did; he had three suits of cloaths made in order to go there. On the fifth of March he hired a black to go with him; he agreed to give him ten pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear mention made of going to France?</p>
               <p>F. Pearce. I never heard a word of France mentioned. When the taylor brought home the cloaths, he said they came to a hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they brought to?</p>
               <p>F. Pearce. They were brought to the Prisoner's, and fitted on Mr. Pearce there.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the cloaths after this?</p>
               <p>F. Pearce. He sent them to a young lady's house which he kept company with, who was to go along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to pay for the cloaths?</p>
               <p>F. Pearce. I do not know. The Prisoner said, he should return in about six months. Pearce said that would just suit him, his fortune would come due at that time, which he said was twenty or thirty thousand pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you a married woman?</p>

I live at Dover; on Friday the 8th of May, I happen'd to be in company with one Mr. Law, a watchmaker, he told me he had got a letter with an advertisement in it, of a young man who had robb'd his master; and also, that he had a young man with him that answer'd that advertisement. I said, why did not you secure him? He said, he wanted some body with him, so we went and sat down in a publick room where he used, and he came in; a man sitting there, call'd him Sir George. The man said again to him, are not you from Shropshire ? He said, yes. Is your name John Davis? Yes, said he. Then I charged him with robbing his master, he confess'd it directly, and said he would deliver all the things to me, which he did. He told me he intended to go over to France.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she own she took it?</p>
               <p>Wadkins. She did, saying, she had it, but she did not carry it away.</p>

             to let the prisoner be in the house. I let him in about the beginning of March, but never saw him before now. No body was in the house but him and his wife. He had lived in the parish of Harrow before. About the 23d of May, Quentery told me, a man was taken selling some leaden weights, and they had reason to think they were mine; they belonged to sash windows. The other evidence will give a further account.</p>

I had been out betwixt one and two o'clock, there are but two plumbers in the town, they had notice of this, to stop all weights, &amp;c. The prisoner came to one King, a plumber, in Washford, who sent him up to my house. I took him in custody.

The child cried, I ask'd it what she cried for, she said, she wanted to go to her mother, and said the woman threaten'd to fling her into a pond if she cry'd. The child<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300011"/> was naked all to her gown, shift, and petticoat. In the bundle was a child's stay, a quilted petticoat, bib, and apron. I brought her to my dwelling-house. She confest she had taken the child from near Leicester-house. I asked her what she had done with the child's stockings. She deliver'd them to me, and a pair of buckles. By what the child said, I found out its parents, who liv'd in St. Martin's court; and there I took the prisoner and the child. When the prisoner was brought before the Justice, the prosecutor swore the things belong'd to the child. The Justice ask'd the prisoner what she had to say for herself. She said she had nothing at all to say, and that she was very sorry for what she had done.</p>

I saw her place herself in a particular place, to sit down in a corner betwixt two banks, which determin'd me to see what she did. Accordingly I watch'd, and saw her take the child's bib and apron off, then her stay, and so on to her smock. She put her under petticoat and the old gown on again, and was going to pull her shoes and stockings off. I then call'd to the other witness, a milk-woman, and said, for God's sake come here, for here is a woman stripping a child. In the mean time she shuffled on the shoes, and was leading it away. The child cried bitterly, and said, let me go to my mamma, adding, she liv'd in St. Martin's-Court at a china-shop. We took her and the child, with the assistance of two men; and I saw the bundle opened.</p>

Walking along, I ask'd her where she liv'd, she said in St. Martin's-court ; these two women put upon me, they took the child out of my hands, sent for two men, who pull'd and haul'd me all to pieces.</p>

            . I am a constable. The deceased was brought by a watchman to the watch-house in Catherine-street, near the tower, about half an hour after twelve at night, between the 4th and 5th of May. I ask'd him who it was that did him this mischief. He answer'd, he did not know the names of the men, but there were two, the one a foreigner, the other a sailor; that the sailor<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300012"/> knock'd him down with a stick, and the other, the man of the house, cut him with a sword. He died last Friday. The people in the neighbourhood heard a noise in Knapp's house, which by their directions we went and surrounded, and took the two prisoners to the watch-house. Knapp was taken the next morning before the deceased, who look'd at him about half a minute, and then said he was the man that cut him with a swore, but that he had chang'd his cloaths, for before he had on regimentals. The deceased was really in his senses at this time, tho' at times he had a few ghts, as once he had about two o'clock; and he told me before he should know the man if he could see him. The prisoners were brought in separately ; but I did not hear him say any thing to Clancey, I being not there when he was brought in. They were also separately examin'd before Justice Goodman, where they confess'd the abuses they had done to the deceased. Clancey was first examined; he own'd he struck him a blow once with a stick; the Justice ask'd him who it was that cut the man in the manner he was; he reply'd it was Mr. Knapp; and when Knapp was examin'd, he own'd he cut the man, but 'twas in his own defence. - On his cross examination, he said Knapp's house was about 300 yards from the watch-house; and that it was impossible to hear the noise made there to the watch-house; that, when he went by Knapp's door about eleven o'clock, all was very still then; and that the deceased had slumbered a little between the time he was brought there, and Knapp's being brought in.</p>

            . I was coming down the Ditch side about four o'clock in the morning of the 5th of May, and going by Knapp's door, I saw the headborough sitting there, who said he wanted my assistance, for that there had been a man murder'd. When the house was surrounded, somebody burst the door open. I went in, and found Knapp just getting out of bed. We took him, and carry'd him to the deceased. I held the prisoner before him, and said, young man, is this the man that has cut you? He lifted up his eyes and look'd hard at him, and said he was the man, but that he had chang'd his cloaths, for before he had on soldier's cloaths. About a minute or two after, he was asked again, and he answered as before, and added, that there was another man concerned with him who had a white waistcoat on, and a pair of clean trowsers. Clancey was then very soon brought in, and the deceas'd said that was the other person, adding, that he knock'd him down with a stick, and, after he had got up, and was running down the hill, Knapp follow'd him about 100 yards with a cutlass, and after he gave him a cut or two, the deceased begg'd for mercy, saying, for the Lord's sake don't kill me, struggling from him at the same time about 10 yards farther; but Knapp follow'd him, and said d - n you, I'll sla you by G - d; but as for Clancey, he never follow'd him. The deceased made no declaration how the quarrel began, but said he never was within the door, but was knock'd down at the door. [He shew'd the cap the deceased had on at the time, a thick worsted cap with three cuts in it about two inches long each.] Knapp declared he cut him so long till the cutlass flew in two.</p>
               <p>On his cross-examination he said he had this conversation with the deceased a little after seven in the morning; that he believed the constable was not there; and that the deceased was pretty saint, but very sensible.</p>

            . I belong to the second regiment of guards, and on the 5th of May between eleven and twelve o'clock was upon guard in the tower, about 100 yards from Knapp's door, whence I heard a great disturbance, and there came out a man, and said, are you come to rob my house? another man said, knock'd him down; to me it seem'd like a quarrel. The man however was knock'd down, but he recovered and ran about 40 yards, follow'd by another man with a hanger or sword in his hand, who knock'd him down, and after that struck him four or five blows. I call'd out, and said I would fire on him, if he did not let the man alone, but could not get to them because the ditch was between us. He left the deceas'd there, who strove to get up, but could not. The man that did it had on a soldier's coat, but I cannot be positive as to the prisoners, it being too far off to see; but when a watchman came, I call'd to him to take the man up that was cut.</p>

            . I live within four doors of Knapp's house, and had been in bed and asleep, but between eleven and twelve o'clock the 4th of May, I heard a great noise of fighting with sticks, and something struck as tho' against a stone. This was upon Tower-hill, at what distance from Knapp's house I cannot positively say, but believe 'twas about 20 yards. I heard the century call and tell them he'd fire, and then some persons, I believe above two, ran away towards Knapp's door.</p>

We staid till he got up, and then went with him to the watch-house. We ask'd the man whether he knew the prisoner ; he said, he did, and that he was the very man. They left me in the house, to take care of it. I took Clancey, who was up stairs under a bed.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. On Saturday the 5th of May, the deceased was brought to the London hospital. We found a large wound on the right side of his head on the upper part; it reached almost down to his ear; he had another wound under the right ear, and one on the left side of his head, beginning at the upper part thereof, and reaching down about two inches and a half, but that on the right side was the most mortal. He died May the 26th, and, by the directions of the surgeons, was opened, and 'twas the judgment of them all that these wounds were the occasion of his death. On the 5th of May I enquir'd of him how this accident happen'd. He said, as he was along with a ship-mate of his, going a-cross Tower-hill, they saw a crowd of people at a door, and upon enquiry what the matter was, a soldier and sailor came out; that the soldier, whom he took for a foreigner, drew his hanger, and swore he would kill him, and accordingly gave him two or three cuts on the head; that he was knock'd down several times by them, and that he made the best of his way from them, but was so closely follow'd by them that he could not escape, for at Tower-ditch the soldier overtook him, and cut him again two or three times. The soldier, who was century in the Tower heard the disturbance, and call'd out, saying he would fire upon them, which made them desist. The deceased lay in his blood upon the ground, whence he was taken and carried to the watch-house. When he gave me this account, he was quite in his senses; and there were some bruises in his arms, and the wounds were made by some cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any account how the quarrel arose?</p>
               <p>Dobson. He never told me what first occasioned the mob.</p>
               <p>Knapp's defence.</p>
               <p>I am a High German, and live upon Tower-hill. I heard a great noise that night in the street, but never went out of my house till the constable came next morning and took me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you forgot what you said before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know what I said there. Some people gave me brandy before I went there, and I was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Clancey's Defence.</p>
               <p>I'll tell the truth. There were three men came and knock'd at Knapp's door between twelve and one o'clock, when Knapp, who was much in liquor, went and ask'd what they wanted, adding, that it was an unseasonable time of the night to let any body in; but they insisted upon coming in, or they would break the door open. I then went out at the back door, and saw they were no watchmen. I ask'd them if they were going to rob the house, when one of them knock'd me down twice; and I, in my own defence, gave him one blow with my fist, but no more. The other prisoner said, gentlemen, go away from my house, and don't make any more noise about my door ; upon which two of them run, but the deceas'd stay'd behind, crying shame on the others for running, and throwing stones at Knapp and me; which made Knapp say, must my house be broke open by those three villains ? However, this man went away at last, and stood at the end of the lane. Knapp follow'd him, but what was done afterwards I can't tell. I was the first that went in, and Knapp came in afterwards.</p>

I went to Mr. Jones's, and found the prisoner had been there a little before, and had demanded payment of my bill. I told Mr. Jones the bill was my property, and that I must insist upon knowing how he came by it. The prisoner seemed confus'd, and told me he had found it; but that answer not being satisfactory, I sent for a constable, and had him sent to the Compter. I went to him afterwards with Mr. Jones, and he confess'd the whole fact, that he had taken the bills out of the post-office at Liverpool, that he had been drinking with the post-master there in his house, and had taken those letters up, and put them into his pocket. He sent for his pocket-book, and deliver'd up the letters, and the two other bills; they were broke open as they are now; one was a 50 l. note upon the bank, another a bill of 100 l. under the hand of

I went to Mr. Singleton's, a pawn-broker, at the corner of Fetherstone Buildings, to inquire if any such things had been brought there; the apprentice told me, had I came a quarter of an hour sooner I should have catched the men pawning them; he told me he knew Lindley very well. I went and got a warrant and apprehended Lindley, and he told me, coming along, that Whiteman Bailey was the man that brought them to him, and also where he lived. I went and took him, Bailey told me if I would not prosecute him, I should have my curtains again, and what I would require. He much desired I would tarry and make it up without committing him.</p>

            , I am headborough of the parish of St. Giles's, on May the 15th the prisoner was upon a dray sitting on the sharps on the near side with another young man behind him. Going along St. Giles's towards the church, the beadle of St. George's Bloomsbury, the deceased, was on the other side of the way, he was going to carry a silver mace home he had borrowed to attend at the Foundling-hospital; he crost the way, and I belive he bid the prisoner get down, but I could not here that. He did not get down, so the beadle took hold of the horse's head (there was out one horse) and turned him back again towards Holbourn, about twenty yards. The prisoner and the other person were then both upon the dray: then there was a little mob, and I heard it said, knock him down, knock him down; that I supposed to be, knock the <rs id="t17500530-32-viclabel148" type="occupation">beadle</rs>

When the deceased was on his back he lay about a yard from the dray, had it gone streight on, the wheel would not have touched him. Then the prisoner was making the best of his way with the dray, I followed him and took him before a magistrate. I heard no words pass between them.</p>

I did not see the prisoner upon the dray, the beadle let his staff fall in the struggle, the dray was as it were rather standing, the drayman disengaged himself from the deceased, and gave him a push, he lay about a yard or two from the dray on his back. Then the drayman turned the horse's head short round, and drove the wheel over his leg which he might have prevented, had he gone streight on he would have avoided it. I was then within seven or eight yards of them at this time, he lay above a yard from the streight course of the dray sideways.</p>

            . I was standing at the end of Bowl-yard, Broad St. Giles's; there I saw the prisoner at the bar and the beadle of St. George's parish a tusling together, they both had hold of each other, the prisoner pushed the other on the left side, then he drove on, and the near wheel went over the deceased's leg. He drove the horse streight on, he did not pull him, the horse's head was towards St. Giles's church when I first saw them. I was within twenty five yards of them, when the wheel run over him, I was within five or six yards of the deceased, I stopped the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined before the coroner?</p>
               <p>Watkins. Yes, I was, my lord.</p>

               <p>Watkins. I said if he had let the horse go on according to his own way, doubtless the wheel might have escaped the old gentleman's leg, had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175005300016"/> he flung the halter over the horse's head when he hit him, it might have escaped him.</p>

I was within fifteen or sixteen yards, I did not see the beginning of it, I saw the prisoner shove the beadle down, and went on with the dray, there were a great many people about, the horse stood still when the deceased was pushed down, and to the best of my knowledge the prisoner might have avoided running over the deceased.</p>
               <p>Jos. Windsor. I am an Apothecary, the deceased leg was broke in two, close by the ancle, both the bones, he was an elderly man; I attended him to the Saturday night when he died. The wound began to mortify on the Tuesday morning before I went to the prisoner in Bridewel. On the Sunday morning after I went and told him Mr. Burgess was dead, he said he was very sorry for it, and wished he had taken his advice and got off the dray.</p>

On the fifteenth of May I was in the shop at the sign of the parrot, I saw the beadle strike the prisoner once with his staff as they were scufling, the drayman's back was towards the horse, I saw the beadle lift up his hand to strike the drayman again; then the drayman pushed him down, and instantly the dray went on. The drayman perceiving the danger, he clap'd his right hand to the dray, to push it back if he could, I did not see he had hold of the halter, I was above twenty yards off.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Dixon. I was in the shop with the last witness, I saw a mob, and they said the beadle was beating the drayman. I don't know when the dray went on, or whether the drayman had a halter in his hand or not. I saw him striving to push the dray off.</p>
               <p>Fra. Winter. On the fifteenth of May I was looking out of my own window about twelve yards from the dray. I heard a noise, I saw the deceased having the prisoner by the collar, insisting he should go along with him, the prisoner would not go, the deceased up with his stick and hit him two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a stick or his staff?</p>
               <p>Winter. It was a stick or a cane, he had a staff in his hand besides, the prisoner strove to twist the stick out of his hand; he gave him a shove and he fell down in the kennel, then the dray turned round short and went over one of his legs.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. The prisoner worked with me a year and a half, I always looked upon him to be a quiet inoffensive man as ever I had in my house.</p>
               <p>The Rev. Mr. Allen. The time the prisoner was servant with Mr. Jackson, I lodg'd there about fifteen months, he had a general good character, I imploy'd him to do little matters for me, I always found him faithful and of a quiet disposition, and I was very much surprized when I heard he was under such circumstances.</p>

I miss'd it in a minute, there was no other person near me but him and the gentleman I was parting from. The prisoner was not gone above three yards from us, so I went and took hold on him, and carry'd him into the castle ale-house, which was about 10 yards off. Upon my searching him, I found nothing upon him; where I took hold of him I observ'd him make a motion with his arm as though he had thrown something away. After I had got sufficient persons to take care of him, I borrow'd a candle and lanthorn, and went to the place where I suspected, and there found my handkerchief. He pretended to be fuddled, and to know nothing of the matter. I got him committed.</p>

Bignal said he had had it three months, and it was lost but the 14th of May, and that he had before had it in pawn with one Mr. Harrison.

            . I rent a lower apartment of Mr. Bignal, last Friday was fortnight, I should have paid the last half guinea for this watch; Mrs. Bignal said to me, I have got a Loach for you; when she shew'd it me, there was the name Herring and number withinside, and a small silver seal with a bird and branch; and after that, when it was deliver'd to me last Friday was fortnight, the name and number were then fil'd out. I put a ribbon on it, the same that is now, and I went afterwards for the seal Mrs. Bignal said, she would make a move of that. I went down to a pawn-broker, and ask'd him what he would lend upon it, he said he would not take the watch in his pocket for ever so much, for fear of coming into trouble by the name being done out. Said my wife, get rid of it if you can. I went home, Mr. Bignal and his wife were quarrelling. She came running into my shop, my wife ran betwixt them; then said my wife, if you don't deliver the watch, and take the half guinea, I'll stamp it to pieces. So I deliver'd it up last Thursday was a week.</p>

               <p>I deal in old cloaths. Last May day in the morning, I went into Sugar-house yard to make water. I sat down, and I saw a watch lying by me, I took it up, there was another woman along with me, she and I went both to Mr. Bignal's in the morning. I said, glory be to God, I had got something that would get me bread for my poor children. I sold it to her for a guinea and a half. When I was before the Justice, the man would not swear me.</p>
