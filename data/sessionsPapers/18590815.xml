I am the wife of George Pratt, of 93, Cloth-fair—I buy old clothes and other things—the prisoner brought this picture and offered it for sale for a shilling, as the value of the frame—he said it was a portrait of his sister—I bought it—I afterwards took it to Mr. Ibbett.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor has known me about 20 years; he knows that I am a man of strict honour and integrity: a small quantity of spirits affects my head. He has behaved very kindly to me and induced me some time ago to take the pledge, which I kept for 16 months. In an evil hour I broke it, and this is the fruit of it. When I possessed myself of the picture it was with no felonious intent; it was done under the insanity of drink. The case would have ended at Guildhall had not the magistrate told the prosecutor that I could bring an action against him if the case was dismissed; I had intended to avail myself of a defence that was prepared for me, showing that there was no evidence that I stole the picture; but after listening to the pious exhortations of the chaplain day after day I cannot consent to purchase my liberty at the sacrifice of truth.</p>

I did not recognise Crockett till I turned my light on him and then I knew him, and I had a better chance of seeing who he was when he came and caught hold of me—I was 3 yards from the cellar when I saw Hemmings come out of it—he could not spring out, it was too deep—when I first saw him he had his head and shoulders above the level of the flap—one side of the flap was wrenched open—there are no steps—I was never asked before about seeing his head and shoulders out, but I said that I saw him come out and I tore his jacket here (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—I said to the landlord that I did not know their names, but could give a full description of them—I told him how they were dressed, and he said "Oh, that is Thomas Hemmings and Crockett"—I had heard their names before, about the market-place, but could not think of them—I do not know that one has been in the service of the postmaster—I have heard that Hemmings was in the service of Page, the builder, and have heard that he was convicted 5 times in 5 months—I went to another place before I went to his mother's—I have never expressed the slightest doubt about the prisoners, not even to the landlord.</p>

On the the Thursday after 22d July, in consequence of some information which had been conveyed to me, I addressed the prisoner, and directed his attention to this book—I said "Mc Bean, did you supply Mr. Hardy, of Croydon, with any goods last week?"—he said "Yes, Sir"—I said "And took them home to Mr. Hardy?"—he said "Yes, Sir"—I said "It is no use telling me a falsity; you did not take them to Mr. Hardy"—he said "I did, Sir"—I said "You did not take them to Mr. Hardy; you took them elsewhere"—he then said he had taken 6 decanters to Mr. Durant, in Bishopsgate-street; and the other portion of the goods he took to Mrs. Baldwin, at the Tamworth Arms, Croydon—I said "Have you received cash for them?" he said "No, Sir"—I said "You had better tell me the truth at once"—he has never paid any of the money for these goods—I never gave him authority to deal on his own account—we give no one authority to do that—we allow them a commission on what they do sell; but everything must go from the firm in the usual course of business—Wheelerby was not there on the Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what period did you tell him he had better tell all about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After he had stated that Mr. Hardy had had the goods—we allow our travellers a commission as well as a salary—the prisoner was a traveller—he did not say he was just going to pay the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; or was just about to pay it, and had drawn 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Mr. Henry Defries to make up the amount; not in my hearing—I was not there all the time—my brother</p>

On 11th July I went to bed with my wife about half-past 10 o'clock—the house was then fastened, and every window was down—about half-past 2 o'clock I heard a rustling noise, and thought I saw a man—I raised myself up, and found a person in the room—I got out of bed, collared the prisoner, and ordered my wife to go and raise an alarm in the front room—during that time the prisoner said to me, "My friend McIntosh is in the front room; you had better liberate me and go and look after him"—I would not do so—my wife gave an alarm in the front room, and during that time the prisoner tried to get away, but I held him till the policeman came, and gave him into his hands—I examined my trousers, and missed my purse, containing 2 cheques,</p>

The Magistrate asked if there were the marks of nails, they said "Yes," and I had no nails in my boots. The prosecutor said to me, "What do you do here?" I said, "Some person let me in;" he saw I was the worse for liquor. He went out of the room for ten minutes and came back and put on his stockings. The policeman searched me and said I had nothing, and when we got to the station he said, "What did you do with the sixpence you had?" I can swear I never saw the purse; it must have fallen out of his pocket after he had overhauled my clothes. I was in the house but I did not break in.</p>

I am a clerk in the General Post Office—in consequence of information I received, I made up a test letter on 12th July—I enclosed in it 2 half sovereigns, having previously marked them; I enclosed them in a paper and fastened that in a piece of gum paper—it was addressed to Mary Slade, at Mrs. Grimway's, the Priory, Leyton, Essex; I fastened the envelope with an adhesive seal—I gave that letter to Mr. Clare—if it were posted at the General Post-office it would go through the district where the prisoner was employed—I gave some directions to Mr. Bennett, at the North-Eastern Office—I subsequently went and met Mr. Bennett—I went to the office in Green-street, Bethnal-green, and the prisoner was brought to me just before 9 o'clock in the morning of the 13th, I asked him if he was on duty at the North-Eastern department that morning—he said he was—I asked him if he assisted at the sorting; he said he did not—I said, "Do you know any<lb/>thing of a money letter addressed to Mary Slade, Leyton?"—he said he did not—I then directed Bingham, the officer, to search him, and saw him take</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers—the prisoner has been about two years a letter carrier attached to the office—on 12th July I received a letter from Mr. Gardner, addressed to Mary Slade, Leyton—I saw that it contained something inside—I posted that letter the next morning at St. Martin's-le-grand, at 5 o'clock in the morning—it would be transmitted from there about a quarter past five—I went about 10 o'clock the same morning to the City of Paris Tavern, in Old Ford-road, kept by Mr. Keymer—he produced three half sovereigns to me, and amongst them I found one which Mr. Gardner identified.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the principal charge taker at the North-Eastern district, Bethnal-green; the prisoner was employed at that office as a letter carrier—he also assisted in sorting the letters—I received the mail-bag from the chief officer about half-past five in the morning of 13th July, and in that bag I found a letter addressed, "Mary Slade, Mrs. Grimway's, the Priory, Leyton, Essex"—Mr. Gardner said something which called my attention to that letter—I handled it, and found it contained coin—about twenty minutes before 7 o'clock I placed that letter on the table amongst the letters which the prisoner had to sort—I saw him sorting the letters amongst which that letter laid—the prisoner was there when I placed that letter there—I saw him sort all the letters—no person was sorting at that table but him—he left the table about ten minutes before 7 o'clock, about ten minutes after I had given him the letter—he then brought the letters for the Loughton-road, where the Leyton letters are taken out, and amongst them this letter ought to have been—he then returned to his seat and remained there till five minutes before 7 o'clock—he then went down, apparently with a view of going to the water-closet—he went in that direction—he was away about ten minutes—when he came back he went to his seat and remained there till twenty-five minutes past 7, when I dispatched the letter carriers, and he went away—after he was gone I looked over the letters in the Leyton box, the one addressed to Mary Slade was not amongst them—I communicated that.</p>

I am a cooper, of 5, Cooper's Row—I have known the prisoner some years; he is a peaceable, quiet, humane man—I never knew anything bad of him—on Sunday, 17th July, I went away with him and his wife—I saw Mrs. Russell at her door—she was very abusive—I have seen her attempting to get things to <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> at Martin, but her husband pre<lb/>vented her—I was with him up to 12 o'clock at night—when we came home between 8 and 9 she abused him very much—I did not see anything thrown at her—after that she went over to the door, and I followed him—No. 2 is nearly opposite No. 5—I believe the woman was abusing him so much that he went over merely to frighten her—I went over after him as soon as he went out of his place—I followed him back—he did not go into the house, for I kept him in sight as he crossed—the court is 7 feet wide—he had one leg in the doorway and the other out when I laid hold of him and brought him back—he did not strike the woman; on my oath, I must have seen it if he had—I did not see the woman at all, either standing or lying down—the door was not thrown back, it never is; it always stands perpendicularly half open—I could not see the woman with it in that con<lb/>dition.</p>

               <p>to the back window, but did not see any one—I sprang my rattle, and got assistance—I then found the back window on the first floor broken to pieces—103, Shurety, came to my assistance—we searched the house, and found the attic front door broken open, as if it was done with a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>—the window of the front attic was open—I and the other policeman got on the roof and searched it—we went along the roofs from one end to the other—there are 21 houses—the other constable apprehended the prisoner 15 houses off from No. 25—I searched him, and found on him pick-locks, a latch-key, a wax taper, some lucifer matches, and a song book—he had his boots in his hand—he had, to stoop down to put his boots on, and I saw the other constable take a watch from him—he seemed to take it from the back of his neck—I produce the watch—the prisoner was taken to the station-house by the other constable—I returned to the empty house—the next morning I went to No. 28, and found a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> outside the window—it was in the gutter at the top of the house.</p>

I live at 5, New-court, Farringdon-street, and am a draughtsman—I met the last witness outside a public-house on that night; he was talking with two females; one of them was the prisoner at the bar—one of the females spoke to me—I did not go into the public-house—I was not drinking with them—soon after, the prisoner and the last witness went down Newcastle-street—I spoke to the prosecutor about going home, and he said he would—I soon after heard him call out, "I have lost my watch," and then saw the prisoner running away—I ran and stopped her—I said nothing about the watch—when I spoke to the prosecutor about coming home, I turned back, thinking he was following me, and I then heard him cry out.</p>

About 2 o'clock on the morn<lb/>ing when this occurred, in consequence of hearing a cry, I ran up to New<lb/>castle-street—I was passing on duty near there—I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor—I saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor after her; and he called out, "I have lost my watch"—he caught hold of her hand, and they wrestled—he handed me the watch, and gave her in custody—she said nothing—he charged her with stealing his watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Horne and Co., of Haydon-square—the prisoner was their wool foreman—his duty was to receive orders for wool and to superintend the calculations, and pay such charge as might be asked by the warehousemen—if a bale of wool was ordered in Lancashire an order would be sent to Chaplin and Horne, at Haydon-square, or it might be sent to the prisoner as the superintendent of the wool department, who would enter it in an order-book kept for that purpose—we must have a delivery order addressed to the warehouseman where the wool is kept—if a bale of wool is in the possession of Gooch and Cozens, the first step is for us to receive an order for its delivery, which is given by the owner or the broker—that would be entered in the order-book at Haydon-square—or one of the other depots—orders are frequently put into the prisoner's hands, and his duty then was to make an entry in the order-book—Gooch and Cozens had a separate order-book—after the order is entered in the order-book the next step is to lodge it with the warehouseman of the wool, say Gooch and Cozens, who then make arrangements for the collection; the wool foreman directs a van to call at the different warehouses for the goods, and they are brought to Haydon-square—before they are put in the van, and before the order is lodged, a payment is made, called <hi rend="italic">the paid on,</hi> which is a charge of 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per bale for marking by the warehouse keeper, or for warehousing, as the case may be—if it has been over the prescribed time another charge is made for warehousing—the charge is made by Gooch and Cozens to Chaplin and Horne—it would be paid by the defendant at the time, or at periodical times by the foreman of the wool, and occasionally by the collector of the bales, and he would receive the money from the foreman; the party that pays it taking a receipt—Chaplin and Home get their money back thus; the bale of wool on its arrival at Haydon-square is accompanied by what is termed the cart note, which is given by the warehouse keeper, and contains the particulars of the wool delivered; so the carman and the cart note being presented to the defendant he registers the number of bales in a book called the number or receipt book, which entry contains the consecutive numbers</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150043"/>
               <p>of the wool bills—each wool bill contains only the wool that is brought in by the separate loads, and after it is registered in the book the defendant makes out the wool bill, giving the sender, the consignee, and the residence, the number of articles, with their marks, and the amount paid on; he then hands it to the invoicer, who makes out an invoice to the station where the goods are consigned to, and the corresponding particulars, with the amount paid on, are thereupon placed, and with that invoice the goods are forwarded from Haydon-square, which finishes the transaction and finishes the duties of the foreman as far as the transit of that single bale is concerned—he has nothing to do with the carriage to be paid afterwards; but before the invoice leaves Haydon-square it is compared with the wool bill by clerks termed referencers; the invoice and wool bill are brought in together, given to the referencer, and he compares them before the goods are sent away—it is his duty to see that they correspond in every particular—when the wool bills are cleared they are checked by the referencers and given into the hands of a boy, who pastes them into a skeleton book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), a reference is made on the wool bill and the invoice—at the termination of each wool sale it is the foreman's duty to make up his account by bringing each bill forward to the last bill of the day, making a daily total—the skeleton book is accessible to the defendant; the place for it is in the down or outward office, and he uses it for reference in case there is any enquiry about wool from the country—he makes demands for payment from that book—he gets back the 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a bale by means of it—he makes out an account of his advances on paid<lb/>ons at the end of each sale and gets paid by the cashier, Mr. Castleman—those entries wave made by the defendant in a book called the wool book, which was kepi by him, and was called his book—nobody else made entries in it—I have examined to-see that—this represents money which he has paid out—the wool-book that contains the summary is missing—a search has been made for it—I saw it last in the defendant's possession in the rack in the wool office—there were a dozen or more books there—all the clerks have access to the wool office—it is left open for business—it is not exclu<lb/>sively the defendant's office—I never saw anybody but the defendant in possession of that wool-book; nobody else has a right to make entries in it—it is kept for the summary.</p>

Chaplin and Home? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since November last—I have not been talking about the case to the other clerks; I have with the attorney several times; he directed me to make such answers as were compatible with the case—I have not been making inquiries at all; the theory I know myself; I have been long enough at the business for that, and I had only to refresh my memory as to the practice, but I cannot recollect any person who I made any direct in<lb/>quiries of—I have made several inquiries; I inquired of the two referencers, A venden and Pay; they are here—that was not in order to enable me to give my evidence, but merely to put the facts into the attorney's hands; it is since I was examined at the Mansion-House—I had no inquiries about my evidence, it was about these entries—I have known the prisoner ever since I entered the service in November last, and have seen him every day—my duty there is checking also—I was in the employment of the Great Western Railway before that—I have been in the office with the prisoner many times—I have a pretty good knowledge of his figures, and swear that I believe these alterations to be his—I hare never received a letter from him—I have seen him write these wool bills in his wool-office—I have seen him actually engaged writing perhaps a dozen times—I went into the wool-office sometimes when I had occasion to see Strickland on different matters of business, and talked to him, but never remained very long at one time—I believe all these alterations to be his writing, and they consist of figures only—I have formed my opinion not merely from seeing him write, but from his figures in the different bills—the cart notes never contain the price, but sometimes there is an additional charge in them for warehousing, when the goods remain longer than the stipulated time, when the amount would be put upon the cart note—the defendant pays the warehouseman, but he might pay the carman sometimes—he makes out the bill from the order in the order book, which contains the consignment, the cart note does not—he would have the cart note on one side of him, and the book on the other—the cart note is the only means he has of knowing how many bills on a a particular load a carman brings—the entry is made in the order-book before the arrival of the goods—Strickland makes it, or his son; he gets the order from the consignors—if you buy bales of wool you can send them</p>

This wool-bill, 516, in my book on December 10th, would in the course of business generally come to me from the prisoner or his son, but I cannot speak to this particular bill—I am an invoice clerk; there are several invoice clerks, two for the wool department, Knapman and myself—I first of all receive a cart note down a shute, and hand it over to the prisoner in the office—he would make out a note for Gooch and Cozens there, and hand it over to me—I copied the contents of that note, but not as it is now stuck in—here are 12 bales, R. P. of H.—one for W. W. of Huddersfield, two for R. Groves, and one for W. Bidfen, of Huddersfield—this is the original invoice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I made it out myself, and Mr. Fryer gave it me to-day; it is in my writing—this is the first time I have seen it since I wrote it; it is "J.

Whitnam, Huddersfield, 1 bale, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  <hi rend="italic">considered that this was no comparison at all, as one person might be careless</hi>)—have wool<lb/>bill 516 here, that is my own ticking; I looked at both without anybody's assistance; the one strictly tallies with the other—the second one is Har<lb/>grave's; I compared that with' Ovenden—the other is Whitwen, of Hud<lb/>dersfield, and Pollett, of Huddersfield; I compared those without assistance—this is the original invoice; I expect they have written to the country for it; it is in three different hands—I know it is the original, because I compared it with the wool-bill, and they strictly tally with one another—Ovenden called the items, and I marked the invoice, as containing the same items called—I saw the wool-bills on each occasion when I compared them—they are not now in the same state—in No, 501, what was 1 bale has been altered to 2, and a 1 put before it on the left side, to make it 12; and the amount paid on which was only 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is now 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the total bales at the bottom, which would have been 7 in its original state, is now 18 bales, but the total was not there; it is not always put—I believe those alterations to be in Strickland's writing—No. 516 is not in the same state as it was ori<lb/>ginally, "Hargraves, of Bradford, 2 bales, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is altered into "24 bales, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." by a 4 being put at the right side of the 2, and the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. having a long stroke brought down, making it into 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I believe the 4 to be the prisoner's; I cannot speak to the stroke—the next item is "Whitwen, 1 bale of wool, 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." which is altered to "12 bales, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." by adding a 1 on the right side, and a long Broke afterwards, such as is commercially understood to mean 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the 2 is Mr. Strickland's figure, but the 1 I cannot swear to—there was no total bales at the time I first saw it; the total is now 55 bales, and the money 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in Strickland's writing—this wool-bill, 518, is not in its original state—here are Mr. Ovenden's figures on it, therefore, of course, I did not see it—Strickland's son has made out the bill for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this 2</p>

               <p>the prisoner and his wife had had breakfast in the same room—I broke some off the lump and put it on the meat and in the gravy—I used very nearly a quarter of it—I and my husband and children all partook of this meat, but the two youngest children did not get so much of it—I then felt very ill, and a burning pain at my chest, and was sick—my eldest child, who is near twelve years old, was very sick; he went to the hospital; and my husband was sick also—I took the remainder of the stuff to Mr. Hatton, and he said it was rank poison—I gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpet warehouseman at 11, Basinghall-street—I first became acquainted with the prisoner in January last—he was brought to me by a customer of mine—he referred me to Messrs. Skiff, Brothers, of Great Alie-street, which reference was highly satisfactory—I knew At that time that he was carrying on business in St. Swithin's-lane—I did not know from him how long he had been there—he first purchased goods to the amount of 139<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said when he bought these goods, that he had become buyer for some houses in Holland for Fortuyn, Keiser, and Hartolf; upon which goods he was to receive a commission of 5 per cent., for purchasing on their account—the goods were sold at 21/2 per cent. in a month from that time, up to the beginning of April—I should say the amount was nearly 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I supplied him with goods in April; on the 4th, 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 7th, 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 8th, 164<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 11th, 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 13th, 224<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on 16th, 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 19th, 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 21st, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 25th, 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 27th, 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 29th, 786<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—these were for donnetts and serges—I can separate them; the donnetts are 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,</p>

               <p>and the serges, are the difference, namely, 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on May 10th there were some table covers, which came to 169<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there were 144 table covers; they were sold in one lot—the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were what we call Victoria covers, a different kind altogether—on 11th May there are carpets and table covers, 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; June 8th, carpets and donnetts, 167<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I don't know whether the whole amount of these goods is 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I could tell if I added them up—that 21/2 discount was altered—after he was doing a good trade he wanted to have a little more time, and I promised then to give him an account up to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; a running account—that was six weeks afterwards; by that time he had paid me about 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no further alteration of credit—I did eventually give him credit—he asked me if I could, and the feeling was so straightforward and satisfactory, that I had no hesitation at all in trusting him—when he got the donnetts and serges on 29th April, he said that they were for Holland; nothing else—I was not aware that they had not been shipped to Holland until after I received information from Grundy's, of Manchester, in the middle of May—Messrs. Grundy were the manufacturers of whom I had bought the goods—in consequence of the information I went to the prisoner immediately, and told him I had heard that the goods had been offered to Messrs. Grundy for 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that being 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. below what they had been invoiced to me at—that was the donnetts only—he seemed very much surprised, and turned to his day-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and showed me this entry, (<hi rend="italic">R ad:</hi> "R. Berhens, goods bought, 30th April; donnetts, 368 pieces, 754<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.")—the date in the prisoner's book is 9th May—he said he could not account at all for how the goods could have been sold in Manchester—he said he had sold them to Mr. Berhens, a friend of his from Holland—I asked him if that was the party for whom the goods were originally intended—he said, "No; the goods were originally intended for Hartolf"—I then asked him the reason Hartolf had not received the goods—he said Hartolf already owed him a considerable amount of money, and he did not wish to send any more goods to him until the account was reduced; and this friend coming over from Holland, he sold him the goods and got cost price for them—I asked him how the goods had been taken away—he said he had taken them to a packer's when they were brought by Berhens—I think he said the packer lived in Newgate-street—I don't think anything was said about a cart—they could not go without a cart—I knew nothing about Mr. Berhens, and had no further means of ascertaining—I asked the prisoner where Berhens lived—he said he did not know—I said it was a very extraordinary thing; I should like to have such a customer, to know where to go back to him again—nothing else passed—when I sold the 144 table covers to him, he said they were to send to Mr. Fortuyn, of Holland—there was another parcel supplied after the table cloths on 19th June—I had no suspicion at that time—he told me he had received the money—the first time I had any suspicion about the prisoner was when I got the information from Manchester—I attended the meeting of his creditors on 22d June—a person named Eames was present—I believe he is a watchmaker—he was very vehement indeed against the bankrupt—he said in the bankrupt's presence and hearing that ho had sold him goods, and asked what had become of them, and Goldsmith stated that he had pawned them with Attenborough, in the Strand, and that he had after<lb/>wards given him (Mr. Eames) the pawn-ticket—when the prisoner ordered the carpets and donnetts on the 18th June, he made no representation specially about the goods.</p>

               <p>account of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I afterwards supplied goods—I ship nothing myself—the bankrupt saw me and my clerk repeatedly when he came to order goods—we were not always together—the donnetts and serges were ordered of me—the order of the table-covers, on the 10th May, was given to me; the velvet table-covers were given to me—the 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. order, on 11th, was also given to me—my clerk was not present at the giving of either of these orders—if goods are forced into the market they must be sold at a sacrifice—there were two lots of table-covers; 144 went to Southgate's, the packers, and 144 to St. Swithin's-lane—I have seen a person whom Gold-smith called Mr. Fortuyn—I was told to enquire about him, and I found that he was a very respectable person, and that he was a Holland merchant—for the 368 pieces of goods the prisoner paid 764<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the serges are not charged there; they were at the manufacturers—I believe Mr. Eames lives at Hoxton—I know nothing about him—I believe he is a watchmaker—whenever I asked the bankrupt any question he showed his books, and answered in a very straightforward manner indeed—I believe the stoppage arose soon after the money paid on his bankers—when he attended the meeting of creditors, when he was asked questions he answered; them without difficulty or hesitation—before the bankruptcy all his bills had been honoured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general merchant, in Gutter-lane—I know the prisoner; he came to my house in February last, and stated that he was a purchaser of goods for various parties on the Continent, in Holland, and many of them his own relations; that he got 5 per cent, for acting as agent, and gave references as to his respectability; he referred to Skiff, Brothers, to and H. Isaacs, and to Mr. Peter Brown—he had no one with him at this time—he said he never purchased goods for himself, only as agent for others—to certain inquiries he gave the name of one party in Holland, A. J. Fortuyn—he gave me an order for some samples, and I was to inquire of the reference—I executed that order on 24th February; the first order came to 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the goods were principally black lustres and black awnings, as far as I can remember—I saw the prisoner again after that, on 10th March, I think; he then ordered 700 pieces of black lustres, and a large quantity of donnetts of different sorts; the order for the lustres came to about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—we refused to execute the order for donnetts, we thought the order too large to trust to one man—I don't think any more goods were ordered till 1st May—I have not an account here; the goods ordered then were about 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. value, in black lustres; the prisoner said that they were for a party in Holland; this delivery was on 5th May; we had no further order after that—the orders were delivered, on an average, about a week or a fortnight after the goods were ordered; altogether we have been paid about 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 447<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., is now due.</p>

               <p>into these accounts—saw the prisoner, and entered into an examination of his books—I got such an explanation from him as I thought necessary—I saw that he first began to trade as a shipping-merchant in December, 1858, in St. Swithin's-lane, and in the Pavement as well, where he has a retail cigar shop, which he has carried on since February, 1858—having examined his books, he was, in January, 1859, insolvent to the amount of about 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and in March he was about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. behind—at the end, his deficiency, according to his own account, was 4,519<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that has since been checked by me, and I find it right—the whole amount of purchases which appeared by the books from January to June is 10,285<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the purchases for the three months preceding the bankruptcy, taken from 1st April, were 6,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he mentioned Mr. Hartolf as a debtor for 954<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I inquired who he was, and he said he was a merchant living at Amsterdam—I asked how he came to include him as a doubtful debtor—he said that he had sold him a large quantity of goods, and that was the balance of the account; and he heard from friends that he had left Amsterdam, and therefore he considered it was doubtful—he recognised Mr. Fortuyn, of Zutfen, as a good debtor of 695<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that be thought the debt would be paid—he said that Mr. Reyser, who was down for 832<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was a bad debtor; that he knew him some time in Amsterdam, and he used to call on him, but had returned him as a bad debtor, as he did not know where he was, as he had ran away from Amsterdam, and he did not know his present whereabouts—I find entries in the books of goods sold to Behrens amounting to 754<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 19th May here is one sum due, 176<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—at the meeting of his creditors on 30th June he said he knew Mr. Behrens in Holland, and that Mr. Behrens called on him in Finsbury Pavement, and wished to know whether he had any goods to sell, and lodged with him sums of money; on 2d May 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 3rd May 108<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; on 4th May 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; on 6th May 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and on 9th May 216<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the 9th May being the day he sold him that large parcel of goods—those sums come to 754<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I inquired further about Behrens—he said that he did not know his address, and could not tell where he could find him, but that he was in the habit of calling on him almost daily at his office, but did not know where the direction was—I have seen this entry about Behrens—cloaks and mantles, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and clocks, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., appear by the balance-sheet to be all the stock given up off the premises in the last three months; the difference is made up by debts, and by a stock of cigars which had not been referred to in the furniture; the stock was valued at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is his valuation, contained in the account laid before the creditors—the accountant does not value; he puts down what the debtor gives—his private expenditure for the last 18 months before his bankruptcy is down in the book as 1,401<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it is 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the three months before his bankruptcy—in this book, under date of 19th May, here is what purports to be a sale to Simons and a payment by Simons to the amount of 590<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in the cash-book I find, "19th May.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since you became connected with the parish, is the constitution of it entirely changed by Act of Parliament? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; during the time I have been there, I have known the defendant to act as collector—I know the mode which is pursued by the collectors—it was for myself to hand to him official receipts in print—they were bound in books—and the notice or application papers with them, applying for the rates; and, having these materials, it was his duty to go and collect the money—the receipts are all written and filled in, in my writing for him, before they are given to him—this is one of the application papers—this is filled up by the collector himself—on collecting the money, it was his duty to give one of the official receipts, signed for the amount he received, and pay the money into the Union Bank of London, every Saturday; the whole amount received up to Friday night—an account of what he receives is rendered to me every Saturday morning—he is to give me the weekly return of all money received—he does not give any paper from the bank—here is a book furnished him by the parish—the amounts on these papers ought to tally with the weekly returns—giving a receipt on the application paper is not in the regular course of business; it is a very great departure from it—the collectors are directed, when they receive money to give an official receipt; and on the receipt itself the vestry request that only a printed receipt stamped with their common seal be taken—at the end of about three months it is customary for the collectors to make out their balance sheet; the quarterly account—I have the quarterly balance sheet for the Christmas quarter; it is in the defendant's writing—I have the three receipts of Baber and Harvey and Tamer—I have an account of the defaulters, which was rendered to me on 16th May, this year—I produce the book of receipts which was handed to the prisoner by me as to the Christmas collection—these are the identical receipts which were handed to the prisoner in the book for the purpose of being given to the rate payers, on payment of the money—the defendant brought them back to me on 16th May with this account of the payments and defaulters—it is the practice that he hands me a book of the names of persons who have not paid, and returns the receipts—those three persons are returned by the prisoner in his writing as defaulters—No. 203 is Susannah: Baber's; that refers to the number in the rate-book, and that shows that that person is a defaulter—the document of the money he pays into the bank is kept by the bankers—it was discovered that these sums were not paid in by the collecting being put into the hands of a subsequent collector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do the collectors receive receipt-books to collect all their rates by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—these are given quarterly, and having collected or made efforts to collect them at the quarter, they make up their quarterly account—in the first instance the defendant is debited with all the receipts, and he must give an account that the houses are empty, and that the person has left without paying; or that the person is excused; and in this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150080"/>
               <p>other column that they have not paid—he had to go through the accounts—there are, probably, two or three thousand receipts in all, at the beginning of the quarter, and he has to make a recapitulation, and abstract of all the receipts in books; Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on—he copies the receipts on separate documents—when he has a receipt in the book, that will be an un<lb/>cancelled receipt—when he has not the receipt he has the counterpart, but that does not show what has become of it—it shows that that person has paid the money—when he goes through the book he has to go through the receipts—I think he has not to go through the counterparts because he has paid those receipts in—the collector should make a copy of this book in figures; but supposing he does not do it, it would be necessary for him to refer to the counterparts—he must go through all the receipts and counterparts in making up his quarterly returns—I think it would take him from Friday night to Monday morning to do it—after the account is closed it would be improper for him to give any formal receipts out of the book—I believe there are no positive directions; it would be improper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a rate-payer comes to him with the money, when the account is closed; is he to refuse the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I never knew a rate-collector refuse the money—he cannot give an official receipt, because he hands them to me—I do not think I was present in May, when the defendant was asked about the Judge's order—the vestry clerk would know: he is here—I know that besides this account there is a separate list of de<lb/>faulters—he has not made such a list here—that is a list of defaulters for the Magistrate—I do not know whether these would be returned as defaulters till the prisoner returned these names in his lists as defaulters—this is returned, and in about three weeks afterwards the list is made out for the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the list of defaulters be made up about three weeks after this list is sent in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about three weeks or a month—before he made out that list, he was suspended on 23d May—so long as he had not made out the list for the Magistrate, the persons would not be summoned—the time he closed his account would be Friday night—he would not return the book of receipts on Friday, he would keep them, and only return the account—he would not dispossess himself of the receipts—all the time from Christmas till 16th May he had the receipts in his possession to give to the rate payers—he has never accounted for these three amounts.</p>

               <p>cent. on those that were paid in after October, certainly not; because I gave him notice that I would not—he frequently requested an account—I had commenced to act for myself long before—perhaps I had received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the bankers had received about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the result of his applications—in addition to what was paid into the bank, I received 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the prisoner, and of course I received some from the contributors; perhaps 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to me when I was travelling about the county—in 1857 I went to Glasgow—in 1856 I received money paid by contributors and sent by post; perhaps 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was before August.</p>

               <p>my account—I do not recollect that I threatened the prisoner with filing a bill in Chancery, but the letters speak for themselves—Mr. Williams paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a meeting at Dudley; I cannot say that the prisoner had not seen him before, because he went all over the country after my giving him instructions not to go to any of the iron districts in the country—I sent him instructions in writing not to canvass in the iron districts—I think that was in October, before I dismissed him—he had not authority to do so in August and September, certainly not, because I had verbally given him instructions not—but in October I gave it him in writing—I furnished him with the book containing the iron districts—I will swear positively that when I gave him the book I gave him those instructions that he was not to canvass in the country—that was sometime early in 1856, before I dismissed him—it was perhaps in September—I have received sums from the country but not through his solicitation—he had not sent them circulars to my knowledge—he furnished me with an account which I have here, and it is a disgrace to any man.</p>

I think he did say, "Not one copy has ever been in a shop window"—I do not remember that the words I used to my clerk were, "Pay a guinea to this person for two prints, when he brings them to-morrow"—I told him to pay him when he called.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Smith, of Rifle-terrace, Bayswater—I keep a boarding-house there—the deceased lady, Miss Isabella Bankes, became an inmate of that boarding-house on the 20th September last year—the prisoner and his wife were inmates there at that time, and had been so for some time, at different times; the last time for about five months—Mrs. Smethurst was, I should think, twenty years older than the prisoner-after Miss Bankes became an inmate of my house I noticed some familiarities that I thought were improper between the prisoner and her—in consequence of that I desired Miss Bankes to leave my house—I heard her tell the prisoner that I had given her notice—I told him why; he said he was very sorry that I had pained her mind, that if I had named it to him he would have taken care I should not have been annoyed—I still persisted in my desire that she should leave the house; and the prisoner said that he should go away himself—Miss Bankes left my house on 29th November, the prisoner left on 12th December—he said he was going to visit a friend, he did not say where he was going—he left his wife behind him in the house—after he had left he returned to his wife, I am not certain how soon after, but I should think about a fortnight—I don't think he stayed any time; he slept there once, but I was not aware of it until afterwards—he came several times.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Wheatley, and live at 10, Alma-villas, Richmond; I was living there in the month of April last—I let lodgings—I recollect the prisoner, Dr. Smethurst, engaging lodg<lb/>ings at my house on the 15th April; he came on that day with a lady he called Mrs. Smethurst—they came in a cab; they engaged two rooms, a sitting-room on the ground floor, and a bedroom over that; those were the only lodgings I had to let in the house—Mrs. Smethurst appeared to be in a very delicate state of health at that time; she was hardly able to walk; she went to bed very soon after she got up stairs—from the time she remained in our house till her death, she came down into the sitting-room about four times, in the way of having her bed made, and to purify the room—as soon as she came to me, Dr. Julius or Mr. Bird attended her every day—after she had been with me a day or two, Dr. Bird came in place of Dr. Julius—I used not to wait on her; Dr. Smethurst waited on her—I pre<lb/>pared her food down stairs; then I either took it to the dining-room, to Dr. Smethurst, or sometimes I have taken it to the bedroom-door; once or twice—when the food had been taken, Dr. Smethurst generally put the things outside the door, on a box in the passage—medicine was brought from the surgery of Dr. Julius for Mrs. Smethurst to take; when I took it in, I either took it into the dining-room to Dr. Smethurst, or to the bed-room-door, and he took it from me there—when there were any evacuations to throw away I took them from the landing—Dr. Smethurst placed them outside on the landing himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You never took anything of that sort out of the bedroom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a slop-pail on the landing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were generally left in a pan or a chamber on the landing; I then removed them, and took them down stairs myself—there were three chambers and a pan in the bedroom Mrs. Smethurst occupied, and two basins also. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the pan or the chamber were placed outside on the landing do you recollect whether different things were poured into the pan together, or whether you had the evacuation there by itself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared altogether, sometimes quite full.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is, all the slops of every kind appeared to be altogether in the same vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and sometimes that was full.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember, during the time that she was ill in your house, saying anything about a nurse attending her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Dr. Smethurst. said he could not afford a nurse; I asked him if I might sit up at night, that he might get a little rest—he said "No," he thanked me, I had my work to do in the day; he would not disturb my rest; he then said he could not afford a nurse, he would rather attend on Mrs. Smethurst himself no one could do so well as himself for her—I had not mentioned anything to him about a nurse—I had not heard Dr. Julius say anything to him about a nurse before this—I recollect on one occasion Dr. Julius coming while the prisoner was away from home, and taking a motion—Dr. Julius brought it to me—I do not know where it was when Dr. Julius went up stairs—I do not remember when this was—I believe it was three or four days before her death—Dr. Julius took it away with him—I recollect Dr. Todd coming from London to see Mrs. Smethurst—I had on that day kept an evacuation of the deceased all day, in order that Dr. Todd might see it; that was by the prisoner's direction—I threw it away a short time before Dr. Todd arrived, in consequence of the lateness of the night—I did not always take the food to the bedroom; Dr. Smethurst fetched it very often from the door.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the things were brought out of the bedroom, or when you took them down stairs, was any part of the food that you had taken up remaining in the cup? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember it, only on one occasion; that was some stewed rice that was turned sour—Dr. Smethurst asked me to throw it away, it was turned sour; and I did so—I do not remember any food re<lb/>maining in the cup on any other occasion—the room was never thoroughly cleaned out—there was an old-fashioned secretary on the landing—there were two keys to it—Dr. Smethurst had the key—it was kept locked—I never saw the inside of it after that—I do not know what was put inside.</p>
               <p>A <hi rend="smallCaps">JUROR</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you that there were two keys? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; one for the drawers at the bottom, and one for the top—Dr. Smethurst had both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe anything of the colour of any vomit that was taken down stairs in the different pans or basins? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not see the colour of it, because it was always mixed together—the evacua<lb/>tions looked a very bad colour—I saw blood in them—that was not the last week, but the week before she died—I did not observe any for the last few days.</p>

               <p>minutes to go down to the town—I did not recommend the trades people that came—he had his bread of the same baker as I did—he had no occasion to order that; the only thing he ordered was meat—I do not know the name of his butcher—he used to put the evacuations outside the door—he has said that he removed them from the room, which was very small, to prevent a bad smell; he has made that observation more than once—the evacuations were always standing outside the door until they were removed by me, so that Dr. Julius, Mr. Bird, or any one might see them—there was never any concealment of them that I know of—I always removed them from there—the evacuation that was kept for Dr. Todd I threw away in consequence of its being late; I did that myself, thinking Dr. Todd would not come that night—I had kept it there all day, for Dr. Todd, as I under<lb/>stood—I remember an evacuation that was taken away by Dr. Julius whilst Dr. Smethurst was absent—besides that, Dr. Smethurst himself brought me an evacuation to give to Mr. Bird; he put it in a white gallipot; I do not know whether he covered it up; I gave it to Mr. Bird—I do not remember whether Dr. Smethurst had requested me to keep an evacuation for Mr. Bird—I was just bringing it down, and he said, "Wait; I want to get some of that for Mr. Bird."—Mr. Bird was then in the house—I had gone up to remove it from the landing, and he came down behind me, and said he wanted it for Mr. Bird—I cannot say whether Mr. Bird was then in the parlour or in the bedroom—I was in the habit of making the bed once a a day; it was generally late at night when I made it—I had no servant, and no one to assist me in the whole work of the house—my husband was at home at the time, up to the 30th—I attended to my husband, and waited upon him, and also on Dr. Smethurst—I only made the bed in the sick room—I used to bring up the food to the door—I had the whole work of the house to do without any one to assist me—I first suggested to Dr. Julius about the nurse, the day he took away the evacuation—I think I spoke to Dr. Julius about it first—I never asked Dr. Smethurst to have a nurse.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take any note or particular observa<lb/>tion about it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I never think of looking into my lodgers' places—there were cupboards down stairs, in the parlour—when lodgers come I always leave the keys in the doors, and they may do as they please—they may lock the cupboards or not—when lodgers come sometimes they do lock up things in their cupboards—some are very particular—I never troubled myself about the secretary after I gave the keys to Dr. Smethurst—it was very convenient with reference to the bedroom—it stood by the sick-room, and would have been a very convenient place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember on one occasion Dr. Smethurst bringing you some tapioca, and complaining that Mrs. Smethurst did not like it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first tapioca I made she said, when I was making the bed at night, how very nice it was—Dr. Smethurst had given her that tapioca—Dr. Smethurst did at one time bring me some tapioca, and say that Mrs. Smethurst complained of the taste of it; that was the second cup, the second time it was made—I cannot say whether he asked me to make some fresh, or what became of that tapioca—it was noton the same day that Mrs. Smethurst said she liked it, it was the</p>

               <p>next day; I wondered it should be so, because I made it exactly the same—I generally made it twice a day—I think Dr. Smethurst said it was the bitter<lb/>ness of the medicine that had made it taste bad—Dr. Julius was attending her then—there is a grate in the bedroom; it was open—I do not remember at any time seeing a wine-bottle on the hob, or on the mantelpiece, or any<lb/>where in the room.</p>

To hear of your gradual improvement will be a source of the greatest comfort to me, although I feel most grateful that you have such a tender and kind nurse. To say nothing about the Doctor's commendable patience, his countenance bespeaks amiability of disposition, and he must have the greatest anxiety for your speedy recovery. We must hope that you will be better than ever when this severe indisposition has passed away. The air is so pure and fresh that I hope all is in your favour. I quite enjoyed a sniff of the country, and got home very comfortably. Was quite beset with inquiries respecting you by Mr. and Mrs. Rigge. If there is anything I can make you fancy, let me hear through the Doctor: you shall have it at once. I shall run down and see you when quite agreeable; and rest assured I shall be perfectly silent about everything that concerns you. To-day I am going to purchase a little hat as a present for Rhoda's 'little Bee,' but having no bairns of my own, I am quite a novice in such matters. And now, God bless you, dearest, and with best remembrances to the Doctor, and affectionate love to your dear self, ever your own fond Loo.")

My dear Miss Bankes,—We are in receipt of yours of yesterday's date, for which we are greatly obliged. After your departure dear Bella had a very bad evening and night of it, purely from the excitement of seeing you, and the fatigue consequent thereon. Vomiting and purging set in at a fearful rate, which of course prostrated her greatly. Her doctor therefore at once forbade any visitors for the present, or he would not be responsible for the effects attendant thereon. Last night was a good one, but I am sorry to say to-day has been a trying one. She is now, however, again better, and I am happy to say recovery is really expected by all. I will write again shortly. Dearest Bella sends her kindest love, and with kindest regards, believe me, yours faithfully, T. Smethurst.")

I sincerely hope the dear invalid is better: I am so anxious about her, poor darling. What do you think to Mr. Lane seeing her; it might be managed with ease, and I am sure you would feel pleased to have his opinion, being a very clever and experienced man. Best love to my own darling sister, and kind regards to yourself. Ever sincerely yours, Loo. Excuse great haste.

She has not yet got over the emotion of meeting you, poor dear, and is still looking forward to a very early interview; indeed, she would like to name Monday next for your taking a chop with me," but I think it would be more advisable to say the middle of next week, for the doctors even this morning have pro<lb/>hibited</p>

               <p>everything of a nature which might try her very weak powers, since it would be impossible to bear up against shocks to the nervous system; and on these grounds alone she is ordered to keep her room, in order to treasure up strength. The aspect of affaire is favourable if great care be observed, and we three doctors have every hope of a successful termination. I shall not fail to call for the jelly. I purchased some very beautiful yesterday, and dearest Bell has partaken of two or three glasses of it, and I think with benefit. Dearest Bell says she would rather not see uncle Lane; however, we will talk this matter over at our next meeting. With every kind wish, in which dearest Bell unites, believe me, yours faithfully, T.

Poor thing, she tries her very best to eat it; it is, however, I imagine, too sweet for her taste, especially so now, with constant nausea. Sometimes it is retained on the stomach, at others it is speedily vomited. I obtained some from town, which is not so sweet; but this she puts aside for yours. I very much regret to say she has not once properly rallied since seeing you. Her nervous energy must be very low indeed, or this would not have happened. Still we have every hope of a good recovery. To-day I have insisted on having a consultation with Dr. Todd, of King's College Hospital, the first physician of the day, with her two regular medical attendants, who are also the first doctors in this town. She is still ordered quietude, and all visitors to be excluded for the present; therefore dearest Bella begs of you to wait a little longer than was anticipated before calling here. As soon as I have got Dr. Todd's opinion, I will send you a few lines on the subject. With our united love, believe me, yours faithfully, T. Smethurst. P.S. Dearest Bella always reads your letters before sending. T. S.") On the 29th I received another letter(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "29th April, 1859. My dear Miss Bankes,—We saw Dr. Todd from London last evening, as late as 10 o'clock, in consultation with Dr. Julius, of Richmond, one of dear Bella's daily medical attendants. He not only acquiesces in what is being done, but recommends a perseverance in the treatment, with some slight addition of his own prescribing, and entertains favourable hopes, like the rest of us. The bilious vomitings are entirely arrested, but sickness still prevails to a great extent, with occasionally violent retchings, which almost shake her very life out of her; and the bowels continue to act from 8 to 10 times in the 24 hours, in spite of all we can do. This action is very different from what is usually called diarrhoea, and is the result of impacted bowels and congested liver, which must have existed for a very long period, judging from the amount of filth which has passed. I am sorry to say there is no appetite, and that is the only thing which raises a fear in my mind; for how nutrition is to be obtained equal to the expenditure of loss of strength under the circumstances does, I confess, somewhat puzzle me. Nevertheless, there are still good and improving points in her, which I sincerely hope may be the means of creating a rallying point from which we trust to build our hopes upon. I much regret the state of the case will not yet admit of even your seeing her for the present, since any or the least anxiety only tends to debilitate her nervous system. We both, however, anticipate very shortly seeing you here. Dearest Bella sends her kindest love and best wishes, in which I beg to unite, and believe me, yours ever faithfully, T. Smethurst.") I wrote a letter upon that, and I got this letter from him late on Saturday evening (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "30th April, 1859. My dear Miss Bankes,—In reply to your</p>

               <p>favour of yesterday's date, I am exceedingly sorry to say dear Bella has passed a wretched bad night—passed 15 motions in the 24 hours, and of a very bad description: there is now much blood in the stools, and besides which there is an entire loss of appetite, consequently I have great dread for the result. She read your kind letter, and agrees with me that it would be better that you should be near to us; so that if you will run down as early as convenient, you can then take a room or rooms near at hand. It will indeed be a source of comfort to me to have you with us. I much regret there is no accommodation in this house for you, as we occupy all there is to let, and have not room enough for ourselves. Dearest Bella sends her kindest love, and with every good wish, believe me, yours faithfully, T. Smethurst. P.S. There was no wish on my part to prevent you calling, beyond the consideration for the critical state of dearest Bella, in which her medical attendants perfectly united. She has never rallied once since seeing you, and that alone was the reason for keeping her quiet. T. S.") On the receipt of that letter I did not go down until the Sunday, the following morning—I got down between 2 and 3 o'clock—I saw the prisoner—nothing was said to me about my sister's having made a will that morning—he did not take me up to see her at once—he said she was very ill—I had been to church, and came down after the morning service—I went up a few minutes after I got in—I found her in a very bad state indeed—she recog<lb/>nised me—she held out her hand—she could not speak—I only remained in the bedroom a few minutes—not alone, Dr. Smethurst was there—I then went down stairs—he asked me to come down—I did not go up again for some time after—he did not remain with me while I was down stairs—he went up stairs, leaving me downstairs—he gave no reason for that—he said she was too ill to bear me in the room—I had brought down some soup with me in a jelly, that was when I went up the first time—I gave it to the prisoner—he took two teaspoonfuls from it, put some warm water to it, and took it outside the room to cool it—he said he took it out of the room to cool—he was out of the room with it a minute or two—I could not see him when he was out of the room; I could hear him stirring it round—when he brought it back he gave it to my sister, and she brought it up immediately—I only saw my sister once afterwards that day—I remained with her a very short time indeed the second time; I left her because she was so ill the Doctor said I had better not remain in the room—he took me down stairs, and then he returned to the room—I don't think she took any arrowroot in my presence—nothing else was given in my presence that I remember—I recollect writing some letters there, which I wanted to have posted—I told the prisoner I wanted them posted, and he said I must take them, as he could not send any one out with them—I took them, and returned again—during the day he called my attention to the effect of Dr. Todd's pills; he said that they had made my sister much worse; he described the effect as a burning sensation all over the body—about 11 o'clock I proposed to Dr. Smethurst that I should remain all night with my sister; he said he would rather not; he would wait on her himself—I had taken a room at a cottage near, and an arrangement was made that I should attend at half-past 9 the following morning—the reason he gave for my not coming earlier was, that he should wish to prepare the room before I came—I came at that time on the Monday morning—when I got there, the prisoner came down stairs to meet me; and while I was there Dr. Julius came in—a conversation took place be<lb/>tween the prisoner and Dr. Julius about some fresh medicine—Dr. Smethurst wished to try something else—he wished me to go and fetch it—that was</p>

               <p>in the presence of Dr. Julius—I was to get it from Conduit-street, in Lon<lb/>don—Dr. Julius said he thought he had better send for it; that I had better not go—after Dr. Julius had left, Dr. Smethurst wished me to go and fetch it immediately, and I did so—he gave me a prescription, and I took it to Conduit-street—it was in his handwriting—I took it to Conduit-street, and there had it made up, and brought it back in two or three hours—when I came back I gave the medicine that had been made up to the prisoner; I was going to give it to him—I brought back the paper also—I think I re<lb/>turned it to Dr. Smethurst—when I was going to give the medicine to him, he said he had tried something else—I expressed a wish to see my sister, and he said she was too ill—I was not aware that any communication had been made to a magistrate until a constable came, and then the prisoner went away with the constable, and returned some two or three hours after—when he came back, he said to me, "Dr. Julius has been killing her"—while he was away, or soon after he came back, a nurse was sent by Dr. Julius, and from that time, down to the death of my sister, either I or the nurse attended to her the whole time—during the night I gave her some food—I sat up with her all night—the prisoner was downstairs during the night—he came up once or twice, but the greater part of the night he was belowstairs—he took no further part in administering medicine or food—I gave her a good deal of food during the night: some arrow-root and brandy—I did not make it myself—I gave it her several times—she did not vomit at all on those occasions—I gave her some tea, that was in consequence of her asking for it—she retained that on her stomach—there were no signs of retching when she took either the arrow-root or the tea—the following morning she died, about 11 o'clock—after the prisoner returned from the magistrate's, I asked him to get something out for the nurse, and he said I had taken that respon<lb/>sibility on my own shoulders, and he should pay for nothing, and get out nothing—my sister and myself both had 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was lent out on mort<lb/>gage to a man of the name of Tarte—I had been on very intimate and affec<lb/>tionate terms with my sister the whole of my life—the nature of her health generally was good.</p>

               <p>frequently that when she rode in carriages she was sick, and was in the habit of vomiting; that has been the case when I have been with her—she suffered from a disease of the womb—I was cognizant of that myself—I had ministered to her in that—it was some time ago that she suffered from that; I should think two years from the time of her death—I was not aware that she was in the habit of using injections of nitrate of silver—she was in the habit of using injections; I did not know their nature—I don't know the duration of the disease; I don't know whether it was for a year or more—once she had a Mr. Hoffman, a physician, to attend her; a doctor in Rams gate—I remember a gentleman of the name of Bartlett attending her—she had a bilious attack which produced vomiting—she was only ill one day—that was a mere ordinary attendance for a mere ordinary bilious attack—I think that was two or three years ago—I had seen her two or three times in Rifle-terrace—prior to that I had seen her constantly, up to that time—my father did not die from diarrhoea; he died of a complication of diseases; I never heard it called diarrhoea.</p>

I am a solicitor at Richmond—on Satur<lb/>day, 30th April, the prisoner came to my office, I believe in the afternoon, about 1 or 2 o'clock—he was a perfect stranger to me—he asked me if I could come up the hill, to make a will for a lady; she was too ill to come to the office—I said I would; I would go directly—he said, "No; not to-day, to-morrow"—I said, "Monday, you mean?"—he said, "No; I mean to<lb/>morrow, Sunday"—I told him I had an objection to doing anything on a Sunday; but he said if it was a work of necessity, would I come; and I said I would—it was arranged that he was to fetch me if there was a necessity—he said the will would be very short, and he then produced this paper, which he said was sent to him by a barrister, a friend of his in London—he said that the lady wished to write it out herself, but he thought it better that a professional man should do it—I just looked at it, and handed it back to him—about 9 o'clock the following morning, he came to my private house—he asked me if I could come immediately; at least, he said, "Come about 10 o'clock"—he said the medical men were coming at half-past 10, and he wished it all done before they came—I said I would come—I had asked him that the medical man might be present; but he said there was no occasion for that, as the lady was perfectly right in her mind, and was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting—I went at half-past 10—I was shown into the parlour—the prisoner was there; in fact, he met me at the door, and asked me to walk in; and he then said he thought it better to tell me, before I went upstairs, that, although he and the lady were living as man and wife, they were not married, and he said that was the reason why he did not wish the medical man to be present—he said, as soon as she was better, and her Chancery affairs were settled, they were going to leave Richmond to be pri<lb/>vately married, and return and settle there—after that I went up stairs; he accompanied me—I went into a bedroom over the room where we had this conversation—I found a lady in bed there—he walked into the room before me, and introduced me to her, saying, "My dear, this is the gentleman who has come to make your will"—she did not say anything; she merely bowed—I went towards her, and she handed me this paper from under her pillow; I immediately recognised it as the same paper I had seen the day before—I said, "You wish to make your will, do you not?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Then perhaps you will allow me to read this to you?"—she nodded assent, and I read it through slowly and carefully to her, and I asked her if that was right—she said yes; except that she wished to leave a brooch to a friend, and she said she did not know how I should describe it—Dr. Smethurst, who was standing by, said, "Why, it contains the hair of your late father, does it not my dear?"—she said, "Yes, it does, and set with diamonds and pearls"—I said, "Oh, that is quite sufficient; I will describe it as such"—she men<lb/>tioned the name of the lady she wished it left to—upon that, I went down stairs again with Dr. Smethurst, and prepared this will (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the pri<lb/>soner was talking to me all the while I was writing it, but upon different subjects; about Richmond, and so on—when I had prepared it, I went up stairs again, and read the fair copy of the will all through to the lady—I asked her if it was according to her wishes; she said, quite so—I then asked for another witness; I said two would be necessary—Dr. Smethurst said he would fetch the daughter of the landlady, if that would do—he men<lb/>tioned that she was a young girl—I asked how old she was—he said 17 or 18—I said that would do very well, and he fetched her—before he fetched her, he said, "I suppose you will tell her it is some Chancery paper?"—I said, "No; she must know what it is, that it is a will; and the lady must</p>

               <p>ask her and myself to witness it;" and he said, "Oh, very well"—Susannah Wheatley was then fetched, and she and I witnessed the execution of the will by the deceased—on her entering the room, I told her what she was wanted for—after the will was executed and witnessed, I handed it back to the lady and left it with her—the prisoner and I then went downstairs together—this is the signature of the deceased—that was all I had to do with it.

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, practising at Richmond, and am also a registered surgeon—I have been in practice since 1832—I was called in to see the lady who I now know to be Miss Isabella Bankes on the 3d of April—I found the prisoner there—he stated that she was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting—I put very few questions to her as to her previous state of health—I came late—when I got to my sur<lb/>gery I sent some medicine—all the medicine that I sent from my surgery was made up by my assistant, Mr. Caudle—I went to see her on the following day, and she was not any better; she was still suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea, and the medicine had no effect in arresting it—Dr. Smethurst had given ten drops of laudanum as an injection, and also some castor-oil—that was not the medicine I had sent; I sent chalk mixture, containing catechn, and so on—nothing was said about the probability of her being in the family-way at that time—I saw her on the following day, the 5th, and learnt from the prisoner that things were going on still in the same state; he drew my attention to the vomiting and purging, that she was very bilious, that a very large quantity of bile came away, and said she would not be better until it did come away—I sent medicine containing grey powder and Dover's pow<lb/>der, which is compound ipecacuanha powder; that did not seem to have any effect whatever—he proposed to give her a mixture containing quinine and gentian, dilute sulphuric acid, ether and gentian, and hydrocyanic acid—I said that I did not think that prescription calculated to do good, that it was not quite the right treatment for the case; he said that he was constantly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150109"/>
               <p>there, and would watch it; he gave it with an idea to give her an appetite, and should it disagree he would stop it immediately—I accordingly sent that mixture—hydrocyanic acid is prussic acid—I went again on the 6th, and learnt that she had taken that medicine, but that there had been no ill effect from it whatever, but no good had been derived from it, the vomiting and purging still continued—I saw the motions and the matter vomited, which was of a grass-green colour, and which was shown to me by the prisoner as evidence of her bilious state, but I did not see any yellow bile—there was blood found in the evacuations, not so early as the 6th, but on the 8th; there was nothing particular, about them—I continued to send medi<lb/>cine to her from time to time, and saw her every day up to the time she left those lodgings; the symptoms kept increasing from day to day, the diarrhea as constant, the vomiting still continued, with violent retching and straining, and frothy mucus was brought up off the stomach—there was great hardness of the abdomen, and I perceived that her strength was failing daily—she used to complain of burning heat in the throat and mouth, burning all through the bowels, and she told me that the very act of swallowing made her sick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you made inquiries as to whether she was in the family-way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Early in my attendance, Dr. Smethurst told me that she was poorly, that her usual periods were on her—that was within five or six days of my first attendance on her—I am not certain as to the date—I tried a variety of remedies, but the same effect was always produced by whatever was given; no medicine produced any effect in arresting the disease, the symptoms continued the same after taking everything that she did take—I learned from Dr. Smethurst that during the purgings there was a great deal of straining and a great deal of tenesmus—I cannot say whether he used the term tenesmus; most likely he did—tenesmus is a con<lb/>tinued desire to go, without doing anything—I noticed her mouth, and before the 18th I noticed on her tongue what in common language is called thrush, apthous spots, up to the time she left Old Palace Terrace—Dr. Smethurst was always present when I saw her, with one or two excep<lb/>tions—I got the character of her symptoms from him in her presence—she removed to Alma-villas on the 15th, and I continued to attend her on the 16th and 17th; I found that she was gradually getting weaker; there was no change in the symptoms; they continued precisely the same—about that time Dr. Smethurst wished to give her a mixture containing prussic acid, which I did not precisely approve of, and I told him that it was a remedy of an uncertain character, and to a person in her delicate state, it was hardly advisable to give it; he told me he was accustomed to its use, and he could always test its effect by throwing pieces of bread out which had it dropped on them, and seeing its effect on the sparrows—a mixture was made up in accordance with his wishes, but milder than he had directed, milder than he wished it to be—at this period, the 18th, I had formed an opinion that there was something being administered which had a tendency to keep up the irritation existing in the stomach and bowels—I am not, on reflection, able to account for it in any other way—in consequence of that opinion I requested my partner, Mr. Bird, to visit her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you communicate to him what your opinion was, or did you leave him to form an unbiassed judgment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I left him to form an unbiased opinion—I did not see the lady again until after three days—I next saw her on the 21st or 22d, I think the 22d—I then found her decidedly much worse, much weaker, and looking very ill and reduced—I inquired into the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150110"/>
               <p>symptoms that had been exhibited during the period I was away, from Dr. Smethurst—I learnt from him that the medicines which had been ad<lb/>ministered had been of no use, that the effect of certain remedies which had been given had been excessively violent, producing excessive irritation of the bowels and stomach—I learnt from him that injections were administered—the injections were being administered throughout the illness, so he told me—the symptoms of blood in the motions continued throughout from the 8th of April—there was a proposal on his part to have another medical man—that was before they left the Terrace—he said, did I not wish to see some one else, and asked whether I would like to see Mr. Hills or Dr. Hassell—I said I had no objection to meet any one, but I would rather meet a person from London, as I was the senior practitioner in Richmond, I preferred seeing a person from London—I never heard the lady herself express a desire about having other advice—I continued attending her—I found no difference, except that she was getting weaker from that time—I continued varying the remedies from time to time in conjunction, at the latter part, with Mr. Bird—I was not present at her death—I saw her a few hours before her death—Dr. Todd came down on Thursday, the 28th—he came to me, and I drove him up to Alma-villas—with the further opportunity that I had had of observing the case, I did not at all alter the opinion I had formed—I purposely abstained from communicating my suspicions to Dr. Todd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean the opinion that something was going on counteracting your medicines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not alter that opinion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But I understand you to say you did not communicate that opinion to Dr. Todd? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; I and Dr. Todd saw the lady together, and Dr. Smethurst also—I mentioned her symptoms to Dr. Todd, and what she had taken—after he had examined her I drove him down to the train—he prescribed for her—he expressed to me some opinion about the illness—the medicine he prescribed was sent up on the following morning; she took it at 11 o'clock; it was to be taken every six hours; it was a quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper, and a quarter of a grain of powdered opium, to be made into a pill—I had never prescribed that mixture; I had recommended it, but the prisoner had objected to it; he said he objected to the use of the sulphate of copper, because it had often produced symptoms of poisoning—I learnt from him that she had taken Dr. Todd's medicine; I learnt that on the Saturday; he said it had produced intense burning in the mouth and throat, constant vomiting, and fifteen bloody motions; he said the burning was throughout the whole intestinal canal, throughout the whole of the bowels and intestines; his expression was, "from the mouth to the anus"—in my judgment the medicine could not have produced those effects; I should say decidedly not—from what had passed between myself and Dr. Todd, I took the opportunity of obtain<lb/>ing a portion of an evacuation—I met Dr. Smethurst in the town on Friday 29th, and I went early to Alma-villas, and procured an evacuation that had just passed; that was before 11 o'clock; she had not then taken the pills; it was before she had taken the first copper pill.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because the pills came there when I was in the house; I think it must have been about a quarter to 10 when I went up there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150111"/>
               <p>evacuation; she was then very low and excessively exhausted; and I did not wish to speak much to her—I took the evacuation home, and gave it to Mr. Caudle—I saw her again the same afternoon; I did not see Dr. Smethurst that afternoon; I saw her again on the following morning, Saturday, the 30th; I saw her again on the Sunday and on the Monday; she died on the Tuesday morning—during the whole of the period, the disease was not at all arrested by the medicines that had been administered to her—the symptoms certainly could not have been produced by the medicines I administered—in consequence of what passed between me and Dr. Todd, and what I observed myself, I made a communication to a magistrate on the Sunday, and in consequence of that, the prisoner was taken into custody on the Monday—I appeared before the magistrate and made a statement—before I made any communication to the magistrate I had received an account from Dr. Taylor, in relation to some evacuation that had been seat to him—after death there was a post-mortem examination of the body; I was merely pre<lb/>sent at it—the stomach was sent up to Dr. Taylor; I did not minutely examine it; the examination was conducted by others, not by me—I met the deceased's sister there on the Monday; I was not aware that she had been there before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give any direction at any time that she should not see her sister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never heard the subject alluded to—I never heard of her having made a will—up to the time of her death I had no idea of the nature of the connexion between her and the prisoner; I supposed them to be husband and wife—supposing small doses of some irritant poison had been administered from time to time, I think that would decidedly have accounted for the appearances that were indicated throughout the disease.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>somebody from town—he did not suggest Dr. Todd at that time; I am certain of that—I did not suggest that my partner, Mr. Bird, should attend then—I don't think I suggested it to him until some days later than that—Mr. Bird began to attend on the 18th—I suggested his attendance before that, that he should attend instead of me—there was no arrangement that I should cease to attend—he had not suggested that Dr. Todd should be sent for before I suggested Mr. Bird—I told him Mr. Bird had been a pupil of Dr. Todd's; that was not in consequence of his suggesting Dr. Todd to me—I told him that Mr. Bird had had great experience in diarrhoea, and diseases of that kind—it is a fact that Mr. Bird has had considerable experience, in the Crimea; knowing that, I recommended him to Dr. Smethurst—at that time I had formed an unfavourable opinion that my remedies were counter<lb/>acted; I had at that time formed an unfavourable opinion, as to the possibility of the lady's recovery; I thought her in a very precarious state; I mean on April 18th, there is no mistake about that—I did not communicate my impression to Mr. Bird—I was present when Mr. Bird was examined here on the last occasion—I heard him examined—I did not hear him say that I had communicated to him my unfavourable impression; I certainly had not—Dr. Smethurst suggested Dr. Todd's coming down after this; I think that was on Wednesday, the 27th—he came down on Thursday night, the 28th—I wrote a note to Dr. Todd, and sent it up by my son—I saw Dr. Todd when he came down; it must have been a few minutes before 10 when he came; I met him at the station, I should think about a quarter to 10; that was the time the train was due—I had not communicated to Dr. Smethurst that he was expected by that train—that was not the latest train; there are several later than that; there is one at 12 o'clock—I had not told Dr. Smethurst the time I expected Dr. Todd to call—it was a little before 10 when I went with Dr. Todd to Alma-villas; we went there direct from the station—I simply told Dr. Todd the symptoms from which she was suffering, and the remedies that had been used—I told him that all those symptoms had failed to yield to my remedies—I told him what the remedies were that I had used—I never conveyed to him any further impression than what I have stated—I did not express to him my great surprise that they had failed—I will undertake to say that I never expressed anything more to him than just detailed the symptoms and the medicines I had used—I have not got the note I sent to him—I cannot recall to my recollection Mr. Smethurst saying, that if the patient had been under his responsibility he should have preferred soothing re<lb/>medies; I do not recollect his saying he should have given her a slight occasional emetic, with calomel and opium, and no irritants—nothing of the kind was expressed to me, to my recollection—hydrocyanic acid, or prussic acid, is very frequently used to check sickness; it is used to check vomiting in the early stage of pregnancy; it is a medicine that is very fre<lb/>quently used for that purpose; it is of a very sedative character—I thought, the dose that Dr. Smethurst suggested was a very large dose for a person in the weak state in which she was; it was 2 drops of Scheel's strength, mixed with the ordinary dose of water, of course—I have the prescription here; it is 12 drops of hydrocyanic acid, 2 drachms of carbonate of soda, syrup of orange-peel, and 6 oz. of water; that would be 2 drops to 1 oz. of water—an ounce of water is 2 table-spoonfuls—that was not the dose to be taken, because she had to dissolve a powder in some more water, so that she would perhaps take 3 or 4 table-spoonfuls of water; that would dilute it still more—there were 6 doses in the bottle, to be taken with a powder to make it effervescent—I sent a dose that was one-third less than that; Mr. Caudle</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the case of a woman who becomes pregnant for the first time at 43, is her state likely to be more critical than if she had become pregnant just after maturity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I think not; her confinement would be very much more difficult; I do not think her pregnancy would be more critical—I do not think the age of 43 would make a state of pregnancy more critical or more likely to disturb the system,' than any other age, such as 20 or 25—I state that decidedly as the result of my experience; the confinement would be very critical indeed, but not the period of pregnancy—as a rule the periods stop within a month or six weeks of pregnancy; there are some very rare exceptions where they do not, but they are very rare, I think; in my opinion there is rather less danger of miscarriage in a woman's becoming preg<lb/>nant for the first time at 43, than at 20 or 25, I should say that from my experience; the danger is rather less at an advanced age than in early youth—you may have the usual symptoms of pregnancy—vomiting is a very common Symptom—if I heard that a woman who was pregnant vomited, or felt sensations of sickness when she awoke of a morning, I should consider it was likely to arise from the pregnancy—it would be an exceptional case if sensations of sickness occurred in moving across a room—sickness in moving is a common symptom.</p>

W. Richardson, of St. George's Hospital; I am not aware that I have ever consulted him in difficult mat<lb/>ters; I think I met him on one occasion; I think not more; when he was living at Mortlake, I used to see a good deal of him professionally; I have not had opportunities of seeing him since he has been in London; we have occasionally been engaged in post-mortem examinations together—in the course of the treatment of the deceased lady, laudanum injections were used constantly; that laudanum was obtained from my surgery; Mr. Caudle can tell you better than I how much was supplied; the opium injections were used with my full approval—I am a doctor of medicine; my degree is not</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered surgeon, and am practicing medicine in partnership with Dr. Julius at Richmond—I have been with Dr. Julius between 2 and 3 years—before that I was practising my profes<lb/>sion in the Crimea—I had opportunities there of seeing many cases of bowel complaint and dysentery—I was requested by Dr. Julius to go and see the deceased lady, Miss Bankes, about 18th April—I did so—at the time Dr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150117"/>
               <p>Julius requested me to attend Miss Bankes he did not mention or allude in any way to any suspicions he entertained with respect to her treatment—I saw her on the 18th or 19th—the prisoner was there—I found her labouring under diarrhoea and vomiting—the prisoner did not tell me that he was a medical man, but I gathered it from my conversation with him—he described to me what she had been suffering from, and what treatment Dr. Julius had adopted for her—he gave me his opinion of the cause of her illness; he said that the lady had neglected her bowels for a considerable time, and that now he thought the liver and bowels were unloading themselves by means of the diarrhoea and vomiting—he read notes to me, which he said he had made of her symptoms and the course of her treatment—I at first continued the treatment that Dr. Julius had been adopting previously, which was an effer<lb/>vescing mixture, containing hydrocyanic acid and other medicines—I con<lb/>tinued that about 3 days, and I also recommended that ice should be used, and that she should have enemas of beef-tea—I also coincided with what the prisoner said he had been doing before, which was enemas of small doses of laudanum—this treatment had not the least effect in mitigating the symptoms under which she was labouring—the prisoner was always there when I visited her—I noticed the evacuations during the time I attended—at first the evacuations that were shown to me presented no remarkable appearance, but afterwards they contained blood and considerable quantities of mucus—the mucus was stained with blood, and there were also shreds—some of the motions I saw consisted almost entirely of mucus stained with blood—there was no foecal matter at all—the prisoner reported to me what he said was the effect of the treatment I recommended; he said that the effervescing mixture did not seem to check the vomiting, that the beef tea enema seemed rather to increase the diarrhoea, and that the ice also did not check the vomiting—I have been present when she has vomited; there was a very great deal of straining—finding these remedies ineffectual, after a few days, I suggested bismuth—I did not suggest acetate of lead before that—I spoke to the prisoner about it—he said that Dr. Julius had suggested that before, and that he (the prisoner) had thought it was not a likely medicine to do good; however, I over persuaded him, and the medicine was pre<lb/>scribed and sent; it was in doses of 5 or 6 grains, I forget which—(<hi rend="italic">Mr. Caudle here referred to the book, and stated that it was 7 grains."</hi>)—the acetate of lead was afterwards prepared by me, combined with opium at first—I suggested that it should be combined with opium—the prisoner remarked that he thought it would act equally well without the opium; but he at last coincided with me that it would be better to give opium with it, and it was given with opium—the nitrate of silver was given on my suggestion—the prisoner informed me, which I found to be the case by my own observation, that the opium which I had combined with the acetate of lead, had had rather too much effect upon the patient, and accordingly, we decided at first that the opium should be omitted from the prescription, but, upon fur there consultation, we decided that nitrate of silver should be given instead without opium, and it was sent out without opium—I heard from the prisoner that it had been given—he said it had produced a very hurtful effect upon the patient; he said it had caused violent burning pain throughout the whole of the intestinal canal, and that the diarrhoea had been increased, and the motions had contained more blood—in my opinion the nitrate of silver was decidedly not calculated to produce the symptoms that he described—it was given in the form of pills—it was discontinued in consequence of that state<lb/>ment of the prisoner—the quantity given was a 1/4 of a grain in one pill</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How was that done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I went into the deceased's room with the prisoner, and we together handed the bottles and pill-boxes to McIntyre, who stood outside the door—at this time the nurse, Chetwood, was in attendance upon the deceased; whilst she was there I gave the deceased some arrow root mixed with brandy, also beef-tea mixed with brandy, and I saw some given her by the nurse; I think I gave it myself at least three times, and I must have seen the nurse give it two or three times more, at short intervals—I gave her a whole teacupful myself at one time; that was retained on the stomach, all of it—the prisoner had been away from the house about four hours before he returned with me—the deceased did vomit during that day; the prisoner informed me that she had vomited in the morning, before my visit—I did not see her vomit after the giving of the arrow root and brandy, but I was informed by the nurse that she did vomit—on the following morning I was sent for suddenly to go up to the house—I found the deceased sinking—there was no vomiting or diarrhoea at that time: she was perfectly conscious, though evidently dying—I was up and down stairs, talking to Miss Bankes, and coming up again every minute or two to the patient, and at the time she expired I was below.</p>

               <p>regularly to the symptoms, to the vomitings, and to the evacuations? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did; and I saw them regularly from day to day—I have mentioned three vessels containing evacuations sent for analysis; they were all three ulti<lb/>mately sent to Dr. Taylor—that was on Saturday, April 30—the bottle No. 2 was the one given to me by the prisoner on the Saturday, and No. 3 was given subsequently, at the time of my visit on the Monday—the prisoner gave me both No. 2 and No. 3—I directed the administration of acetate of lead, nitrate of silver, and bismuth—the acetate of lead was the first; there was one grain of it in each pill; Mr. Caudle, I think, made up four pills; I will not be certain; it was either three or four, I think—the prisoner informed me that two were taken, if I remember right—the next thing was the nitrate of silver; there was a quarter of a grain in each pill—I think four were sent; I think she only took one of those, but I am not quite sure about it—I can't say how many were sent; Mr. Caudle will be able to state that—there was no bismuth pill; it was a mixture; either five or six grains for a dose; that can be told by referring to the book—I directed it to be taken every four hours, I think for three or four days, I can't say exactly—when I first went to the deceased I continued the mixture that she was then taking, which Dr. Julius had left her taking—that mixture contained hydro<lb/>cianic acid—I continued that from the 18th to the 22d—I do not know what quantity of sulphate of copper was administered; I don't know that Mr. Caudle had the opportunity of knowing that—the bismuth and other drugs were purchased of Hearon, McCulloch and Squires; I really cannot say where they reside; I leave that to Mr. Caudle—I was present at the first part of the post mortem examination; I took no part in it; I was merely present when the brain was opened, and then I was compelled to go away—Mr. Smethurst particularly requested that I would attend the con<lb/>sultation with Dr. Todd; I believe he said, because I had been in the more immediate and direct attendance upon Mrs. Smethurst while she was at Alma-villas—I did not attend, because I had another engagement; he begged of me to attend; and if it had not been for that engagement I should have attended according to his request—I arrived at the opinion that death was caused by some irritant poison partly from my own observation, and partly from the symptoms, the nature of which Dr. Smethurst described to me from day to day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Julius, and have been so for about a year and a half—I had studied medicine before entering upon my employment with Dr. Julius—I made up the whole of the medicines sent from Dr. Julius's surgery for Miss Bankes—the first I made up was an ordinary chalk mixture, on 3d April, consisting of prepared chalk, aromatic confection, tincture of catechu, and compound tincture of camphor—the following day there were three pills of grey powder and compound ipecacuanha powder; I put two grains of the grey powder into each pill; they were to be repeated every four hours, one to be taken at a time—on 5th April, by Dr. Julius's direction, I made up a quinine mixture; that consisted of eight grains of quinine, a sufficient quantity of dilute sul<lb/>phuric acid to dissolve the quinine, two drachms of chloric ether, and infusion</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150122"/>
               <p>of gentian to make up six ounces; there were also fifteen drops of dilute hydrocyanic acid—the next medicine sent was a few more of the pills similar to those on 4th April; four of them, I think, or six—there was also a draught containing powdered rhubarb, tincture of cardamums, and magnesia—on the 7th of April the quinine mixture was repeated the same as before—on the 9th the same mixture was sent again—on the 12th six more of the grey-powder pills were sent, the same as those sent on the 4th of April; "the pills as before" was directed to be put on the box; I do not know how many were to be taken; it was one every 4 hours—on the 14th of April I made up another bottle of the quinine mixture as before—on the 17th another bottle of quinine mixture as before—on the 18th I had to make up a prescription with 12 drops of prussic acid of Scheel's strength; Scheel's acid is stronger than the ordinary Pharmacopoeia acid; I had not Scheel's acid in the surgery at the time, and instead of the 12 drops of Scheel's, I used the Pharmacopoeia acid, 4 drops in each dose, instead of 2 drops of Scheel's; that would be 24 drops in the mixture, instead of 12; my reason for that was, partly because we had none of Scheel's; I could have got Scheel's with a very little trouble; but the 4 drops of the Pharmacopoeia acid was not quite so strong as Scheel's would be, and I thought 2 drops a very large dose, and was rather nervous at giving it; I thought it rather safer to give under the dose than over it; Dr. Julius was not at home at the time, and I wished to send it at once, and I thought it the safest thing to do; the rest of the prescription I made up precisely as Dr. Julius had prescribed it; there were 6 powders to go with it to cause effervescence, to take with each dose of the mixture; those powders were citric acid, simply to cause effervescence—on the 22d of April Mr. Bird prescribed for Miss Bankes; the first pre<lb/>scription of Mr. Bird's that I made up contained bismuth, carbonate of soda, hydrocyanic acid, and water, and, I think, a small quantity of the solu<lb/>tion of acetate of morphia (<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>); there were 7 grains of bismuth for a dose, 42 grains in the mixture; it was a 6-oz. bottle; the sixth part was to be taken at a time; there were 20 drops of the Pharmacopoeia dilute hydrocyanic acid, 20 drops of the acetate of morphia, 2 drachms of carbonate of soda, 2 drachms of gum-powder, containing bismuth in solution, and water; that mixture was to be taken 3 times a-day—on the 24th that mixture was repeated—on the 25th I made up 8 pills of acetate of lead and powdered opium; the dose in each pill was 1 grain of acetate of lead, and half a grain of powdered opium; one pill to be taken every 6 hours—on the next day, Tuesday, the 26th, I made up 4 pills of nitrate of silver; there was a quarter of a grain of nitrate of silver in each pill; the prisoner saw me make them up, and saw me weigh the nitrate of silver; he appeared to be very particular how I did it, unnecessarily so; I used great caution, and mixed them very well, and he requested me to do it more, with my hand; I asked him whether Mrs. Smethurst was better or no, and he said no, he thought she was in a very critical state; that was on Tuesday; at that time he also obtained some laudanum from me; he gave me a bottle that had had laudanum in it before; as nearly as I can remember, I filled it—I did not see Dr. Todd when he came on the 28th—on the next morning I made up some sulphate of copper pills; I sent 4; I beg your pardon, I sent 6 sulphate of copper pills; there was a quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper in each pill, and a quarter of a grain of powdered opium; one pill was to be taken 3 times a-day, about every 4 hours—on that same day there was some tincture of catechu sent, 4 ounces, and another quantity of laudanum; they were sent separately; I suppose they were sent for injections—on the morn<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>of the 29th, Dr. Julius brought to the surgery a bottle, apparently contain<lb/>ing an evacuation; it was a 6-oz. bottle; it was not marked then; subsequently it was marked No. 1; I put that bottle in a cupboard, locked it, and kept the key in my own possession—on the following day, Mr. Bird brought a tumbler containing part of an evacuation; he gave it to me, and I put it in a bottle; I was very careful in the selection of the bottle, in the first place, and very careful to wash it as well; it had contained simply liquorice-water before I put the evacuation into it; I took the liquorice out, and washed the bottle, and then poured the evacuation into it from the tumbler; that bottle, and the one I had received from Dr. Julius, were then labelled; Mr. Bird was present; he wrote the labels, and I put them on; Dr. Julius's bottle was labelled No. 1, and Mr. Bird's No. 2; and I sealed them with Mr. Bird's seal, in his presence; it is a Turkish seal, with his name on it, I believe, in Turkish letters; when they were sealed, they were placed in a small basket, and given to young Mr. Julius, with directions to take it to Mr. Buzzard—On Monday, 2d May, I called on Mrs. Chetwood, the nurse, and took her to Alma-villas; I called at the surgery with her in a cab on the way, and took with me some medicine that had been made up; some hydrate of magnesia; that is an antidote to arsenic: I believe that was ordered by Dr. Taylor; if I remember rightly, Dr. Buzzard said so; I left that with Mrs. Chetwood at Alma-villas, with instructions how to use it—after the 29th of April, either Dr. Julius or Mr. Bird were always present when I made up the prescrip<lb/>tions; I must except the hydrate of magnesia; Dr. Buzzard was present on that occasion; I helped Dr. Buzzard to make it—we have two preparations of arsenic in our surgery; they are Donovan's solution and Fowler's solution; they are kept in a cupboard by themselves entirely, with other poisons, in a cupboard apart from other drugs—we have also antimony in the surgery, in the form of tartarized antimony, what is called tartar emetic, and antimonial wine; the tartarized antimony is placed on a shelf in a small bottle, with a small row of bottles of a peculiar shape, on a very high shelf; it is a row of bottles quite different from any other bottles in the surgery, and very small.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In any one of the prescriptions which you made up, and which were sent to Miss Banker's house, was there any arsenic, or antimony, or bi-chloride of mercury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most certainly not—after the death of Miss Bankes I gave some specimens of the bismuth, the sulphate of copper, the nitrate of silver, and the acetate of lead to Inspector McIntyre—they were taken from the same stop-bottles of those drugs from which the medicines had been taken that were administered to Miss Bankes—a boy named Wil<lb/>liam Marchant took out the chief of the medicines from the surgery; an<lb/>other boy took a note, I believe, and I think one bottle of medicine; I am not quite sure; I delivered one or two myself in the early part of the illness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the College of Surgeons—I reside at 41, Great Marlborough-street—on Saturday, April 30, on my return home, I found two bottles on my hall table, labelled No. 1 and No. 2, and sealed with Mr. Bird's seal, which I knew well—I sent those two bottles by Hughes, my servant, to Dr. Conway Evans—on the following day (Sunday) the same two bottles were brought back to me from Dr. Evans with the seals unbroken; the bottles could not have been opened without opening the seals—on the Sunday morning I took those bottles myself to Dr. Alfred Taylor—after some hesitation, Dr. Taylor agreed to examine the contents of those bottles—the bottle labelled No. 2 was opened at that time in my presence, and about two teaspoonsful of the contents were poured out for analysis—(No. 1 was not opened at that time)—I then replaced the glass stopper, and took the bottles back to my house and locked them up—I then went down to Richmond, and saw Dr. Julius and Mr. Bird—I received a letter from Dr. Julius directed to Dr. Taylor; I delivered that letter, and the two bottles which I had locked up, to Dr. Taylor on the Sunday night—on the Monday I was at Dr. Julius's surgery, and prepared the hydrate of magnesia at Dr. Taylor's suggestion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Assistant-surgeon and Lecturer at Charing-Cross hospital—I have been in practice about eleven years—I made the post mortem examination of the body of Miss Bankes, about nine o'clock in the morning of 4th May, twenty-two hours after death—I performed the examination; I was assisted by Mr. Palmer, of Mortlake—the back part of the body externally was of a dark purple, on account of being full of blood, from the position in which the body lay; I gathered from that that the blood was fluid, more fluid I should say than usual; the arms were perfectly flexible; the legs were very rigid; the feet were a good deal bent downwards and turned in, and the muscles at the bottoms of the feet were hard; that would indicate that there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150125"/>
               <p>may have been some cramp or spasm in the lower extremities of the body; the abdomen was drawn in; and the muscles were also tense and hard; the tongue was rough; and the papillae, the little rough eminences, were more elevated than usual—I saw no signs that I could put down as apthous—the face was much emaciated, and of a dull clay or earthy colour; and the lower lip was drawn in under the upper teeth; the front of the body generally was of this dull earthy colour—I examined the head; the result of my examination of it was that the brain was perfectly healthy, and that there was nothing whatever to remark except that there was the same engorgement backwards, on account of the position of the body, from her lying down, the fluid blood naturally gravitates towards the back—there was nothing at all about the lungs wrong; they were healthy; but there was the same engorgement at the back or lower part—I hardly examined the liver care<lb/>fully at that time; I did not cut into it; I examined it afterwards, but I saw at that time that the liver was firm and full-sized, rather large—I examined the <hi rend="italic">uterus;</hi> I found the common signs of pregnancy, and there was a foetus with a deciduous membrane a vascular fold attached; I believe it was somewhere between the fifth and seventh week; it is not a very easy thing to determine accurately; I think I could determine accurately within those limits; it was somewhere between the fifth and seventh week—the heart and great vessels connected with the heart were perfectly healthy; there was, perhaps, a little more serum than usual in the bag of the heart, the pericardium, as it is called, but nothing to amount to a morbid or diseased appearance—I examined the liver subsequently; it was slightly fatty, rather fatty, the remainder hard; the liver when it becomes fatty is usually soft, but in this instance it was hard, and it was coloured in the usual manner, speckled—the oesophagus, or gullet, was healthy; I saw no signs of inflammation upon it—the outside of the stomach, the smaller end, that nearer the intestine, was red; the larger end, that near where the gullet enters, was of a dark colour; in the center it was pale—upon subsequently examining the inside of the stomach the narrow part or small end was also red; at the larger end was a large black patch from effused blood; near the small end of the stomach the mucous membrane was congested, that is at the other end from the black spot and near where the red part was—the contents of the stomach were a brown mucus mixed with blood and some bile, I should say—there were no ulcers in the stomach, and no perforation, nor appearance of acute inflammation—I have some short notes of my observation of the intestines made for my own guidance—on the outside of the intestine I noted on 4th May, that was at the first examination, that the commencement of the intestine was very red; the small intestines generally were inflated and minutely injected with blood, and in certain spots they were roughened by lymph, the result of inflamma<lb/>tion, and glued together at certain turns where this lymph or glutinous inflammation was effused; they were coherent together from that cause; that did not apply to the entire length of the intestines, only to a few parts, and chiefly quite the lower parts; those are the external symptoms—internally, the first part of the intestine, technically called the <hi rend="italic">duodenum,</hi> was inflamed for about three inches from its commencement, but the mucous membrane was quite firm, and there was no ulceration—from that point the rest of the mucous membrane was only slightly injected, not inflamed—in the next intestine, the <hi rend="italic">jejunum,</hi> the mucous membrane was still firm—in places the vessels were injected with it's own blood, showing the branch<lb/>ing way in which the vessels run remarkably plainly, but this only in spots—then I go to the <hi rend="italic">ilium,</hi> or lower part of the intestines—there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150126"/>
               <p>much the same appearance at the commencement as in the last, except that on approaching the lower part the injections increased very much, and at last, about three feet from its end, the mucous membrane was greatly altered; there was a deposit of lymph therein, and a thickening of the membrane; an ill-organized granular lymph; the membrane at the same time was roughened, and the glands, which are in the intestine there, were less visible than usual—this deposit of lymph did not begin in the glands, but went over the whole surface of the intestine, and concealed the glands instead of rendering them more prominent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And may I take it that severe dysentery would produce the inflamma<lb/>matory symptoms that have been described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I judge so from my read<lb/>ing, acute dysentery not being a disease which we are familiar with in this country; it is very rare—I have had but little experience in obstetric medicine; it is not a branch to which I have given my attention.</p>

               <p>at night; I then proceeded to examine her in the presence of Dr. Julius and Dr. Smethurst—I felt her abdomen—my attention was attracted by the re<lb/>markable hardness and rigidity of the muscles of the abdomen, and there was a very peculiar expression of countenance, a peculiar terrified look, as if she was under some influence of fear or terror, which did not look to me like the effect of ordinary disease—the condition of the abdominal muscles sug<lb/>gested to me the presence of some great irritation within the abdomen—I cannot charge my recollection with ever having observed the same aspect of countenance in any case of acute abdominal disease that I have ever witnessed.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is not bilious matter green? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Bile is not green; bile, when it passes into the stomach and is acted upon by the acid of the stomach, becomes green; if it was then vomited it would be green; that explains the green colour of the vomit—it would not be the green colour of the vomit alone that would direct my attention to antimony; the green colour shows great intensity of vomiting; it shows that bile is carried into the stomach; and when by a sort of inverted action, it shows that a large portion of the bowel below the stomach is involved in the effort of vomiting; it shows that the vomiting is an intense vomiting—what I mean to say is that antimony would produce intense vomiting—I have taken that into con<lb/>sideration in the opinion I have expressed; it is one of the elements upon which I formed my opinion; as far as the green vomiting goes, I explain it in that way—I have no experience of a case of violent vomiting in the early pregnancy of a woman between 40 and 45, which has only been checked by procuring the abortion of the foetus—I don't know that I was here when that was stated by Dr. Julius—I do not say it could not happen—by "experience" I mean my own personal experience, and my general know<lb/>ledge and reading.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>not prepared to say that it could not happen—Dr. Julius did not mention a word to me about irritant poison—he told me that this diarrhoea and vomiting had failed to yield to any of the medicines he had applied; and he stated to me that Dr. Smethurst was very impatient of the continuance of remedies, and that after each change of remedy the symptoms became worse—when I first formed my opinion, I stated that I had formed it not only from what I had observed in the bedroom of the dying woman, but also that I had been amply informed as to the case by Dr. Julius, as to the symptoms—it was then that I stated that, without a full examination of the intestines, I should not like to deliver a positive opinion—it was upon my seeing the patient and hearing the description Dr. Julius had given of the symptoms, that I at once formed a strong suspicion of the existence of irritant poison—I think I said arsenic, or some other irritant; I think those were my words—I cannot undertake to swear that my exact words were, "I said that I had a strong suspicion that this was a case of arsenical poisoning."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the College of Physicians, and am physician of Queen Charlotte's Lying-in-Hospital, assistant-physician to the Children's Hospital, and am a physician accou<lb/>cheur—in the course of my practice I have seen cases of acute dysentery; it is nearly eighteen years ago; about six or eight cases then came under my notice—they were of an epidemic character, in Lower Chelsea; I think in 1847 I also saw two cases in the same neighbourhood—I am not certain whether they were epidemic; I only knew of the two cases—I have heard the evidence given here of the symptoms of disease under which this lady laboured, and also of the appearances which her body presented after death; I have also heard the remedies that were administered—taking all those circumstances into consideration, I do not think she died from acute dysentery—I should think that she died from having taken some irritant medicine; from the effect of irritant medicines.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever in your practice been acquainted with instances of very violent and severe vomiting and very violent and severe purging and diarrhoea in an early stage of pregnancy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in the early stage—it is a complication generally at the later period of pregnancy; I mean the diarrhoea—I have certainly been acquainted with it in an early stage—I don't think that advanced age has anything to with it—the condition of a woman between 40 and 45 years of age, pregnant for the first time, is not more critical in the early stage—I have known instances of violent vomiting in the early stages of preg<lb/>nancy; not of violent diarrhoea; there are such cases recorded, certainly—I don't remember any of so severe a character as to endanger life; I do not know of any case in which the life of the mother has been saved under such circumstances by procuring abortion; not within the first three months of pregnancy; rather later, between the sixth and seventh month it is more common, I should say—I do not remember having read of an instance within three months; I would not pretend to say it was impossible, but improbable—I was present on the former occasion; I had been called upon to give evidence before that—I made a post mortem examination of the cases of dysentery that I have spoken of, assisted by the apothecary of the dispensary, in each of the six cases—I have no notes of the two last—I believe the six cases arose from an epidemic—that was in 1841; that was not the cholera year; the cholera years were 1832 and 1848—they were not cases at all in the nature of cholera; no symptoms like cholera; severe dysentery simply—they were accompanied by vomiting and violent retching—violent retching is a frequent symptom in the early stage of pregnancy, but it is not an unfavourable symptom, the patient is not at all the worse for it afterwards; on the contrary, it is rather looked upon by accoucheurs as a good symptom—I have not known, in my own practice, of cases of violent vomiting which was unable to be stopped; I have heard of such cases—violent vomiting would then become unfavourable, but as an ordinary symptom I do not consider it at all unfavourable—I do not remember ever to have heard of a case of violent vomiting without diarrhoea within the first three months of pregnancy, in which, to save the life of the mother, abortion has been procured—I do not know Dr. Barker, of Bedford.</p>

               <p>between the present case, and the six cases in which you made the post mortem examinations? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was not the same amount of sloughing in those cases, that there was in the post mortem appearances described by Dr. Wilks; I mean of the <hi rend="italic">coecum;</hi> there was not the same amount of destruc<lb/>tion of the mucous membrane; the glands were in a different condition; in the dysentery cases, the glands were entirely destroyed, quite obliterated; and, in three of the cases, there was perforation of the intestine—the symp<lb/>toms in those six cases were different from the symptoms of the case I have heard described to-day—there was no burning sensation of the throat in those cases.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the College of Physicians—I am the author of different medical works; amongst others, "The Dictionary of Practical Medicine"—I was in Africa in 1817, and at that time had an opportunity of observing a good many cases of dysentery, generally acute dysentery; I may add that I had opportunities of seeing a good deal of dysentery, in 1815 and 1816, on, the Continent, after the peace, where in<lb/>spections were frequent in the French and German hospitals; I saw them merely as a spectator—I witnessed several post mortem examinations—I have been for many years practising as a physician in this country—I have been present during this trial, and have heard the symptoms under which Miss Bankes is said to have laboured; I have heard described the different remedies which were from time to time administered; and I have paid attention to the evidence with regard to the post mortem appearances—viewing all the evidence, in my opinion her death is not referable to acute dysentery—in my opinion, the symptoms during life, and the appearances after death, are referable to the exhibition of irritant poisons, either by the mouth, or by injection, given at intervals, or in small quantities, frequently exhibited.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever made the post-mortem examination of any animal body, human or otherwise, that has been killed by slow arsenical poisoning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not; I may mention that I have seen within the last few years several cases of slow poisoning by arsenic to which I have been called in; arsenic taken by mistake, or prescribed, and its use ex<lb/>tended beyond the proper time; but in only one case, that I know of, has the case terminated fatally, and in that case arsenic was given by an iodate of arsenic—the gentleman who called me in in consultation inspected the body; I was to have been present, but was prevented from being present; he fur<lb/>nished me with the particulars of the examination—in the last three or four months I have seen, I think, two cases of poisoning by arsenic; one was from accident or mistake, and the other was from continuing arsenic for too long a period; they produced very severe symptoms of vomiting and purging; those two cases recovered—they produced burning pain in the oesophagus, down the gullet into the stomach; the stomach was obviously inflamed to a certain extent at the time, but whether the parts would exhibit appearances of in<lb/>flammation afterwards, is a different matter—in a case of slow arsenical poisoning I should look for inflammation of the oesophagus, but I should not be disappointed in not finding it—I might expect to find traces of the poison in some parts of the tissues—I might expect to find it in the liver, certainly, and in other tissues; but if there was, as there would be, constant vomiting and purging, I should consider a considerable portion of the poison would be eliminated from the system—purging and vomiting do accompany slow irri<lb/>tant poison, if the poison be frequently exhibited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would you not expect to find in the tissues of a body traces of the actual arsenic, of the metal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have never made the examination.</p>

               <p>expect to find traces of the metal in the tissues, more especially in the liver, but I should scarcely expect to find much where there is much sickness, vomiting, and purging; because when a mucous surface is in a state of in<lb/>flammatory action you have active discharge from the surface, and the other vital function of absorption scarcely takes place—absorption ✗n scarcely take place from a surface from which there is a constant discharge—vomiting and purging are not invariably the constant and continued attendants of slow arsenical poisoning; they are the general attendants—the poison may be exhibited in such a manner as to produce very little vomiting, although it may afterwards produce a great deal of purging—I have paid very little attention to midwifery diseases; I do not practice in that way—I am inti<lb/>mately acquainted with Dr. Herbert Barker, of Bedford; he was a pupil; he attended my lectures at the Middlesex Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> With regard to the inflammation that you would expect to find, supposing arsenic was taken through the throat, would it depend at all upon the mode in which it was taken and what it was mixed with. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, to a certain extent at least; if no arsenic or antimony was found, but some small quantity in an evacuation, I should still entertain the opinion that the death was occasioned by an irritant poison, and, of course, the poison that is detected after death is the most likely to produce it; but poison may be exhibited not only alone, it may be combined, and combined with other substances which may mask their detec<lb/>tion—I am unable to give a decided opinion whether that would be the case if antimony or arsenic, or both, were given as different times or at the same time—I have no experience on that subject.

I am Professor of Chemistry at Guy's Hospital, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and a Fellow of the Royal Society—I have had long experience in enquiries of this nature—on Sunday, 1st May, Mr. Buzzard first called on me, about one o'clock, at my private residence—he brought a parcel wrapped up in paper—he told me it contained two bottles, and I ascertained that to be so—the cork of one of the bottles, No. 2, was sealed with a Turkish seal—in consequence of a com<lb/>munication made to me by Mr. Buzzard, I consented to test the contents of No. 1—I made no selection—he opened the parcel—I said, "I will test one, I shall not test both; I think one will answer the purpose of both"—he opened the parcel, and took out the first bottle that came—No. 2 was then opened, and a portion of the contents measured out, two drachms—I first tested my apparatus—I applied a process to see whether there was arsenic—my apparatus consisted of copper wire, hydro chloric acid, or muriatic acid, as it is called, of distilled water, and an ordinary test tube—I tested my materials, as also the vessels I used, and ascertained they were perfectly clean—I then used the same tube, the same acid, the same water, and having repeated the experiment with the liquid in No. 2, I found that a metallic deposit of a greyish steel colour had become attached to the wire—that deposit indicated the presence of either arsenic or</p>

               <p>time; bismuth, antimony, and mercury are all detected by it; it is the only process known to chemists, that will at once enable them to give an opinion upon the probability of any one of these four metals being present, antimony, arsenic, bismuth, and mercury—I examined the organic matter of No. 2, by the microscope, and found it consisted of fibrous matter, fecu<lb/>lent matter, such as one sees in watery evacuations; apparently food changed more or less, and mixed with bile and blood; it also contained mucus—I did not perceive any indication of pus—I noticed nothing very remarkable in those organic contents, except this, that I came immediately to the conclusion, from the discovery of arsenic in the blood, that it was such an evacuation as a person labouring under that form of poisoning would probably pass—I advised immediately the use of the antidote for arsenic; the hydrate of magnesia—I examined the contents of No. 1 next morning, and found no arsenic, no metallic matter at all; the contents of it were simply biliary matter, foecal matter with mucus—there was no blood, merely feculent matter with mucus, and no metallic compound; no metallic matter at all; it was of a greenish yellow colour, rather of altered bile, biliary matter and mucus, feculent matter—I ought to mention that it had also a smell rather of feculent matter—on Thursday, 5th May, I received a large jar from McIntyre sealed up, which was found afterwards to contain a portion of the viscera, the stomach unopened, the spleen, the large and small intestines, the liver, part on the oesophagus or gullet, and the uterus or womb—and on 7th May I received other viscera; I received a bottle containing the two kidneys, and a small bottle containing blood said to have been taken from the heart—I received a number of medicine bottles from Mclntyre; I can hardly tell the number separately; I labelled both the bottles, packages, parcels, pill-boxes, and a great number of other articles; I numbered them all; they are in the hands of Mclntyre, I believe—the highest of my numbers was 26 at that date; I afterwards received others, making a total of 28; then there were others that followed on 14th May, which I numbered 29, 30, &amp;c.; those are chiefly specimens of the medicines supplied from the surgery of Dr. Julius—I examined the contents of all those twenty-eight bottles or packages—omitting No. 5, and No. 21; I found nothing that it is at all necessary you should be acquainted with; I examined them with reference to arsenic—I did not examine them before—I examined the bottles containing the viscera—I first examined the uterus, I did not analyse it, but examined it; and I concur in all that Mr. Barwell has said respect<lb/>ing it—it was in an impregnated state; I agree with what Mr. Barwell says, between the fifth and seventh week, as nearly as I could judge—I next examined the oesophagus or gullet; there was only a portion of it sent, about one third of its length; that was injected on the mucous surface slightly, which indicated some cause of irritation of the throat—there was no arsenic or antimony in the gullet—I next analysed the stomach, and found none there—the appearances have been already described—I concur in them; it contained a yellowish liquid, coloured with blood—on analysis I found antimony in the small intestines in two distinct places; the middle portion of the small intestines contained the largest quantity, the other part was above and below; some was found both above that and below that, and some was found in the coecum—altogether the quantity was very small that was found in the body—I found some in one kidney, and there were traces in the blood of the heart, and traces of antimony in the blood from the jar; the drainings of the jar—the other kidney was not examined—there was none in the liver or in the spleen—I was assisted by Dr. Odling in the analysis, and we calculated that the whole quantity did not exceed probably</p>

               <p>from a quarter to half a grain—I also observed that the coecum was ulcerated, and its lining membrane nearly destroyed throughout—the colon was also ulcerated; the large intestines were ulcerated more or less through<lb/>out, four feet of them, and in parts of them there were dark patches where blood had been effused, and patches of inflammation in the rectum, or rather of irritation—the most remarkable appearance was the almost entire destruction of the lining membrane; there was no perforation in any part of the intestines—I tested the contents of the stomach; the only remarkable point I can state is that there was blood and biliary, matter in the contents—the appearances were such as were described by Mr. Barwell yesterday—my judgment and knowledge suggested that some great cause of irritation was the cause of the blood in the stomach—there was no appearance of disease in the other organs at all to account for death; that is the spleen and liver, I observed nothing about them to account for symptoms or death—I next proceeded to examine the contents of certain pill-boxes, which I received on 7th May from Mclntyre—I found that they were what they were represented to be, and contained, one mercury, another silver, another copper; they were not all labelled, but the account I had of the prescriptions corresponded with the contents—of the pills containing metallic medicine there were four of the sulphate of copper; one was taken for analysis—by copper pills I mean pills containing a quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper, with a portion of powdered opium corresponding with what was prescribed by Dr. Todd—I found nothing but what corresponded to the labels or prescriptions—I examined besides an Indian rubber enema bottle and a glass syringe—I found in the wadding of the glass syringe, which I removed, traces of some white metal; it was neither mercury, bismuth, or silver, but what I cannot say; it was a mere trace of white metal—I then examined the large number of bottles and packets of powders which Mclntyre had delivered to me—there were two bottles of the bismuth; it looked to me as if an ounce or an ounce and a half had been removed from one; the other was unopened, and quite full; in the other bottles I found prussic acid, quinine, and sulphuric acid; that corresponded with the prescriptions—I examined also some sugar and tapioca, and matters of that sort, brought to me by the constable: I found nothing at all suspicious in them. Bottle No. 5 was among the articles delivered to me by Mclntyre, the inspector; it was unlabelled, and contained, I found on examination, 355 grains of chlorate of potass; I examined that, and found it was free from anything; it was what I found it to be—in the first instance I had to determine its nature by analysis; there was nothing to guide me to it—it is not muriate of potass; nothing of the sort; that is a detonating salt, an explosive compound, used instead of saltpetre in making explosive mixtures—that bottle has been broken since it has been in my possession; it is broken in two—bottle No. 21, about which an error arose, purported to be a bottle like the other medicine bottles with a label that I could recognise by the handwriting, corresponding to a quinine mixture; it contained about one half of a clear watery liquid, of a saline taste—I handed an ounce and a half of it to my assistant to boil for testing by Reinsch's process, as I had done with the other 20 bottles—I had not at that time Dr. Odling's assistance in applying that test—what I did with the bottle was this: on the 13th, I think, of May, in proceeding to the analysis, I found that, in using the test that had served my purpose throughout the whole of this investigation, that the copper was destroyed, entirely destroyed, and was dissolved; that seemed rather a remarkable circumstance; at any rate, it had never occurred to me in my experience</p>

               <p>before; and thinking, from the appearance of the copper when first put in, that there was something like arsenic about it, I plunged a portion of copper gauze into it for a very short time; removed the copper gauze, examined it, and obtained crystals of arsenic; that was in an ounce and a half of it, about one half the quantity—I then put this bottle aside, and went on with the other analyses, thinking there was something remarkable about it, and wishing to have the assistance of another chemist in the matter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did that lead you to suppose that there was arsenic in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did; Dr. Odling assisted me in a further examination, and we both came to that conclusion; it turned out ultimately that there was none—there was no arsenic or antimony in the fluid; the arsenic was found, by subsequent research, to come from the copper gauze we had used.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you examined in this case before the Magistrate and the Coroner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I think twice before the Magistrate and once before the Coroner—I have spoken of finding traces of arsenic in the evacuation No. 2; it was altogether less than a quarter of a grain—I have stated that it was about the hundredth part of a grain from the two teaspoonsful, and there were 17 teaspoonsful; 34 altogether in the bottle; and if the amount were the same throughout it would be about seventeen-hundredths of a grain, that would be the proportion of one-sixth part of a grain; I always reckoned it so; I think you will find in my deposition before the Magistrate that I stated it—I used the copper gauze that is here—I have got in my laboratory copper gauze, copper foil, and copper wire—this was a portion of the same copper gauze that I afterwards used with bottle 21—in every experiment I tested the copper to see whether it contained arsenic by boiling it, as I have explained to his Lord<lb/>ship—the copper was used in every other vessel, and observe, there was no change until the suspected liquid was added; that is, until the evacuation was added—from the copper I used in my experiment on bottle No. 21 I actually deposited, myself, arsenic in the liquid that remained; and the reason was this, it was the only bottle of the whole number which con<lb/>tained chlorate of potass, and it was the chlorate of potass which destroyed the action of the test—Dr. Odling assisted me; he made an independent experiment himself on the mixture, and came to the same conclusion that arsenic was present in bottle No. 21 in the liquid we were analysing: in that respect he was wrong, as I was wrong—besides Reinsch's test I applied March's teal to bottle 21, that is, to a portion of the same liquid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150143"/>
               <p>that I was examining, and which contained the chlorate of potass; I did not know fully then, when I was making this examination, that the chlorate of potass was present; I had to find that out—we found, ulti<lb/>mately, that we had deposited arsenic, but our belief at the time was that the arsenic was in the liquid—I stated that belief most positively, both to the Coroner and to the Magistrate—I made the discovery on the afternoon of the 20th—on the morning of the 21st I went down, and having commu<lb/>nicated the matter to my friend, Mr. Serjeant Ballantine, he thought that it was such an important subject that it ought not to be for one moment concealed—I did solemnly, on my oath, before the Magistrate, and before the Coroner, state, more than once, that I had discovered arsenic in the bottle, and it was my belief at the time that it was there—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not your words before the Magistrate, "Understand, Sir; I tested all my tests before I made this discovery of arsenic"—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is, we tested them in the usual way in which they are tested for the application of this process—I have used the copper gauze for fourteen years, and I never found a trace of arsenic in it until this—I have given evidence before on the faith of this copper gauze, and shall do so again; but I shall take care not to put chlo<lb/>rate of potass in my liquid—I have made in this case seventy-seven analyses—arsenic was found, only in one; and if there were any strength in your remark, arsenic would be found in every one—I first gave evidence about this on the 21st of May, I think; I think it was the 21st of May; either the 21st or 20th; I think it was the 20th—I have a note of the day on which I attended; it was on Friday, May 20th (<hi rend="italic">The deposition being put in and read, contained Dr. Taylor's statement that he found arsenic in the bottle.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you delivered that evidence before the Magistrate and Coroner you firmly believed, did you not, that you had made a correct analysis of this bottle, and had discovered arsenic in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—and I firmly believed that that arsenic had been placed there at that time, not by my tests, but by somebody else—that did not enter as an element into my judgment—I intended by the term "the analysis," the discovery of antimony in the body—I did not include that, when I used the expression, "and from the analysis I have made"—I excluded it, in so far as this, that I told the Magistrate and Coroner that the symptoms were more referable to antimony than to arsenic—I am not sure whether that is in my deposition, but that is what I said, whether it is in the deposition or not. (<hi rend="italic">The other depositions were put in and read. In the deposition of 20th May it appeared that the witness stated, "I can only account for death by supposing it to be the result of antimony and arsenic administered in small doses at intervals.</hi>") I have to state that I had not made the analysis at the time of the deposition which has just been read; therefore, I could give no opinion of the cause of death—at the time I gave that evidence, the result of it was this, that if this 6-oz. bottle had been full of the mixture that I analyzed, in each ounce there would have been a grain of arsenic, which would certainly have been a very serious mixture to administer to any one situated as the deceased was—the bottle I had was only partly full—I formed no judgment about the administration of this liquid to the deceased at all—we fully and finally came to the conclusion that it was the copper which had deposited the arsenic somewhere about the 7th June—I made my original analysis, in which this mistake was made, from half of the contents which had remained in the bottle—Dr. Odling took a portion afterwards to make his independent examina<lb/>tion—we then sealed the bottle, and resolved to do nothing more with it—we did not receive special directions to analyze the remainder; we advised</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150144"/>
               <p>it ourselves, considering the circumstances—the subsequent analysis was made in conjunction with Professor Brande; we asked him to be present—Professor Brande, Dr. Odling and myself were together—Professor Brande used Marsh's test—Reinsch's process was also used; no other, we had so little liquid to operate upon; there were only two or three teaspoonsful to operate upon; three teaspoonsful altogether—one teaspoonful was sub<lb/>jected to one test, and two to the other; one to Reinsch's, two to Marsh's—we then agreed that there was a mistake in the original analysis—my copper was tested before that; that led to the necessity of testing the contents of the bottle—by being tested. I mean entirely destroying the copper—we destroyed it with chlorate of potass, and also with nitric acid—the acid of the human stomach would have no effect at all in dissolving copper—I do not think it would—it might, to a limited extent, dissolve copper: to a very limited extent—it would be difficult to suppose that any quantity should be dissolved, because copper is not dissolved by acid except under the free access of air, which cannot get into the body—it might have a limited, or a very limited effect—my tests have been contested; they have been disputed sometimes; at least, they have been examined into—I never re<lb/>member an occasion when I conscientiously believed my tests were correct, and they were found not to be correct upon further examination—I have no recollection of an instance of that kind occurring with Professor Rodgers—I never analyzed powders for the purpose of discovering arsenic with that gentleman; but I remember, eleven years ago, I had to give an opinion about his analysis here: I do not remember analyzing; I do not remember an instance in which my tests were objected to, I myself believing them to be correct, and afterwards finding that I was wrong; nothing of that sort, most certainly—I speak of chlorate of potass as a diuretic, and capable of carrying off the arsenic in the urine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing no foreign agent of that kind to be used in cases of slow poisoning by arsenic or antimony, would you not expect to find traces or deposits in small quantities, more or less, of antimony or arsenic, in the tissues of the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That would depend upon several circumstances—in cases of slow arsenical poisoning, I look, as a general rule, for arsenic in the tissues, and expect to find it—I communicated, by a paper to Mr. Penrhyn, that I had found arsenic in the evacuation; but not to Mr. Buzzard, that I know of—this was while the lady was living, and I judged it was passing from her body—I wrote a letter, I think it was to Dr. Julius or to Mr. Penrhyn—supposing there is no disturbing influence, we expect, as a general rule, in cases of slow arsenical poisoning, to find the actual metal in the tissues—the question was put to me, as to whether chlorate of potass would have any particular effect, and I said it would act as a diuretic, and carry off the arsenic or any mineral matter that might have been administered—before I analyzed this bottle, I had never had any actual experience of the effects of chlorate of potass in carrying off any mineral poison—when I found the chlorate of potass, I did not form this as a theory in my own mind to account for the absence of arsenic in the body, that it had been carried off by means of this diuretic; there are other causes which might lead to that in this particular case; that is not one; it did not enter into my consideration beyond this, that it acts generally as a diuretic; and the question put to me by Mr. Serjeant Ballantine was with regard to mineral matter, or foreign matter, not arsenic—(if you look at the depositions; you will see) whether it had not the property of carrying off foreign or metallic matter from the body—that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150145"/>
               <p>the question—I was called in, in the case of Mr. Wooler, who was tried at Durham, for the murder of his wife in 1855, by slow poisoning—I went down by order of the Government—I made myself master of all the details of that case—there was no question there that the poison had been administered; the only question was, by whom—arsenic was discovered in the tissues of that lady's body, and in the liver—it was found in all parts of the body, more or less—I had to examine the liver and intestines—the total quantity I found was a grain—Dr. Richardson, of Durham, found half a grain, and she had taken the poison for seven weeks—I found a grain in the liver and intestines, taken together; that allows for calculation for the whole—there might have been more in the rest of the body, but I cannot say that—that was the whole I found—the liver is the great criterion; it is the great seat of deposition—I did not examine the stomach; it was examined by Dr. Richardson of Durham—I did not see it at all, and know nothing of the state of it from my own knowledge—I heard the evidence of some other gentleman about it (<hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">considered that evidence as to this could not be given, not being within the witness's own knowledge</hi>)—As a result of slow arsenical poisoning the stomach might present this appearance, that all the groups of vessels might be gorged with blood, that might be so great as to be almost universal, I mean congestion of the vessels of the stomach—it was so in this case—there might be effused blood under the mucous membrane—there would be a great effusion, undoubtedly—in irritant poisoning there is generally effusion of blood—pustular eruption of the skin is sometimes the result of poisoning by arsenic, but it is not very common—inflammation of the conjunctiva, or lining membrane of the eye, is a frequent consequence of slow arsenical poisoning—it existed in Mrs. Wooller's case—I did not see her living; I only know it as a fact that I heard at the trial—I can state as a matter of science that it is so—inflammation of the conjunctiva is a frequent result of slow poisoning by arsenic—there is an eruption known to science called the <hi rend="italic">eczema arsenicale;</hi> it has received its name because of its appear<lb/>ance on the skin in the case of slow arsenical poisoning—excoriation of the anus is a symptom in slow arsenical poisoning—great redness of the nostrils, and even ulceration, would be a symptom of slow arsenical poisoning—some<lb/>times the mouth and the lips are excoriated—when the arsenical eruption takes place, it appears on the arms, and sometimes on the free and neck—the arms and hands are the parts generally affected—a hacking cough is a frequent attendant upon slow arsenical poisoning, where there is irritation in the throat,—a mucous discharge any way is always increased by the action of arsenic—I am not acquainted at all with instances of dysentery; I only know about it as a matter of general medical knowledge—I never attended any cases of dysentery—I do not practice or visit patients—my avocations are chiefly in regard to legal medicine—in antimonial poisoning a clammy sweating is chiefly observed where there are not discharges in other directions; where there is not diarrhoea—I have myself stated that that is what I look to as a consequence of antimonial poisoning—suppos<lb/>ing the discharge takes place more from the bowels, then there is less from the skin; if the bowels are constipated, then these perspirations occur; still that is a symptom—if the bowels are constipated there will be a clammy skin; but if there is diarrhoea and vomiting, then the fluids pass out in that direction, and I should not expect it—in all cases of antimonial poisoning there is not invariably vomiting; it depends upon the dose—in antimonial poisoning I have recorded instances where there was no vomiting: one instance; but as a rule I expect it from the administration of doses of antimony—I also expect purging generally as a consequence—I believe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150146"/>
               <p>that a cold clamminess of the skin would exist, but not a feverish state of the skin—the administration of small doses of antimony would have a tendency to enlarge the liver, and to cause a deposit of fat, and sometimes to soften it; the chief thing is the deposit of fat—small doses of antimony have been found to cause enlargement of the liver and also to cause a deposit of fat on it, and also sometimes to render it brittle—this liver was firm, decidedly—according to my experience, slow poisoning by antimony has not a tendency to soften the liver, but cases are recorded in which it has softened the liver; I believe it depends more upon the amount of fat deposited—I have stated in a book that I have written on this question of antimony, before this case, about a deposit of fat being a consequence of it, and in a remarkable way, that at Strasbourgh they actually give sulphate of antimony in their food to fatten their livers—it has a tendency to soften the liver, to deposit the fat; I stated that in my book in the case of the poisoning of Ann Palmer; in the Guy's Hospital Reports there is a full account of that case.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly Professor of Chemistry to the Royal Institution, and have been engaged in the practice of chemistry for fifty years—I was required to examine a portion of the liquid that had been in the hands of Dr. Taylor, with a view to ascertain whether, in reality, there was any arsenic in it—I examined a portion of it by Reinsch's test, and a portion by Marsh's test, and the conclusion I arrived at was that there was no arsenic—I have heard of the liquid composed of chlorate of potass; it turns out that that has the effect of dissolving copper—when matters do not contain any substance that does not actually dissolve the copper, Reinsch's test is in all cases an admirable one; in my opinion and judgment it was properly applied to test the intestines and evacuations; and in my opinion the result obtained was a correct one, one upon which I would act.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment is it possible for a person to be poisoned by slow arsenical poisoning without arsenic being afterwards found in the tissues? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In my judgment it is quite impossible—it would make no difference whether the arsenic was introduced by the mouth or by any other means, or whether it was introduced in combination with any other substance—I have made experiments upon the subject and have my notes; the first experiment commenced on 20th May, this year, with regard to arsenic—in the first instance my experiments were made without any reference to the prisoner or any communication with him or his friends, but as a matter of science, after reading Dr. Taylor's account in the newspaper—I made them in conjunction with Dr. Webb, and I may add, that every experiment I made he has witnessed, and the majority also in conjunction with Dr. Thudichum—I took a large dog, and made a mixture of arsenic and chlorate of potassa; I gave it daily, arsenious acid and chlorate of potassa; I gave the chlorate in such excess as to insure a diuretic action—I gave it 16 days, giving small doses each day of the two, three times daily, with food, I gave 18 grains of arsenic; the full amount of 18 grains of arsenious acid and 365 of the chlorate of potass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much did you give each time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About one-third of a grain for a dose, as near as possible, from one-third to one-fourth, and with a scruple of the potassa upon an average, but it varied a little; when the animal was ill it would not take its food; sometimes it refused its food, and then I had to vary the dose a little; I then killed the animal and made a post mortem and chemical analysis in conjunction with Dr. Thudichum and Dr. Webb—I found arsenic in the liver, in the lungs, in the heart, a trace in the spleen and in the kidneys, but by far the greater part in the liver. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is what you would have expected to find if you went on feeding it and giving it arsenic, and then killed it sud<lb/>denly and made the examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a question whether chlorate would eliminate it; that was what I was aiming at; that was the chief object of the experiment, to show that chlorate of potassa does not elimi<lb/>nate it, that is the whole value of that special experiment chemically; I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150151"/>
               <p>would add that there was intense inflammation in the stomach of that dog, and in the lower part of the alimentary canal intense ulceration; the ali<lb/>mentary canal of a dog generally resembles the human—arsenious acid is what is ordinarily called arsenic; it is the white arsenic—I administered arsenic, the metal—when they talk of a grain of arsenic, they do not mean a grain of the metal, they mean a grain of white arsenious acid—I cannot say how much arsenic I found altogether, but there was abundant evidence of very fine mirrors of arsenic on glass—I will not venture to say that I found half a grain, or a grain; I could not venture to give that kind of evidence at all which was not determined absolutely by the balance—I did not take it for the purpose of making a quantitative analysis at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Give me leave to say the value of the experiment is nothing if you give a dog arsenic day by day for 16 days, and then it is killed, and some arsenic is found left in it; is that all it proves? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was done to prove whether after arsenic had been given in small quantities with an over<lb/>whelming portion of chlorate of potassa, the chlorate would eliminate the arsenic as fast as it was introduced—I left twelve hours between the interval of the last dose and the destruction of the dog, which was purged and was sick in the meantime—I did not examine the motions, I did the urine, and found arsenic in it—I think I could really venture to say that I found one-fourth of a grain in the body, but, with your Lordship's permission, I would rather put it in this way; that if in the case of supposed death from arsenic I found as much arsenic as I found in the tissues of that animal, I should have no doubt about connecting the case with arsenical poisoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> All that the experiment proves is, that chlorate of potassa does not eliminate the whole of the arsenic, because it eliminated all but half a grain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But if there had been no chlorate of potassa given, as I shall show by a future experiment, the result would have been the same; the chlorate made no difference—I had given 18 grains in 16 days, and there was some arsenic left, but what I cannot say, in the tissues I examined—I examined a limited portion of the body; I think I could from that say that there was in the whole body half a grain, but what I meant was the amount of arsenic that came before me—I could not form any opinion how much was left in the whole animal; there were no data to guide me to such an opinion, not even whether there was a grain or half a grain; my attention was at that time directed to a supposed discovery of a mixture of chlorate of potass and arsenic in this case; I afterwards took two other dogs, and placed them under the same conditions, I mean living in the same way and fed with the same food, in the same way and gave the same quantity of arsenic, one had anti<lb/>mony and one had arsenic on alternate days; one with, and one without chlorate of potass, that animal died in eleven days; it had two and a quarter grains of antimony; I gave it three doses a day; that would be little less than one-third of a grain in each dose; the other dog was started at the same time, June 15th; it was commenced with the same day and continued in the same way, with alternate doses of arsenic and antimony—that third of a grain applies both to arsenic and antimony; this dog had chlorate of potassa besides; it had three grains with each dose—it died the morning after the other, on the twelfth day from the commencement of the experiment—the object of these experiments was to compare the effect of having the chlorate of potassa and the not having it, and it made no difference, either as regards symptoms, pathology, or the chemical result—I collected the urine of the dog that was taking no chlorate of potass, and found arsenic in that also, as well as in the other, during the time.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As a matter of medical science and reading, would you expect to find those two symptoms, sweating and pustular eruption? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They have been very commonly noticed in cases of this kind—I can only speak of the effects of antimony on the liver from experiments I made in 1856-7; it was a series of experiments that I performed on animals—there are really no data upon which to form a judgment of the effect of antimony on the human liver—it has been found softened—there is nothing of this sort recorded in any medical book that the profession at large can refer to; the evidence is exceedingly scanty—there have been so few cases of chronic antimonial poisoning carefully recorded—the liver is very imperfectly noticed in the best case of the kind, that is McMullen's case—there is a reference to it in Dr. Taylor's book—I hope I am quite understanding the questions; I am speaking only of chronic cases, where the antimony has been given over a long time; the case in question is what I should call a chronic case—in a case of slow antimonial poisoning I should expect an effect on the lungs, congestion possibly, from the great fluidity of the blood, which exists always in antimonial poisoning—I have no experience of that fact in the human subject, only on animals—if antimony were exhibited in small doses, I should expect to find it on analysis in the liver; that is from experiments on animals, and from experi<lb/>ments that have been made on the human subject, from what I have read, and from experiments—I heard Dr. Taylor examined—the liver is the great depot both for arsenic and antimony—I have not had very much experience of dysentery—I have seen a few cases; I can scarcely recollect how many; perhaps two or three in this country—I have suffered from it myself—the word dysentery is of very general import or construction; it is used very loosely—I should prefer to take Dr. Abercrombie's definition of it; he being the greatest writer on the subject, both of the acute forms and the chronic—my description of it would be a disease marked by purging, the matters thrown off by the bowels being tinged with blood, or mucus, or bile, not always the same in each case, but ordinarily, and marked definitely, occa<lb/>sionally or always, with blood, sometimes with shreds of membrane, taking on a form of dysentery, which I believe has been called, by the German school, diptheretic dysentery, more recently; attended not unfre<lb/>quently with vomiting, intense thirst in proportion to the purging and vomiting; in fact, in proportion to the loss of fluid sustained by the body; and attended with great prostration and sinking—fatal cases of dysentery</p>

               <p>are by no means uncommon in this country, if we take the mass of cases—the dysentery I have described, if carried to an extreme extent, would have the effect of injecting the coecum, and effusing it with black patches—I have never in my own experience met with a case of dysentery in the early stage of pregnancy—I have seen diarrhoea and vomiting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having heard the description of the liver, as examined after death, in your judgment would Isabella Bankes have been a likely subject for dysen<lb/>tery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so; dysentery sometimes comes on of its own accord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You tell me that, having heard the description of her liver, you think she would be a probable subject of dysentery; I ask you whether, having heard that she was liable to nausea and frequent sickness, that would confirm or alter your view that she was a favourable subject for dysentery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So far, that it would point out that she was a favourable subject for disease of the liver—I mentioned that I had seen one case of diarrhea in early pregnancy—I know, apart from my own experience, that diarrhoea and sickness are met with in pregnancy—persons in the family-way are subject to diarrhoea as well as other people—I have met with one instance of diarrhoea arid vomiting as a consequence of pregnancy, arising from it—that was between the third and fourth month—I never met with it between the fifth and seventh week—the sickness and vomiting of pregnancy ordinarily increases, then decreases, and sometimes increases again—the earlier stages are those in which it is the most violent ordinarily—sickness is sometimes the very first indication of pregnancy—if a person were subject to bilious attacks I should consider them predisposed to irritation of the mucous membrane from any cause—I have analysed the ordinary drug, trisnitrate of bismuth, which is the form of bismuth usually administered in medicine, and every specimen of bismuth in London that I have examined contained arsenic—I have not made a quantitative analysis—as a matter of medical science, I am aware that arsenic is generally found in bismuth; the quantity varies very materially—the largest quantity that I am acquainted with is very nearly half a grain to the ounce; there are 480 grains in an ounce—I examined but one specimen myself, but I saw ten—the specimen that I examined came from Squire and McCulloch's—I have a patient to whom I have given bismuth as a medicine—I analysed the urine of that patient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much did you give? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Five grains of bismuth three times a day, from Tuesday morning till Sunday night, six days; that would be 90 grains—the urine passed on the seventh morning was subjected to analysis—I did it with Dr. Thudichum and Dr. Webb, and found arsenic—I could not give the quantity; it was a distinct evidence, a good metallic mirror in the tube, but I would not say that there was the fiftieth part of a grain represented—the medicine was commenced on July 26th this year (<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>), and continued to Sunday, the 31st, but I did not put the termination—it was for dyspepsia, a form of disease I frequently give bismuth for.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it tried for this case? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He being under bismuth I collected the urine; I did not find bismuth as well as arsenic—I used all the urine: and it would not have been chemically very easy to discover it—to work for the two is not so easy—I did not work to ascertain whether bismuth and arsenic passed—I did not doubt whether I should find both in the evacuation; it is quite impossible to say, because I never tried—I began the experiments on the dogs on the 26th May—it was a philosophical inquiry of mine, entirely; to ascertain whether the chlorate would pass off the arsenic—I had read the report of the examination before the Magistrate—I had read Dr. Taylor's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150154"/>
               <p>evidence carefully through, and then I got a dog to try it—the experiments on the other dogs were a continuation—I did not communicate the result of those experiments to Dr. Smethurst or to anybody—Mr. Humphreys, the solicitor for the defence, called on me and asked me, not in reference to the experiments, but as a scientific man, some particulars, without knowing I had been antimonising the dogs or giving the arsenic—it was not done so that it might come round to Mr. Humphreys' ears—I had communicated it to two or three of my fellow lecturers at the Grosvenor School; that is what was called St. George's School in Palmer's trial—it is the school established by Mr. Lane; and in order to distinguish it from the hospital, it is called the Grosvenor School—Mr. Lane has nothing to do with it now—I have not the slightest knowledge how it was that Mr. Humphreys called on me—I was not quite surprised—the experiments I made in 1856 were likewise to dis<lb/>cover arsenic; they were not for the purpose of Palmer's trial; they were both before and after the trial—I did not mention them in that case at all—I was a witness in that case—I did not come to prove that the death was caused by angina pectoris; I gave evidence about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In that case the imputation being, death by strychnine, you came to prove that it was angina pectoris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That it might be angina pectoris; I did not say that it was—I gave a case that was caused by it, and which was analogous to the man Cook's case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you not asked "Are the symptoms described in the evidence more like the symptoms of angina pectoris," and was not your answer, "Speaking scientifically, I should say that the person suffering under them was more likely to be labouring under angina pectoris." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot answer whether those were my words or not; it is not the effect of them, not if the case was put correctly—I in no way endorsed the theory of angina pectoris—I gave it on the trial of Palmer, who, it was said, poisoned a person by strychnia, but I gave no negative opinion about strychnia, it was affirmative all through that it was analogous to Cook's case, and that Cook's symptoms might be taken for what I had seen—I gave the opinion from a case of my own, that the death of Cook might be from angina pectoris—I did not say that the symptoms were more likely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say they were more like it than death by poisoning?—did not this pass: "Do I understand you to say that, in your opinion, it was a case of angina pectoris?" "I do; it accords with all the descriptions of angina pectoris by the best authorities." And did you not then quote La<lb/>tham, Watson, Bolleau, Sir Everard Holme, and Ridge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Latham I quoted; that is, Latham on diseases of the heart, in 2 vols; but I quoted more than are there—the weight of what I said rested on a case that I had seen—my opinion was founded on experiments mainly, and on the best authorities—I do not dispute, in point of fact, that I went to support the theory of angina pectoris—I have not given evidence in other criminal cases; only before coroners' juries, not on trials for murder—I have given evidence eight or nine times before coroners; I cannot recall it at the moment; I have been neither on the part of prosecution or of the accused; they were cases where an accident had occurred, and I had seen the patient before or after death; there has been no prosecution—I have not been a scientific witness in any case except Palmer's; I was consulted on one criminal case, and gave an opinion, but was not called—on the 26th I got a large dog; I gave him 18 grains of arsenic in 16 days; I do not know how much came out, but a con<lb/>siderable quantity would be eliminated; the dog was kept tied up, or he would not have stayed; the arsenic was put in his food as long as he would take it; the fact is, he was made to take it, because if he did not he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150155"/>
               <p>left without it; he took it very well—he took it in milk very frequently—the chlorate of potassa was made into a solution with the arsenic—he did not take the arsenic in milk, and the chlorate of potassa sometimes in milk and sometimes in something else—I mixed the two together first, in a solution, and it was put into milk sometimes, and sometimes it was mixed with chopped meat—I dissolved the chlorate of potassa by putting it into water, and to make sure of dissolution of the arsenious acid, I boiled it, and let it cool—I looked at the urine—the arsenic would go off by means of the chlorate of potassa—I did not examine the urine in either experiment, to ascertain the amount of arsenic eliminated—no part of my chemical analysis was quanti<lb/>tative—I did not once very nearly poison a patient myself with antimony—it was not a patient of mine, nor a friend's patient—it was many years ago—I think it was in 1848—I saw the case with a medical man—the patient did not die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am alluding to a case in which you gave 15 minims to a stout, active, well built man, who asked you to prescribe, and to be careful (<hi rend="italic">reading from the Lancet</hi>) "There was no mistake in the dose; the dose was taken, and from its result I lost caste with the patient for some time. I admit that the re<lb/>sults were severe, and such as no medical man would expect from such a dose. There was no purging, but abdominal pain and griping." Is that your description? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I beg pardon; you are referring to another case—I am not prepared at this moment to say how much actual antimony there would be in the sixteenth of a grain; it would be from the one-eighth to the one-sixteenth of a grain; from the one-twelfth to the one-sixteenth of tartar emetic—all these serious results were produced on a fine healthy subject—it surprised me exceedingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose after that you would not like to pledge yourself for the operation of antimony on the human subject; to give any opinion of the results to be produced? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As a general thing I could—this was a stout active man; if it was a woman, who was not prepared to receive it, it would make no difference—frequently feeble persons bear it very well—sometimes it causes purging, and sometimes, in eases of antimonial poisoning, it causes costiveness—there are not sufficient cases to prove that it more frequently causes purging—it causes sickness and heat in the throat—it would depend entirely upon the general history of the case; but if immediately after taking medicine, heat is felt from the mouth, through the body, to the anus, through the whole intestinal canal, that would be in accordance with a large dose of copper—that would also be caused by other substances; but arsenic, immediately after taking, does not produce pain, nor does antimony immediately afterwards, not as it is taken—I do not think a sulphate of copper pill, with a quarter of a grain in it, would produce a burning sensa<lb/>tion from the mouth to the anus—I have never prescribed it—any irritant poison given for a long time would produce that effect unquestionably—if a person had been kept under the influence of irritant poison two or three weeks, and a further dose of irritant poison was given, the effect would con<lb/>tinue—if the irritant poison had been administered from time to time, in small doses, for three or four weeks, and a larger dose than usual was ad<lb/>ministered, it would produce purging, and it might produce a burning sen<lb/>sation through the whole intestinal canal—I would not say it would do that always—supposing a person to be suffering from violent irritation, however caused, of the intestines, there are medicines that could be properly given, that would produce such an effect—I believe the whole class of metallic medicines would produce that effect.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have already told me that the quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper pill would not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> But I am assuming a healthy person—I did say that in a healthy person the effect would not be immediate, but would only be the result of a continuation; but that was with regard to arsenic and antimony—I agree that arsenic and antimony, given for a long time, would produce those symptoms to which I have referred—I would not say that the symptoms would not be brought on at once by arsenic or antimony admi<lb/>nistered for the first time—arsenic would produce it, especially as compared with antimony—I have never in my experience met with or heard of a case in which antimony and arsenic were used, each of them occasionally, on the human subject—the tests applied to the discovery of poison are not confined to cases where there has been only one poison used, but the majority of cases would be those in which only one poison was used—almost all the cases in which medical men have experience, are cases of one poison only—when I speak of dysentery, I do not speak of the Eastern form, not of tropical dysentery, but of the disease of this country—I have been speaking to you of what is known in medical science as acute dysentery—acute dysentery and Eastern dysentery are not necessarily terms used for the same disease—acute dysentery does not mean the dysentery of hot climates—there is a form of disease which in some districts differs from the dysentery of hot climates—I have never seen a body opened which died of any form of dysentery—the dysentery I speak of may occur in this country, either from a specific poison, or from disease of the intestines—I have never met with a form of dysentery which I supposed to be epidemic, or arising from the taking in of a poison—the form of dysentery which I should think a lady, with a liver like Miss Bankes, would be subject to, would be the form of sub acute dysentery; not dysentery arising from poison, but which is prolonged over a very considerable period—I do not mean chronic dysentery, but sub acute dysentery; some<lb/>thing between acute and chronic, but too severe to be strictly chronic—that would not harden the coats of the stomach—it would produce a great deal of mischief in the bowels—it would not thicken them, but it would lead probably to a deposit of false membrane—it would not harden them, but a false membrane would—if there was very great congestion, the wall would be thicker.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">cross-examination continued</hi>). If con<lb/>siderable rigidity of muscle is found upon a person after death, it indicates natural post mortem rigidity—I should not attribute it to any spasm during life, I should not think that—supposing the hands and the feet were inverted and rigid, it would be consistent with natural or other causes—it is not the re<lb/>sult of spasm during life—spasm attends dysentery, and also cases of poison, slow or otherwise—I made antimonial experiments in 1856—this was not with a view of being a witness in relation to some antimony matters in Palmer's I trial—I was not to be a witness either in Cook's case or Palmer's wife's case—the appearance of the lady, in this case, indicated that she was a likely subject to dysentery—the liver was hard and large—I assume that it was indurated and speckled—a healthy liver ought not to be speckled—a liver in health is never speckled, the fat on the liver forms a basis of my opinion that there had been a chronic disease of the liver—I do not think I antimony would cause that—my experiments upon dogs teach me that it would not; not experiments on the human subject—I was an aceoucheur, but ceased to practice as such in 1854—I am of opinion that sickness, accompanied with dysenteric diarrhoea, in the early stage of pregnancy might</p>

I was a professor of chemistry for 17 years, at the Old St. George's School of Medicine, which I resigned on my appointment to Known College—I am a registered Doctor of Medicine—I am not now properly engaged—I left the St. George's School about two years ago—I was examined as a witness on Palmer's trial—I am acquainted, by</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150158"/>
               <p>my reading, with the effects of slow poisoning by arsenic upon the human body—I know a drug or chemical mineral called chlorate of potass—I am constantly called upon by Coroners to make chemical analyses of the contents of human bodies—I think I have the greater number of cases in London—chlorate of potass is in itself a perfectly innocent salt—I do not think that, supposing small doses of arsenic or of antimony were administered to the human subject, either in chlorate of potass, or chlorate of potass cotem<lb/>poraneously administered, the action of the chlorate of potass would have the slightest effect in eliminating the poison from the system; if it did so, you would have no poison—if chlorate of potass was removing poison from the system as it was given, the poison would not have time to act as such; and consequently, it would be a kind of antidote; it would be administering poison with an antidote at the same time; that is, if it would eliminate it, but I do not think it would—I have made experiments—I have given chlorate of potass with both antimony, and antimony and arsenic, and arsenic alone, and I have found just the same amount of poison in the animals as though there had been no such mixture given as chlorate of potass—I believe that chlorate of potass is a perfectly harmless agent—it is largely prescribed by many practitioners, and used as a wash for sweetening the mouth—if arsenic or antimony were given in small doses to a human patient for a period extending over four or five weeks, I should, as a matter of chemical science, or as a matter of general science, medical or chemical, expect to find arsenic in the tissues, and antimony also, particularly in the liver; the liver is the great criterion—in a case of alleged arsenical or antimonial poisoning, the absence of the poison from the liver would cause me to doubt whether the allegation was correct—I should expect to find either arsenic or anti<lb/>mony under such circumstances in the kidneys and in the spleen as well; their absence would be a strong element in favour of that opinion—if I found poison in the blood, I should expect to find it in the tissues and everywhere; but if I found it in the liver, I should not necessarily expect to find it in sufficient quantities to determine its presence in the blood; it might be in the blood, but not in sufficient percentage, if I may so say—I do not believe it is possible to find traces of antimony in the blood without also finding it deposited in the liver—the blood in the heart must be regarded as a sample of the whole 28 lbs. or so that is circulating in the system: if you find it there in one small portion, you must find it wherever blood flows—in a case of alleged slow metallic poisoning, the absence of the poison from the tissues would raise the greatest doubt as to poison being the cause of death—my experience has been confined rather to chemical than medical researches—I have some medical knowledge, but I have not devoted myself to medical science or the pathology of diseases—I am a surgeon and apothecary—I have practised medicine—my specialty is toxi<lb/>cology and chemistry, not pathology—I am acquainted with the fact that the bismuth generally exhibited contains arsenic—I have in my pocket a quantity obtained from about six doses (<hi rend="italic">producing some</hi>)—by another analysis I found upwards of half a grain in an ounce of bismuth—an ounce is 480 grains—I think Marsh's test for discovering arsenic in bismuth is not a correct one to have used, for I have failed to find it by that process, when I have found it by another of my own—I heard Dr. Taylor state that he used Marsh's test, and I would state, that in the way he performed the experiment there may have been arsenic there, and he not find it—the object of Marsh's test is to get stains of that character, by a flame on the porcelain—if you have a very minute quantity, you have a very slight stain; for instance, on this piece of porcelain (<hi rend="italic">producing a piece</hi>), that was produced</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you examined grey powder? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but I am aware it is frequently impure; I know, as a matter of knowledge in my profession, that it frequently contains antimony—com<lb/>mercial mercury is used, and it is often impure; whatever would be in the mercury would be in the grey powder; I do not remember in what propor<lb/>tion, but I should think more than the arsenic I found in the bismuth—this I know more from what I have heard and ascertained, than from what I know from my own personal experiments—antimony is used in several medicines—if any traces of antimony were found in a body, the greatest caution should be used as regards attributing such traces to actual improper administration, owing to the circumstance that it is contained in a great many medicines that are innocently taken; in James's powder, for instance, and in a substitute for that, called antimonial powder; and then there is tartar emetic, and anti<lb/>monial wine—in a case of actual slow arsenical poisoning I should expect to find the smaller intestines greatly injected and ulcerated in parts—I have not seen a case of slow arsenical poisoning or any slow poisoning; they are very rare—I have seen cases of rapid poisoning by large doses of arsenic, but not by antimony; four days is the longest time that I have personally known—from my knowledge of the effects of mineral poison, such as arsenic or anti<lb/>mony, upon the mucous membrane and the lining of the intestines, I should expect to find, in a case of slow arsenical poisoning, the stomach and the small intestines greatly injected and effused with blood, and ulcerated in parts; the absence of those appearances would make me hesitate in attri<lb/>buting the death to slow poisoning; I should expect to see the conjunctival membrance of the eye suffused and injected and red; that is considered almost a specific result of slow arsenical poisoning; my attention would be immediately directed to the lining membrane of the eye—I am aware that there is an arsenical eruption called <hi rend="italic">eczema arsenicale;</hi> I should, from my reading, expect to find such eruption on the arms and shoulders in a case of slow arsenical poisoning—the lining membrane of the nostrils would be affected by arsenical poisoning—excoriation of the anus has also been observed, and all the orifices of the mucous tracks would be so—I should expect in a case of slow poisoning by antimony to observe as a symptom, whilst the poison was being administered over three or four weeks, a clammy perspiration of the body, a sort of death coldness; I may speak from my own experience there, for I have found antimony acting most injuriously upon persons—I should expect from the record of such things given by Dr. Taylor, and also from my experiments on animals, that in a case of small doses of antimony chronically administered, the liver would be softened—a great</p>

               <p>bulk, by far the greater portion of toxicological knowledge, that is a knowledge of the effects of poisons on the human frame, is derived from experiments on the lower animals—the cases of poisoning of human beings where opportunities for observation have been offered are very rare—it is the practice of the greatest toxicologists, both here and on the Continent, to make these experiments continually; and they are recorded in the greatest works on medical science; many are referred to in Dr. Taylor's own book; they are in Christison, and in Orfila, the great French toxicologist.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the St. George's School what is called the Grosvenor School? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is; it was the first school connected with St. George's—I appeared in Palmer's case, to prove that strych<lb/>nia may be found in a body if once the patient has taken strychnia—I appeared for the defence; I gave evidence that no strychnia appeared; that it must be found if the party died of that poison; that is decidedly the case—I had practised on animals for the purpose of coming to a conclusion, not exactly for Palmer's ease; but Dr. Taylor had made a statement that it could not be detected, and I, being constantly consulted upon these matters, was anxious to determine whether that was the case or not; I have done so on this occasion; another gentleman from the Grosvenor School (Dr. Richard<lb/>son) was also a witness then—if it is well ascertained that in an evacuation there is one-sixth of a grain of arsenic, I could form an opinion of how much arsenic had been in the body; if in an evacuation I separated the one-sixth of a grain of arsenic, I should be convinced that there was a large quantity remaining in the stomach somewhere or other.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you ceased to be connected with the Grosvenor School? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two years—the Grosvenor School has been established about thirty years; it is a laboratory where chemical expe<lb/>riments are constantly being made; the Governors of St. George's Hospital would not allow an anatomical school to be attached to it, and it was esta<lb/>blished, by Mr. Lane, some thirty years ago—it is a separate school of medi<lb/>cine, not connected with St. George's Hospital—if I did not find any arsenic in a body from which an evacuation containing one-sixth of a grain of arsenic came, it would lead me to doubt whether the experiment had been correct or not—I do not think it a wise thing to use a piece of untested copper to make an experiment with upon such an evacuation, nor a piece of re; I always used pure electrotyped copper for experiments—there is a means known to skilled persons who make experiments of this kind, by which the copper they use may be perfectly pure and free from doubt—when a man's life is to be brought into question, unless the copper be perfectly pure and free from doubt, it is a most dangerous experiment to make as regards the ascertaining the existence of poison; to use untested copper leads to error—at the trial of Palmer, and with reference to strychnia, I confined my evidence to the statement of what I believed to be a chemical fact, viz., that if strychnia had been administered while living, and had caused death, it ought to have been found in the body; that is still my opinion, and I am not singular in that opinion.</p>

I am a Doctor of Medicine and Lec<lb/>turer on Practical and Experimental Chemistry—I was a pupil of Professor Liebig—I also carried on chemical inquiries and investigations at the labora<lb/>tory at Heidelberg, and received the great Prussian medal—I have heard the evidence in relation to the symptoms exhibited by Isabella Bankes, also the treatment and the post-mortem examination—in my judgment her death is compatible with natural causes—I have met with instances of pregnancy, with diarrhoea combined, though in early stages of pregnancy only; but I</p>

               <p>know that such cases occur in all stages of pregnancy—in addition to the circumstance of pregnancy I should attribute the death of Isabella Bankes to diptheretic dysentery; I believe the term "diptheretic" dysentery is known everywhere; the name of diptehrites has been common these twenty years—taking the symptoms altogether, they are incompatible with slow arsenical poisoning; they are also incompatible with slow antimonial poisoning—in my judgment, the administration of chlorate of potass, either in slow arseni<lb/>cal or antimonial poisoning, would not modify the symptoms so as to make her death reconcilable with either—in cases of slow arsenical poisoning I should expect to find the stomach ulcerated—I quite concur in what Dr. Richardson and Dr. Rodgers have said upon the pathology that they would expect to find in the case of slow arsenical or antimonial poisoning—in either case I should expect to find the arsenic or the antimony, as the case might be, in the tissues after death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know exactly how much? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not, because I dissolved two ounces, and of that I took by measure about one-sixteenth part, or something of that kind; we do not always ascertain the quantity we are operating upon, not in qualitative analyses—the quantity is of importance, no doubt; but quantitative analyses are very laborious indeed—it could be done: I did not do it, because my occupation, and the time allowed, and all that, did not allow me to take the trouble—I dare say these experiments were made several weeks back.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then do you think that the arsenic in the grey powder poisoned Isabella Bankes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never said anything of the kind—I do not think it poisoned her—I do not think it might have done so—it might have produced the apthous spots; I cannot say that it did; it is very possible, very likely—what are ordinarily called apthous spots on the tongue are not produced by arsenic—I say that the grey powder might produce the apthous spots in consequence of the action of the mercury—it would not arise, either from the antimony or the arsenic—grey powder is mercury rubbed down with chalk—I do not think that the arsenic in the bismuth had any operation upon Miss Bankes, but it had upon the analysis—I have already stated to what I attribute the symptoms in Miss Bankes a case; neither the grey powder or the bismuth had any<lb/>thing to do with her death.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing bismuth to be taken which contains arsenic, and it is used, and in an evacuation traces of arsenic are found, such as the 100th part of a grain in two spoonfuls, as Dr. Taylor stated, might the fact of bismuth so containing arsenic reasonably and scientifically account for the traces in an evacuation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might; if antimony was taken in a medicine, and a trace of antimony found in the intestines, that might reasonably and scientifically be accounted for by the presence of antimony in a medicine otherwise con<lb/>sidered harmless—that is what I mean by saying that it might account for the analysis.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In a case of chronic dysentery would every bit of food taken produce a burning sensation in the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very probably, especially if the irritation of pregnancy was added; I am acquainted with a disease called <hi rend="italic">coeco colitis;</hi> I look upon that to be dysen<lb/>tery, in fact inflammation of the large bowel—I heard Dr. Bowerbank speak of it as a natural disease; it is so—I have heard the stomach de<lb/>scribed as ulcerated, the mucous membrane obliterated and partly destroyed, coming away in shreds, and that blood was effused under the mucous mem<lb/>brane; that there were dark patchy spots and ulcers and an injection generally of the membrane—I agree with Dr. Wilkes that that might arise from dysentery; those are the appearances I should expect to find in dysentery—in cases of slow irritant poisoning, diarrhoea and vomiting with burning sensations of the intestinal canal, ulceration sometimes of the mouth, and a burning sensation in the throat, are symptoms which would unquestionably arise, they also arise from natural causes as well, most assuredly—irritation of the conjunctiva and injection of the lining membrane of the eye, and irritation of the skin accompanied by an eruption called <hi rend="italic">eczema arsenicale,</hi> that has been frequently observed; I should expect in a case of slow arsenical poisoning to find the membrane of the nostril injected, reddened, and probably ulcerated along the edge of the <hi rend="italic">alienasi</hi> and all the mucous ori<lb/>fices—there would be excoriation of the anus and of the vagina also—I have heard it stated that the deceased was said at one time to have had an affection of the womb—I have not seen a bottle of nitrate of silver pro<lb/>duced.</p>

If there was a disease of the womb for which it was necessary to use an injection of nitrate of silver, that would probably indicate some ulceration of the <hi rend="italic">cervex uteri;</hi> the neck of the womb—if there had been such a condition of the womb an appreciable time before preg<lb/>nancy, I think it might add to the irritation of pregnancy—if I found a patient suffering from severe purging or diarrhoea, vomiting, burning</p>

               <p>sensation of the throat and of the intestinal canal, the sensation of a ball in the throat, accompanied by ulcerous appearances in parts of the body, that would not, in my judgment, necessarily lead to the conclusion that she must be the subject of arsenical or irritant poisoning, and that alone; unless I found other symptoms, it would never enter my head—in the case of anti<lb/>monial poisoning, I should expect to find a clamminess and cold perspiration of the skin; and, as far as any experiments that I have seen on animals go, I should expect to find a softening of the liver; but I cannot speak of the human subject—I think that a very large portion of the knowledge of the effects of poison on the human frame is derived from experiments on the lower animals—a large proportion of the use, the pathology of the parts of the body, is derived in the same way; every great fact in pathology is found out in the same way; the circulation of the blood and everything, and the use of certain nerves—Sir Charles Bell's division of the nerves has been very much confirmed, if not discovered, by experiments on animals—chlorate of potass is an innocent salt, and is used sometimes as a wash for the mouth; it would very probably be used advantageously in cases of foul breath—I am of opinion that it would not in any way affect the operation of arsenic or antimony if mingled with them—in cases of slow arsenical or antimonial poisoning, I should most decidedly expect, if death resulted, to find the poison in the tissues; as Dr. Taylor has said, the finding poison in the liver is the great criterion—as far as my reading enables me to judge, I should say that in cases of slow arsenical poisoning the small intestines are most likely to be affected, as far as their appearance after death is concerned—I have heard the appearance of the small intestines here, and I think their appearance and that of the stomach together are not compatible with arsenical poisoning—in cases of slow irritant poisoning, it is to the stomach and the small intestines that I should most immediately direct my atten<lb/>tion, especially to the stomach—in cases of slow irritant poisoning, the inner coating of the stomach is very much inflamed from injection of the vessels; it is suffused with red patches of blood, and it would very probably be ulcerated; certainly inflamed—the duodenum is the upper part of the small intestines—if the coats of the duodenum were firm, and there was no ulceration, that is not an appearance which I should expect to find after slow arsenical or irritant poison; in antimonial poisoning, I should expect to find the lungs after death intensely congested and red—supposing a person had had small doses of antimonial poison administered to her, I should certainly not expect to find the lungs pale or perfectly healthy—supposing Mr. Palmer's account to be correct, that the liver was very large, very hard in the left lobe, that would most certainly be an indication of a long standing disease, and would be what I should expect to find where a person had been suffering for some considerable time from bilious irritation and chronic inflammation—it is as much the peculiar effect of arsenic in small doses to influence the stomach as I have described, as it is of mercury to produce salivation; arsenic acts on the stomach specifically as much as mercury acts on the salivatory glands, or cantharides on the bladder; I should say on the urinary organs; I speak of the kidneys and bladder together; and in whatever way introduced into the system—in cases of antimonial poisoning, I should expect to find the stomach reddened, congested probably, and a condition of apthous ulceration; that has been observed in the human subject in cases of poisoning by antimony—in every case of poisoning by arsenic in animals that I have met, witnessed, or been a party to, I have found the inner coats of the mucous membrane of the stomach</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150167"/>
               <p>very much inflamed, very red and ulcerated—I should expect to find arsenic in the kidneys and the spleen from slow arsenical poisoning, as well as the liver; I should expect to find it in the liver first—I start with the liver as the great criterion, from the absence of these symptoms and appearances in Miss Bankes's case, I am fortified in my opinion that she died from natural causes—if I am testing a liquid for the presence of arsenic or any other irritant poison, in arriving at a perfectly accurate judgment as to the quantity, I ought to make what is called a quantitative analysis; that is done by actually weighing the whole that I find—any other mode of proceeding is likely to lead to the most erroneous results, most certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dr. Taylor calculated that there was the 1/100th of a grain of arsenic in two spoonsful of liquid, and then he appears to have multiplied those two spoonfuls by the whole quantity of liquid, and arrived at the result that about one-sixth of a grain of arsenic was contained in the whole; would you consider that to be a safe or reliable mode in a case where the life of a human being is concerned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I consider it a mere guess, and of no importance whatever—I have made experiments on bismuth, and have nearly found a grain of arsenic in an ounce of it; that is between four and five tenths of a grain—I never found more than that, but I can swear it was a quantitative analysis—I have analysed qualitatively, and thought I found more, but I cannot swear to it; because, unless a quantitative analysis is made, no one can swear to a chemical quantity—the qualitative is to find the agent, the quantitative is to find the presence and exact measure; therefore, without a quantitative analysis, I should be very sorry to swear to the exact quantity—that applies to every chemical substance, to arsenic as much as antimony—I have not examined grey powder—I took part in the analysis for finding arsenic in the urine of a gentleman who had been treated with bismuth for some complaint, and a trace of arsenic was found in the urine—no quantitative analysis was made there; it was a very small quantity, but quite sufficient to be certain it was there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the early part of your examination you expressed an opinion on the subject of inquiring into pregnancy; supposing you were called in to attend the wife of a medical man, and he assured you she was not pregnant, and her courses were in order; do you mean that you would consider further investigation necessary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I found her suffering from vomiting and purging, which went on in spite of all my remedies, I should certainly—I am assuming dysentery coming on just at the same time as pregnancy, coming on with it probably, or soon after; coming on as other diseases would, with pregnancy; not directly caused by it, but pregnancy would make it more probable that dysentery would occur; as an independent disease, and then the two working together might produce results which would not be often attendant on such a disease—without pregnancy I should not have expected to find the vomiting so constant; vomiting is the only symptom—if you take the Registrar General's Reports, I think you will find that dysentery is a very common disease—in such a state of things the bowels would continue ulcerating, and would get worse and worse down to the death; the symptoms would become more aggravated, till exhaustion killed the patient; therefore I should not expect that any medicines given would check the disease—I should expect most frequently, I cannot say always, that when taking food or medicine the woman would vomit, and in such a state I think a quarter of a grain of sulphate of copper pill would produce the effect of irritation, and that it would increase the irritation—it might be very extensive throughout the whole of the canal, or not; such sensations</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150168"/>
               <p>are very different in different individuals—diptheretic dysentery is a form of idiopathic dysentery; idiopathic dysentery applies to every case of dysentery which occurs without a particular poison of any kind, the Eastern form of dysentery, idiopathic, arising in India—there is a dysentery that arises from a natural poison, just the same as fever, and all those diseases arise—if I had been acquainted with all those symptoms I have heard described in Court to-day I should not have dreamt of poison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Doctor of Medicine, I have had considerable experience in midwifery—I have delivered upwards of 3,000 women—I have occasionally met with cases of pregnancy combined with diarrhoea and vomiting; diarrhoea superadded to vomiting; and I have had cases in which pregnancy was combined with dysentery; on one occasion of a very severe character, but from which the patient recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, if a person were pregnant, and suffering from dysenteric symptoms, such as you observed in that case, would it be proper to give mineral medicines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not give any in pregnancy, nor on any occasion whatever, unless I found it to be serviceable; not in any dysenteric case whatever, unless I made out the reason why I should give it—I would find out the immediate cause of the dysentery—in this country it generally proceeds from a disease, which has been very well expressed by a celebrated man, Dr. Copland, who has most admirably described the disease which is most common in this country—it commences in that portion of the intestine called the coecum, extending thence to the anus, inflammation of that portion of the intestine, ending in ulceration and death if it is not stopped—the best way to stop it is that which I adopted; the application of leeches to that portion of the coecum, which, if a careful practitioner exer<lb/>cises his fingers, he would be sure to find out—I have heard the symptoms which Isabella Bankes exhibited during life, the remedies, and the post mortem examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, was her death to be attributed to poison or to the effects of dysentery combined with pregnancy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I see the whole of the symptoms traceable to the dysentery, and to the consequent ulceration and exhaustion—that would certainly account for the appearance of the coecum—idiopathic dysentery would be a proper phrase to give it—that is a special disease originating in itself, one single malady, one single suffering—preg<lb/>nancy and dysentery would quite account, in my judgment, for the diarrhea—I have had several cases of dysentery at the early stages of pregnancy, one of them very severe, in fact, contemporaneous with it, I would say, symptomatic of pregnancy—in many cases, instead of the usual change occurring at the period when women exhibit that change peculiar to them there has been some disease of diarrhoea in the early months of pregnancy; this would be much aggravated by a bilious temperament and any affection of the liver.</p>

               <p>accompanied with severe fever, but in this country idiopathic dysentery assumes a less severe form; it is generally what is called sub-acute, or chronic—the state of the coecum in this case in my view indicates a case of sub-acute dysentery, not of severe dysentery; of prolonged dysentery, but not severe—it does not necessarily follow that such a case would commence with febrile symptoms—there is not much fever accompanying dysentery in this country, which is prolonged beyond a few days—I make the distinction between the dysentery of this country and that of warm climates—occasion<lb/>ally there are cases of dysentery similar to that of warm climate, but they are not common; they depend upon a malaria—there was one at Clapham some years ago, which destroyed several boys—every year many persons die of dysentery, but it is the dysentery of this country.</p>

I am a surgeon, and general practitioner; a member of the College of Surgeons, in London, surgeon to the H division of police, and also to the Royal Maternity Charity—I am acquainted, as a matter of medical science, with the fact that in the early stage of pregnancy, vomiting and diarrhoea exist sometimes to a very severe extent; so much so, as some<lb/>times almost to exhaust the patient, principally by the vomiting—diarrhoea is a much less frequent accompaniment; both resulting in sympathetic irritation of the stomach and bowels, being supplied with nervous energy of the same sort as the uterine—I have have had experience myself of one fatal case where pregnancy existed—this person was about forty years of age, perhaps a little more; she had been married ten or twelve years, she suffered from vomiting and purging, and severe burning pain in the abdomen, if the abdomen was touched it would give her great pain all up the right side, especially in the right flank; she was ill from four to six weeks; at any rate four weeks—she came to me occasionally four weeks before her death, and when she was unable to come out I visited her—in consequence of the extraordinary symptoms I observed in that case I made a post mortem examination of the body, and I believe that dysentery caused her death—I think the dysentery was complicated by vomiting, irritability of the stomach, attributable to pregnancy, and purging attributable to dysentery—purging is often a symptom at the early stage of pregnancy, and often a symptom of impending labour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does the excessive vomiting in the early stage of pregnancy, accom<lb/>panied by occasional purging, produce a burning sensation in the throat and along the intestinal canal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In those cases, heartburn is a very com<lb/>mon symptom—it depends upon the secretion—if there is a great amount of acid in the stomach, the irruptations, the matters vomited, are more acid and burning than usual—the heartburn of pregnancy is a household term—a burning sensation along the intestinal canal, the throat, and so on, is often complained of in cases where nothing but ordinary pregnancy, attended by unusual vomiting, exists—the statement that the foetus was of about the age of seven weeks, makes no difference in the opinion I am expressing—the early part of pregnancy, the first three months, is the time specially marked by vomiting—that is inclusive of the whole period, from the beginning to the end of the three months—women who suffer from diseases of the <hi rend="italic">os</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cervex uteri,</hi> for which nitrate of silver is used as an injection, suffer more from inflammation in the stomach by the uterus than other persons; that, and the more frequent occurrence of the monthly periods in the early part of pregnancy, mark cases of disorder of the <hi rend="italic">os</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cervex uteri</hi>—a woman in the early stage of pregnancy, such as I have described, suffering from excessive vomiting, might also have purging and diarrhoea—the diarrhoea might degenerate into dysentery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known cases yourself where there has been excessive vomit<lb/>ing and general intestinal disturbance in the early stages of pregnancy, in which it has been necessary, to save the life of the mother, to abort the foetus and procure a miscarriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a recognised practice in the vomiting of pregnancy which threatens life—nature generally does it herself, and this practice has arisen from an imitation of nature—if by an effort of nature the child is not got rid of, then the medical man intervenes and pro<lb/>duces abortion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you known in your own practice cases of excessive vomiting, accompanied by purging or diarrhoea, with a burning sensation, such as you have described, erroneously attributed to poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known one, case in which there was a great amount of vomiting, and some amount of purging, in which the friends of the lady could not be brought to believe that her husband was not poisoning her, they taking their impressions from themselves, from their own notions—the symptoms that I have described might become so violent from the natural causes I have alluded to, as to be mistaken for a case of poisoning; I have known that happen, and I have known evacuations examined by a chemist under that impression—I mean that I have seen that case in my own practice—an effervescing draught, composed of hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid) is one of the most valuable remedies in the vomitings of pregnancy—persons in these cases die of starvation, as much as though they were deprived of food—in fact no food is kept on the stomach—where persons are suffering from excessive vomiting there is a perfect indisposition to take food; it would give them a of vomiting to speak of or smell food—a woman in that state rejects everything, a few minutes after it is taken—vomiting would come on even when they are not taking food—I have known this vomiting to cease a few days or a few hours before death; that was the case with Charlotte Bronte, the well-known authoress, who died from the vomiting of pregnancy; for</p>

               <p>a short time before her death she was able to take food, and sickness ceased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In cases of death occasioned by the natural causes you have described, and which are within your particular knowledge, have you noticed a peculiar expression of the face? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The expression is that of death from starvation—it is recognised that there is a peculiar expression of the face in such cases—Dr. Paul Dubois, the first obstetrician in France at the present time, observed twenty cases of death by vomiting caused by pregnancy, in thirteen years, and he marks as one. of the four or five distinct signs of danger, a peculiar expression of the face, "a painful expression of the face," and I know of no other man who has had equal experience in the same space of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the symptoms of vomiting and occasional purging had begun at the time that conception or pregnancy had begun, and had continued for four or five weeks, accompanied by the burning sensation of the throat and the intestinal canal, and apthous irritation in the mouth, and a sensation sometimes of a ball in the throat, do you believe that all these symptoms might have arisen from what you have described? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The ball in the throat I take to be an hysterical feeling; the other symptoms might; that is, if you consider morbid pregnancy a natural cause.</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the discussion by Monsieur Dubois with a view to show that, not with standing all these symptoms, there was neither ulceration nor inflammation of the stomach and intestines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not; I believe it had no reference to any ulceration of the intestines—if a pregnant woman has diarrhoea and dysentery, it would go on to sloughing, exactly as in natural dysentery or diarrhoea—if dysentery su<lb/>pervenes, there would be the dysenteric symptoms—I have seen cases in which death has occurred from vomiting, conjoined with purging, but I believe the vomiting to be the great cause of death in those cases—ordinarily, if dysentery be excessive, abortion is produced, or an irritation of the intestinal canal, the intestine is nearer the uterus than the stomach—dysentery kills by exhaustion.</p>

I missed some spoons from downstairs, and in the dining-room the tea-caddy had been forced open and the spoon taken from there; some napkin rings were taken away, and several boxes broken open—it was just becoming grey dawn; we could just see without a candle—these boots (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) were worn by my son—I have not the slightest doubt about their being his.</p>

I am surgeon to the police force at Woolwich—I accompanied the policeman, 63, to the dead-house at Woolwich on the morning of the 14th, the next morning—my assistant saw him before that—I examined the body externally; the only external mark of violence was on the left side of the neck, where there was a bruise, and the skin slightly raised; it was below the ear, and behind the corner of the lower jaw—blood was rushing from the nostrils, but no other external violence—I began my internal examination by examining the head—I found all the vessels of the brain congealed with blood, and on the surface were large clots in two or three different places; and on opening the brain, there was a large clot on the left side—on removing the brain from the skull, there was also a very large clot of blood pressing on the spinal marrow—the result that I drew was that he died from rupture of the brain, from pressure on the brain, and apoplexy—it might be the result of a blow or a fall on the ground—the vessels would rupture, the blood would be effused, and death would ensue from pressure on the brain—if a person had been drinking, and had received a blow in the stomach, and had fallen down on the ground, it would be very likely to bring death.</p>

I was on duty in High-street, on Tuesday night, 12th July, about half-past 12—in consequence of some<lb/>thing I heard, I went to the Shamrock beershop, and there I saw the deceased lying on the ground, and a number of people standing round—after that, I went in pursuit of the prisoner, and found him in a small cottage—he was lying outside his bed with his clothes on, apparently asleep—I took him in charge, and told him that he had assaulted a man in High-street, and kicked him—he had been drinking.</p>
