            . I live at the Angel-Inn, Islington. About the 13th or 14th of June last, I missed this Sheep of Mr. Robinson's out of my Field, and on the Sunday following the Skin was brought to me, by a Person who had pick'd it up. The next Day about 12 o'Clock, Word was brought me that two Men were taken up at Westminster, and that some Mutton was found upon them. I then came up to London, and found the Prisoners in the Gate-House: I took them before Mr. De Viel, before whom they confessed that they went into the Field, and took the Sheep. They very particularly described the Field, and said they came up some Steps and over a Stile to get into the Field, and that there was a sort of a rising Hill or Bank in it. They said they took the Sheep up the Field and dressed it, and left part of it under a Hay-Cock.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Were there no other Sheep in the Field but this?</p>
               <p>Day. Yes, a great many.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. What does Robinson mark his Sheep with, that you can swear to the Skin?</p>
               <p>Day. A Fleur de Lis, and I think there were some other Marks on the Shoulder.</p>

            . On Sunday the 14th of June last, at 11 o'Clock at Night, I met the Prisoner Alder in King's-Street, Westminster, in a very odd posture. He had got something that made him go almost double. I was going to stop him, but the Wheel of a Coach, which was then going along, falling off, I ran to the assistance of the People who were in the Coach. Before I could overtake him again he had got as far as Tothill-Street, and the Neighbours who were standing at their Doors, called out to the Watchmen to stop him. They did so, and brought him to the Watch-House: I was present and saw the hind quarter of a pretty large Sheep, and the Neck and Breast taken from him. I asked him how he came by it? and he said he had it from one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174107010003"/> Thompson as part of a Debt. I saw that it was not kill'd in the manner that Butchers kill their Meat, and so I took him to the Gate-House, and the next Morning carried him before Mr. De Viel. He still kept to the same story, and said he could tell us the Man whom he had it from; upon that he went with us to Thompson's Lodging, and on my asking him if he had ever sold any Mutton to Alder, he said, he had not. I immediately secur'd him, and on searching the Room, I found a

He said it was Mutton, and he had it from a Man in Holbourn that owed him 18 s. and that he took it for half of his Debt. I had a suspicion that it was stolen, so I took him to the Watch-house, and from thence he was carried to the Gate-House.</p>

I was likewise present when Thompson and Alder were together before the Justice, and they both said it signified nothing to deny it, for they stole the Sheep out of Primrose Hill, and were both equally concerned. I saw the Mutton which was found in Thompson's Room, and it appeared to be part of the same Sheep, as that which we found upon the other Prisoner Alder.</p>

When we got thither, I heard a Man say, D - n you, you Rascal, what Business have you with my Coach? The Prisoner Steers then open'd the Coach-Door, and I thought he was going to let me out, but instead of that, he came into the Coach to me, and one hand he employed in a very indecent manner, the other he put into my Pocket, and took out 6 s. 6 d. I begg'd for God's sake that he would let me alone, and I would pay him, but he paid no regard at all to what I said.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did any other Man appear at the same Time?</p>
               <p>Strickland. No, the other Man kept beating me with the Butt End of his Whip all the Time.</p>
               <p>Q. When you desired them to let you alone, what followed?</p>
               <p>Strickland. Steers went out at the Backside of the Coach, and the other came in, and offered to be rude with me. While Steers was in the Coach with me, another Man (I can't tell who it was) poked in his Whip at the Window, and with the Handle of it struck out two of my sore Teeth. As soon as Steers had pick'd my Pocket he went out, and the other Man came in; upon that I called out Watch as loud as I could, and then Steers took me by the Cloak and pulled me out of the Coach upon the ground. When I was out of the Coach, 2 Women came up and said, d - n you, you B - ch, what Business have you with our Husbands, and gave me several Blows; I cry'd out, and then the Prisoner Steers cut me with the small End of the Whip. This was over against Somerset House, and the Soldiers there hearing the Disturbance came to my Assistance, and the Men took to their Coach and drove away, to a Cellar by the New-Church.</p>
               <p>Q. What Condition did they leave you in?</p>
               <p>Strickland. Without my Cap, Handkerchief, Cloak and Apron; and all over Blood. I lost these Things at the same Time that I lost the Money,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174107010004"/> and they took them from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoners are the Persons who robb'd you?</p>
               <p>Strickland. I can swear to the Prisoner Steers, and Gloide own'd before the Justice that he was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When they stopped with their Coach at this Cellar-Door, what follow'd?</p>
               <p>Strickland. I went with 3 Watchmen to the Cellar, and they asked me if I knew the Men; I told them I knew one of them for he had a Scar on his Eye; so we went down into the Cellar, and neither of the Prisoners were there; but we found them both in a back Room, and although they had changed Coats, I knew Steers to be one of the Persons that robbed me. There were a great many Men in the Cellar, and the Watchmen were afraid of them, and told me if I took the Number of the Coach that was sufficient. This was on the Monday Morning about 2 o'Clock, and on Tuesday I went to the Hackney-Coach Office, and a Man there told me that Mr. Clark, the Master of the Coach, was a very civil Man, and the Matter might be made up for about 2 Guineas, but I was informed I could not do it; so Mr. Clark and Steers were both summoned to appear. On the Friday following I went again to the Office, and Clark appeared, but Steers did not. Mr. Clark desired that I would not indict his Coach, and gave me a Crown, and promised to get a Warrant against Steers to take him, and if he could not take him in a Week, he would give me another Crown. The Prisoners both kept out of the Way, and were not taken till the 14th of June, at which Time they were carried before Mr. De Viel.</p>
               <p>Q. As the Distance between the Commission of this Robbery, and the apprehending the Prisoners was so great, could you remember either of their Faces?</p>
               <p>Strickland. Yes, there were 2 Lights against the Place where Steers took me up; - it was just by St. Martin's Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Prisoners were taken could you remember any Thing as to Gloide?</p>
               <p>Strickland No, I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you recollect that he was the Person whom you had seen in the Cellar with Steers?</p>
               <p>Strickland. Yes, I knew him to be the same Person.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Prisoners were before Mr. De Viel did they own any Thing?</p>
               <p>Strickland. Yes, Steers owned that he horse-whipped me, but I don't remember that he owned the robbing me; but I am sure the Person that horse-whipped me was the same that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Gloide confess any Thing?</p>
               <p>Strickland. Gloide only owned that he attempted to commit Indecencies with me, but that I would not let him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any Thing else that they confessed?</p>
               <p>Strickland. No nothing else; they said they horse-whipped me because they thought I was a Whore.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Did not she own to several People that she was very much fuddled?</p>
               <p>Strickland. No, I never did, for I was not fuddled.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Do you know one Mrs. Murphey or Mrs. Rockham?</p>
               <p>Strickland. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Did not you say the Women tore your Pocket off?</p>
               <p>Strickland. No, they only beat me, and asked me what Business I had with their Husbands.</p>
               <p>Steers. What was the Reason that you staid so long as from March to June before you took us up?</p>
               <p>Strickland. Mr. Clark told me he would take them up, besides I was taken very ill.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Did not you hear that we were both at our Stand in the Day Time?</p>
               <p>Strickland. They were only out at Nights; besides I was ill and could not go about to look after them.</p>

            . I am a Watchman. On the 10th of March, about 2 in the Morning, this Woman, Strickland, came to my Stand, the Corner of Catharine Street, and appeared to be very much abused. She desired me to go with her, for she had like to have been murdered. I told her I had heard the Lashes of a Whip for near half an Hour, but it being out of my Parish I durst not venture to go, except she could call the other Watchmen out of the Strand. She got 3 other Watchmen, and we all went together to Woodward's Cellar, where the Coach was standing. The other Men desired me to go down first; accordingly I did, and when I came down I saw the Coachman, Steers shuffling about from one Table to another, endeavouring to hide his Whip. I accused about half a dozen Men in the Cellar, and asked the Woman if she knew any of them; she said she did not, but when I came to Steers, she fell on her Knees, and wished she might never rise more if he was not one of the Men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she take Notice of any other Man at that Time?</p>
               <p>Haydon. No, she did not; she said nothing of Gloide then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered Steers would she have charged you with him?</p>
               <p>Haydon. Yes, but I said the Number of the Coach was sufficient, and there were so many Men in the Cellar that I was afraid we should have our Brains beat out. In a little Time afterwards the Prisoner Steers came out of the Cellar, and I would have pushed the Woman away, but she looked in his Face and said, this is the Person that whipped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174107010005"/> me, upon which he turned about and said; d - n you, you B - ch, for half a Farthing I would horse whip you again. The next Day I went with the Prosecutrix to the Coach-Office about the Number of the Coach, and the Master of it was summoned, and on his appearing, he gave her a Crown, and promised her another if he did not take Steers in a short Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the Justice with the Prisoners?</p>
               <p>Haydon. Yes, and I heard Steers own that he whipped her with a double thong'd Whip: The Justice asked them, what they went into the Coach for, and one of them, I think it was Gloide, smiled and said, with Intent to lie with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. When she came to you at your Stand, did she say she had been robbed?</p>
               <p>Haydon. Yes, she said she had been robbed of her Landlady's Cloak, her Cap, and 6 s. 6 d. in Money, and desired me to go and take the Persons.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Did not she charge some Women with the Robbery?</p>
               <p>Hay don. No, she said she was robbed by 2 Men, and 2 Women came and beat her.</p>

             was my Servant. On the 9th of March last, he drove a Hackney-Coach for me, No. 248, and on the Wednesday following a Summons came with a Complaint against that Number to appear at the Office on the Friday. On the Thursday Morning, I went up Stairs to call the Prisoner as usual, and informed him of this Summons, and of the Complaint: He said, he knew nothing of it, but however if he was to be sent to Newgate he would certainly appear. He lay a bed the best Part of that Day, and the next Day instead of appearing according to his Promise, he absconded, and I could not find him, so I went myself to the Office, and was informed that a Woman and two Watchmen had been to complain against me. I afterwards went into Covent Garden to see for Steers, but he was not to be found, so I went to the Office again, and the Prosecutrix was there, and told me she had been robbed of 6 s. 6 d., her Cloak, Apron and Cap. I told her it was out of my Power to produce the Man, but if she would not appear against me at the Office, I would give her a Crown then, and another if I did not take him in a Week. In about a Week afterward she was taken ill, and I went to see her, and gave her 5 d. or 6 d. to get blooded. We got a Warrant from Justice De Viel, and Steers was taken; Glide was taken the same Morning at 10 o'Clock, and carried before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed when you were before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Clark. Steers being asked why he left my Coach, said, he was taken ill at Temple-Bar, and sent Glide away with it, and ordered him to bring it again at 2 o'clock. He said, Glide, did not return with the Coach, upon which he went to see for him at Woodward's Cellar, where he had left Word that he was gone to Westminster. That he saw the Coach in the Strand, with a Linkman on the Box, and a Man and Woman in the Coach: that he pulled the Woman out of the Coach, and gave her 3 or 4 Strokes with his Whip. Gloide said he was in the Coach at the same time, and would have lain with the Woman, but did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoners. Where does this Woman live?</p>
               <p>Clark. She lodged then at one Whitehead's in King's Court, Russel Street, Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Steers. Did not you see me from the time that you got the Warrant, to the time that I was taken?</p>
               <p>Clark. I have seen him once or twice since, but he kept out of the Way. I told him there was a Warrant against him, and he said he did not value it, for it was only going to Bridewell for 7 Days.</p>
               <p>- Black. I am a Constable in St. Giles's Parish. When I had Steers in Custody, I carried him before Mr. De Viel, but he not being at Home, I left him in the Custody of 2 or 3 Men at the

             in Bow Street, while I went to see after Gloide. I took him out of Bed, and told him I wanted him to come and speak in the Behalf of Steers; and he said he had nothing to say but what would hurt him. When we had them both together before the Justice, Gloide owned that he attempted to lie with the Woman, and Steers said he horse-whipped her with a double Thong.</p>
               <p>DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Steers. I sent Gloide with the Coach, and thinking he staid long, I went several times to see after him. I went to Woodward's Cellar, and while I was there, the Coach stopped on the other Side of Somerset House Water Gate. I went to see what was the Reason that it did not come up, and saw a Fellow on the Box, and Gloide and this Woman in the Coach. The Woman got out of the Coach and went up Catharine Street, and I went to Woodward's Cellar again, and watered my Horses, intending to go Home, and Gloide gave me my great Coat, which I had lent him to drive in. In a few Minutes this Woman came with this Watchman to the Cellar, and she said she had been robbed by 2 Women. The Watchman asked her whether I belonged to the Coach, and she said I was one of them, and she would swear to my Coat.</p>
               <p>Gloide. This Man sent me with his Coach, and as I was coming by the Corner of Southampton Street, the Woman called after me and desired me to give her a Cast; so I put her into the Coach and asked her to do so and so; she asked me if I was found, I told her I was not, and then she said she would have nothing to say to me.</p>

            . Between 12 and 2 o'Clock, on the 10th of March, to the best of my Knowledge, I was locked out, and waiting at Temple Bar, for my Master Withers's Work, Gloide asked me to go to Westminster with him with a Job. As we came back from Westminster, that Woman was standing at the Corner of Southampton Street. Gloide got off the Box, and said, My Dear, will you take a Ride in the Coach; she said she did not care to trust herself with a Man, but if he would not hurt her she would. They both got into the Coach, and I drove on slowly to Somerset House, and then the Coachman came up, and cut me over the Legs with his Whip, for driving his Coach. Gloide jump'd out, and Steers took the Woman out, and used his Whip a little about her. The Woman cried out Watch! but as for seeing him put his Hands near her Clothes, I did not. The Coach stood about 2 Yards beyond Somerset House; and I did not go above 10 Yards, but stood by the Watch House all the Time, and saw what passed.</p>

            . I am a Gravesend Waterman, and seeing this Woman and a Man go into the Dolphin in Darkhouse Lane, I plyed them, but they were not going by Water, so they asked me to go in and drink with them. I did so, and heard her say, some Men had prompted her to this, or else she had not done it, and if she could save one of the Prisoners she would, but would hang the other. She was asked who the Persons were that robbed her; and she said she did not know whether he was a Tradesman or a Coachman, and she could not swear to him till a Man shewed him to her in the Night-Cellar.</p>

The Prisoner Steers came to our Cellar about 2 o'Clock in the Morning, - I can't tell the Day: He staid some Time, and then went away; and in a quarter of an Hour or less, returned with the other Man, Gloide. They had not been there long before Strickland and the Watchman came down, and when somebody shewed her Steers, she said, this is the Man who whipped me out of the Coach. I was then in a back Room, and the Watchman said he would take the Number of the Coach, and they went away together without mentioning a Word of a Robbery.</p>

            . On the 12th of April I had Occasion to go out, and left this Money lock'd up safe, in a Drawer in my Chamber. I returned in about 5 or 6 Hours, and heard the Prisoner, who was my Servant, unlock my Chamber Door: I immediately ran up Stairs, and found the Door fast, with the Key in the Inside. We have an empty House backwards, and imagining he might make his Escape that Way, I took my other Apprentice with me to search; but as soon as I had got down Stairs I heard my Chamber Door open, and somebody run up Stairs into the Garret. I ran up into the Garret likewise, and took the Prisoner from under the Bed. When I had taken him, I went into my Chamber, and found my Drawer broke open, but the Money was not taken away.</p>
               <p>- Painter. I am a Constable, and was sent for to take Charge of the Prisoner. I asked him how he came to use his Master so, and he said he did design to take the money; that some People were waiting for it, and it was to be spent at the White-Conduit-House, in White-Conduit Fields. He owned he broke open the Drawer with this Knife, which we found on the Bed, according to his Directions, and said he put the Money into his Pocket, but hearing his Master come up, he laid it in the Place from whence he took it.</p>
               <p>- Long. I was present when the Prisoner was examined; and heard him own this to be the Knife with which he broke the Drawers; he said, he did take the Money and put it into his Pocket, but hearing his Master come up Stairs, he put it into the Drawer again.</p>

            . I happened to be out pretty late, and was locked out of my Lodging, so I went to the Watch-House thinking to stay there all Night; but a Brick-maker took me down to a Night House where I picked up the Prisoner. The Brick-maker got him a Woman, and we all went up Stairs, but they left me and the Prisoner alone together. I paid 6 d. for my Bed, and the Prisoner lay with me; and we had not been a bed long before she wanted a quartern of Gin; I put my Hand into my Pocket to pay for it, and then my Money was safe. When she had drank the Gin, she got up and bolted the Door, and I being weary fell asleep, and when I waked my Money was gone and she too. I met her 2 or 3 Days afterwards in Bond Street, and asked her about the Money. I had a Crown in my Pocket when I went up Stairs with her, which my Father left me, and I desired her to let me have that, and I would let her go, but she said she only had the other Money.</p>

She shewed me up a Pair of Stairs, and when I came into the Chamber, I saw the Prisoner Eades, and the 2 other Women lying on the Floor, covered over with a Blanket or Rug. After I had sat down a little, I desired Eliz. Eccles to fetch me a Quart of Beer, and when I had drank part of it, they drank the rest, and I fell asleep, and they robbed me of the Goods mentioned in the Indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had all those Things about you, when you fell asleep?</p>
               <p>J. R.. Yes, I am sure I had them when I went into the Room.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did you awake?</p>
               <p>J. R.. I can't say, because I had lost my Watch, but it was past 11 o'Clock before the Wells broke up, and after that I went into the Tap-House, and sat till it was pretty late.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been drinking, or were you sober?</p>
               <p>J.R.. I could not be very sober to be sure, but I had my Senses enough to know that I had my Things when I went to sleep, because I looked out of the Window, and saw People milking their Cattle, and I thought to get some Milk, but I fell asleep, and when I 'wak'd, I missed my Goods, and the Prisoners were all gone off. These two Boys were in the Room at the same Time, though I did not see them because they were covered over and hid. The Prisoners were taken and carried before Justice Manley, and when I came there, I found all these Things which are in the Custody of the Constable. These are the Shoe-Buckles; here is one Knee-Buckle, and the Tobacco Stopper, and this is the Bag which contained the Money, but here is not half the Money I lost.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Eccles. Ask him if he knows this Shilling?</p>
               <p>J. R.. Yes, this very Shilling was taken from me with the other Things: It is a leaden one, and I put it into my Fob-Pocket because I would not put it off. This Silver Portugal Piece was likewise taken from me.</p>

            . On the 31st of May, between 5 and 6 in the Evening, the Prisoner brought a black Mare faddled and bridled, to my House, the Bell at Bow. He left her with me all Night, and went away to lie at another House. The next Morning he came to fetch her away, and when she came to the Stable Door, I seeing her Shoes were bad, immediately suspected her to be stolen, and stopp'd her. When I had stopped her, the Prisoner came into the Yard, and I asked him whether the Mare was his own or not; he said he had borrowed it of his Master Smith, who lived at Halstead in Essex, that his own Name was Smith, and he was going to Hounslow to a Kinsman of his Master's. We were not satisfied with this, but took him before a Justice at Bow, and there he denied that his Name was Smith, and would not tell any Name, for he said if he did it would be the worse for him. The Justice then committed him to New-Prison, and I had the Mare cried at Rumford and Epping, and my next Door Neighbour, Mr. Cook the Collar-Maker, sent a Letter into the Country. On the Friday following, Mr. Wash came to my House, and owned the Mare, and had her away again.</p>

When I got Home my Friends persuaded me to fetch my Things away, and not to go to work. My Father follows the farming Business, and gave me the liberty to take a Horse whenever I would. I got up early in the Morning, in order to come away, and there were some Horses in the Road, which I thought to be my Father's, so I made bold to go into the Stable and take a Bridle and Saddle, and one of those Horses. I desire Mr. Wash may be ask'd concerning my Character.</p>
               <p>Wash. He is a Neighbour's Son. His Friends bear a very good Character, and I never heard any harm of him before this.</p>
               <p>Q. Does his Father live so near you, that your Horses run together?</p>
               <p>Wash. No, they never go together, and I live half a Mile from him.</p>
               <p>Lay. I don't know a great deal of the Prisoner; his Friends bear a very good Character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I lived Servant with this Man.</p>
               <p>Lay. He did live with me about 3 quarters of a Year, and was a very good Servant to me. <rs id="t17410701-12-verdict58" type="verdictDescription">

            . I live at Tottenham-Court, and being sent on an Errand to London, my Master's Daughter call'd to me as I was going along the Road. I ran to her directly, and going along the Fields the space of twenty yards, we saw a Child sitting on a Lay-stall or Dung-hill. My Master's Daughter said to me, '' Ruth, I will be hang'd if those 2 creatures '' have not stripped the Child, for I saw the '' old one have her by the hand.'' I went up to the Child and ask'd her where those Women were? She said she did not know, and that they had taken her Coat and Stay from her. We bid the Child sit still till we came back, and we would take them; and accordingly went in pursuit of the Prisoners, and took them within two Fields of Pancras. The great one, Rouse, made several attempts to get over a Bank, but she could not, so she slung this Coat and Stay into the ditch. I took it up and shew'd it to her, and she said we had stripp'd the Child ourselves and laid it on her, and began to grow robustical: upon that we called a Man to our assistance and carried them to my Master's, where we secur'd them till we got help and carried them before Mr. De Viel. When they were before Mr. De Veil they were examined, and the great one said to the other, '' Mall, '' if it had not been to buy you a new Gown, I '' had not committed this Robbery. ''the other said, It was to serve herself and not her, and that she was a Field off when Rouse committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Prisoner Smith say she was with Rouse when she decoy'd the Child away, or when she brought it back to the Lay-stall?</p>
               <p>Bagley. She said she saw Rouse decoy the Child away, and offer her a Plum-cake.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from the Lay-stall did you first see the Prisoners with the Child?</p>
               <p>Giles. Very near a quarter of a mile; they were leading the Child, and she said something to them, and they replied, Yes, we shall be there presently now.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the Prisoners with the Child, had she her Stay on?</p>
               <p>Giles. No, she had only her Frock on. When we came up to the Lay-stall, we asked the Child if they had taken any thing from her, and she said they had taken her coat and stay: upon that we pursued the Prisoners, and got up with them. I asked the little one for the coat and stay, and she said she had none of it; the great one came up and beat me, and said she supposed we had stripp'd the child ourselves, and the little one was going to run away, but I catch'd hold of her, and

            . On the 10th of June last, I and my wife were taking a walk to Pancras, and these 2 girls came down the Road crying stop thief! I took hold of the Prisoner Smith, and she said she would shew me the ditch where the things were: accordingly I went with her to the ditch and took out this coat and stay, and she said her sister took them from the child and threw them in there. The Prisoner Rouse was all that time in this young woman's hands, and we carried them to Mr. Giles's at Tottenham-Court, where the great one own'd she robbed the Child, and said it was to buy the little one a new gown. I kept them till a Constable came, and he carried them before Justice Trent, but he being busy, we had them before Mr. De Viel, where Rouse own'd they took the Child from Albemarle-Street, and carried her to Tottenham-Court, but I did not then hear them say what they did to her.</p>

               <p>Counsel. Can you recollect seeing him do any thing to any body at Hayes?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, but I can't tell what Day it was; it was on a Saturday Night, between 10 and 11 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What did you see done?</p>
               <p>Brown. I saw him put the Man into the Ditch, hard by the Angel at Hayes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What did you hear him say to the Man?</p>
               <p>Brown. He damn'd his Blood, and the old Man said, pray Sir don't damn my Blood. The Prisoner then said he was a pilsering Rogue, and went to throw him over the Gate.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Was that before or after he put him into the Ditch?</p>
               <p>Brown. Before he put him into the Ditch, and the old Man fell back again, and hit his Head against the Gate.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Do you think it was to assist the Man to get over the Gate?</p>
               <p>Brown. No, the Prisoner took him up in his Arms, and threw him from him, and he fell with his Head against the Gate.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did the Man make any Complaints after that?</p>
               <p>Brown. He cried out of his Leg, but I did not see any Thing done to it. After the Prisoner had thrown him into the Ditch, I desired him to take him out; he did so, and laid him in a Cart-Rut.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What became of the Prisoner after this?</p>
               <p>Brown. He went in at the Angel and I went Home.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did you ever see the old Man again?</p>
               <p>Brown. No Sir, not 'till next Day in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. You say it was between 10 and 11 in the Evening, was there any Light there?</p>
               <p>Brown. I can't tell whether there was or not, but I was just by the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. How far from the Angel does your Father live?</p>
               <p>Brown. He lives at Coombes, which is 13 Miles from the Angel.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. How came you to be out at this time of Night?</p>
               <p>Brown. My Mother and my Sister and I lived at my Aunt's, about 2 Stones throw from the Angel, and my Sister called me out and said she thought some Soldiers were quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, and I was just by him all the Time.</p>
               <p>Counsel. When you went Home did you tell any Body what you had seen?</p>

            . Last Saturday was three Weeks, about ten o'Clock at Night, I saw the Prisoner at Hayes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What did you see him do there?</p>
               <p>Clark. I saw him bringing an old Man along the Road: I asked him if he had got a drunken Man, and he said, he was no more drunk than I was, but that he was an idle Fellow and a Rogue, and wanted to get into some Body's House when he saw a Conveniency. He said he had brought him from Woodrosse's, where he had lain long enough if he had been drunk to have been sober again, for he had been ever since 1 o'Clock coming from the Adam and Eve, which is about a Mile distant. My Sister keeps the Angel, and I told him she was very much obliged to him for bringing him here, and he said his Intention was to carry him out of the Parish,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174107010012"/> but d - n him, he would duck him well first. The old Man hearing him say so, said in a low Tone; then I will cry out Murder: The Prisoner replied d - n his Blood, hear the Rogue, now he says he will cry out Murder. Then a young Fellow took the old Man up out of the Road, and laid him gently under the Gateway: I said, I believe the poor Soul was drunk, and wished somebody would take care of him; and then I saw the Prisoner take him up in his Arms in Order to throw him over the Gate; he fell short, and his Head hit upon the Gate, and the Prisoner said, d - n him, there let him lie. The old Man then cried out of his Leg, and one

             asked him what was the Matter with it, but he made no Answer.</p>
               <p>Counsel. How long did the Deceased lie there?</p>
               <p>Clark. I can't tell; I heard no more of him for a quarter of an Hour, and then he lay at my Sister Walker's Door, and the Prisoner said, come Mrs Walker, and see me put this Money into the Rogue's Pocket, or else to-morrow he will swear I have robbed him. He put 14 d into his Pocket, and then I went away and saw no more of him till next Morning. I asked the Prisoner what he had done with the old Man, and he said, d - n him, he had ducked him several Times.</p>
               <p>Counsel. What passed after this?</p>
               <p>Clark. I heard no more till a Man went by in the Night, who called to us, and said, we had turned a Man out of Doors drunk. I got out of Bed, and looked out of the Window; the Deceased was then lying on the Ground, and a Man went to help him up, and said, d - n him, he will not stand. Presently afterwards another Man came by, and said the Man was dying, so I got up, and my Sister and I went down Stairs. She asked the old Man if he would have any Thing; and he moved his Hand and Head, but could not speak. We called the Neighbours about us, and I put a little Rum, Water and Sugar in a Sp oon into his Mouth, but I can't tell whether he swallowed any of it.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did you look at his Head or any part of him?</p>
               <p>Clark. After he was dead, I looked at his Legs, and there was a sort of a scratch on one of them. I did not take Notice of his Head, neither did I see him strip'd, but I saw his Clothes afterwards, and he had about half a pound of Raisins and a piece of Bread in his Pocket all wet. His Shirt was dry just on the Stomach, and the other Part was wet. He lived 'till 5 o'Clock in the Morning and then died.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Was any Body brought to look on him?</p>
               <p>Clark. No, there was no Coroner or Surgeon sent for to examine him.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Do you apprehend, as the Deceased fell against the Gate, that could be the occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Clark. I can't tell; I am not a judge of that, but I do not believe it was.</p>

            . I was coming from London with the last Witness, and saw the Prisoner standing by a poor Man who was in the Road. He made an offer to take him from the Ground, and I asked him what he was doing? He said he was a drunken, sorry Fellow, and he would get him out of the Parish. I desired him to take the man out of the way of the carts and waggons, and he said he design'd to put him out of the Parish, but would duck him a little first, and that would bring him to himself. The Deceased then seemed to be weary and weak, and was lying on his Back, and desired the Prisoner several times to let him alone.</p>

            . One Saturday Night in May last, I was going along the Road at Hayes, and saw a little bustle in the Road. I went up, and found the Deceased and the Prisoner together. I asked him what was the matter, and he said, Here is a pilsering Rogue that has lurked about the Road ever since 3 o'Clock to rob somebody, and would not tell from whence he came, nor whither he was going, and if he would not speak, d - n him, he would throw him into the Pond. The Deceased made no answer to this, so the Prisoner took him up with his Knees bending under him and laid him along at a little distance. The Prisoner then said he was a pilsering Rogue, and he would have him out of the Parish for fear he should rob somebody in the Night. He took him by the Arm to the

            . On Saturday the 23d of May, I was going out of my own House, and hearing a noise, I asked the Neighbours what was the matter, and was answered, they thought it was a drunken Man. In a little time I saw the Deceased lie prostrate on the Ground, and the Prisoner was pulling him up, and insisting on his going away. I said to the Prisoner, Coachman, let the Man alone, when he is come to himself he will go away; and he replied, d - n it, this comes of listning to a parcel of foolish Women. The old Man then complained of his Legs, and the Prisoner still insisted on his going away, and if he did not he said he would throw him into the Pond. I did not hear the Deceased cry Murder, though I imagine he did by the Answer which the Prisoner made, for he said, Now you hear the old Rogue, he cries Murder.</p>

               <p>Counsel. Did you see the Deceased any Time afterwards?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I saw him the next morning after he was dead. There was a Bruise on the top of his Head, and I saw no other marks except a few black and blue spots on his Legs, but how they came I can't tell, for I did not see the Prisoner offer any violence to him, only in pulling him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that Bruise which you saw on the Deceased's Head, was the occasion of his Death?</p>
               <p>Roberts. I can't say indeed. It was a Bruise, but it was not swelled, neither was the Skin broke. These Breeches and Garters are the same which the Deceased wore at that Time.</p>

He lay at my House that Night, and the next morning I rose at 5 o'Clock, and boiled him a quart of Milk for his Breakfast, which he eat up very heartily, and he said he was going directly for Gloucester, and hoped to be at Home by the Tuesday following. He was in perfect Health and had these very Breeches and Garters on when he left my House. As to his being in Liquor, I don't believe he has drank any Thing but Milk these 30 Years.</p>

               <p>Perry. No, I was afraid I should get a mischief; and I had not taken him up now, but I was summoned in about a fortnight or three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make no discovery that Crossley was one of the men before you was summoned in?</p>
               <p>Perry. Yes; I told Mrs. Row at the White-Swan, that the man who rode the Horses at the Horse and Groom was one of the persons. I am positive he is one of them, and none of the other Prisoners were present except him.</p>

             and I went out together with a design to rob on the 1st Wednesday in last November was twelvemonths. Crossley and I went up to this Woman in the Long Canseway in Holloway Road, and knocked her down. Hagan and Rawlins stood at a distance to watch while we robbed her, and as soon as we had done, they went to their lodging; and Crossley and I went to Mr. Lewis's Hay-Loft where we usually lay.</p>
               <p>Q. When you parted with the Prisoners did you meet again?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, we parted the Booty the very same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you divide it?</p>
               <p>White. We divided it in the Road before we parted, and then Crossley and I went to Lewis's Hay Lost, and the other 2 Prisoners went to Mr. Banister's where they lodged. We broke the Loadstone which we took out of this Woman's Pocket, and sold the Silver which belonged to it for 2 d. and shared it among us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that and the Penny divided among you?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, and there was about ten Pennyworth of Half-pence and we had all share and share alike. We likewise took a bunch of Keys, which we flung with the rest of the things into a pond.</p>
               <p>Perry. I don't know that I had any Half pence at all about me at this time.</p>
               <p>Jury to White. What could you divide a piece out of that money?</p>
               <p>White. We drank it out in liquor.</p>
               <p>Crossley. Where did you sell the silver which you took from the Loadstone?</p>
               <p>White. We sold it for 2 d, at a Silversmith's on London-Bridge.</p>
               <p>Crossley. Where did we drink the liquor?</p>
               <p>White. We had it the next day at Banister's at the Castle.</p>
               <p>Crossley. How much liquor had we?</p>
               <p>White. We had about 2 or 3 full pots as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. to Perry. Is that man (White) like the person that attacked you?</p>
               <p>Perry. No, he was a blackish complexioned man, and had a hollowness in his cheeks - I don't believe White was one of them.</p>

            . On the 14th of September last between 11 and 12 o'Clock, the prisoners and I met a man just by the Hole in the Wall near Canbury House at Islington. Crossley came up to him and stopped him, and he knocked Crossley down: I went up to Crossley's assistance and he knocked me down. Then Hagan came before him and knocked him down, and kept beating him with a broomstick 'till we recovered ourselves, to rifle his pockets: Hagan swore we should kill him and then he would have no suspicion of us, so we put him into the ditch, and left him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bigg, Surgeon. On the 15th of September the deceased was received into our Ward. He had a great number of contusions, and his head was beat almost to a Jelly. I ask'd him if he had any retchings upon him, he said he was only sick and saint, and during this time he was perfectly sensible, and continued so for above 10 days. I asked him how this accident happened, and he said he had been to carry money to pay for his Child's nursing, and was met by 4 or 5 men, 2 of whom he could have master'd, had not the others come up and flung him into the ditch, for he was a very sturdy man, almost 6 foot high. At first I had great hopes of his life, for I could find no fissure in his skull; but some time afterwards on enlarging the wound, found there was a necessity to trepan it. The membranes look'd of a very bad colour underneath, and on laying them open farther, I found a fissure which ran quite under the temporal bone, and entirely divided the orbit of his eye, and he absolutely died of the wound which he received at that time.</p>
               <p>Jury to White. Are you positive the Prisoners were present at the commission of this murder?</p>
               <p>White. Yes, we all went out with intent to rob. We have known one another 5 or 6 years, and followed labouring work; sometimes we went out on this Lay, and sometimes got drunk and spent our money.</p>

            . Rawlins came from gathering damsons at the Devil's-House, and went to bed very ill, at my house on the saturday before this fact was committed, and never got up till the tuesday following, at which time he was so weak that he could not walk a-cross the room without help. I desire Lander the Beadle may be asked if we did not send for him to take Rawlins to Hornsey work-house, for we were afraid we should be obliged to bury him.</p>
               <p>Lander. His mother came to us to beg relief for him, and I went to see him and found him ill, but I can't say what time it was.</p>

               <p>Gerrard Cavenagh. Last sunday was tennight at night, the Prisoner Evans met me in Fleet-street near Fleet-Ditch, and carried me to the Prisoner Trueman's house. I followed the young jade up stairs; she sat down in a chair and I sat by her, and Hoskins brought up a pint bottle of China Ale, I think they call it, for I never drank any of that liquor before. When we had taken that bottle between us 3, we had another, and made an end of that in the same manner. Then this young jade asked me to go to bed with her, but she was battered and had a black eye, so I would not have any thing to say to her, but gave her 6 d. to be quiet, for I was sure she had a mind to do me a mischief. Presently she in the red cloak (Hoskins) came up; I ask'd her what was her demand? she said a shilling; but I thought 6 d. was enough, for those 2 pints did not hold above a pot: she said the common price of this house was 12 d. for 2 bottles and 6 d. for a bottle, so I got my hand into my pocket, and drew up a shilling, and said it was an extravagant house, for the liquor was worth nothing, and a pint of beer would be better than 5 bottles of it. I had clear'd my way and was for going off, but this young jade (Evans) took hold of the skirt of my coat, and said she would not be quit of me: then the other Woman came up, took hold of my hair, while Evans took me by the body, and pick'd my money out of my pocket. I immediately got hold of Evans, and Hoskins cut my fingers and my cheek with a knife to make me let her loose. After this they called that gentleman at the bar ( Trueman ) up, and he beat me in the face, and said he would murder me before I should leave the place. Then I lost my stock and clasp, but which of them took it I can't tell. They kept beating and battering me about some time, and at last I made my way to the door, leaving my hat and cane behind me, and met the drawer coming up, but I knock'd him down stairs again. I cried out murder! and a Watchman who was crying the hour within 3 yards of the door took me up to the watch-house, and afterwards secur'd the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Trueman. When you first saw me was you not on the stair-case, coming down to get away?</p>
               <p>Cavenagh. No, I never saw him till he came into the room, and gave me a knock in the face.</p>

            . I went to assist the watchman in carrying the Prisoners before a magistrate, and as we came back, Trueman drew this knife, and swore if I came near him he would cut me to pieces. After we came from Guild-hall, and got to the lodge at Newgate, Trueman flung a great piece of chalk at me and swore he would be revenged of me.</p>

            . I was going my rounds about 2 o'clock, and somebody in Trueman's house called Watch! I made up to the door, and the Prosecutor said he had lost 12 s. 6 d. his cane, hat, and clasp, and I took him to the watch-house. Trueman and the woman in the red cloak (Hoskins) who goes for his wife, were sitting at the door together at the same time, and said the man had lost nothing.</p>

            . I was constable for the night that this thing happen'd, and hearing a Hurley-burley I sent the watchmen out to see what was the matter, and they brought the Prosecutor and three Prisoners to the watch-house. The Prosecutor seem'd to be in a very bloody condition, and had a large cut across the back of his hand, and a bruise under one of his eyes. He charged the Prisoners with robbing him, so I thought it convenient to commit them to the Compter, and him to Bridewell, till the next morning; when they were carried before the Alderman at Guild-hall.</p>

            . I was drinking last monday with the prosecutor and the prisoner Trueman's brother at the Sun and Cart, and the prosecutor said he had nothing to say against Trueman for he did not come up stairs till after he lost his money. He said he saw the girl come down Fleetstreet, and she asked him to treat her with a pint of beer, and upon that he went with her to Trueman's house at Fleet Ditch, where they drank a bottle of China Ale for which he paid a shilling. That he was going to be conversant with the girl, but catching her hand in his pocket, he gave her 6 d. for her trouble, and would not have any thing to say to her, for he thought it was enough for her to be a whore only and not a thief too. He said they battled together for about 10 or 12 minutes, and then Trueman came up and knocked him down backwards, at the same time swearing he would murder him. That after this another man came up and he lost his stock and clasp in the scuffle, but who took it he could not tell. This is all that I can remember, for his discourse was so imperfect, and his expressions so intricate, that a man must have the eloquence of Tully to express their meaning.</p>

            ; it was a month next Friday to the best of my knowledge, and about a quarter past 12 at night. This gentleman came up, and laid fast hold of Brooks and me too. He desired Brooks to go with him and he would give her 6 d. and when he found she would not, he said she had robb'd him. She call'd the watch, but none came to her assistance, and then he took her by the hand, and gave her a kick and sent her away.</p>

            . I live in Oxford Road and there is an alehouse next door to me. It will be a month next Friday, about a quarter past 12, he came to the alehouse door, and said he was robb'd of his stock and stock-buckle. I was a-bed and heard these words, and presently the Prisoner who is my lodger came to the door and I got up and let her in. After I had open'd the door to her, she stood a little, and Prior came up to her and said, are you the woman that robb'd me? I desired him not to make a noise at the door, and he said he was a life-guard-man, and would pull the house down before morning. The Prisoner then went away for about a quarter of an hour, and Prior called the watchman, and charged him with my sister
