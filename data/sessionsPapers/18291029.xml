            . My father kept this coffee-house; the prisoner came to lodge there on the 1st of June, and left on the 5th - he occupied the same room as Nicholson; I saw the portmanteau in the room on the Thursday, while the prisoner was there, as I was helping to make the bed- it was locked then; I examined it, as the prisoner was a stranger: the prisoner was at home almost all day on Friday, in the bed-room; he said, about five o'clock, he thought he should leave that night, and about eight he went - he brought nothing in when he came to the house- he brought in a shirt and handkerchief one day, and gave it me to carry up to the room; I saw him go out on Friday afternoon with a middling sized bundle - he might have come in and gone out again, when I was not in the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Had you any female servants in the house? A. Only one, at that time - how often he went out on Thursday I cannot say; he might have gone out when I was not in the bar, and brought in a bundle; I believe the prosecutor's was a military cloak - the bundle he took out was not so large as that; my father has since discharged a chamber maid, because she did not suit us - not on any suspicion.</p>

            . The prisoner lodged at my father's house; I saw him there frequently - I remember his going away; I saw him take a bundle out - it was large enough to contain a coat, but I think not a military cloak- it was tied in a red and black silk handkerchief; it was too large to contain only two shirts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether the servant discharged attended on the prisoner? A. She made the bed and cleaned the room - the bed room door was never locked; there was no other lodger - the prisoner could often have taken things in when I was not in the bar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your father had but this one maid servant? A. No - a man attended in the bar.</p>

No - she denied having sent an article out; she said nothing about perquisites - the napkins are old, but fit for the use they are now made for; she said she had herself cut them into napkins.</p>

On Friday, the 2nd of October, between five and six o'clock, I was coming out of my door, and saw the prisoner running away very quick; I saw Nagle crying, and asked what was the matter - she said she had been robbed of three half-crowns, and some half-pence; I concluded it was him, by his running so fast - I pursued and overtook him, in about ten minutes, in Fieldgate-street, and gave him in charge; he had joined another person before I overtook him, and they were walking deliberately together - the prisoner is the person I first saw; he had a crape round his hat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not in Mr. Paull's employ when he gave me the property; he had not sufficient work for me, and wished me to get other work: the case belonged to a repeater, which he wished me to finish - I was distressed, and pawned them, not intending to rob him, but to save my wife and children from being turned into the street; he said if I would tell him where it was he would not proceed.</p>
               <p>MR. PAULL. I did not promise not to prosecute; I told him if he gave me the duplicate that night I would not, but I did not then know he had robbed me of my tools - he was still in my employ; I was paying him wages- I settled with him every Saturday, but he generally drew all his money before; he had 28s. a week, and his tea - I was not in his debt at the time.</p>

When an article was redeemed he should put the money into the till: I had settled the account on the Saturday night, with the prisoner, but on the Tuesday morning I called for the account again, and noticed the prisoner abstracting this duplicate; he saw me, and desisted, but I missed it afterwards, and named it to Mr. Lawton, who called the prisoner into the parlour, and he ultimately took the duplicate from his waistcoat pocket; he said it was the first money he had taken - I did not miss the money from the till; I took the account of the cash that day, but did not notice this morning what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prosecutor say he would not prosecute him if he would confess? A. No - I was not there all the time.</p>

The prisoner was quite a stranger, but I called him on the 14th of September to buy two coats of me - he bought one for 6s. 6d.; the other, which was a beadle's coat, he said was too dear - I asked him 2l. for that; 1l. 13s. had been offered me for it before - it had gold lace on it; when he laid down the 6s. 6d. for the other coat I was looking at the money, and he took the beadle's coat and left the one which he had bought of me - I did not miss it for an hour, till my husband came home; the prisoner had a brown coat, sewn in the sleeve with light thread - he lifted up his arm, shewed it to me, and said he was a very poor man; I met him on the Wednesday, and accused him of it - he said he knew nothing of me, and never bought any thing of me; I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? A. No - these old-clothes men are very much alike; I did say when I saw him that he was not the man, but I had not then had a good look at his face - I looked at him in the face, and then said he was the man; the beadle's coat was provided by the parish, but it is allowed to my husband - the prisoner gave his address correctly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to say he was not the man? A.Because I was not sure, and he had not the same coat on - I do not swear to his coat, but to his features.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DUNN. Q. Had he not more time to run away the first time you went for the water, than afterwards? A. Yes, as I had to get the glass ready; there was no other person in the shop - when he came back with the guitar he said he had gone after a friend; I thought he was a singular character when I saw him in the shop.</p>

            . I am one of the new Police. On the 20th of October I saw the prisoner at the top of Oxford-street, about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's - he had a guitar in his hand; a little boy gave me information - I went to the prosecutor, and found the prisoner in the next shop with the guitar; he said he only took it to run after a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him returned with it? A. Yes, but when I first saw him he was going from the house - he must have gone round to have returned.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

            . I was in the prisoner's service; on the Thursday before Conner was taken I saw him at my master's - he came for some draught phials, and had two baskets with him with something in them, but I do not know whether these are the baskets - he staid, I suppose, a quarter of an hour; I was paving in the yard, but I could see him - there was no sale of bottles of this kind, or I should have seen it; to my certain knowledge there were no such bottles as these in the shop - there are some fish-kettles there in which nails are put; I saw Conner go away and take the baskets which he brought - I took in the phials which he bought on the Friday; I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Conner seldom came to the shop? A. He deals in bottles, and calls there sometimes - I went there on the 28th, but I have worked there before; I have seen Conner there twice - I do not know what was in his baskets when he was at the house - they were talking about the phials; he was to have them at 8d. a dozen - I took them on Friday, and brought my master the money - I never saw such bottles as these on my master's premises; I do not believe he would buy them, they are so very conspicuous - I have known him to turn away a great many things that came to the shop, because he was afraid they might be stolen - I never saw a doctor's bottle in his house; he deals in phials - these would not sell in his shop; he does not sell to doctors.</p>

The prisoner lodged with me about two months - on the Thursday night in question, I saw him at eleven o'clock, when I came in with a pint of beer; I asked him if they were all in - he said Yes; I locked and bolted the door - I had a pair of shoes to make that night; I began them at half-past eleven o'clock, and finished them about four - about three in the morning I went down, and asked him if he had a bit of candle; he jumped up in his bed, and told me to take it off the table - about five o'clock I went down again, to fill the tea-kettle, and saw him getting up, and putting on his smock-frock.</p>

No - I did work at Mr. Plumber's, a shoemaker, at Laytonstone; I left the key of the door in the lock that night - my house is half a mile from Stamford-hill; I had nothing to do with the fowls - he left my house about half-past five o'clock on Friday morning; I did not give evidence before the Magistrate, but I was present.

            . I am servant to Mr. Caunter. On Saturday morning, the 26th of September, about half-past nine o'clock, Pheny came to the house with some fish; I said I thought it was a mistake, as there was none ordered - Miss James came out of the dining-room and said he might leave it or take it away, which he pleased - he left it and went away; he had not then been in any room - he came again in half an hour; I went up stairs to speak to Miss James, leaving him on the mat in the passage - I was gone about five minutes; when I came down I told him to wait a few minutes - a person came in, and I paid him for the fish; the parlour opened into that passage.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner never accounted to me for these monies; he has taken out bread every day since, and brought the money home - I had not asked him about this money before I discharged him, and then I told his wife of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know he did not account for this money? A. By the book - that is not here; he was discharged on the 16th of September, and on the 23rd he was apprehended; if he had paid this money to me it would have been in the book - he has paid monies to my wife when I was not at home; he has very likely paid her 2l. - I have played at cards with him in the bake-house for a drop of drink.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you discharged him on the 16th of September? A. Yes; he had for seven days before that brought me no money from Mr. Potter; I go by the book; when I went round to my customers I gave Mr. Potter a bill for seven loaves, and he said, "I don't owe you a farthing - I have paid every day;" I could recollect he had not paid for some days, independent of my book -I know he did not pay this money from the other witness, because they had owed eight loaves for some time, and he paid three loaves off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He has not taken his scores regularly, but it has gone three or four days; if these persons have paid me, I am certain I paid it.</p>

On the 15th of October I had been out at work in a barn, just opposite my house; I have three children, who were out, and my wife was out at work; I had left the house at breakfast time, locked the door, and had the key with me - the windows were all fast; when I returned, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I found the iron bar of the back window out - I unlocked the door, and went in; the back window opens into the garden, which has furze round it - I found the prisoner up stairs; I secured him, and brought him down - he said he was looking for his money; he had no business in the house - he had lodged there, and left on the Tuesday; this was Thursday; he had not left any money there, I am certain - I took him to Whittingham; we went before the Magistrate, and brought him to the Swan - Whittingham searched him there, and found a silk handkerchief of mine on him; I am sure it is mine - he said it belonged to me, but did not say how he came to take it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What wages were due to her when she left? A. A quarter of a year, 3l. 8s. - there was 10s. 6d. due to a cash account which she had laid out besides - the family never borrowed money of her; I never borrowed 6d. of her - I borrowed about 3s.; she pawned her shawl for her own use to drink, not for ours; the 10s. 6d. was for things she had bought in the course of the week for the family - when she asked for money it was given to her; she never to my knowledge pawned things for our family; her wages were paid the day she was committed - there are twelve of us in family; we were in rather embarrassed circumstances; none of my brothers or sisters are here - they say they never authorised her to pawn things.</p>

No - I believe she told me who she was, and where she came from; I have not inquired whether her address was correct - I let her go, and then took her again: I said she must have given it to some person, or thrown it over the garden wall; I did not say I let her go because I thought two other women had taken it, nor that I was going after two other persons - the prisoner was ordered to appear at Worship-street, and she was there about five hours before I was; I do not know exactly the time I got there - I let her go at first because I found nothing on her, though I had seen her take it.</p>

On the 24th of September, at half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner with this carpet, in Albany-street, about two hundred yards from the carpet-ground; I asked where he got it - he said from the carpet-ground, and that he was going to Newport-market; I said, "Where is your stick?" he said, "I belong to the ground, and we leave them there;" I again said, "Where are you going to take it?" he then said to Oxford-market, then to the Plasterers' Arms, and then to the Queen's Arms: I went to the carpet-ground - the master said the prisoner had been forbidden to come to the ground, and if the carpet had been left there it should have been taken to him, as he was answerable for it; the prisoner said he had been working with Waugh, who had left the carpet for him to carry.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were three of them fighting together; she was so intoxicated she was forced to be dragged to the watch-house - she first said she lost 8s., and then 14s.; at the watch-house, when she saw the half-sovereign, she said I took that - I knew I had the half-sovereign, but I wanted to keep it back to give my sister in the morning, when I thought I should be let out- I never said she was my grandmother; I was going to Mr. Robinson's, a hair-dresser, at Bow, for whom I had worked; the prosecutrix, a man, and a woman were fighting - she asked me to wipe her face, and I did; she then forced me into a gin-shop, to have something to drink, and when we came out she said I had robbed her.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How near were you to the woman when you saw the watch go? A. About four yards; I saw it go - Read took it from Smith when she went to rescue her, and passed it to a young man behind; it appeared to me to be a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.You saw it pass to some person who ran away? A. Yes; he put it into his right-hand pocket - that was not Newman; I never told the last witness I had changed my mind and that it was; Newman was on the spot - there was a struggle between the prosecutor and the woman, before the man who ran away received the watch; to the best of my knowledge Newman took no part in it.</p>

I said she flung her arms round, and some one took it, but I could not tell who; I saw Newman examined twice - the women were brought up first, and then twice afterwards; I was not told that one of the witnesses said Newman was not the man.</p>

I counted the bobbins of silk at eight o'clock in the morning of the 14th of October and missed some; the prisoner came to work - I saw him put his hat on a box, and his handkerchief fell out of it; he went to work, and when he went to his handkerchief, I saw the bobbins which I had missed full of silk, fall from his hat, and they were empty; I got out of my loom and took them up; I got an officer, and he was taken to the watch-house at eleven o'clock - at one, he said if I would let him out he would go to work, and never do any thing of the kind again - I had a good character with him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What wages did you give him? A.Fifteen shillings a week and a bushel of coals; there was no arrear of coals due - he booked the coals himself up to the 5th of September; he has lately opened a shop: he told me of it, and I said he might do what he pleased -I discharged him on the 5th of October; he said there were five bushels of coals due to him, but I did not know of this then; sometimes he booked them, and sometimes I did - I do not believe there were any due to him; the book will prove there were not thirty-six bushels due to him.</p>

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Thompson, of Berwick-street. I have known the prisoner five years; he called on me one morning, about five weeks ago, and asked me to pawn him a dozen knives, which he had bought of his master at trade price - I pawned them for him for 10s.; he called at one o'clock, and I gave him the money and duplicate - in three weeks he called again, said he had taken them out of pawn, and asked me to pawn them again, which I did, at Mr. Harrison's - I gave him the money and duplicate at dinner time: he came again last Monday fortnight, said he had taken the knives out of pawn, and asked me to pawn them again; I went with them to Mr. Harrison's, who said, "I have several of these knives - I must know where they come from, and detain you;" I was frightened, and ran out of the shop: I was taken three days afterwards - he gave me these salt-cellars five months ago, for my good behaviour to him, and giving him something when he was out of place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you lived in your place? A. Five or six years; I pawned these on my way to my master's shop - I do not know the prosecutor, but I know his shop. I kept these salts in my own room, but I did not know they were stolen; I thought he had bought them of his master - I did not suspect the knives were stolen; I had not sold any.</p>

Price's wharf - he put a barrel of tar into a boat; I went and told him to bring his boat too, but he pushed off - I sprang my rattle; he hung down his head, and pulled off till he got one-third across the river - he then let the boat that had the tar in it drift against a lighter; the Police-boat came up - I said, "Go, and take that boat;" they went and took the prisoner, and then brought Mr. Dawson's boat, which had the tar in it.</p>

I said No, and told him he was to go himself; I said that from the directions I had received - While we were talking together, Aldred the officer came up, and asked me what it was about; I told him the circumstances, and he took the prisoner in charge - we went to Masterman's together; the prisoner had beckoned me over to him, before I went up to him; as we went along, I heard him say to Aldred, that it was all right, he had been there the night before.</p>

I was in Cannon-street, near the London Life Insurance Office, on the 18th of September - my attention was attracted by Perkins and the prisoner talking; in consequence of what passed I took the prisoner into custody - he said in my hearing that he came into possession of the cheque from a person at No. 78, Grosvenor-street, or Grosvenor-square, I will not be certain which; this was before we got to the banking house, and before we got there he said he was at Masterman's the night before with a cheque, and I should find it all right - on arriving there Brand identified him, and said, "You are the young man who presented a cheque here last night;" the prisoner made no answer -I took him into the office and searched him, and heard him say he was the young man who had been there the night before; as I took him to the Compter, after his examination, he said, "I have one thing I wish to state to you;" he put out his hands - I shook hands with him, and said, "If it is any thing to benefit you, I shall be happy to hear it, if not, say nothing;" he said, "What I want you to do will be the means of clearing me of this altogether - if you will go up to the corner of St. Martin's-lane, near Orange-street, Leicester-fields, you will there see a young man, between the hours of half-past five and six o'clock; his dress will be a blue coat, with yellow buttons, and trousers, or a green coat with yellow buttons"- I said, "Can you give me any further description of the young man;" he said, "He has a roundish face, fresh colour, dark hair, smoothed over his face," and that he was to meet him there, if he got the money, and give it him- I went there with White, my brother officer, at the time he stated, and waited till half-past six o'clock, but saw nobody at all answering his description; I afterwards went to the Feathers, in Orange-street, kept by Page - that is eight hundred or a thousand yards from the place I was desired to go to; I went there because the prisoner had told me he lodged there the night before, and was well known to Mr. Page - a room was pointed out to me there, which I searched, and found these strips of paper(looking at them) - I found all these in the room on the first search; some in the fire-place, some on the floor, and some on the cill just outside the window of the room- I marked them; on the Saturday I searched the dustcellar in that house, and found these papers which I produce - they have never been out of my possession.</p>

In the office - I have given you the paper to write, and seen you write several times; I have ordered you out of the office several times to write, and have known Mr. Young to do so, and not allow you to write in the office, but have seen you write in the office several times - it is my belief this is your hand-writing; I am sure it is not Mr. Young's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have seen him write several times, and should not know his writing; I am well aware that he is not acquainted with mine. Witness. The papers are not in my writing.</p>

            . ESQ. I am the son of John Smith, who is a banker - I have lived in Grosvenor-square; there is no No.72 in the square - I think the last number is 44; my father was out of town at the time this cheque is dated, and I think the whole of September - I was in town the greatest part of the month; I know nothing of the prisoner - I am not aware of having seen him before; my father had so dealings with the prisoner, to my knowledge - he lives at No.22, Grosvenor-square; I am not aware of any other John Smith living in Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>The cheque was here put in and read; also the papers which had the words "Please to pay Mr. John Smith, 75. A. 
               <persName id="t18291029-127-person1031">Geo. Young</persName>
            ," and parts of other words composing the cheque.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to CHRISTOPHER PERKINGS. Q. Are you certain whether I told you No.32 or 72? A. I understood you 72, and am sure you said Grosvenor-square.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told him Leicester-square. On Thursday, the 17th of September, a gentleman I know very well to have been at the Horse-bazaar, having horses there, met me by accident in Leicester-square. and asked me to go to the Bank for him, to draw the money for a horse and gig he had sold on Saturday; it was customary for them to give a cheque four days after the sale - he said he had received it four days before, and had not time to go- I had frequently seen him in the counting-house and yard: he went by the name of Smith: he desired me to meet him again at nine o'clock that evening - I went to the banker's; the gentleman said he was under a heavy penalty if he paid it, wrote "Not dated, &amp;c.," and returned it to me to get another more correct; I took it to the gentleman at the time appointed - he was in company with another gentleman; I handed him the cheque - he said he would give it to Young and get another; I was to meet him at the top of Martin-street, Leicester-square, at nine o'clock next morning; he gave me the cheque, and desired me on no consideration to go myself, but to employ a Temple porter - he gave me 1s. to pay the porter: I had no money myself, and thought I could not get a porter there for that money - I went on to the lane, gave this man the job, and told him to come to me, not to the public-house in the lane, but to another in Cannon-street; I waited a considerable time for him, and a few minutes after I saw him going up the lane with another person - I called him over, and asked if he had received the money; he said No, I had better go myself; I said I would - this gentleman came and took me to the banking-house, and asked me several question, which I answered as well as I could; Mr. Gates asked if he went with me, whether I could find the gentleman - I said not till the time appointed, half-past five o'clock, but he would not give me an opportunity of going then, or I dare say I could have pointed him out.</p>

            . I am an inspector of counterfeit coin for the Mint. Here is an impression on this large mould; I find some letters, and a portion of the impression - here is E.O. and the top of R, then a space and an E., a space large enough for three letters - then S., and then distinctly III. D.E., a faint impression of I.G., a space for one letter, the top of A. and the cross top of

            - here is a small portion of the graining sunk on the edge; the mould is the size of a half-crown.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do the parts you have pointed out correspond with the parts of the obverse side of a current half-crown of the Realm? A.Precisely so, as far as they go; they appear to be impressed by a genuine half-crown; the metal produced is such as is used to counterfeit coin by this process - and a file is frequently used to file the edges, where the channel of the mould went; the other things produced are such as are used in this process of coining.</p>

            . I am inspector of the Police of Acton. On Sunday night, the 18th of October, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, I was on duty in Pigwell-field, near the park road, in Acton parish, and heard some footsteps; a little farther I saw the prisoner, just by the gate which divides Pigwell-field from Park-road - he was on the footpath - Clark, the officer, who was with me, first got up to him; I laid hold of him by the arm, and asked where he was going - he said home; I asked where that was - here plied to Barton's court, Hoxton; I asked where he had been to - he said to the Bird Cage, at Stamford-hill; there is a public-house of that sign - I asked what brought him that way, as it was not in his road from there to Hoxton - he said surely a gentleman might take a walk, which way he liked; I said it appeared to me rather strange he should take a walk that way at that late hour in the night - I and Clark took him to the watch-house, supposing there was something amiss; I saw Clark search him - the prisoner pulled off his coat, put his arms out, and said, "Now, search me;" nothing was found in his coat, but the skirts of it were wet - after Clark had done searching the coat, he went up to the prisoner, took of his hat, and in it was this silver tea-caddy (produced by Clark) - when his hat was laid down there was likewise some leaves of privet and quickthorn came from his hat; I then assisted in searching him, and found him wet nearly up to his knees - I desired him to pull off his shoes, and they had then got water in them, as though he had recently come out of some water. I know Miss Flower's house; I first saw him about two hundred and fifty yards from their house, going by the road way, but by going over the field at the back of the house, it is about fifty yards nearer - in coming that way a person would have a ditch of running water, about two feet wide, to cross; it is generally about eighteen inches deep - when I met him he was going as if he had come from the field where that ditch was. On the Monday morning I went to the prosecutrixs' house, examined the field and the ditch - I traced footsteps from the house, across the field, to a gap in the hedge, one side of which is privet, and the other quickthorn; after returning through the house, I went the road way into the field, and observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290045"/>an appearance of some person having slipped down the bank of the ditch into the water.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he had found the caddy? A. I asked where he got it- he said he picked it up; I have heard other property was picked up about the fields and road - a woman, who was in charge of the house, was taken up, the ladies being absent in the country: I have heard the son of a woman who was in the house has absconded - the woman was held to bail before the Magistrate; I do not know whether she is in custody now; I have inquired every where for her son, and cannot meet with him - I have searched for him; there were three examinations before the Magistrate - I am not aware of any witness being here who knew he was living in the house; I have searched for him to bring him to trial.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you ever see the prisoner before? A. No; I have not seen my brother since the robbery - he lived with my mother, about five minutes' walk from Miss Flowers'; I do not know where my mother is -I cannot tell whether my brother took the portmanteau out and hid it in the ditch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had your brother been from sea? A.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do these goods refer to this indictment? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How soon after the robbery did you see the house? A. On the Monday morning, four or five days after - how it was entered I cannot tell; the bills of exchange were not due at the time - they are worth 100l. - I lost three, but the other was over due, and 12l. had been paid on it - the other two were for 50l. each; the amount of the other property taken out was 15l. or 20l; I believe it is all here - I have no partner.</p>

            . I pawned these books with Priest; the prisoner brought them to me on the 3rd of July, 1828, at Lambeth, where I then lived - I have known him for years; he is a gold wire-drawer by trade, and has been in the habit of selling books on commission; I am a cabinet-maker's plumber, and have sold books for some time - the prisoner was indebted to me, having boarded ten months with me; he agreed to let me have 1l. out of the money I pawned them for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you name some person for whom you have worked within the last three months? A.Business has been very bad, but I have worked for Lazenby and Son; I have not had 2s. 6d. a night for debating at a room in Spitalfields - I do not remember ever receiving a farthing in my life, for debating any where; I did belong to a Mechanic's Institution -I did go away to avoid being arrested for 33l., but certainly did not abscond under the imputation of taking a sum of money belonging to that society - I never went by any other name than my own; I pawned the books in my wife's name, as I thought it not very respectable, and my family are respectable - I have been in pawnbrokers' shops a hundred times, but I never pawned a book in my life that did not belong to me, except in this way, and these I thought did belong to me; I had a library of books when I kept a coffee shop on Clerkenwell-green, and with them, and my father's library I set up a book shop, in April, 1827 - I did live in Oakley-street, and removed to the next street; I was offered a sum of money to leave - I remember attending at Guildhall in consequence of a most injurious report in the Morning Herald, respecting my coffee-shop on Clerkenwell-green, but I am not conscious of attending at any other time; a pickpocket of the name of Smith was there; I did not go to give evidence, I went respecting my own business, but I think Sir Peter Laurie did put a question to me -I did not state that it was my constant practice to receive books, handkerchiefs, and other things from the persons who frequented my coffee-shop, not any thing of the kind - I was secretary to the Mechanics' Institution; my bro- did pay 70l. or 80l., because there was a deficiency in the account, but not to prevent my being prosecuted; there had been three secretaries, and when I returned from Paris, there was a regular arrangement of all the monies paid and received; there was a deficiency of 70l. or 80l., but all the monies I had were given up.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.You have stated you are a bookseller? A. Yes, and have been so for two years; I do not now keep a public shop - my business was very bad, and I was anxious to get into any other; I have been in the tin plate-working business, it is connected with my own - I have followed no other business, that I recollect; since I have been in the book business, I have occasionally pawned books, when I have wanted a little money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you miss any thing from your stock? A. I could not at the time, as I was in bed; I could not ascertain that there was a deficiency - I bought the oats and hay of Mr. Curtis, a salesman in Smithfield; he sells a great deal to others - it is not uncommon for beans and peas to be mixed.</p>

Turner,"What have you in your cart?" he said dung - I said, "I am an officer, have you nothing else? I must see," and I got into the cart; I found a truss of hay under some dung, and then I saw a bag - I put my hand on it and said, "That is what I have been looking for;" I told Turner to stay in the cart, and I would give him a ride to the watch-house - Oxer ran away; as I was going to the watch-house Turner opened the bag and shot the oats in front of the cart, but they fell inside - he said, "D - n the fellow, I wish I had had nothing to do with him; he has brought me into a pretty mess" - I afterwards found Oxer, and knew him again; I said he must go with me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Under what circumstances Turner got these, you do not know? A. No; Oxer ran away while I was contending with Turner - I had followed the cart about forty yards; Mr. Sermon came, owned the cart, and I found Turner belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Turner's Defence. I did not know about the hay and corn - I understood it belonged to this man.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go before the Magistrate? A. Yes - I saw a person before the Magistrate, but the prisoner seems different; there is some similarity - he certainly does not appear to me to be the same; the person I saw before the Magistrate was the same person I had seen at the shop, to the best of my belief - I do not think I expressed any doubt at the office; in the dress he had on then he seemed more fresh to my recollection than now - this deposition is signed by me; it is merely the dress, I suppose, that makes the difference in his appearance - I believed he was the man, certainly; I said,"The prisoner came into my shop," that is true; I had not doubt he was the man then.</p>

The prisoner came to our cottage yesterday week, about five minutes before five, or it might be ten minutes - he was rather intoxicated; I sent my daughter for his wife, and she came a few minutes after - the prisoner staid about half an hour, and I went home with him to his own cottage, some little distance below mine - he lodged with me about six months from March last.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know Wimpole-street? A. No; these cottages are at the bottom of the wharf, near the Grand Junction Canal - the streets are not named; I know a Wimpole-street, Marylebone - I should think it is about two miles off; I do not often see the prisoner - I do not minute the time when he comes to see me, but my children were coming from school, and I told them to come home before five, as I had some things to send home to the Elm Tree-road - the prisoner left me about eight or nine weeks ago - it may be eleven weeks; I know his wife - I understood he was a painter by trade; I never heard any thing against him - if he had asserted in this Court that he had been tried and convicted I would not believe it; I think I saw him on the Thursday - I see him almost every day; I believe I had seen him on the Wednesday - I do not think I saw him on the Monday or the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>ANN ROGERS. My husband is a journeyman carpenter - we live at No. 5, Earl-street, Lisson-grove. I was working for Hanner yesterday week at her cottage, as a laundress - I saw the prisoner there that evening; he had a blue coat on and a great coat over it - he was not quite sober - he had been drinking; this was nearer five o'clock than four - I recollect his leaving to go home.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290056"/>COURT. Q. What made you tell us the coloured coat he had on? A. I had no particular reason - I have seen him a great many times; my husband does not know him - I do not know much of him; I never changed ten words with him - I remember the time because I was ironing a dress that was to go home at five o'clock; I have seen the prisoner with a brown great coat, and I think he had it on then - I never heard any thing against him; Mrs. Hanner told me to come here - I did not go before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know a person named Boyd? A. Yes; he receives money from me, for finishing the houses - I bought the property of Mr. Staley, who pays Boyd; Boyd has the power of letting the houses - he is to have them at a certain price; I had paid for these sashes in the purchases - they were there when I purchased the property; the prisoner did not make them - I saw sashes in the house before I knew the prisoner - I cannot swear they were these.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you proprietor of the ground? A. I have the lease of eleven houses; I advance money to the builders, and then grant leases; the prisoner applied about a lease of that house - I said when it was complete I should have no objection to grant a lease to him, or any one that Staley had appointed; this was five months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not your agreement with the Brewers' company, that the houses were to be fit for inhabiting at a given time? A. Yes, and they are not - I am not certain that they will not be taken from me.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I assisted in making the sashes for this house; I received money from Mr. Staley - I fixed up these sashes before the prisoner engaged to finish the house; I had made the basement sashes, and some of the attics, before he entered into any agreement with me. On the 28th of September, I saw the prisoner with one sash in his hand; I said, "What are you going to do with that?" he said, "Stop me if you dare" - I said, "I shall stop the sash;" this is the one - it was a quarter-past twelve o'clock in the day; the sashes were then out of the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do not you know that he made a claim of right to them? A. No - there was no agreement between him and me that he was to finish the house in a certain time, or to forfeit the things in it; there was no such agreement made with my son-in-law, to my knowledge; I made an agreement with the prisoner, in the presence of my son-in-law,

I saw the prisoner on the 13th of October, about eleven o'clock in the morning, in the Commercial-road; she asked me to go home with her - I went to a house, occupied by Mr. Davies, with her, and to one of the chambers up stairs; I said I would go and get something to drink - she said I should send: I said I wanted change for a half-sovereign - she called Davies to get it; she brought me back 9s. 3d. change, and half a pint of gin. When I went to the house I had a 5l. note, ten sovereigns, a half-sovereign and a shilling; I gave Davies 3d., and the prisoner 2s., and then a half-crown; I took off my jacket, and put it under the head of the bed, and laid down on the bed - the prisoner had part of her clothes off; she went out of the room, got a wash-hand basin, turned it down, and sat upon it - I heard some money rattle, got up, and said, "You are robbing me;" she said, "I am not - lie still:" I got my jacket, and missed six sovereigns - she went down, and went out of the house; I followed her, and she called me a scaley fellow - I went back, put on my things, and got an officer; we went to the house which she had gone into, but she had escaped; the officer found her - she ran into a rag-shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had you been on shore? A. I came on Saturday week; I had been paid that day, and went straight to the Commercial-road, where I met her; I had not taken any beer or spirits - I did not invite her to go with me; I should have gone on board at one o'clock - the first thing we had at the house was half a pint of gin; we then had the same again, but the woman who brought it drank with us - we afterwards had half a pint of rum; I will not swear we had no more - I might be two hours in the house - I was not tipsy, but a little animated; she had 4s. 6d. of me besides the liquor - I counted my money in the house, while she was gone for Davies to get the liquor; she did not see it - it was all in one pocket - any person might have taken the whole; I am sure I gave her no sovereigns - I did not drink so much as she did: she was rather tipsy - she was taken in about half an hour.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What house did she come out of with the sailor? A. Out of Davies', and went to her own house; she was dragging him by the hand, and said if he would come with her she would make all right - he left her in her own house to get the officer; in going to the office she said her things were loose - the officer said, "Tie them;" she then put her hand into her pocket-hole, broke the string, and let her pocket fall.</p>

            . I was at Mr. Allen's when Spicer's husband came and said there was something wrong; the prisoner was not there then - I went to Fox's room, and sent for the officer; she denied having any of the prosecutor's money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Q. Did not you ask Allen if he would let you have some money, and he gave you 3d.; you said that was not enough, and then he gave you a halfpenny, and under it was a shilling? A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any sovereign? A. Yes - she took two sovereigns, and threw them on the floor; the officer took the other from her - she then threw two sixpences on the floor.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. Spicer's husband came to me, and said, "I believe Fox has robbed Allen" - I went and found 15s. 5d. in her hand, and these two sovereigns and a sixpence on the floor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me a sovereign to get half a pint of gin - I got it; I gave him the change, and he put it into his waistcoat-pocket - I went home to tea; before I drank the second cup he sent for me again -I went, and said, "What do you want?" he said, "To speak to you in particular;" there were five or six people in the room drinking gin - all those people went out except one, and then he sent for 3d. of brandy; he took it with some warm water, and had his bed made - Spicer afterwards came to me, and said Allen wanted to speak to me; I went to him - he gave me a shilling to get three quarters of a pint of gin; he then put this money into my hand, and said, "Keep this till to-morrow morning" - I said, "Allen, I don't wish to have any thing to do with it;" he said, "Take it, if it were 20l. I should not be afraid to trust you with it;" he was very much intoxicated- he had been drinking all day; next morning he met my husband, and said, "Fox, your wife can clear herself at Queen-square if she will say but two or three words - tell her to say I gave her that money to sleep with me last night."</p>

            , imported by the ship Isabella; they could obtain possession of it by an order signed by them (looking at the document in question) this is the order on which wine is delivered or transferred at the dock - it is the only authority required by the dock company; if genuine it would entitle the party named in it to take the wine away at once, or to transfer it into his own name: if he chose it to remain he would have a warrant enabling him to transfer the wine by endorsement to any party he chose, or to deliver it to any one - he could take it away by giving an order to deliver to bearer; I saw the order in question presented by the prisoner, on the 29th of December, but whether to me or to Blackwood, I cannot say - he stood just by; I know that five pipes of wine have been delivered to that order.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know who lodged these wines in the dock? A. They were regularly entered by Donaldson, and arrived in November, 1827 - were then entered in the name of Donaldson, and on the 18th of December, 1828, were entered by Donaldson to George and Thomas Cussons; three pipes of the wine were delivered on the 18th of March last, one on the 30th, and one on the 12th of May - one still remains in the docks; Cussons lodged a caveat against the delivery after four pipes had been delivered - the fifth was delivered to C. Pamenter, to whom it had been transferred by Field, to whom the sale had been made; they could exchange hands by endorsing the transfer on the warrant - it is a power which transfers property by endorsement, like a bill of exchange.</p>

            . I am an agent, and carry on a cotton spinning and manufacturing business at Manchester, in partnership with my brother George. The prisoner was in our employ up to December last as agent; I was on the continent, and knew nothing of this wine (looking at the order) my name is written here, but it is not my writing - my brother's name is not here; I never authorized the prisoner to sign it, or to use my signature, nor did my brother, to my knowledge: I never gave him authority, directly or indirectly, to take these wines out of the docks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew nothing of the transfer? A. No - it took place after my departure for the continent;(looking at a paper) this has my signature, and my brother's; the prisoner carried on our town business, and was to be paid 5 per cent. on goods sold, and not to be answerable for bad debts - he had carried on business for us about thirteen months; he has not been obliged to raise money for that purpose, to my knowledge - I do not know one way or the other; my brother sent Jones up in January last to look into our affairs - I was in Flanders at the time: I have not detained the prisoner in custody for the amount of these wines.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you leave for the continent in December? A. Yes - on the 14th; when I left there was a balance in the prisoner's favour, of upwards of 100l. - I left a bill for 135l. in his hands, also a balance of 100l., which I told him he must cash out.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain what you mean by a balance - was it due to you or the prisoner? A. Due to us; he was indebted to us 100l. - money collected, and due to us.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Then why did you leave the bill in his hands? A. In case he should want it, besides the 100l.</p>

            . I am in partnership with my brother. The signature to this order is not my hand-writing; I never authorized any person to sign it for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in England? A. Yes, at Manchester; the prisoner corresponded with us from time to time on business; I do not know of his borrowing money of Picton - I had a note which was given to Picton, but cannot find it; I had a note signed Picton - it was a copy, not the original; I cannot find it - I had it last January, it was signed by Picton as a promissory note to the prisoner for 19l. - I had it from Jones, my brother-in-law; I first spoke to the prisoner respecting this wine about February; I had sent Jones up to watch his conduct - I came to town myself on the 11th of January, and knew nothing about the transfer of the wine till that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not then apprised that the warrants for the wine had been deposited with Picton as security for the 19l.? A.Jones told me Trueman had deposited the order with Picton for 19l. - he knew of the prisoner doing it - when I came to town the prisoner was arrested for debt; I lodged a detainer against him the beginning of January for 200l. - this wine was included in that 200l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you never taken off that detainer? Never; because he owes us the amount in addition to the wines - I did not lodge a detainer for the whole amount he owed us - I included the wine; but have since ascertained that he owed us more money - we took the wine into the account for which we detained him; the value of the wine alone is 270l. - I knew he owed us 200l. independent of the wine, at the time the detainer was lodged; I had no knowledge of the forgery then - I knew he had dealt improperly with the wine on the 11th of January, and lodged the detainer after that.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. At the time you lodged the detainer, did you know whether your brother might not have authorised him to make the order? A. I did not know the order had been made.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You meant in your detainer to include the value of it, or part of it? A. I did; I knew it was in the name of Trueman at that time; I got a detainer for the criminal charge in September - I ascertained the order to be a forgery at the end of February, on my brother's return, and gave the business into my attorney's hand to proceed against the dock company - when I found out the forgery I did not go to the docks, as Trueman had told Jones my brother had transferred them to him before he went on the continent; I did not treat the wine as a civil suit in June -I included the wine in the detainer.*</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any transactions with the prisoner for goods sold and delivered except this wine? A. Yes; there was 48l. deficient in stock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any demand against him for goods sold and delivered? A. For 48l. deficient in stock, and he had overdrawn his commission; the 48l. was for goods he had from us.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean that you had sold them to him? A. He had taken them and sold them of his own accord, and overdrawn us for them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you lodged the detainer, you had no positive certainty of the exact amount of your debt? A. I knew it was 200l. besides the wine - but the wine was included by my solicitor - I did include the wine.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Cussons. About the 20th of December I was at their place of business in town, which is in Basing-lane, and saw the prisoner - there were a number of work people in the place; I asked what they were - he said they were cottonwinders in the prosecutors' employ, and were waiting for their wages; I asked why he did not pay them - he said he could not, Thomas Cussons having gone on the continent on the Sunday previous, and he had only a bill of exchange - he asked me to cash the bill, which I declined, and asked why he did not sell the wines? he said he could not without the signature of the firm.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CUSSONS re-examined. The average weekly sums paid to the work people was from 8l. to 10l.; he supplied himself with that money from the general proceeds of goods sold - I knew there was a scarcity of money when I</p>

            . I am Messrs. Cussons' brother-in-law. On the 1st of January I was sent up to the town establishment - the prisoner told me Mr. Thomas Cussons had transferred the wine to him - he did not say when.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not tell you that, in order to raise money to pay the work people, he had been obliged to raise 19l. through Picton on these wines? A. He did; and that if I would repay the 19l. the wines would be my brother's again - but he specified no time; he said in a few days the money would be returned - I went with him in the course of the week to Picton; Picton told me he would go with me to the person who he (Picton) had transferred the warrant to, if I would call on him in a few days; he would not tell me who it was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.As soon as you saw him, you told him you had heard he had transferred the wines? A. I had not heard of it, but I found a paper in the books purporting that he had received 19l. on the wines, and spoke to him about it - he said he had raised 19l. on them to pay wages and expences.</p>

             re-examined. I was a porter in the prosecutors' employ; I slept in the same room as Metzger in another bed - I was disturbed in the night by a noise resembling a hammer and chisel knocking against the wainscoat and the door - there was valuable property kept in the room I slept in - there was cloth to a very considerable amount; my masters have a very extensive business; I got out of bed, directed my eyes towards the spot where I heard the noise, and saw a man with the whole of his body through the pannel of the door except one arm and one leg; (I awoke rather after Metzger) he had one hand through the pannel, and in that hand was a large tallow candle a light - it was the same kind of candle as our Journeymen use; I said, "Who are you?" using a vulgar expression - he said to me, "Silence! you old***, or we will shoot you;" I swore at him again, and told him I would shoot him with a blunderbuss which I had in the room, and was feeling for it at the time I was speaking - I found it, and presented it at him - he drew back immediately through the hole and ran away; the candle was in his hand all this time - I had an opportunity of seeing his person; the prisoner Sandford bears a strong resemblance to the man in point of stature, clothing, and dress; I only saw the white of his eye - his face was in the shade; I immediately ran out at the front door, and called Watchman! Thieves! and Murder! as loud as I could halloo; I was in my shirt - I saw Bannister the watchman at a distance - he came running towards me; I directed him down the mews; he ran towards the mews which our workshops come into - there is no other entrance to it; the men are never allowed to go through the house - I still kept calling for more assistance, and saw another watchman; I think it was Pethers - he ran towards the spot; I went in again directly at the front premises to dress - I examined the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290066"/>premises, and the inner door leading to the cutting-room, the pannel was cut through; I heard the piece of wood fall which awoke me - they had entered the premises by breaking away two wooden rails which are over the door in the mews; in the upper workshop I found a piece of was candle burning, and a large candle of the same description as the man had in his hand, burning also in the same candlestick; we never use wax candles - it is the first time I ever saw such a thing in the shop; we use very large tallow candles - the tallow candle was one such as I saw in the man's hand, and one was gone from one of the candlesticks; I saw a crow-bar and a chisel picked up, and the pieces of wood belonging to the door; I saw a phosphorus-box case produced by somebody on the premises - it was only the case; I knew Lesslie by his working at Mr. Stulzs' in the middle of last summer, in May or June - I never saw Sandford before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This was at two or three o'clock in the morning? A. Yes; I had been in bed; I was rather alarmed at being awoke, and much agitated.</p>

            . On the 25th of September I was watchman of Clifford-street, Bond-street - I heard a noise near Clifford-street; it was as near as I can recollect before two o'clock - I thought it was from Stulzs' premises, which come into Coach and Horses-yard, which is no thoroughfare; I listened for two or three minutes, heard no more, and proceeded on my rounds; about half-past two o'clock I went my round - all was quiet till I came into Clifford-street, to the front of Stulzs' premises, and then heard a voice sing out, "Watch! Murder! Thieves are in the house! they have broken into the back premises at the back of the mews:" I returned from there, and when I got to the entrance of the mews, I saw the prisoner Sandford coming up the Coach and Horses-yard mews - he was running, and coming up towards Boyle-street; I laid hold of him, seized him by the collar, and told him he should not go another inch from me - he levelled a pistol at me, and pulled the trigger, it burnt the priming in the pan; I saw that it flashed and missed fire in my face; I had hold of his collar at the time - it produced no effect on me; I did not let him go, and he then knocked me down; I cannot say whether it was with his fist or the butt end of the pistol - he struck me above the left temple, it did not turn out a contused wound; he got from me and went up Boyle-street, and I lost sight of him there because I was on the ground; I saw

             the Watchman, running after him - McDonough was not running; I did not see him till he had the prisoner in custody; I followed after Barham, and Clark singing Stop thief! and sprung my rattle - followed him up New Burlington-street and Regent-street into Fobears' passage; I did not see Sandford taken - I saw him after he was taken in McDonough's hands - he is a watchman; I lost sight of the man in turning.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether the man McDonough secured, was the man who you had collared, and who presented the pistol at you? A. Yes, I am certain of it; I had a very good view of him, by a light at the corner - he was in custody within three or four minutes of his knocking me down; I found a handkerchief in Regent-street, laying on the flag stones, and saw it picked up - it was in the course the prisoner had ran, when I saw it, and on being picked up, the prisoner said it was his; he was searched at the watch-house - a half-sovereign, a half-crown piece, a free-bottle and phosphorus-matches were found on him; there was no case for the bottle - there was part of a case, and a piece of wax candle; Buckland, the beadle of the night, searched him - the fire-bottle, matches, and candle were in his right-hand waistcoat pocket - I gave him in charge, returned with the officers, and examined the prosecutors' premises, with other persons; I found nothing, but saw the implements picked up, and two pieces of wood which came from over the fanlight of the back door, where they had got in, and a crow-bar - that is all I saw picked up; I examined the door, and parts of the back premises - we thought they had got in over the door, where the fan-light bars were taken down; it was large enough to admit a person - I saw, in the workman's room, a piece of wax candle found- it corresponded in size and appearance with that found on the prisoner. I saw Lesslie that evening, first about half-past eleven o'clock coming down Old Burlington-street, into Clifford-street; I know the Burlington Arms- he was not doing any thing there then - he asked me if I had seen a serjeant of the guards standing there with a girl; there had been a sergeant there with a woman - I told him I had seen him there, but they had not been there long; they were gone off my beat, and I had nothing more to do with them - he said, "I think they wanted to make a job of it to go down the mews, but the sergeant had not browns enough;" he went away up Clifford-street, turned round to Savill-row, towards Boyle-street, which is the nearest way to this mews; I saw Lesslie again about half-past twelve o'clock, or a quarter to one, coming round the same quarter as before, out of Old Burlington-street, by my box - he accosted me, and said it was a find night; I said it was - I came out of my box, and heard a noise, which I thought was some window shutters falling down (I did not ask his business at that time) I went to the top of Clifford-street - he followed me, and when I got to Savill-row, I saw

            , and told him what I had heard, and where I was going; I heard Evans say to Lesslie, "I think you are a Police-man, and are come to see what you can find out, before you come on duty;" Lesslie said, "I am not - I am a tailor, and working for Mr. Stulz;" Leslie asked if we would have anything to drink, meaning both of us - I told him there was no house open; he said, "If you will get the landlord up, Mr. or Mrs. Barry, I know them perfectly well - we have been spending the evening there - they know me well, and I will treat you with ale, if it is a dozen pots, or any thing you have a mind to drink;" this was at the Burlington Arms - I told him it was no use, for the house was shut up, and the people gone to bed, and would not open for any body; I then left him, went and called my rounds - I saw him again about ten minutes before two o'clock; I was in my box, and he wished me a good morning - I passed the compliment to him again, and saw no more of him; I did not ask what he was doing there - when I parted with him at a quarter before two o'clock, he turned up the top of Clifford-street, down towards Boyle-street, leading to the mews; that was a little before two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were not you a little frightened during the transaction? A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290067"/>No; I was rather burnt at first, by the priming of the pistol - I cannot say whether I was struck with the pistol or hand; I was not alarmed at all - I should not be alarmed in the least if a man fired within half an inch of me; I have fought for my country twenty-two-years - I should not be alarmed at being fired at - if I had a stick I would knock him down; I received a blow, either from the pistol or his fist - I was struck above the temple, and the blow knocked me down; I was not much hurt - I had my hat on, and my night-cap; I should not have gone to the public-house with Lesslie, if it had been open - I could have found plenty of houses open. if I had chosen; I am not on the beat now, the new Police have come there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you know Lesslie before? A. I never saw him before to my knowledge - it was about half-past eleven o'clock; it was not very light then - there are gas lights - I do not know whether he came out of the Burlington Arms, when he first spoke to me; I saw him come to the corner of my box- I did not see many other persons about there then; I saw the soldier and woman, but nobody else - I saw nobody else pass in that direction after this; it is not a great throughfare - I saw other people going a different way, in the course of the night; many persons observe to me about the night, as they pass - it was Evans told him he was a Police-man; he said he was a tailor, and worked for Mr. Stulz.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he say, "I am a tailor, and worked for Mr. Stulz," or "I am a tailor, and work for Stulz". A. He said, "I am a tailor, working for Stulz."</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Are you satisfied, whether he said he had worked for Stulz, or that he was then, at that time, working for him? A. He said he was working for him; he led me to suppose he was at that time working for Stulz - that is what he said to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.This conversation with Lesslie happened before you were knocked down, by the man you say is Sandford? A. Yes, two hours; my box where he spoke to me is, I suppose, two hundred yards from the mews, leading to Stulz's back premises - I always go into that mews, every half hour; I was then the watchman of that mews - I did not see the pistol picked up; I have seen it since - I could not see it sufficiently when it flashed, to see the size of it; I heard the cry of "Murder! Murder! Thieves are in the house!" as near as I can recollect it was about twenty minutes before three o'clock.</p>

            . I am a watchman of the same parish.

               <p>COURT. Q.Then, before you saw the man running, you saw him in the custody of Bannister? A. Yes, he had hold of him by the collar, and was scufflling - I first saw him at the end of the mews with Bannister, who was holding him by the collar; I saw the pistol flash, and he afterwards struck Bannister and knocked him down - he ran away; I pursued him, and Barham also - McDonough and a watchman caught him in Little Marlborough-street, he had been out of my sight for a moment when turning Fobears' passage, but not more - I pursued him into Fobears' passage; there was nobody running in the passage except the person who was secured - I swear it was the same person; Sandford is that person - I knew nothing of him before; Barham assisted McDonough in securing him - I afterwards returned to the mews. where Bannister had been knocked down, and found a piece of tallow candle and a pistol; I gave them to Schofield - there was a piece of red rag wrapped round the candle; it was something similar to a tailor's cutting - Regent-street is in the way I pursued him, and between the chapel and Fobears' passage, as I returned with the prisoner, I saw a handkerchief laying; one of the watchmen picked it up, and the prisoner claimed it as his - it was not given to him: he was by when it was picked up by McGill, a watchman - I did not see who he gave it to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Have you seen it since? A. No - it was not produced at the office; McGill is not here - I did not take the prisoner into custody myself; the person who took him, met him - he was not between me and the prisoner; the passage is in Regent-street - it is a very short passage, and has three or four houses in it; when I turned I saw the person turn into King-street - I saw him in the passage, and saw him turn out of the passage into King-street.</p>

            . On the 25th of September I was a waiter in the service of Scott and Freeman, Stevens' hotel, Bond-street, at the corner of Clifford-street; I had permission to go to my club that night - our door, which goes into Clifford-street, is next door to Messrs. Stulzs' house; I was coming home a little after two o'clock and heard an alarm of thieves and murder given from Stulzs' premises - I saw Bannister, the watchman, going down towards the mews, as he was directed, after the prisoner; I saw a person running from the mews towards Boyle-street - it was the prisoner Sandford; I heard Bannister desire him to stop - I saw him seize him, and saw Sandford present and flash a pistol at him; I saw him struck to the ground, and saw Sandford run - I pursued and joined Clark in the pursuit, over-run Clark, pursued him through Burlington-street into Regent-street, and saw a girl near the chapel; Sandford was running near the centre of the road - when he came up to the girl, he called out to her, Poll, and threw, apparently, a pistol towards her; I did not stay to see if she picked it up, but pursued him.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you saw the watchman struck to the ground, till you got to Marlborough-street, did you lose sight of Sandford? A. I did not - I saw him taken by McDonough, and assisted to take him to the watch-house; I never lost sight of him at all till he was taken - on our way to the watch-house with him I saw a pocket-handkerchief found, and he claimed it; on our road to the watch-house he said to me, "D-n and b-r your eyes, if it was not for you I should not have been apprehended" - when I got to the watch-house I saw him, searched by Buckland; a phosphorus-bottle and matches, half a sove<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290068"/>reign, half a crown, and some bread and cheese were found on him, and a piece of candle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many examinations were there at the office? A. Five, I believe - I never said I had lost sight of the person - I was examined twice; I believe it was the first and last time, and swear I did not say I lost sight of him.</p>

I saw Lesslie again coming from Savill-passage, about half-past one; the passage crosses Boyle-street, which leads down into the mews; he came from the passage to the corner, and surveyed me from head to foot, and said,"Talking of my being a Police-man, I should think you were one;" he again invited me to drink - I told him he knew very well there was no shop open, or he would not be so free to ask me; I left him at the corner of Boyle-street and Savill-row - on my return from the passage I saw no more of him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I produce the pistol and the charge which I drew from it, also a piece of tallow-candle, with a bit of red cloth round it; Clark, the watchman, gave them to me - a common crow-bar, with a piece of stocking tied round one end of it, to prevent a noise, I suppose; here is a piece of railing and the case of a phosphorus-bottle given me by Evans - a chisel and small saw given me by Rossiter Buckland has the phosphorus-bottle; I went to the prosecutors' premises some time afterwards, but did not examine the manner it had been done. On the Friday after the robbery I detained Lesslie at the office, and told him I had been after him for some days - I held out neither threat nor promise to him; I told him I had been after him respecting the robbery at Mr. Stulzs' - he said he was out of the way that he should not be taken into custody, which he expected; I said I should detain him, and about an hour after that he remained with me in the waiting-room; Bannister and Evans came in - I overheard them say, "That is the man that was where Sandford committed the robbery;" I desired them to point the man out, as several were there - they pointed Lesslie out; I then told Lesslie I must search him - he said I might; he made no reply to what was said - he said afterwards, as I took him backwards and forwards to prison, at different times, that he had known Sandford for upwards of eight years.</p>

I had, and left a summons for him to attend at Marlborough-street, Office the day before - I left it with his wife; he came to the office in consequence of the summons - that was seven days after the robbery; I had left the summons on Thursday, and he came on Friday.</p>

            . I was on duty at St. James' watch-house on Friday night, the 25th of September, and remember Sandford being brought in - I searched his person, and found a phosphorus-bottle, without a case; some phosphorus-matches, which I tried with the bottle, and they ignited, and a piece of wax candle; the phosphorus-bottle does not match the case - it is rather too large.</p>

            . I know Lesslie - he worked for Stulz and Co. for two or three months last summer. On the 16th of October I was at the office when the prisoners were being examined, and in consequence of a proposition made to me, I was locked up in the same cell with Lesslie - Sandford was at that time in an opposite cell, as his voice echoed from there.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see Sandford in the cell? A. No, but Lesslie hallooed out "Sandford!" and Sandford called out "Halloo!"</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I heard Lesslie call out Sandford! a voice said Halloo! Lesslie then said, "What a bl-d fool you were to send that letter;" I did not hear any answer to that - Sandford called Lesslie! he hallooed out Halloo! and Sandford said, "I have just seen my wife, and she says we are to be remanded for another week;" Lesslie said, with a bad expression, "Welcome, but how is that?" the voice said, "Because there has been a robbery in Clifford-street;" (I knew myself there had been a report of a robbery in Clifford-street, since ours) - Lesslie then said,"What! another robbery in Clifford-street - welcome; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290069"/>wish there had been a dozen, so as they got to the right house;" a voice from the opposite cell said, "I understand old Edge has sworn to the pistol," with a bad expression - Lesslie said, "Has the old b-r? why it was not his, was it? I thought it was Dickey's;" the conversation stopped between each sentence, for a little while, but at this time longer than usual, and then Sandford called Lesslie! and Lesslie said, "Hold your tongue, you b-r; a plant, a plant" - Lesslie knew I was in the place when he first came in, but it was so dark he could not recognize my features; the voice from the cell called out, "Shall you say any thing, Lesslie?" Lesslie then said, "No, not here: what will do you will do me;" Lesslie called Sandford! Sandford called Halloo! Lesslie called out Halloo! and said, "Oh, won't I give those b-g-r-d old watchman a pepper" - Lesslie said, "I have been to the

               <p>"Have you? I suppose you had a bit of talk about the concern;" Lesslie said, "We just did," and added, "How your wife cried."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Pray what were you charged with, that you were put into the cell? A. I was put in to hear what Lesslie said; one of the officers asked me if I was afraid to go in, and Mr. Stulzs' solicitor asked me - I was sober; I pretended to be drunk - I was directed to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. You were put there to get what evidence you could from the prisoner's lips, against him? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.What were you to get for it? A. Not any thing; I swear that - nothing of the sort was proposed; there is a wide stone passage between the cells - the officers were two or three long passages off; the prisoners spoke quite loud - they hallooed, or they could not hear each other; every body passing and re-passing must have heard what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Has this conversation ever been read over to you? A. Yes, the solicitor read it over to me once or twice - I think altogether he may have read it to me four or five times since I made the communication.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you first tell him what conversation had passed? A. I wrote it down myself first as soon as I got to the prosecutors', after coming out of the cell.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Was any amendment made to it afterwards by the solicitor? A. Not that I am aware of - I gave the same evidence to the Magistrate as I did to the solicitor; no alteration was made in my evidence by the solicitor - I was in the same cell with Lesslie; I knew him by his working at the shop - this conversation took place about twelve o'clock in the day, through the bars over the door of the cell; I suppose there is two or three inches between the bars - there is a little light coming from there; he could see there was a man in the cell - I could see him sufficiently to swear to him, because he got up on a bucket in the cell to speak through the bars to the voice, and the light was on his face; there was light enough without that for me to see him walking about, but I do not think I could distinguish his countenance except when he was at the bars - the light came through the bars on his face quite sufficient for me to know him when he was on the bucket.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You made a memorandum of what passed before you saw the solicitor? A. I just told him I had been in, and said I would write it down - I have the memorandum I wrote at the time, (producing it.)</p>

            . I keep the Burlington Arms. I remember the night of Mr. Stulzs' robbery - Lesslie was not at my house that night at all; I know him well - he was not there at all that night, nor had he any thing to eat or drink.</p>
               <p>Sandford's Defence (written.) - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I am accused of committing a burglary alone, which must appear to your minds almost impossible to be accomplished by one man - and had I gone with the determination of committing such a desperate burglary, I am certain that it must occur to your minds that I should not have retreated armed, as it is stated that I was, because a man happened to raise an alarm: had I been sufficiently desperate to have attempted such a dangerous enterprise alone, it must strike your minds that that desperation would not soon have forsaken me; besides, had I been so well acquainted with the premises, as the witness, Evans, states that the person must have been, who broke into the premises, is it likely that I should have broken into a room in which a person slept? you will please to recollect that one of the witnesses states that he saw the legs of three or four persons - had this been the case, more than one person must have been seen; as the watchman, Bannister, states that he came up the instant the alarm was given, and that he only saw one person, and when he came up to that person, he made, as the watchman states, a desperate resistance - whereas it is not attempted to be proved that I made any resistance.</p>
               <p>Lesslie's Defence (written.) - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I beg to declare most solemnly that I am wholly innocent of any connection with any person or persons who were concerned in committing the burglary on the premises of Messrs. Stulz, and the fact of my coming forward in a voluntary manner to give such evidence as might be required of me by the Magistrates of Marlborough-street, will, I trust, carry conviction to your mind of that fact; for had I been the guilty man it is attempted to make me appear, I could not have had the audacity to have acted in this manner; on the contrary, is it not more probable that I should have attempted to secrete myself, or to leave the country, which I might have done, as more than a week had elapsed from the commission of the crime and the apprehension of Sandford, to the time I surrendered myself, which I did on a summons being left at my house? There is one point in this case to which I think it necessary to call your attention; the public press gave out that I had absconded on the apprehension of Sandford - I therefore beg but a moment's time to explain this, in order to remove any prejudice that that aspersion may have made on some of your minds; the facts are these: - the first examination of Sandford took place on Saturday, the 26th day of September - his wife was apprehended on the Tuesday following, and on which day, for the first time, I left my house, and went to work for a Mr. Tyndale, of Market-street, Westminster, and returned and slept at home on that night; the following day I again went to Mr. Tyndale's and resumed my work, and slept at his house on that and the following nights, namely, Wednesday and Thursday nights, in consequence of our continuing work until very late hours, and considerably after midnight, so that no time might be lost in getting the work in hand finished, as it was to be done by a certain time. On the Wednesday night (the first night that I slept at Mr. Tyndale's) the officers from Marlborough-street went and searched my house: on the following day, Thursday, the officers came again, and left the summons which I have before alluded to, which my wife brought to me at Mr. Tyndale's - in pursuance of which I went to Marlborough-street, where I was taken into custody, and kept under examination for twenty-one days, deprived of my liberty, and also of any legal advice; an order having been made that I should not have communication direct or indirect with any person, and it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290070"/>with difficulty that my solicitor obtained permission to see me, and that in the presence of an officer, who was placed there to hear every word that passed. Although I was thus kept so long under examination, yet no other evidence than that adduced on my first examination was brought forward, except that of the witness,

I am a watchman of St. James', Westminster, and was so on the 26th of September, when, on hearing an alarm at Mr. Stulzs' premises, I went to the spot, saw the prisoner there, and seized him, in order to take him into custody - I collared him; he presented a pistol at me, immediately pulled the trigger, and it burnt the priming in the pan; he ran up Boyle-street and New Burlington-street, pursued by Clark and another.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen him before? A. Not to my knowledge - he snapped the pistol at me momentarily.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. In how short a time did you see the prisoner in custody? A. Not three minutes - I had not the least doubt of his being the man who pulled the trigger, and have no doubt of him now.</p>

            . I have the pistol which Clark gave me on the 26th of September, the morning after the robbery; it had the appearance of having been snapped - there was powder burnt in the pan; I drew the charge - there were two small pieces of iron, and five large ones, two pieces of wadding, and powder.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those pieces of iron, if discharged against a man, capable of killing him? A. I should think so, at least of doing him grievous bodily harm.</p>

I locked it up in a cupboard, which I kept the key of; it was not out of my sight from the time I got it from Clark till I drew the charge - I was before the Magistrate at the time Clark put it on the table; I received it from him before the Magistrate at the office, on Saturday, the 26th - I know nothing about the robbery.</p>

On the 3rd of September, I had a large dinner at my house, and in the evening, about nine o'clock, the prisoner came in, and went up to the club-room, where the persons had dined; I was in the bar - I sent him up three glasses of brandy and water, one after the other; I took up the last myself, and told him there were three to pay for - he pulled out sixpence, and threw down; I told him that would not pay for three, that they were 1s. each - he seemed to take no notice of what I said; I told him to put the sixpence into his pocket, and we would settle it when he came down - when he came down I was in the parlour; my wife called me, and said he was going away without paying - I went out and said," Sir, you have not paid for these three glasses of brandy and water; pay for them before you go" - he made no answer; I repeated it - he paid no attention to me, but gave Parnell a glass of gin, and had one himself; he paid for both, and directly took a penknife out of his pocket, opened it, and put it into his pocket again - my wife told Parnell of it, and he said,"Mr. Dowell, you have put the knife into your pocket, open;" he took it out, shut it, and put it in again, then opened the door, and went out - I went after him, tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him to pay for the three glasses of brandy and water; he then turned round, struck me in the throat, and knocked me down, with his fist - I went up, touched him on the shoulder, and collared him, to prevent his going away; he struck me again, a scuffle ensued, and we both fell together - I got up first, and when he was sitting on the ground, he said, "How much do you want?" I said, "Three shillings for the brandy and water," he put his hand into his pocket, and I thought he was going to pay me - instead of which be ran at me directly he got up and struck me with the knife - I put up my arm and received the cut in it; I fell from the blow, but did not know he had stuck me; he ran across the road and hallooed Watch! it was about eleven o'clock at night; the watchman was going to take me, till he saw the blood all over me, and then took him to the watch-house; I was taken to my doctor's, who stopped the blood - I lost about three quarts, and was taken home for dead - my vein was nearly cut through; the knife was found on him with a blade broken; it was a two-bladed knife - I do not know whether that was the blade that cut me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had he any thing besides the three glasses of brandy and water? A. Not at my house; there was no dispute about the price of the brandy - he was about half drunk when this took place, and seemed the same when he came in; the scuffle was about thirty yards from my house - I went to the office next day, about four o'clock in the afternoon, not earlier; I there charged him with a common assault - the prisoner was not there; the Magistrate did not refuse me a warrant; the prisoner surrendered here yesterday - I went and preferred this bill because I could not find him any where -I heard he was in Paris; he is an ironmonger, living near me - I did not look for him at his shop, but the officer did; I never told Mitchell, or any body, that I would make this up for 200l.; I did not seize him - I touched him on the shoulder in a civil manner.</p>
               <p>JOHN BRADLEY. I am a watchman. I heard a call of Watch! and on turning round, saw White and the prisoner running across the road; I went to them - they were struggling together, each having hold of the other; I parted them - White instantly gave Dowell in charge, desiring me to take him to the watch-house - I walked with him a few steps, turned round to my right, and saw blood running from White's arm: he became very wet - some people said he was stabbed; I took the prisoner to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw them having hold of each other? A. Yes; they did not fall in my presence - at what time he got the wound I cannot say; I took the prisoner to Worship-street the next morning - White did not appear: he had been sent for - the prisoner was detained about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Can you say in what state the prisoner was? A. He was not so drunk but what I consider he knew well what he was doing,</p>

            . I am apprenticed to Mr. Kay, a surgeon. I was called up between eleven and twelve o'clock to Mr. White, who came to our house - there was a wound in the upper part of his arm, and a great effusion of blood; it appeared such a wound as a penknife would give - it was not likely to occasion death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How long did you attend him? A.Perhaps for a week or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I spent the evening at another house, and went to inquire for Mr. Birch at this house - they said they expected him there; I had a glass of brandy and water, which I paid the lad 8d. for - I had two more glasses, and handed the landlord 2s.; I said I had paid the lad 8d. for the first, and should pay no more - when I went down, he said there was a mistake in my reckoning; it was 1s. instead of 8d. - I said I would pay no more; I was eating a pear up stairs, and came down with the pen-knife in my hand, and went away; he followed, and collared me sixty yards from the house - he said I must come back; I refused - he knocked me down, and kicked me; we had three or four scuffles, and I suppose the knife must have cut his arm and broke the blade - I called the watchman, and gave him in charge; he found his arm bleeding, and gave me in charge - the Magistrate took my word to appear when wanted; White got a surgeon to make him out too bad to attend the office - the Magistrate told me to take a warrant out at Lambeth-street, and indict his house for being open late; but he went, and took out this warrant to prevent me.</p>

These two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290072"/>men were scuffling; I saw them get up, and fall down two or three times - I thought them both in liquor; I saw the prisoner down three times - I did not hear what was said till the third time: when the prisoner was getting up I heard him say, Watch! and Thieves! the prosecutor said,"Pay your reckoning;" they went on to the turnpike-road, and then the prisoner gave the prosecutor a blow on the neck and threw him back - he got up, went towards the road in a sort of fighting attitude till they got to Dog-row; they were standing still when the watchman took charge of White - his arm bled; I cannot tell when he got the wound, but the last blow the prisoner struck was on the neck.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house dead drunk with scarcely a bit of shirt left; it was rent to ribbons - his legs were bleeding, as if he had been very ill-used and kicked about; the charge was for quarrelling - the watchman was so drunk that I told him to wash himself before he went to Worship-street with me, or I should be ashamed to go with him - before I went to Worship-street that morning I went to white to see what was the matter with him; I found him about in his shirt-sleeves, and a handkerchief on his head - he said he was not able to attend the office; the doctor, in my hearing, told him he was able - I said there was a coach standing at the door, why not go; he said he thought he should faint - I told the Magistrate this, and he discharged the prisoner.</p>

On Saturday, the 10th of October, I selected country notes amounting to 625l. 5s., and a 67l. bank post-bill, to send to town; after taking the numbers and particulars, Mr. Collard, another clerk, took possession of them to pack them up - he was in the room when I took the account of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you take the numbers and dates? A. Only the numbers and amounts; I laid them on the desk for Collard about six o'clock, and saw him tie the parcel up before nine - I do not think he had been in the room all that time; I had left them on the desk, and gone away - they were country notes, payable in London.</p>
               <p>MR. MOODY. Q.Was any other clerk in the office at the time you took the particulars? A. Mr. Collard's father; the notes were to go to London to be placed to our credit; I did not see Collard seal them up.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live at Taunton. On the 10th of October, Knight, my apprentice, put two parcels into my hands from the Taunton bank; one was for Stuckey's house at Bristol, and the other for Robarts and Co., of London - I recollect Collard inquiring about them; I had them in my possession then - they were then being sewn up in my pocket, by a person in my employ; they were sewn in my left-hand inside coat pocket - I placed them there, and the London parcel at the bottom; it fitted the pocket tight - the Bristol one was smallest - I started for Bristol about half-past ten o'clock that evening, by the coach and got there about six the next morning; I went to Stuckey's house, and their porter ripped my pocket a little open, took out part of the thread, and drew out the Bristol parcel; I looked to see that he had the right one - my coat was on at the time; I felt the other panel safe - he drew up the thread of the pocket again as well as he could; I started for London almost immediately by the coach, and arrived about nine o'clock on the Sunday evening - I got off the coach, near the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane; I had some luggage, and went from the coach to Mrs. Andrews', No. 22, <placeName id="t18291029-193-crimeloc1088">Ironmonger-lane</placeName>

            . My husband's name is Richard - I live in Ironmonger-lane, and keep a lodging-house; I have done so for twenty years, and in that lane seventeen years. Newton has been in the habit of lodging with me about seven years; Allan came to lodge with me on the 10th of May last, and was sometimes out of town for a week; he was there off and on till the time in question. On Sunday, the 11th of October, about nine o'clock, Mr. Newton came; he had tea and cold meat, a glass of ale, and smoked a pipe- he went to bed about ten o'clock; there was one or two other persons in the kitchen; Allan came in - Newton slept in the room No. 15, and Allan in No. 16: the two rooms are very close together - there is a passage between their doors, about a yard and a half wide; there are two other bed-rooms on that floor, but nobody slept there that night - Allan went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock; it was after Newton: in the morning Mr. Newton came with an officer; the officer staid about a quarter of an hour or more - I desired him not to leave, but he did not know what to search for, I believe, and they went out; Allan came down stairs after they were gone out - he came down soon after them: he went into the breakfast-room, walked about from place to place, and came into the kitchen; the robbery was talked of - he requested to leave the house for five minutes; I requested that no one would leave till a proper search was made - that was said in his presence; he left the house, and was away nearly an hour; I believe he was not quite dressed when he left - he said he was not dressed and not shaved; it was not usual for him to be out at that time in the morning - he left about nine o'clock, came back again, in about an hour, and stopped in the house from the Monday till the Thursday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been married? A. Twenty-six years; I was married at Carlisle, in Cumberland - my maiden name was Ann Thompson: my hus<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290074"/>band is in town - he has not been here; I do not know that the prisoner sent him a subpoena to come.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that you answered the messenger? A. He was from home - there was a man came with something - I said he was not at home: I did not say he was in Scotland; he went out of town this afternoon, on business, and so he did on Saturday - the messenger came on Saturday; I do not know whether I told him the messenger had been; he came home yesterday - he had gone on Friday: I did not tell him he had been subpoenaed on the prisoner's behalf; I do not know that I was told he was wanted here on the prisoner's behalf; he is not in any business - he goes out with gentlemen's good at times; he has gone out with Mr. Williams' goods - he is a gentleman lodging at my house; it is a parcel he has gone with; I did not tell him the messenger had been for him - I do not know that I thought of it - I know I did not tell him; I did not purposely avoid telling him - it was because I forgot it, or something; a person named Unsworth lives in my house: he was there yesterday; the messenger did not ask for him - he is not able to come here; he is unwell: he is a person who has plenty to live on - he occupies any room that suits him; my gentlemen do not always occupy one room- he slept in his bed-room on the night of the robbery; there was no person in the room besides himself, that I know of; the messenger did not produce a paper to me for Unsworth - he did for my husband; I did not tell my husband of it - I forgot it, I suppose; I do not know that the prisoner has charged my husband with putting the notes into his portmanteau; he said I did it - I knew he charged somebody with it, but I understood it was myself- I do not know whether I ever heard of his charging my husband with it; I swear I never heard it - I paid Mr. Newton for some bandanna handkerchiefs once, because he charged me with them in a bill; he did not threaten to indict me - the messenger asked for Russell; he went to Glasgow on Friday - he also asked for Fergusson; he was gone to Glasgow - he asked for Philip Thompson: he never lodged with me - he is my nephew, and comes to my house sometimes, but I do not know where he lives - he lives sometimes with one friend and sometimes with another; when he was last with me he stopped at Hackney: I did not tell the messenger I would not tell him where to find Thompson; I said I could not - he is now out of employ - Fergusson lodged with me four or five months, and is gone home to Glasgow; he was at my house on the night of the robbery - Thompson was not, but Russell was; I do not know whether my servant is here or not - I left her at home; there was a robbery in my house last summer, about June; I have known the prisoner since May - no inconvenience happened in my house before I knew the prisoner, except Unsworth's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that before the prisoner left your house, both his room and person were searched at his request? A.His person was not searched; I was not up stairs; his portmanteau was not in my bed-room at that time - it had been there: he took it out himself; his box was in my room - he took that out on the morning of the robbery, after it had been discovered; he took the portmanteau out of town - I did not see him take his trousers out of the box which had been in my room, and put them into the portmanteau. Unsworth has some property, and lives on it; he does not do any thing in particular - he is in bad health; my husband assists me in the house; Unsworth sometimes assists me in writing - my husband cleans the lodger's shoes - Unsworth cleans his own, I dare say; he assists in the house; he never cleaned a knife - he sometimes assists in the kitchen, in sending in breakfast; he does not light the fires - he lent me money when I furnished the house; he is not under my control.</p>

            . I am a City officer. Mr. Cope, the marshal, directed me to watch the motions of the prisoner - I began to watch him on Wednesday morning, the 14th, about eleven o'clock, when I saw him going into Andrews' house from Cheapside; he came out with a short gentleman dressed in black - I was watching outside next morning, about half-past seven o'clock; he came out between eight and nine o'clock, with a portmanteau in his hand, got into a hackney-coach, which drew up to the door; I followed the coach to the Custom House-stairs - he took a boat, and went on board the Kent Gravesend steam-packet, with his portmanteau; I took another boat to the same steamer, and landed at Gravesend with him; he walked up and down the street, and I think the coachman put his portmanteau into the boot of a Chatham coach - he got on the coach; I got on the roof behind - he alighted at the Sun tavern, Chatham; I got down, and saw him go into the Sun, with his portmanteau - I went to a house about thirty yards off, and after putting on my great coat, went to the Sun, and saw him in the coffee-room; I saw him at the Sun on and off, from the Thursday till the Tuesday following - he left at times, and on Monday went to Gravesend; I went with him - on the evening he arrived, he went on board the Euryalus, convict ship; I did not go with him, but saw the waterman row him to the side of the vessel; he went on board that ship every day except Tuesday, and I believe on the Monday night, be remained on board all night - I saw him go on board, and saw him again on the Tuesday morning, walking about Chatham; he left Chatham on the Tuesday afnoon, by the Dover Union coach, and came to town - I saw his portmanteau put into the boot; I was watching him the whole of this time, and got on the coach - we both sat in the dickey behind, and our knees touched each other; when we stopped at Rochester, to change horses, I got off, went into the house, and took a glass of brandy; he also got down, and went into the house; we both got on the coach again, and when we had started about five yards, I let a piece of rather greasy whitey brown paper fly; I did not say any thing to him - it flew round the wheel of the coach, and he said, "Bless me that is not out of my pocket, is it?" I said, "I don't know Sir, it is not out of mine, I know;" he then put his hand into his left hand trousers pocket, and pulling out a roll of notes said, "Oh it is all right," and returned them again - I saw distinctly that they were country notes, by the mark across the middle of them; they were rolled up very carelessly - we proceeded on our journey; he got down in the Kent-road, and went into Mrs. Morton's carrying his portmanteau with him - this was on the Tuesday after the Thursday that I went down; I saw him go into the house; I got off the coach, kept watch there all night, and sent a man to the Mansion-house, with a note to Forrester - next morning, about eight o'clock, Allan came out of the house, in company with a young man; I watched him - he and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290075"/>young man walked together some distance, for about half an hour, then returned to Morton's again - I kept my eye on them the whole time; he came out again, in half an hour - I followed him into Cornhill - he stopped at a picture shop in St. Michael's-alley; I sent off a note, and Forrester came to me, while I was watching him; we took him into custody in Cornhill; Forrester searched him, and took possession of what was on him - he did not bring the portmanteau out of the house in the morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your object was to watch his motions from first to last? A. It was; I believe he was not aware of what I was about - he could not have gone to a more public place at Chatham, than the Sun, it is the most respectable house; the mate of the convict-ship has a daughter - I saw him walking about Chatham with her, occasionally, and going to the ship with her; I say he was on board one night, as I sat up all night at the Sun, and he did not come there; the ship is moored about a mile and a half from the Sun - he had plenty of opportunities to escape that night; Mrs. Morton's is a respectable house - he pulled the notes out openly; I did not ask if he had dropped any notes, but seeing the paper fly, he said what I have stated - there was no confusion about him, that I particularly noticed; I know nothing of Andrews, Russell, or Thompson; I took Fergusson into custody on the morning Allan was taken; I was at Andrews' house on Saturday, and saw a man, but do not know whether it was him; I never heard any person answer to the name of Andrews - I never heard the prisoner charge Unsworth or Andrews with having done this.</p>
               <p>MR. MOODY. Q. Was Fergusson in custody on this charge? A. A letter had been found on the prisoner when he was taken, directed to Fergusson - he was before the Lord Mayor on suspicion of this charge.</p>

I took Allan into custody, and directly took him to the Mansion-house - searched him, and found on him 55l. in country notes (producing them) - they were in his pocket; I marked them before I parted with them - I directly went over to Mrs. Morton's Kent-road, with Thorowgood, and asked her to shew me Allan's portmanteau - she shewed me one, which I searched, and found in it country notes amounting to 570l. 5s. - one was a five guinea note; there was a 67l. bank post-bill - I took an account of the notes at the Mansion-house; one parcel of them was in the upper division of the portmanteau, and the other in the lower, rolled up in two separate papers, not concealed in any way - they were not in any clothes.</p>

            . I have compared all these notes with the entry in the book; the numbers of those in the parcel of 55l. do not correspond with the numbers in the book, but they do in every other respect - the banks and the amounts are the same; I can see that the numbers have been altered - I can trace the original numbers, and they correspond with the entry; I know them to be the notes I put on the counter to be packed up - I have a private mark of my own on them all - and I have no doubt of their being the same; I have examined the two parcels found in the portmanteau - they correspond in numbers, names, and description, except one 5l. of Payne and Co.'s the number of which is rather faint; I could not make it out, and put down what I thought it was - I remember that: and here is the 67l. bank post-bill; none of the numbers in these two parcels are altered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Look at this 5l. Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet bank note? A. Yes; I did not take the dates - this one was A. No. 982; here is another, which was No. 629, and is altered to 1629.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. One Leuthwaite, who was at York with me, recommended me to take lodgings at this house. I arrived on the 10th of May from Newark, and lodged there - On the 22nd of September I went out of town, leaving my box and portmanteau in the bed-room; on returning I was informed my box had fallen down stairs, and was broken open; but I found it had been broken open by one of the husbands of Mrs. Andrews, who was in the act of abstracting articles from it. Newton once found the cord of his box altered, and a piece of handkerchiefs missing; he charged Mr. Andrews with taking it, which he did not deny - he charged it to Mrs. Andrews, and she paid for it. I went on Sunday evening, the 11th, to Silver-street chapel, and came home about nine o'clock; but did not sit down, nor did I speak that evening to Newton - I went to bed soon after ten o'clock, and did not arise till after seven, when I was awoke by a noise, and on opening my door, heard what had occured - I accompanied the officer to Mrs. Andrews' room, where she and Unsworth were in bed; it was proposed that her room should be searched first - she said she wished to dress, and wished my room to be searched first; every part of it was searched, and at the moment the officer was going to search her room she brought out a box belonging to me, and said I might take it to my bed-room, which: I did and could prove by the servant and one of her husbands, if they will come forward, that it was broken open some time previous, and the articles thrown round the room by Unsworth - it remained open; (the officer did not know but it was locked) till the 15th of October, when I took a pair of trousers from it and put them into my portmanteau, then tied the box up, and had it put into Fergusson's room. I went to Chatham, and on Monday afternoon, about four o'clock, when I went up to dress myself, on opening my portmanteau, to my great surprise and horror found three parcels of notes in the pockets of the trousers which I had taken out of the box which had been kept in Mrs. Andrews' room - I immediately wrote to Fergusson, at Ironmonger-lane, to know if Newton was still there, as I wished to see him - I went to the Euryalus, and told the watchman to come for me that evening, but his boat could not get to the ship, and after nine o'clock, no boats being allowed to come, I could not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290076"/>get ashore - I had the letter written, intending to send it by the post, which leaves at twelve, but was obliged to stop on board on account of the boat being aground; I came on shore the next morning, took the notes from my pocket, and counted them over in the public-house - the waiter saw them on the table, and I ask was that the conduct of a midnight robber? I arrived in town about eight o'clock, and stopped in the Kent-road - I arose next morning, and wrote to Fergusson to meet me at the Burton coffee-house at eleven o'clock; I went, intending to put the letter into the General Post-office, when I was taken. I solemnly declare my innocence; I am made the dupe of a villain, who to screen himself, has made me the victim; I trust you will consider the character of Andrews - she has two husbands, one the partner of her bed, while the other acts as servant to clean the lodgers' boots and shoes; it is incredible to suppose, a person, who had stolen the property, would have carried it about ten days without offering to put off one note - when a person went to subpoenae a witness for me, Mrs. Andrews told him some were gone to Ireland, and others to Scotland; I am deprived of their testimony.</p>
               <p>- HERBERT. I am an officer. Newton fetched me from the Mansion-house about half-past seven o'clock on the morning of the robbery; I asked him several questions at the house - he being very deaf I talked loud - that alarmed Allan, who came out of his bed-room in his shirt, and said I was very welcome to search his room; I went and searched his room thoroughly, and his box - Newton was at the door; I have not been called on the part of the prosecution - Allan had got nothing on; I searched his trunk - in short, he searched it himself in my presence; I stood by him while he turned over the things; I did not see the portmanteau there - he took and opened every thing, and took the things out; I searched where I thought proper - Mrs. Andrews was alarmed, and came out of her bed-room; she gave me leave to do the same - I searched her room; there were a great many boxes, which she said belonged to different people, travellers, out of town - there was a box under her bed, which I understood was Allan's; it appeared to me to be locked - I cannot say whether Allan offered that to be searched; he did not leave the house till after me - I went to the banking-house to try and find out the numbers of the notes.</p>
               <p>MR. MOODY. Q. Have you been an officer long? A. Yes - I let him search the box himself; I did not know what property was lost, or what to look for - I had no warrant; I did not make a complete search - I did not exactly search his clothes; I looked under the bed, but did not rip up the matting - he said I was welcome, and I was perfectly convinced it was not there, as he had plenty of time to have got it out of the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know you were to search for three small rolls of notes? A. No - I did not examine his clothes; I looked among the sheets - I afterwards looked among his clothes, but he had not got them on; they were in the room - I have been an officer nearly ten years; I looked into his pocket - I did not know what was lost, and did not make a complete search; I did not put my hand into his pockets - I went to the Mansion-house, and told Mr. Cope I had searched his room, but not completely; I took the prosecutor to him.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he not offer his bed, his clothes, and things to be searched? A. He offered every thing to be searched.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If there had been a parcel of this description in the trunk, should you have seen it? A. I should have noticed it, certainly.</p>

On the 26th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the female prisoner and some chrystal were brought to my house by the officer; the male prisoner was at work there at the time - the officer brought a basket of chrystals, and put them on the board; I heard the male prisoner say, "There are some officers with my wife" - I was then called by my servant, and went down - the officer asked where I kept my chrystal; I said in the top back room, and the male prisoner worked in the top front room - there is a passage and stair-case between the rooms; there are leads to the house, but he would have no business on them - in July last I picked out some chrystals, and put them into the top back room; there were some particular pieces, which I knew, and in those which the officer brought back were some of those pieces - I had never given any to the prisoner nor sold him any, nor authorized him to sell any; the whole of this chrystal belongs to myself - there is about 20lbs.; it cost me about 3l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What are you? A. I deal and work in chrystals, minerals, and all kinds of stones, and am a butcher - I only keep the male prisoner, and a man who carries out the meat; I employ other men out of doors - the male prisoner was employed in cutting chrystals, and had been with me off and on about seven years; he worked in the front room next the street - I do not know whether a man, who wanted to know what o'clock it was, could see from the front room, but he might from the leads very easily; I do not know whether he was employed by any other person, or dealt in chrystals himself - I believe all these were part of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290077"/>stock, but I have no mark on them; I know this piece to be mine, by having it several times in my hand - I have perhaps 2000 lbs. weight; my daughter and wife give out the work - I had seen this piece on the Thursday; the female prisoner was brought on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.When the woman was brought in, did you examine your stock of chrystals? A. No, but I did when the male prisoner ran away, and missed a considerable number.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I see part of this is clear, and the other part is not? A. Yes, I knocked a piece off, to see if it was clear, to go to work.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-surveyor. On Saturday morning, the 26th of September, I was in Craven-street, and saw the female prisoner with this basket of chrystals; I asked how she came by it - she said she brought it from home, and was to have met her husband at Charing-cross, but, as he had not come, she was going back with it; I left her in charge of an officer, made inquiries, and took her to Mr. Barnett's house - in consequence of what I said, the male prisoner came down; I asked if he had given his wife any chrystal - he said Yes, he had half an hour before, and he would put on his coat and explain it to me; he went up stairs - I followed him a few steps, and he said," Come on;" I thought it was all right, and waited for him - he made his escape at the top of the house; I went up to the top of the house, and saw some saw-dust, and a foot-mark in the gutter - a person might get from the workshop window, to the window of the room where the chrystal is kept; the rooms are on the same floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What time did you meet her? A.Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I do not know that the prisoner was afraid of a civil process for debt.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.When he talked about his coat he did not say any thing about a civil process? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I suppose if you had seen them in Whitechapel, or any where, you would have known them again? A. Yes, they have been so often in my hands; I do not know that there ever were such pieces any where else - (looking at some other pieces produced by the prisoners' Counsel) I know some of these to be ours; this one by a flaw, and this by its being partly coloured.</p>

Longman, Rees and Co., Westley and Co., and Mr. Marshall, to take impressions from steel plates for the forthcoming annuals, the Friendship's Offering, the Gem, the Literary Souvenir, and the Juvenile Forget Me Not; I was employed first about June last - the respective proprietors find paper for those plates: I had struck off impressions from them all, previous to the 19th of September, but never gave any of them out of my custody.

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290078"/>COURT. Q. Did you say they had been sold? A. I said she had almost ruined me by giving these prints to her mother, and their being exposed for public sale, as it would show I was not a trustworthy person; I could not ascertain how many I had lost - we have an immense quantity, and it would be impossible to detect one or two dozen - at that time none ought to have been issued to the public - I had delivered some of the Juvenile Forget Me Not to Messrs. Westley and Davis.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Had you any right to any of them yourself? A. According to the custom of the trade we consider ourselves entitled to one or two impressions, not more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. I believe you were suspected of having parted with them? A. Yes, at first: after the examination at the office I asked Simpson how he came by the prints, and he said an elderly woman with a child sold them to him - he asked me if there was any one I suspected about my house; I said I could not possibly suspect any one of my work-people; at my suggestion he went willingly to my house, to see if he could point out the person who sold them - he said it was not my female servant; it struck me it might probably be her mother - we went to her mother's in London-street; he knocked, and I staid outside - her mother came to the door, and he told me that was the woman; I had parted with some of them to Messrs. Westley's binders, to be bound in the usual way, and I think to some others. Simpson was out on bail; I believe there were some impressions exhibited by the resective proprietors.</p>

             Longman and others. I went to Simpson's house, in Tottenham-court-road; he deals in books and prints - this was on the 19th of September; I saw him, and asked for some prints - he produced several portfolios, and I saw some impressions for the Gem and the Literary Souvenir for the coming year; the publishers of those works get them out about the end of October - I bought two of them at 6d. each, and asked if he had any more; he said he had had more, and might possibly have some in a week or two- I marked the two I bought - these are them; these letters at the bottom of the print are not put by the engraver, but by a person he sends them to - we receive them perfect - this one is "Jacob's Dream," published by Longman and Co., and this is</p>
               <p>"Saturday Night," published by Marshall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. When you went to the shop did you see any other prints of a similar description? A. No; I saw none in the window - I went into the back shop: they were in the port-folios, among others - no doubt persons buy a great many prints, and sell one print for more than they give for the whole; these are in the same state as I bought them, except my marking - one of them was soiled; when they are soiled they are of little value.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What would the value of them be if not soiled? A.Perhaps 6d. or 1s., or 1s. 6d.; Simpson sells second-hand books - these could not be the engraver's proofs, because they have the letters to them.</p>

            . I am a print colourer. On the 19th of September I went to Mr. Simpson's shop, and bought five prints of annuals and another; these are them - some of them are good prints: there may be one or two damaged or dirty - I gave 2s. for the five; I asked where he got them - he said from a girl who represented that she had been sent by her young mistress, and he supposed they were engravers' proofs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Are they precisely in the same state as when you bought them? A. Yes, with the exception of my mark - it frequently happens that prints of considerable value at one time, are sold at another, at a very small price.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you get them? A.

               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Do the prints vary in value? A. Yes; the plates cost from one hundred to one hundred and eighty guineas a piece - these prints are worth 1s. or 1s. 6d. each.</p>

Driver, Esq. on them, looked in the Court Guide, and found him.</p>

No; I never had any one there but my wife; I have lived with Mr. Burgin eleven years - the man she lives with is not her husband; she came up to me for a light when they came there, and I said to my wife, "I don't like these people, for I heard him beat her, and she threatened to hang him;" I never spoke to her but once in anger, when she was coming up- I told her to keep her distance; I am sure my blanket was gone.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Chequer-alley. I was with Ryan, on the 9th of October, from half-past seven o'clock, till she was taken - she was not out of my sight; we had taken a walk together, after I had done work she then went with me to my own room, and staid three quarters of an hour - we then went out again; I heard the cry of Watch! - I turned and saw the prosecutor with his small-clothes down, in a very indecent manner; he took hold of her, and said, "You have got my watch" - she said, "Nonsense man;" he let her go, and then took her again; I had not seen the prosecutor drinking.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and have lived at No. 4, Chequer-alley, about eight months; I never saw the prisoners, but the prosecutor came to my house, with a girl, as near as I can guess about half-past eight o'clock that night - I had just come home from my work, at Mr. Garrett's, an oil-man, in Whitecross-street; I had not been in two minutes, when the prosecutor came in, and went up stairs - he had not been there three minutes, when he came down again; the young woman then came down, and bade me good night - I said to her, "It is strange that a man should come to a house of this kind, and not pay for it;" I looked out, and he turned to the right hand - the girl went after him, and he followed her up; I went it, sat down, and in a few minutes, I heard Watch! cried - I went out, and saw the prosecutor running with his trousers down; he caught hold of Ryan, and said, "You have robbed me of my watch" - "No(says she) I have not;" "You d - d b - h, you have, (says he) and I have got hold of you;" I did not take any part in it, nor ask him for any thing for my room - I thought it very indecent for any man to do a thing of that kind.</p>

            , the large hop grower; he said Yes, and that he had street to Mr. Ellis that he was about to take a public-house, and that Mr. Ellis told him he would accommodate him with any sum under 100l.; - that he might draw on him to any amount under 100l.; he then put this bill into my hands - I immediately noticed to him the word "Exceped" across it, instead of accepted; he said that did not matter, the bill was as safe, as the Bank of England, all the same for that, and it did not matter about being altered - he then asked me what money I could let him have immediately on it, as he wanted some immediately to buy some clothes; I told him I was then short of cash, but what I had in the house he should have- he asked me to let him have 2l.; I gave him a sovereign and twenty shillings, and then sent my brother over to the George inn, where the bill was made payable to make the necessary inquiry - my brother had gone before the prisoner went away, but I believe he did not know the bill was out of my hands; I advanced him 10s., more after my brother had left - my brother was gone four hours, or nearly so; the prisoner remained in my house I should think half or three quarters of an hour after my brother was gone - I do not think he knew my brother was gone on this errand, for he went out at the side door; I did not tell him my brother was gone - he came again in the evening, for some more money, I suppose, as I had appointed to let him have more that night or the next morning - on his coming, in consequence of something my brother said I had the prisoner taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What is your brother? A. He has only lately come from sea; he is a seafaring young man - he does not lodge with me; he has been from sea three months or nearly so, and has not employ at present - I am a publican; I have sold horses on commission - I kept livery stables seven years ago; I never dealt in horses with the prisoner; - I advanced the 40s. after the bill was shown to me; I had no previous meeting with him on that day, before the bill was produced - there was nothing to cause any suspicion on my mind about the bill till I saw it, and then the only suspicion was from the word exceped; knowing Mr. Ellis to he a man of opulence I thought he must know how to spell.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you not, in the first instance. propose yourself to discount the bill? A. I said I would advance him the money on it - he said he did not want the whole immediately; I was not the first to propose it - he asked if I would advance him a little, and more as he wanted it; I do not think he had seen my brother - he might have seen him in the shop, but he went into the back room; it is very likely he may have seen him on the premises - after he was gone the prisoner asked for 10s. more; I advanced it - he saw my brother in the evening when he was taken; I do not know whether they recognized each other: 50s. is all I advanced on this bill - I have been kind to him in other instance.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you met the prisoner, did not you, afterwards? A. No; I met him out of doors the morning before, and he told me he was going to get a bill which he had got in the Borought, and which he was going to ask my brother to lend him some money on, or to discount it, I cannot say which - I was going into Tooley-street, and walked with him; he did not request me to walk with him - he went with me to a house in Tooley-street, where he drank with me; I did not see him in the after part of the day, till he was taken - my brother's is a gin shop.</p>

I knew there was such a man in the parish of Burwash once, and that his brother has been in my employ; it could easily be discovered that the acceptance was not mine, it is not at all like mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You never authorized the brother to sign your name? A. No.(The bill was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - Confident of your patient hearing, I will briefly state the cause which has placed me before you in so critical a situation. My life is in your hands; but I am persuaded, that if any favourable circumstances have transpired during my trial I shall have the benefit of them. The evidence on the part of the prosecution you have heard. I most solemnly declare that I was quite ignorant of the bill being a forged instrument. I was about taking a public house at Deptford; I became possessed of the bill in the following manner: - Smith, formerly a customer of mine, (and now I believe he goes to and fro in the country with fruit) was aware, that I was going into business, he requested me to draw up a bill for two months, and he would get it accepted by a friend of his who would honor it when due; so indifferent was I to what he proposed, that I forgot the circumstance altogether, till, unfortunately for me, I must Smith again: he presented a bill to me drawn for two months, and requested me to put my name, saying he would get it accepted and bring it back again. I did so, and it was brought again to me. My Lord and Gentlemen, is it likely? was it the conduct of a man in his senses to have a bill by me which I knew to be a forgery? and knowing of the fatal consequences resulting from committing the crime of forgery, should I have gone to a person, who has known me for so many years? rather, should I not have applied to have it cashed by a person who would not so easily have detected me; would I, after obtaining 2l. on that bill, have returned to the prosecutor, and that after a lapse of upwards of three hours, having given the said bill into his possession, and receiving 10s. more? I left his house, was absent about half an hour, and returned once more to his house, when I was apprehended on a charge of forgery, without the least inquiry being made as to whether the person who was said to have accepted the bill was a responsible person or not. My Lord and Gentlemen, I do not hesitate to say, that it was a vile conspiracy against me for my destruction. I will briefly state the circumstances, and leave the rest to your deliberate consideration. I called at the prosecutor's house and had something to drink; the prosecutor then asked me what he should lend me on that bill, as he could do some good with it. I told him I did not immediately want money; he however persuades me to take 2l., and sends me after the bill - on my road to fetch it, his brother way-lays me, and never leaves me till I am taken into custody. My Lord and Gentlemen, I beseech you most earnestly, that as my reputation amongst society, nay, my life is now at stake, and entirely depending on your verdict, I feel confident that you will give it every consideration that the nature of my case requires; and I aver, that which ever way this investigation may terminate, I am entirely innocent of the crime laid to my charge. I feel assured, after a candid and conscientious inquiry into the evidence, you will return a verdict in favour of the unfortunately person who now addresses you.</p>

The prisoner was about three weeks in our employ - he had been in service before he came to us; he did not sleep in our house, but came in the day time. On the 4th of September he came as usual a little after seven o'clock; I let him in at the private door, and desired him to go down into the kitchen and light the fire - I went down into the kitchen with him, and the watch was hanging over the dresser; it was a gold watch - I had hung it there a quarter of an hour before - I left him in the kitchen, and went down again to see the time at twenty minutes to eight o'clock, and the watch hung there then, and he was there; I went up stairs to call my husband and children, and when I came down he had opened the shop door, and was gone; I had told him not to open the shop door - I missed the watch, also a gold brooch from up stairs in the bed-room; he could not have taken that that morning, but it was safe the morning before; I also missed four rings from a drawer in the bedroom, and a silver table-spoon and sugar-tongs from the same place; there was a seal to the watch: about forty herrings were taken from the shop - I had seen them that morning: I have never seen the things since - I inquired about at the pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood. I never saw the prisoner again till the 23rd of October, when I found him in a cart at Kensington gravel-pits; my husband was with me, and took him.</p>

            . I know the prisoner - I have seen him about Kensington gravel-pits; I first saw him about the 7th of September, and have played about there with him - I have seen him with two or three sovereigns; we used to ask him how he got them, and he said he lived at a bonnet-shop in Regent-street three years - that his master never paid him regularly, and when he did he paid him as much as seven sovereigns.</p>
               <p>MRS. MANN re-examined. He came into our service from Mr. Plummer, a hosier, of Regent-street, but we took him on his mother's recommendation, and did not see Plummer. The watch was gold, and worth 20l.</p>

On the 14th of October I was alone in the house, I shut the street door, left it on the latch, and went out into the back yard; I remained there about a quarter of an hour, then came back, and saw a little boy run out - I did not see whether he had any thing, now hear any noise; I had time to see him; I had never seen him before - I missed some Delphware from the cupboard, and some halfpence in a little bag, which was in a mug - I went and told my mother almost directly; she was in Whitecross-street, selling fruit: I then got a constable, and went to Moggeridge's father's house, which is next door but one to us - the constable knocked at the door; it was not opened - he got in at the window, and let me in; this was within ten minutes of the time, but nothing was found - the prisoner is not the boy who ran out; he was much less than him: he told the Magistrate the door was kept fast because his father expected an execution; I am quite sure he is not the boy, for I knew the prisoner.</p>

I went to the house, and got through the hole on the roof; I saw the prisoner dragging his legs from the ceiling to get on the roof - I went and took him, and found this knife laying by his side in the gutter - the lead had been cut and turned up for three or four feet; I charged the prisoner with it - he said there was no one there then, but the other had made his escape out of a window - and I heard a window thrown up at the back of the premises; the prisoner said he got up there to lodge - there was nothing on him but a small penknife.</p>

No; I told him as I had found him out in so many things, I would certainly go to the full extent of the law; he was apprenticed to me, but used to do a few things for the prosecutor, who is single; he has been a good boy till lately, when he has got some bad companions.</p>

            . I am a servant at the Horse Shoe and Magpie. I saw the prosecutor at our house last Wednesday night rather tipsy; the prisoner and another soldier were with him, and they drank together.</p>
               <p>FERDINAND JOHNS. I am a constable. On Friday night last I saw the prisoner intoxicated in the street - I took him into custody, and found this duplicate on him; the prosecutor had given notice of this robbery at our watch-house - he said it was a young man in a military undress.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at a house in Brownlow-street; I left a quarter before nine o'clock, and came straight down to the barracks - I had not been at that part of Westminster the whole day. On Friday a man in a red jacket came to me and said, "Soldier, I will sell you a bargain;" he took me aside, showed me this watch, and said he would sell it for 1l. - I said I had not 1l., but I would give him 15s. for it, as I was no judge of watches; I had never had one in my life - I bought it, and then, as I had to go on furlough, I pawned it to get the money.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DUFF. I am pay-serjeant of the company to which the prisoner belongs, in the 3rd regiment of Foot Guards - he was present at the roll call in the King's`mews barracks, at nine o'clock on Wednesday night last; he has been above four years in the regiment, and had a good character for honesty.</p>

I had seen it safe in the brick field, but I cannot say when; the prisoner had been in our employ three years, but when we found he was a returned transport we discharged him, and since he has been in our employ we have lost twenty-two planks.</p>

            . On the 25th of September I saw the prisoner and another turn out of Moorfields-square and go, one to South-place and the other to South-street; I went down Cross-street and came up South street - I missed the prisoner, but saw the other man; I went on to Wilson-street, saw the prisoner come up to Wilson-street, and then he ran - I went and took him, and found this tea-pot in his apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you see the two persons together? A. Yes, walking within a yard of each other; I did not observe any conversation - I think they were not walking in the usual way; the prisoner did not come to me and ask what I wanted - I took hold of his collar; he said he had been to Blackfriars, and found the tea-pot - the other man did not join him afterwards; I took him about thirty yards from the prosecutor's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you put it at night? A. I used to take it to my bed-room - I am sure I had it in my bed-room the night before, and brought it down that morning; the Lion on the top of it turns round, and I have it in use every day.</p>

               <p>ANN FREAK. I am a widow. On the 5th of October I was at the corner of <placeName id="t18291029-258-crimeloc1449">Monmouth-street</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ask me to lead you out of the public-house? A. I am not saying contrary to that.</p>

            . I was on my beat that evening, and saw this old lady, who had had a drop, but was not incapable of taking care of herself; the prisoner was with her - she set her down, and then drew the shawl from off her back, and tucked it under her hams; I said to my serjeant,"Do you see that?" he said Yes; I went and asked the prisoner to assist me up with the old lady; she said she was not able; I got her up, and the prisoner took the shawl from her hams, and went away; my serjeant stopped her.</p>
               <p>PHILIP RILEY. I am serjeant of the Police. I saw the prisoner shifting the shawl under her - I said to her, "Why don't you assist the woman?" she said, "I am very bad, and can't;" she went away with the shawl, and I stopped her. She and another sat on the step - the old lady sat on the flag-stones; the prisoner had got as far as the public-house when I stopped her.</p>

               <p>GEORGE CAVE. I was in Mr. Watson's shop, and saw the prisoner in the adjoining passage; I saw him put his arm round into the prosecutor's shop, but I did not see him take the bacon - I saw him for about ten minutes, while I was washing myself: when I got out he was in custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PORTEOUS. I was on duty, and a man told me I was wanted - I went, and the prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner, for taking this bacon; he made a violent resistance, and offered 2s. a lb. for the bacon.</p>
               <p>EDWARD LEES. This is my bacon - it fell from my hand when I took it from under the prisoner's coat; it could not have been reached without a person stepped into my shop.</p>

I caught the prisoner in the act of broaching a cask of brandy, which laid on the quay, about half-past one o'clock yesterday; I took this bottle of brandy out of his trousers - it has about a pint in it; the prisoner was employed there - there were a good many people about; he had bored a hole, and put a spile in - I asked him to give up his tool, and he gave this gimblet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Was his back to you? A. When he saw me he turned his back to the wall- his back was to me when he was doing something at the cask; the cask was leaking from the hole - the bottle was in his breeches; I cannot say that the contents came from the cask - it appeared to be a brandy cask; I did not taste the contents of it - I did not say yesterday that it was rum - I have not tasted what is in this bottle: it smells like brandy - the cask was in the custody of the dock company.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you taste any of that which came from the hole? A. No - a brandy cask is of a different model to others: it was a sort of cask that brandy is generally brought in - it was on the wharf of the London-dock company, and the prisoner was in their employ.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WEBB. I am a cellar-clerk in the spirit-quay of the London-docks. I saw the cask which Osborn pointed out; I dipped it, and found it deficient about one quart - it was brandy, and of the same description as this in the bottle - I tasted them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What difference in a cask would one quart make? A. About 2-10ths in the rule; there is not a quart in this bottle, but the cask was leaking - I do not know whether any one else had been there; to the best of my judgment the brandy in the cask and this in the bottle are the same - I have no hesitation at all in swearing that: the prisoner was an extra man there - all persons are searched coming out, and I should think he would have been stopped with it; no sample bottles are allowed there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not bore the cask - I took the spile out.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . The day before yesterday I was going home to Walthamstow, and called on my daughter at Newington. I and my wife had two pints of porter at the Three Crowns - we left at half-past seven o'clock in the evening; I was perfectly sober: when we got to <placeName id="t18291029-261-crimeloc1463">Tile-kiln-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18291029-261-crimeloc1463" type="placeName" value="Tile-kiln-lane"/>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t18291029-261-off1462 t18291029-261-crimeloc1463"/>, I met three men - I saw them before they came up to us; the prisoner was one of them, and he had a pack at his back - a man on his right-hand struck me, and I fell; in getting up the prisoner's hand was close against my watch; I called out Watch! my wife then said she was struck, and I cried Murder! the men made the best of their way off - I am certain the prisoner was one, and he was in the middle; it was star-light - the prisoner went forty or fifty yards, then came back, and said, "What the devil is the matter?" we called Watch! Watch! he ran, and called Watch! Picket came up, and he had hold of the prisoner; I said that was the very man, and he had been in the centre of the three, with a pack at his back - he is a bird-catcher; neither of the others had a pack - I saw his face quite plain; the officer took charge of him, and he was taken to the watch-house - I did not lose my watch; he put his hand against it, but the seals were in my clothes, and there was nothing for any one to lay hold of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. He was quite a stranger? A. Yes; there was a lamp in the lane - there were no trees near us; I swear to him both by the fact, and the man himself - I was not muddled; the man who ran away, called Watch! the man who struck against my watch, went away, and came back - he did not say any thing, till he came back; no hand had been thrust into my fob.</p>
               <p>MARTHA WILBEY. I am the prosecutor's wife. In Tile Kiln-lane, we met three men; they knocked my husband's hat off - the prisoner put his hand to my husband's watch; he had a pack on his back - I saw it as I picked up my husband's hat; I said, "How dare you insult my husband, he said nothing to you;" one of the others then struck me in the eye.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. Had you been with your husband all the afternoon? A. Yes, and drank a little, but not to hurt me - I drank at a grocer's shop, but not at the Three Crowns, only two pints were drank there - I saw a large bunch of onions.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM PICKET. I am an officer. I went into Tile Kiln-lane, on my way home; I met three or four men running, who said, "They want you - a man and woman have been insulted down the lane; have you met a man?" I said Yes - they said, "Had he any thing on his back?" I said No - I ran down the hill, and saw the prosecutor; his wife was holding her handkerchief to her eye - I said,"Which way did he go?" they said, "Down the hill;" I ran and overtook the prisoner, who was walking towards the bridge - I said, "You are my prisoner;" he said he was willing to go with me, but he knew nothing of it - the prosecuter said he was the man who tried to take his watch; the prisoner had some onions, and a large package of bird-cages - the prosecutor said he was one of the three that had insulted him, and had put his hand to his watch</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he was the man who clapped his hand to his watch? A.Something like that; the prisoner had a large load - he had some sticks, or poles, and some nets; that is a very common place for bird-catchers on Sundays - there had been several parties of bird-catchers that day.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Were your watch and seals entirely concealed? A. Yes; no one could take hold of it - he put his hand against it; he did not strike me in any other way - I told Henry Watts how we had been used, and he told the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got to the high bridge, one hundred or two hundred and fifty yards before the prosecutor - I heard the woman cry out; I turned back and said, "Mistress, what is the matter?" I then went on, but I had lost a little dog, and went back to see for him - I then turned to go home, and met the officer.</p>
