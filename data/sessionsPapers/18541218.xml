                  </hi>, Esq. I am one of the Masters of the Court of Exchequer. I produce an original deposition, taken by me on 3rd Nov., and the Judge's order for me to examine the witness, which is necessary tinder the Common Law Procedure Act—I examined the defendant upon this order—I administered the oath to him—this is his signature to the deposition—he signed it in my presence, and this is my attestation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was an examination at the instance of the plaintiff? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—(<hi rend="italic">Order read: "On hearing the attornies or agents for the plaintiff, and James Pugh, I do order that the said James Pugh appear and be examined on oath before one of the Masters, as to the matters concerning which he has refused to make an affidavit." Signed, "Crompton."—The deposition of the defendant was here put in and read. He described himself as a military outfitter, and stated, that in Aug.</hi>, 1852, <hi rend="italic">he arranged with Mr. Andrews to carry on business with him; that he, Pugh, was to remove his business from his premises, in Jermyn-street, to Mr. Andrews's premises, in Cork-street, and that Andrews was to provide the capital, and other requisites; that he, Pugh, was to be allowed a commission of</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">per cent, on the business he introduced, and that this arrangement was carried on till</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1854, <hi rend="italic">when a misunder<lb/>standing occurred. He proceeded to state, that various orders for jewellery were given him by customers, which jewellery he obtained from Messrs. Dray<lb/>son; and after detailing the particulars of his disagreement with Andrews, the deposition proceeded as follows:</hi> "I recollect an interview with the defendant a day or two before the trial of this action, which was on 16th June, at Mr. Teague's; it was on 8th June. I went, at the request of the defendant, to see what sort of proof I could make on his behalf. Mr. Teague had got a proof prepared, which he read over to me. I was described in it as commercial traveller to the defendant, and that I had no authority to buy the goods. I objected to this, and said I was not the defendant's com<lb/>mercial traveller, and stated the nature of my arrangement with the defendant, as already stated by me in this deposition. Mr. Teague then said it was a partnership between the defendant and myself. Defendant contradicted this, and said it was not a partnership. Mr. Teague then said to the defendant, 'Let me hear your version of the matter." Defendant said, 'I was to charge Mr. Pugh 5 per cent, for the use of my capital;" and he was going on, but Mr. Teague stopped him, and said again that it was a partnership, and that Mr. Pugh must not stay in town. Defendant said, 'Do you mean to say that Mr. Pugh could pledge my credit for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., without my sanction?' Mr. Teague said, 'Yes, certainly, for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and you would be obliged to pay it;' and that the only thing to be done was to send me out of town; for that if I was examined at the trial, and this was to come out, defendant would certainly lose it. Mr. Teague said, 'Mr. Pugh must not be in London another hour; he must not even go home, on any account;' and Mr. Teague offered to send to my house for anything I might require. It was fixed that I should go at once. I said I had, no money. Defendant said he had no money with him, and asked Mr. Teague to lend him some money. Defendant asked Mr. Teague to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me. Mr. Teague drew a cheque for that amount, and I went out, and returned in half an hour, and received ten sovereigns from Mr. Teague. Mr. Teague warned me not to come back to town until after the trial. During this interview defendant said that we must have an agreement</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180009"/>
               <p>drawn up between us immediately. I said I had always wished for one, and should have no objection to it, if it secured to me my half of the profits. I went out of town on 10th June, and returned on the afternoon of the day of the trial. About 30th June last, I was requested by Mr. Teague to make an affidavit. He wanted to describe me as commercial traveller to defendant I objected to this, and it was finally agreed that I should be described as a commercial traveller generally. Mr. Teague assured me that this should not affect my position with the defendant. I then consented to make the affidavit. It was read over to me; I did not read it I after<lb/>wards swore it at Guildhall, etc. <hi rend="italic">Signed</hi>, <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES PUGH. W. F. POLLOCK."</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney. I was the attorney for Mr. Andrews in the action of Drayson and another, <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Andrews, in which there was a verdict for the defendant—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the rule for the new trial—here are three rules; this one is the amended rule—this is not the one served on me by the plaintiff it is an office copy which I have obtained and examined with the books in the office—Mr. Harrison, the attorney, had not got the rule, he had lost it—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">stated, that this rule was dated, Nov.</hi> 14, 1854, <hi rend="italic">and had not yet been argued</hi>)—the examination of the defendant Pugh, taken before Master Pollock, was used by the plaintiff in the action for the purpose of obtaining this rule—I first became ac<lb/>quainted with the connection between the defendant and Mr. Andrews about May, this year, when Mr. Andrews came to consult me respecting a claim made by Messrs. Drayson and Burwash, for tome jewellery—I saw the defendant in relation to that claim, some time I believe in the latter end of May, when the action was first commenced—that was the action for 166<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for jewellery, as was indorsed on the writ—when I first saw him he told me that he had gone to Drayson and Burwash, and had ordered some jewellery in the name of Mr. Andrews, and that he had not Mr. Andrews's authority for ordering those things—in consequence of notice of trial having been given, I wished to take the evidence of Mr. Pugh as a witness, if necessary—I received instructions from Mr. Andrews as to what Mr. Pugh could state; I prepared a statement of what Mr. Pugh could state, from what Mr. Andrews told me; and on 8th June Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pugh came to my office—I said to Mr. Pugh, "I wish you to state all that you know respecting this transaction; Mr. Andrews tells me that you have obtained these goods without his authority?"—he said, "Well, I believe I have"—I then asked him for whom he had obtained such goods, or, "For whom did you procure those goods?" or something to that effect—he said, "I obtained them for three customers of mine, Mr. Talbot, Mr. Masklin, and somebody else"—I then asked one or two other questions, and took this piece of paper, the statement which I had already prepared, and read it through to him seriatim—this is the original document; he sat by my side as I read it to him, and I believe he followed me in that reading—it was under his eyes," and he also heard me read it—when I came to portions of it he ordered alterations to be made (<hi rend="italic">reading the document—In this statement Pugh described himself as commercial traveller to Andrews, and stated that the various articles of jewellery which he had obtained from Messrs. Drayson for various customers were ordered by him without the sanction or authority of Andrews; he further stated, that he had no authority from him specifically to give any such order in his name.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That was read over to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it is just in the same form as when he left my office—he did not sign it—I did not ask him to do so—I took it in the first person, because a witness understands it better—I inva<lb/>riably</p>

               <p>do so—after I had made the corrections suggested by the defendant, I said to Mr. Andrews, who was in the room, "I do not think it will be necessary to call Mr. Pugh as a witness; he has quite confirmed all you have before told me"—Andrews said, in Pugh's presence, "I should wish him to be called as a witness, as I wish all the facts to appear"—(Mr. Andrews permitted him to state all this)—I said, "You do not require Mr. Pugh's evidence; and if he should be examined as a witness, and prove by his evidence that he has obtained these goods fraudulently, he might possibly, on the application of Drayson and Burwash, be ordered by the Judge into custody"—Pugh immediately said, "Then I had better keep out of the way"—I said that I thought he had; and I believe I said, "You had better perhaps go out of town," or something to that effect—Pugh then asked Andrews if he would let him have some money—he wanted 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Andrews said, "I have no money with me; perhaps Mr. Teague will lend you the money"—I said, "No, I will not do anything of the kind"—Mr. Andrews then said to me, "Will you give him a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I will send you the money in the afternoon?"—I said, "I have no objection to give you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I drew a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was cashed, and Pugh had the money—Pugh left for a short time, and came back for the money (I having sent my clerk to cash the cheque), and I never saw him again till the latter end of the month, the 29th—the cause was tried on the 16th June, and a verdict given for the defendant—in consequence of a summons and an order to stay execution, and an affidavit having been filed, I saw Pugh again—I took the instructions from Andrews and Pugh together on this affidavit—I have not got the paper with me—Mr. Andrews and the prisoner made separate affidavits—the one which Pugh made on 30th June is the one I have been speaking of—it was made to show cause against the summons for an order to stay execution—it was used by me for that purpose, and filed—(<hi rend="italic">this affidavit being read, contained accounts of various interviews with Mr. Burwash, and stated that the entries of the articles of jewellery purchased by him of Mr. Burwash, to the amount of</hi> 166<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">were made in Mr. Andrews's books, without his (Andrews's) privity or sanction</hi>) he certainly never objected to being described as the defendant's commercial traveller—I did not at the interview of 8th June, or at any time say to him that it was a partnership between Mr. Andrews and him, or anything to that effect—I never said to Pugh, "Why, it is a partnership between you and Mr. Andrews"—I did not stop Mr. Pugh, and say it was a part<lb/>nership, or anything of the sort—nothing was said on that occasion, about a partnership by any one—nothing was said about pledging his credit—Mr. Andrews did not say, "Do you mean to say that Mr. Pugh can pledge my credit for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., without my sanction"—nor did I say, "Yes, for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not say that the only thing was to send him out of town, for if he was examined at the trial, and this was to come out, the defendant would certainly lose it—I spoke to him about going out of town, but not in that way—I did not say, "Mr. Pugh must not be in town another hour, he must not even go home on any account"—I did not offer to send to his house for anything—the whole of the statement of the conversation sworn to by Mr. Pugh, as having taken place in my office on 8th Aug., is a fabri<lb/>cation from beginning to end, except as to the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did not on 30th June, when this affidavit was made, object to his being described as a com<lb/>mercial traveller to the defendant—nothing was said by any one about an assurance, that it should not affect his position with the defendant—I read over the affidavit to him, and he afterwards swore it—on 10th July, Mr. Andrews</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180011"/>
               <p>and Mr. Pugh, came to my office, that was by an appointment, which Mr. Andrews had previously made with me—a discussion then took place between Mr. Andrews and Mr. Pugh, as to the right of Mr. Pugh to purchase goods, and also as to the commission which he should receive as his traveller—in consequence of the conversation we had on that occasion, I prepared an agreement by their joint instruction—I have the draft of it here, it was never signed (<hi rend="italic">in this the defendant was described as commercial traveller to Mr. Andrews</hi>)—after this agreement had been prepared and sent to Mr. Andrews, Mr. Pugh came to my office with a letter from Mr. Andrews, and upon that occasion Pugh spoke to me as to the terms of the commission which Mr. Andrews proposed to pay him, and he objected to those terms—he said that Mr. Andrews had proposed, as he had at a former meeting, to pay him 10 per cent, upon moneys received—Pugh thought he ought to have 15 per cent., the agreement was prepared upon the basis of 10 per cent.—an appointment was made for the next day the 13th, and then the two parties met together at my office—they then had a long discussion about this question of commission, and it resulted in a cost price book being made out by Mr. Pugh, as he said he wished to satisfy Mr. Andrews that he could afford to pay out of the profits more than 10 per cent, upon orders that he was to get—I told Pugh that his commission could not be regulated by the profits, because if the profits were to regulate it, it might be a constructive partnership—I said in addition to that, "You might then be liable to pay the debts"—Pugh remarked, "That is what I wish to avoid"—he also said, "When I first came to Mr. Andrews, it was agreed between us that there should not be a partnership, for Mr. Andrews told me he never would have another partner"—he also said, "I consider that I am not his partner, nor do I wish to be his partner"—they then left my office with the understanding between them, that the cost price was to be made out to satisfy Mr. Andrews, that he could afford to pay Pugh more than 10 per cent.—nothing was ever said about a division of profits—this agreement was not carried out, it was never signed—Mr. Pugh saw the rough draft of it—he said he considered the terms of it were very stringent, for I bind him down here, that he is not to buy any goods without specific orders—Mr. Pugh did not at any of these interviews, claim to be a partner of Mr. Andrews—the only instance of a partnership being mentioned was by me, when I said that if the commission was to be regulated by the profits it might be a constructive partnership—nobody else ever said any<lb/>thing of the kind—I first heard that the defendant claimed to be a partner some time in Aug., when I was abroad—I received a letter from Mr. Andrews, I find it was on 15th Sept.—that was the first time I heard of it—the first notice that Mr. Andrews had of a partnership that I knew of, was by having a notice of dissolution; he came to consult me about it on 14th Sept.—in consequence of Pugh collecting debts, I was obliged to get an injunction, which I obtained on 18th Nov.—that injunction is still in force, restraining him from receiving any moneys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That injunction was granted upon a bond given by Mr. Andrews for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a bond proffered by Mr. Andrews to be given—it was not required by the Court; a receiver would not have been appointed if the bond had not been given—I swear that, it could not be so, upon the form of the proceedings, as I am advised—the bond was given at the time the injunction was granted; it was, of course, given before the judgment of the Court; it was all simultaneous, it was all on the same day, at the same moment—this was an action against Mr. Andrews by</p>

               <p>Drayson and Co., for goods supplied to Pugh, upon Andrews's credit—the verdict was for the defendant, Mr. Andrews—no witnesses were called for the defence, we did not find it necessary—a motion was made on the part of Messrs. Drayson and Co., for a new trial, and upon that the examination was used—it was to have come on to be argued last term—I had affidavits ready to answer them; Mr. Montague Chambers took an objection, that the rule was not in conformity with the new practice; I suppose I may say it was a technical objection—it put the matter over, so that it will not now be argued till Hilary Term; but Mr. Chambers took that objection con<lb/>trary to my instructions and wishes, as he knew I wanted to argue it then and there—in the meanwhile I went before the grand jury, and preferred his indictment—we did not give notice to the defendant—I did not sum<lb/>mon him before a Magistrate; I got the bill in the usual way, it was with<lb/>out going before a Magistrate; myself, Mr. Andrews, and Mr. Dax, were the witnesses before the grand jury—Mr. Dax is an officer of the Court of Exchequer—the assignments of perjury only apply to the conversation at my chambers; nobody was there on the part of Mr. Pugh—it is not usual when you examine a witness to have an attorney present—I had prepared this document before he came, from the instructions of Mr. Andrews; that was to save time, to make any corrections that were necessary—I always do, if I have the chance of preparing a deposition of a witness, take it from the client first—I think that desirable to save time; it is more readily altered if it is all ready done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And it is read over to the witness, who not unfrequently is found accommodating, and signs it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all: I do not understand what you call "accommodating;" it is not my practice—it was drawn up to read over to him as I should to any other witness; I did it to save time when the witness came; I intended to correct it according to his own suggestion, and then transfer it to the brief, as a witness, if necessary.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, carrying on business at No. 9, Cork-street, Burlington-gardens. I have carried on that business twenty-one years—Mr. Pugh was introduced to me in 1851—he made an application at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180014"/>
               <p>that time to be taken into my service, that came to nothing—in Aug., 1852, he applied to me again, stating that his circumstances were such that he had a large amount of orders to execute, but had not the means of carrying them on—he was at that time attempting to carry on business for himself as a tailor, in Jermyn-street, but he had orders which he could not execute, he had not capital enough; a broker was in possession of his premises at the time—he made a proposal to bring his orders to me, and I was to grant him a commission—he told me that he had such confidence in me he would rely upon any commission that I choose to allow him—it had originally been stipulated, in the first instance, that the commission should be 5 per cent., but he thought if he trusted to me he would obtain a larger commission—I finally agreed that he should bring his business to me; but I told him I could not tell him on what terms until I knew the nature of the business he would introduce—his duty was that of a traveller for me to obtain orders, to act as my commercial traveller—he was not to give orders for cloth, or anything, without my sanction—I agreed to make him advances as he required it, which I have done—the commission was to be settled afterwards, as it went on—he was not to give orders, even in my own trade, without my authority—I latterly allowed him to receive accounts that were due; and at first I believe I should not have objected to it, because it was understood it would have been a case of embezzlement had he received them, and I never found him guilty of receiving them until lately—he came into my employment in Aug., 1852—he brought some considerable orders at the commencement, but in consequence of the difficulties in his circumstances, he brought very few afterwards, till after his bankruptcy—he commenced his duties in Aug.—in Dec, 1852, he was arrested, and he was made a bankrupt in that month, while he was in my service—he was in prison about three weeks—I occasionally visited him there—he then came back and entered my service, without a certificate—he did not get a certificate until the present year—it was suspended twelve months—he afterwards travelled into the country for me to get orders, and also went about town for that purpose—he occasionally, to my knowledge, ordered cloths and other things required for the trade, from warehousemen—some new accounts were opened with new warehousemen: that I ought to explain—in conse<lb/>quence of the arrangements not being broken off with respect to accoutre<lb/>ments and other things, he wished to introduce the hosiery and scarf busi<lb/>ness as well, which I did not understand—I allowed him to go and obtain certain goods, subject to my approbation—he went on in that way until Sept., 1853, when the first articles were got from Drayson's—I was out of town when the first articles, the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, were procured—the first time I ever saw the things for the first gentleman, I believe they were in his shirt, or I would have returned them—I spoke to the prisoner on the sub<lb/>ject, and desired him never to undertake to procure any such things—I could not return them as they had been used—I not only found fault with him for obtaining them, and desired him never to procure such things again, but I even, in his presence, severely scolded the young gentleman who had induced him to get them, which we do not very often do—he was a very young man, but he was of age—I first became acquainted with the fact that jewellery to the amount of 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been got from Drayson and Co., exactly ten days after the things had been obtained—I think it was on 29th Dec.—Mr. Burwash called upon me, I had never spoken to him before—Pugh was not present; I afterwards spoke to him upon the subject—I told him Mr. Burwash had represented that he had obtained some valuable diamond rings,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180015"/>
               <p>and I asked him whether he had obtained any such—he said he had—I said, "How could you do so, when you know it is contrary to my express orders? What have you done with them?"—he said, "I have sold them to three young gentlemen, all under age," and one of those I have never seen—he mentioned their names—I said, "How could you obtain them, upon what authority?"—he said, "Oh, a Mr. Osborne introduced me to Mr. Drayson," and this Osborne is an uncertificated bankrupt; he was with Futvoye, as one of his shopmen—I found fault with him about it—I said, "I would rather loose double the amount of the rings than such a transaction should take place in my house," and I made him write a letter to these young gentlemen, desiring them instantly to return the things, and took the letter, with Mr. Pugh, to Mr. Burwash—I could not get them back, because they had disposed of them to young ladies—there was a handsome bracelet got afterwards—I took Pugh with me to Mr. Burwash, and expressed my ex<lb/>treme astonishment that such a thing should be done without making any application to me—I told them that I should require the things to be returned, and should not ask them permission; I would not recognize the transaction in any way whatever—I had other interviews with them, in the presence of Pugh, and I greatly found fault with Mr. Burwash, and told him that however unjustifiable Mr. Pugh's conduct was, I thought theirs was scarcely better—that was said in Pugh's presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In all those interviews before they brought the action, did Pugh ever set up that he was your partner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; I told them that I would hold Pugh's commission, whatever it was, responsible for any act done in my house; and I would endeavour to get the transaction cleared without loss, if they would leave it in my hands—I said, no one should do such a trans<lb/>action in my house without being fully responsible—I told them that I would discharge him on the spot, but that I should not then have the oppor<lb/>tunity of assisting them in getting them paid—after I received a letter, say<lb/>ing, that an action was brought, I went to Mr. Teague to consult him, I made a statement to him of the transaction of this jewellery—on 6th June I received a letter which Mr. Teague has; to the best of my knowledge the words were, "Please to attend with Mr. Pugh, your traveller, on the 8th instant"—I showed that letter to Mr. Pugh, and desired him to proceed to Mr. Teague's, and meet me there (I had previously seen Mr. Teague, and given him my statement); Mr. Pugh was there before me—Mr. Teague read over the instructions, the minutes of evidence, I suppose you call them, that were prepared under what I had stated, and Mr. Pugh had them corrected, and the corrections were then and there made by Mr. Teague—Mr. Teague said that he did not think it was necessary for him to attend—I objected to it, and said, I wished the fullest examination in every parti<lb/>cular; I am not quite certain whether I did not even remark that I would rather lose the trial than there should be anything like concealment—Mr. Teague said he did not think a witness was necessary for me; but from the minutes of evidence that he had read, in his opinion if the evidence were given in the same form, upon the application of the then plaintiff's counsel, that then and there the Judge would order him into custody—Pugh said, "I had better not be there then"—I said, "I can have nothing to do with that; I cannot recognise any absence"—Mr. Teague, I think, then said, "You are not desiring his absence, nor commanding it; but if he is not wanted, if he chooses to stay away, I do not see how you can help it; I do not see what you have to do with it, we do not want him;" or something of that kind—I said I would not be a party to it, and Mr. Teague told me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180016"/>
               <p>that I need have nothing to do with it at all—Pugh said he was to have gone on his journey the day before, and he had better go out of town—he then said that he bad not any money prepared for it—I was always obliged to make him advances before going out of town—I asked Mr. Teague to let him have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he did—I did not see the money given; the trial came on, and there was a verdict for the defendant—the prisoner came to me on the following morning—with reference to this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you will find in his book that for his travelling expenses he has charged me but 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the book is here, it is in his own handwriting—he charges 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for ten days; he told me he could not charge me the full amount, because it was on his own account that he was absent—after his return he informed me of an interview that he had had with Mr. Drayson or Mr. Burwash—it was after the trial; I cannot say on what day—he told me that he had been sent for to Drayson's, and that Mr. Burwash had said it was clear I was not liable for these things and somebody was, and he wanted to know what arrangement he could make respecting the rings—I said to him, "I think (if I recollect rightly) Mr. Drayson and Mr. Burwash are acting very sillily, because I intended to have seen them harmless in the matter if they had left it to me; but I cannot help you now"—I was not aware that he was going to make an affidavit in opposition to a summons for staying proceedings; I was after<lb/>wards made acquainted with it—I was not present when he had it read over to him, or when he swore to it—he never complained to me that he was described in the affidavit as a commercial traveller—I think he did afterwards when he told me in Sept. that I had the honour of having a partner; but never before Sept., after he had claimed to be a partner—in July there was an attendance at Mr. Teague's, with reference to the terms of his commission, the first occasion upon which such a subject was mentioned was I think about 10th July—Mr. Pugh wished to have the commission regulated upon a scale according to the profits; Mr. Teague said that could not be the case, or it might be construed into a partnership—he made use of the terms, "Constructive partnership," and therefore he would not recommend it—he recommended a fixed commission, and that we should decide upon what the commission should be fixed—that was the first time I ever heard Mr. Teague even make use of the word partnership in the matter—I told Pugh that he had better get a few sheets of paper, and make out a prime cost book, and he would find that he was very much mistaken in his estimate, for imaginary and real profits were very different things—he wanted 15 per cent., and I told him it was ridiculous—I saw him begin to make some account, but I never saw it—I think it was on the 10th or 11th Sept., that he claimed to be a partner—he said to me, "At the time, when you, in the presence of Mr. Teague, told me that I must go about my business at twenty-four hours notice, I then knew that I must do something"—that was the day Mr. Teague came about his affi<lb/>davit—I was so displeased' with his conduct about Drayson's concern, that I threatened to discharge him—that was at the latter end of June, it was in Sept. that he told me he knew he must do something, it was in the pre<lb/>sence of both my foreman Monger, and Perryman—he said that he had been advised that he was my partner—that was the first time I heard that claim set up—I was afterwards obliged to resort to the Court of Chancery, in consequence of his collecting debts—at the interview at Mr. Teague's on 8th June, he did not object to being described as a commercial traveller—he did not say that he was not my commercial traveller—he did not at that interview state that he had made an arrangement with me, as to his not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185412180017"/>
               <p>being my commercial traveler—Mr. Teague did not say that it was a part<lb/>nership between me and him, nor did I contradict that, and say it was not a partnership—Mr. Teague did not say to me, "Let me hear your version of the matter"—nor did I say that I was to charge Mr. Pugh 5 per cent, for the use of my capital—Mr. Teague did not stop me, and say again that it was a partnership, and that Mr. Pugh must not stay in town—I did not ask Mr. Teague whether Mr. Pugh could pledge my credit for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor did Mr. Teague answer that he could pledge it for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or anything to that effect—it is quite fabulous from first to last—I have given a correct account of what did occur, to the best of my ability—I was at Mr. Teague's on 30th June, when Pugh's affidavit was read over to him, and I was pre<lb/>sent when he swore it at Guildhall.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you told Mr. Teague those facts, did he suggest that if they were proved by Mr. Pugh, it would subject him to a charge of obtaining money by false pretences? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was not until after it was corrected, as far as I can recollect—Mr. Teague had previously told me in conversation that the things had been obtained fraudulently—it was not until after the correction that he told Pugh so—I believe it was after the correction—I cannot say what the correction was—I had not the correcting—I saw Mr. Teague correcting the paper from Mr. Pugh's dictation—I do not know whether it was after the correction, "I had no authority from him specifi<lb/>cally;" it was not my examination—the country air was not recommended to him; it was proposed by himself—I cannot say whether the country trip was first thought of after the words "from him specifically" were put in—it was first thought of by Mr. Pugh himself; you had better ask him—I particularly wished him to be present as a witness—I did not notice this alteration—I was there to give my particulars as well as Mr. Pugh—we do not listen quite so acutely as to every word; we leave a little to the attorney—I do not recollect hearing the word "specifically" before—if I had taken my own course, I should have given him into custody at first for embezzlement—Mr. Teague said it would not be safe—his attorney had told me that he was insolvent, and as he was collecting debts we could not stop him, and that he perhaps might go on receiving them, and it would be better to get safety than revenge—it was not his own attorney who said that; it was Mr.——; I do not think it was so strong a term as that: I cannot recollect the terms exactly—you may recall them if you like; I do not want to urge them—I do not know that the prisoner dictated to Mr. Teague that words should be put in entirely altering the sense of the sentence—let me see them; I would rather trust my own eyes—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the paper</hi>)—I give you my word that I never noticed that before, not the word "specifically."—I have not seen this since the time it was first drawn—I heard it read—I cannot tell whether that was after the alteration—I believe it was read, and while being read it was altered—I did not hear it read after the alteration was made—I think it was only read once—he might require certain words to be entered, which might be done without my positively noticing it—these are the words as they originally stood, "I acknowledge I had no authority to give any such orders in his name"—I do not recollect the alteration, "from him specifically," being made—they might have occurred; I certainly did not notice them—I was present when this was read over, but it was not my evidence, and so long as it was con<lb/>nected merely with reading the affidavit I did not much notice it; but had the word "partnership" been down, I should have been sure to have noticed it, because I was very careful to avoid it—I gave the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because it was necessary for him to go out of town—he said so—he wished it, and it was charged against him in his account—it was nothing extraordinary—Mr. Teague did not persuade me to give it him—I believe he said he could not leave town without getting it—I have no doubt he said so—I did not then</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman, in the employ of Mr. Andrews, and have been there a great many years. I recollect Mr. Pugh being there—he once said to me that he was a partner of Mr. Andrews—that was some time about the middle of last July—it was after the trial had taken place about the jewellery—he came in one day as I was at work, and in conversation he brought up the subject of going into the city, and when he came back he said Mr. Teague <hi rend="italic">should home said</hi> he was a partner of Mr. Andrews—previous to that, he has told me that when his friends have said to him why did not he have a written agreement to secure himself a partner with Mr. Andrews, he said he did not wish such a thing; that is, such a thing as an agreement, that he considered his situation was better as he was than being a partner—I understood from him that he had a commis<lb/>sion—I was present when he and Mr. Andrews had a dispute in Sept. about the rings, and Mr. Andrews said that if he would persist in ordering things against his sanction, he must send him about his business—he made answer to that and said, "When I found my situation was not worth a minute's notice, I thought it time to do something for myself"—I do not know the exact answer he made at that time—I do not suppose that was the answer he made then, but that has been the way—he said that, a day or two before he left Mr. Andrews' situation—what he said on that occasion was that if he could not order a few things to carry on the business to suit the customers he did bring, he should not be able to keep his connexion together, or bring customers at all.</p>

In March, 1853, the prisoner came there and applied to open an account in the name of George Andrews, with whom he said he was engaged as traveller—we requested a reference, and got one to Messrs. Barber, of St. Paul's Church-yard—on two or three other occasions after this he called at the warehouse and ordered goods—he never repre<lb/>sented that he was anything but the traveller—we sent the things to Mr. Andrews, charging him with them.</p>

Mr. Andrews was a customer of ours—Pugh Las bought things for Mr. Andrews—he opened an account with me Sept. 6, 1852—he had previously been a bankrupt; and he said that he intended to transfer his connexion to Mr. Andrews, and would I trust Mr. Andrews—he did not say how I was to be paid; he only said that he had made a very good arrangement, and if we did business we should be paid—Andrews was not my customer before Mr. Pugh introduced him—Pugh ordered several lots of goods—I did business with him continously—I have had no particular conversations with him at other times as to what position he held under Mr. Andrews—I saw Mr. Andrews subsequently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Harrisson, a carpenter; we live at No. 2, Bull Inn-yard, Aldgate, right opposite the tap, which shows" a light upon our door, and the gas Light lights all over our kitchen; the</p>

               <p>house consists of a kitchen below, and three rooms over it. I occupy all but the middle room, which is occupied by a lodger, Mrs. Blower, a laundress—I have two children, one is fourteen months old, and the other four years—there are two long muslin curtains and a blind to the kitchen window, which looks into the yard, but they are quite thin; anybody can see through them—I assist my husband by taking in dress and mantle making—last Monday week, about half past 6, or a quarter to 7 o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in the parlour, the ground floor room; I had a lamp, and there was also a good fire which gave some light—I saw a person looking in at the window, as if he was reading my name as dress and mantle maker, which is on a sign board in the window, and directly afterwards I heard a gentle knock at the door; I went to the door and saw the prisoner with a bundle—he asked if Mrs. Harrisson was in; I said, "I am Mrs. Harrisson"—he said "I have brought you some work from my sister"—I asked him into the parlour to see what work it was he had—I went in and he followed me, and shut the door after him, and the parlour door also—the light was on the table close to the door; he put out the light, and said, "Now I want your money"—I said, "I have none"—he touched the outside of my dress, and my money jingled in my pocket—I bad 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, loose in my pocket—he dragged my pocket out, took all the money out, threw the coppers on the floor, and left them there—he then struck me on the nose, and the blood flew on to the bosom of his shirt; I then fell with my head against the corner of a chair, and then he dragged me across to the other side of the room, and struck me at the back of my head with a large stick of my husband's, and left me on the floor unable to speak—then he went to the other end of the room, took two pistols out of his pocket, put them on the table, and said, that if I hallooed out he would kill the baby, which was lying asleep—he cut each end of the line which was hanging in the room, tied my hands together with it, and then dragged me to the other side of the room, <hi rend="italic">jammed</hi> me in between two chairs and left me—the eldest child then began to scream—he prisoner went upstairs, came down again, and the children were then both screaming; he went out of doors, and I saw him look over the short blind as he went by the window—I was then on the floor, unable to make any alarm—my eldest child ran over to the tap and gave an alarm, upon which two men came to me, and afterwards the police, and a medical gentle<lb/>man—in the course of that evening I gave a description to the police of the person who had attacked me; and on the following evening I went, t the request of the police, to a penny theatre, about 300 yards from our house—I went into the pit alone, and saw the prisoner standing by the orchestra with a short pipe in his mouth, and the same handkerchief and trowsers as he had on before; it was a white handkerchief with large blue or green spots; I believe blue—I felt quite certain that he was the man, and I feel quite positive now; I went out directly and spoke to the police, and they went in and took him into custody—I had seen him before, on the Wednesday before this happened, that is three weeks to-day; I was coming from the Metropolitan Hospital with my children, and saw the prisoner near the Exchange with some handkerchiefs, which were not new, and one of which he asked me to buy for a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., then for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and then for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; but in consequence of what a woman who was with me said to me, I did not buy it—I did not stand still, I was going on and the prisoner fol<lb/>lowed me—I had an opportunity of observing his features; he was five or ten minutes in my sight on that occasion, and he was ten minutes or a quar<lb/>ter of an hour in my parlour on that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Leaf and Co., of Old 'Change; they are silk mercers, on a very large scale. On Thursday, 23rd Nov., about half past 1 o'clock, the elder prisoner, Isaac Lowenthall, came to my master's warehouse—there was a man and woman with him—they asked to see some watered silks, and I showed them about half a dozen pieces—one piece of goods was purchased at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—whilst I was showing them the silks, I observed the prisoner Isaac take hold of a piece of silk and hold it up—that had the effect of concealing the action of the woman from me, excepting that I could see she moved and stooped—the prisoner Isaac had been there on the Monday before, and purchased a piece f goods—he did not pay for it then—after these goods were shown to them on the Thursday, and they had purchased one piece, the man and woman went away—the prisoner Isaac remained, and said to me, "Do you know the name of Walker?" and showed me the invoice of the piece of silk he had bought on the Monday before, and which he had paid for in the counting-house on that Thursday morning, before I had shown them any goods—he remained a minute or two after the man and woman had gone away—we</p>

               <p>have a man, named Holland, employed to open the door, and as a sort of guard; and after the man and woman, and Isaac, were gone, I sent for Holland, because I missed a piece of black silk, containing ninety-one yards, which I had on the counter that morning, showing it to Isaac and his two companions—I did not at that time miss any other silk—I did not miss a piece of figured silk till it was shown to me by the police at Guildhall on the following day—those were two of the pieces of silk that I had had on the counter—one was ninety-one yards, the other was sixteen yards—that one had not been shown to them—I know where it was—it was on the counter behind me—I had not occasion to leave the place while Isaac, and the man and woman, were there—how that piece of figured silk went I cannot tell—the woman must have taken it—I was as close to the place where the figured silk was, as I am to this rail—there are two counters; one of them was behind me, and on that counter the figured silk was, and the woman stood behind me—on the following day I saw in the hands of the officer, King, the ninety-one yards of silk that I had missed, and the sixteen yards of figured silk which I did not miss till the officer showed it to me—I know this figured silk to be the property of my employers, because I had a pattern of it, which I took off a day or two before—this is the pattern, and this is the piece of figured silk—they exactly correspond—I know these ninety-one yards of silk by the mark on the paper, and the pencil mark on the piece of goods—the mark on the paper is my writing—it is, "No. 10, 20-inch black ducape"—the value of the two pieces is about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. George Dunbar, who keeps the Crown public house, Basinghall-street. I was at Sadler's-wells Theatre on Friday night—I returned home about 10 minutes to 12 o'clock—I saw a man standing at the corner of Church-passage, Basinghall-street—that man resembles the face of the man I saw (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Jones</hi>)—I could not swear—he has every appearance of the man I saw—I was looking behind on account of my daughter, because I thought, from the position he placed himself in, he might insult her—that was the whole reason my attention was drawn to him.</p>

About four months ago I took some rails off the line, and laid them beside the line near Stratford, close to a bridge—these are them—here is a mark on this piece, made by the weight of an engine, which I noticed, as I had to cut another piece and put in the place of it, and I had to put a longer piece in—I do not know the other piece, but I had to cut a piece off to fill up the other, and I put them both together.</p>

On Saturday night I was on duty between Greenwich and Woolwich—there is a railway across the road between Greenwich and Woolwich—my beat extends from Greenwich up to that arch—a little after 12 o'clock, I saw police-constable Mathews at the end of our respective beats—I stopped at the arch and spoke to Mathews—it was nearly twenty minutes past 12 o'clock—I imagine the conversation lasted about three minutes—he was sober at that time—after I had spoken to him, he returned towards Woolwich—I turned towards Greenwich—my beat extends to the toll gate, towards Greenwich—I went up to the toll gate—I then came back towards the railway bridge—I met the prisoner—he was then coming from the railway towards Greenwich—he was about a quarter of a mile from the railway bridge when I met him—that was ten minutes past 1 o'clock—he was sober—he told me there was a man drunk on the road, falling about, and he told me to take the man to the station, that he had been robbed—he said the man had been robbed of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by the police-constable, Mathews, 179—he did not give me any particulars as to how the man had been robbed—he told me the constable put his hand in his pocket, and took out his purse—he told me to take the drunken man to the station, if I did not, he would take my number, and report me likewise—I then went along my beat towards Woolwich—on my way I met the drunken man—he was about sixty yards from where I saw Verrier, when I came up with him—he could walk pretty well—he tumbled down once—I helped him along towards the station—he talked to me going along, and he appeared to be perfectly sensible to know what was passing and what had passed—I went with him to the station house; when I got there, I found the prisoner—the baker was locked up that night, being intoxicate—I did not hear any charge made by the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker. I remember on Saturday night I started about 6 o'clock from Greenwich to go to Woolwich—when I went away I had two shillings and two or three pence, it was in all 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I started late from Woolwich, about half past 11 o'clock, as near as I can recollect—I spent 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. while I was out—when I started I had one shilling And a six-pence,</p>

               <p>and a few pence—I had been to a friend's house—I had not received a halfpenny from anybody—I had been drinking, but my recollection was as good as ever it was—as I was coming along the road I slipped down by the side of the road—the policeman, Mathews, came, and assisted me to get up—nothing more passed then—he picked me up, started me, and watched me till I had started—no one else was present at the time—the policeman did not put his hand into my pocket and take out my purse, and shake out 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from it—he did not search me, nor insist upon searching me—I did not see any man come up while I was there—I have told all that occurred then—after I left the policeman I walked about 200 yards before the prisoner overtook me—we were walking the same way towards Greenwich—I had another slip—he assisted me a little way—I gave him my address, and offered to pay him, or anybody else who would see me home—I carry my money in my trowsers pocket—I had no watch or any other property—after the prisoner helped me he walked a little way, and then went on ahead, and left me by myself—I met the policeman, Gardner—he walked behind me, watching me to see if I was taking care of myself—I was going along after Mathews had started me, and the prisoner overtook me—I asked him to see me home as far as he was going—I have no knowledge of anything being said about my being robbed—when I got to the station house the prisoner was there—I heard it spoken in the office of my being robbed—I am not positive who spoke it—the prisoner was there, and I distinctly heard somebody say I had been robbed—then I said it was impossible—the sum mentioned was is.—I took out my money and I said it was all right—they then locked me up for my safety, and I know nothing more of it—I never saw the man before to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman, residing on my means, in Brompton Crescent. On 9th Aug. I was residing there—I was told some<lb/>thing by my servant, in consequence of which I left a message at my house, and on the following morning, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner, William Newton, called—he was shown up into the drawing room—I went there, and said, "Mr. William Newton, what is your business with me?"—he said, "I have called on the part of my brother, Mr. Francis Newton"—I said, "Your brother, Mr. Francis Newton, I have never seen; I know nothing about him, and I never have spoken about him. I have of you, and will tell you what I have said, and my author, if you wish it"—he replied, "Oh, that is immaterial, quite immaterial; it is about my brother, Mr. Francis Newton, I have called"—I replied, "I tell you again, your brother, Mr. Francis Newton, I have never seen; I know nothing about him, and I have never spoken about him"—I never had seen him; I never had spoken about him, and I knew nothing about him—he said, "I am sure that Judas, Captain Davilla, has told you something about him"—he said, "What have you said about myself?"—I said, "Mr. William Newton, I bear you no ill will, no malice; you are a young man, which is your only excuse for doing foolish things which subjects you to unpleasantness. You, some evenings back, whilst standing among a group of gentlemen at Mrs. Robin<lb/>son's</p>

               <p>party, at the supper table, asked me, across the table, to honour you by taking wine. Do not take that liberty again, for I will not make your acquaintance"—I said, "What I said to Mrs. Robinson came about thus"—I then told him what I had said of himself; in answer to that he said, "I am sure that ruffian, Davilla, has spoken about my brother to you"—I still declared that was not so, and the interview ended, by my saying, "Now, after this plain and full explanation, if you, or your brother, molest me, I will hand you or him over to the police"—he replied, "Is this the way they do things at Paris?"—I have been a resident in France—I rang the bell, and desired him to leave my house—he seemed unwilling to go, and I went down stairs with him, and he left the house in that way—in the afternoon of that same day (10th Aug.) I was out in Brompton, walking by the side of Captain Davilla, who was on horseback—when I got close to the Brompton high road, a step came up from behind me, and a gentleman stopped me, and said, "I presume I have the honour of addressing Mr. Kerr?"—I bowed, and said, "Yes"—he said, "My name is Mr. Frank Newton"—I said, "Mr. Frank Newton, after the explanation I have given your brother, on your part, this morning, I will hold no conversation with you," and I walked on—he came up after me again and stopped me, and said, "You must speak"—I said, "No, I will not; if you have anything to say to me communicate it in writing"—I walked on, and he stopped me a third time, and said, "You must and shall speak to me"—I said, "I have told your brother, and I tell you, that if you molest me, I will hand you over to the police," and I walked on—he walked up after me, and I felt a blow on the back, which struck my shoulder bone, and I turned round and knocked him down—I stooped down to pick him up again, to knock him down again, when a number of persons came up from behind, all strangers to me, and came between us—I held on to his coat, and his coat ripped up to the collar; a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove up immediately, and he stepped into it, and drove away—I saw no more of him that day, and that was the first time I ever saw him—I had seen William Newton, I think, three or four times before—in consequence of this assault, I went that afternoon to Mr. Arnold, at the Westminster police court, and got a summons, which Mr. Arnold said should be issued for that day week—on the following day I was engaged to a party at Beulah Spa, Norwood—they are pleasure gardens—it was the first time I was ever there—my wife was with me, and other ladies and gentlemen were of the party—there were three ladies of my party who went down with me in my carriage—I did not give the <hi rend="italic">pic nic</hi>, I was invited, and at the gardens we joined a larger number of ladies and gentle<lb/>men—there was dancing and other amusements there in the course of the day—about 8 o'clock in the evening we sat down to tea—most of the com<lb/>pany were at tea—whilst we were at tea I noticed some five or six persons drinking at a table in front of where we were—they were laughing, and appeared to me to be making remarks upon our party—I noticed Mrs. Newton, the prisoner's mother, and a gentleman who has been pointed out to me as her husband, come up, and look about them—I had not seen either of the defend<lb/>ants at that time—shortly after, I heard some altercation going on immediately before us, and a gentleman came up to me and said, "Kerr, there is going to be a <hi rend="italic">row"</hi>—I went forward some few yards when I saw Mr. Francis Newton spring forward upon me, and strike me on the shoulder, saying, "As you would give me no explanation yesterday, I come to punish you, sir"—I felt from the blow that the long whip which he had in his hand was loaded—he leaped back, and sprang forward again, and struck me on the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not they favour him so far as to call out against you as a coward, for being down on this man, and striking him when he was down, and tearing his coat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear it—they did not hoot me—I do not think I was on the top of him when they separated us—I stooped down, and he was undermost—the first time I saw Mr. Francis Newton was when he came up to me in the Brompton-road—I said, "I will hold no conver<lb/>sation with you; your brother has seen me"—he came up to me a second time, and I said, "If you have any communication to make to me, make it in writing"—he did not ask me to give him some explanation of the charge I had made against him, because he had no opportunity; I would not listen—we were a large party at Beulah Spa—we had dined together before the rencontre, between 4 and 5 o'clock—Mrs. Robinson was one of the party—she invited me to the <hi rend="italic">pic nic</hi>—at the time Mr. Francis Newton came up to me, Mr. Bass came up to me also, and said, "Kerr, there is going to be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> "—I presume that Mr. Bass is here, because he has been subpoenaed by me, and I see from the papers that he was a witness before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Builders' Arms beer shop, in Merton-road. There is a bar and a tap, which is lower than the house—it is one story high, and has a flat roof, covered with zinc—there are two windows over the roof—one window is fastened with a drop catch—any person on that bar top could get to that window, and put an instrument in, raise the catch, and open the window—on Saturday week I was in the tap room, about 7 o'clock in the evening—my wife was in the sitting room, close by—in consequence of something my servant, Elston, said to me, I listened, and heard a person walking on the zinc flat on the roof—I called my son out of the stable, went out into the road, and saw a man on the roof—there was a gas light at the toll gate, which throws a light over my premises—it was the prisoner, Hunter, who was on the roof—he was at my bed room window—I placed my son in the gateway, and Payne at the tap room door—I stood in the road, and saw Hunter drop off the roof, within a yard of where I stood—I laid hold of him momently—he tried to get away—while he was doing so, Lane came up, and said, "Let him go, and I will see that he don't get away"—I told him "No," not as long as life lasted, I would not give him up—Lane walked away about ten yards; he then deliberately turned round, and said to Hunter, "Trip him up"—I was still struggling with Hunter, getting him towards home—a screw driver and a pocket handkerchief fell from him—we forced him into the tap room, and sent for an officer, and gave him in charge—he took a crow bar from his pocket, and used it over my head—he struck me with it five times, but there were only three wounds—they bled—some other persons came up, he was taken into the house—I went in—Lane followed us in, and I told him he was one of the party—I collared him, and held him till a policeman came and took him into cus<lb/>tody—I had hold of Hunter and him too—Lane said he did not belong to the party, and he did not know anything of him at all—the policeman came and took Hunter—we gave the crow bar in charge of the policeman—I afterwards examined the bed room window, and saw the marks where a screw driver had been in, trying to lift the sash up; and there was some candle grease under the bottom sash—a person with that screw driver might lift up the window, and get into the house—I had my wounds dressed, first by my wife, and afterwards by a surgeon—there were articles of property in that bed room.</p>

(I had one in my pocket book)—he said, "The matter is now arranged"—I went up stairs—I did not see the receipt written—I saw it after it was written—I do not know the handwriting—I had written a receipt for Mr. Petre to give to the prisoner—it was written in English, and the receipt that was afterwards written was a copy of mine, with the exception of its being for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. de Curgas read the receipt to the prisoner in French, and translated it into English, and he said to him in French, "This is for the purpose of giving a full discharge for all"—the prisoner said, "Yes yes, yes," as to its being a full discharge for all or any charge that he might have against Mr. Petre—I saw the prisoner sign it, the receipt, and it was given to Mr. Petre—I saw Mr. Petre hand a cheque to the prisoner—he went away, and came back some time after<lb/>wards, and came up stairs—the said to me and Mr. Petre that the cheque was wrong—the mistake was that it was dated the 24th, and this was on Satur<lb/>day, the 23rd—I said we had discovered the mistake, and Mr. Petre would give him another—Mr. Petre put himself to the table to give him another, and I took the first cheque and wrote on it "Spoiled," and wrote the same in the cheque book—Mr. Petre then wrote a second cheque, and it was handed to the prisoner—the first cheque remained on the table.</p>
