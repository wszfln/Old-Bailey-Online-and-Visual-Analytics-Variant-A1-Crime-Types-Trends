                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Foster-street, Half Moon-street. I have known the prisoner two years—I have been cohabiting with him about eight months—he left me on Thursday, 6th March, and on 8th March I met him in the street—he said he had had no breakfast, and the person he was with had taken his jacket, and gone away—I took my shawl to a leaving shop, and I was with him till 10 o'clock at night—he wanted me to give him his supper—I said I was not prepared to give it him—he was dreadful angry—I called him a murderer, and struck him—he struck me—I called him a murderer because we were quarrelling about a penny pie—he struck me with his hand—I was on the stairs—he said, "Come in," and he took me and struck me, and kicked me, I believe—I became insen<lb/>sible, and was taken to the Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am principal clerk to the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London.

On 4th March, about a quarter pest 1 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Bethnal-green, and heard some persons talking—shortly afterwards I heard some person fall to the ground—before I arrived at the spot, I heard a person say, "You are welcome to take all I have got, but do not take my life, for the sake of my wife and family"—I went up, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground, on his back, and the prisoner laying hold of his coat collar or stock—I showed my light, and the prisoner let go his hold—I said, "What are you doing with the man?—he said, "It is a friend of mine—he called him Forest, or Forrester, and told him to get up—he told me that he was going to see him home, as they had been drinking together at Mr. Beale's public house, Church-street, Bethnal-green—the prosecutor then got up, seized the prisoner by the bosom of his shirt, pulled him towards me, told me to take him into custody for knocking him down with intent to rob him, and said that he did not know him at all—I took him to the station—the prosecutor had been drinking, but was quite capable of what he was doing—he walked by himself, and walked steadily—he perfectly knew what he was about—he seemed agitated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at Ewsley—there is a bridge over the Grand Junction Canal called Ewsley Bridge—I live near that bridge—on the Friday evening that the children were found in the canal, I saw the prisoner near Ewsley Bridge, about half past 6 o'clock—I was on the bridge—the prisoner had two children with her—she was about half way up into the road from the water side, I mean from the towing path—she was coming from the towing path—the towing path comes under the bridge—she was coming from the towing path up into the road—she went down the road on the same side as she came up—that road leads into the Uxbridge road—I did not speak to her then—I saw her again about three minutes afterwards—she came back on the same bridge—both the children were with her—she came back, and asked me if I could tell her where Mr. Turton, the shoemaker, lived, and I told her—he lives in the neigh<lb/>bourhood, on the Uxbridge-road—she then went as if she was going in the direction for Mr. Turton's that is, away from the canal—I afterwards saw her again on Colham Bridge—that was about half past 7 o'clock—she was then alone—there were no children with her—she was then going down towards Mr. Tollitt's towards Dray ton station—there was some one stand<lb/>ing on the bridge with me at that time—the prisoner crossed the bridge—she afterwards came back with a baby in her arms—that was two or three minutes afterwards—I was still on the bridge—she asked me if I was speaking to her—I was speaking to a young woman who was along with me—that young woman answered the prisoner, and said, "No"—nothing else passed—the prisoner crossed the bridge, and went right straight along the Uxbridge-road—I saw her again that evening, in the lane that leads from Ewsley Bridge to the Uxbridge-road, about half way in the lane—I think that was about 8 o'clock—she then had her baby in her arms—she was then coming back into the Uxbridge-road from Ewsley Bridge—I did not see anything more of her after that—I afterwards saw the bodies of the children that evening, lying on the bank of the canal, after they had been pulled out of the water—they were close to Ewaley Bridge—that was close to the place where I had first seen the prisoner with the two children that evening—the bodies of the children were afterwards taken to Mr. Rumble's, at the Anglers' Arms.</p>

Thompson, No. 9, Bunhill<lb/>row"—I find that endorsement on this note—I gave the note to James Phillips, a messenger in our employ, and gave him certain directions, without saying anything to the prisoner about it—Phillips returned in about an hour and a quarter, or an hour and a half with the note stamped "forged," as it is now—I produced it to the prisoner, and told him it was a forged Bank of England note—he said, "It is a bed job, I know where I got it from; I got it in change"—a policeman was outside the shop, and I gave the prisoner into his custody—I did not see</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185604070039"/>
               <p>and the prisoner took the money to the bank—this 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the cash book on 9th Feb. is in the prisoner's writing—I do not, of my own know<lb/>ledge, know how much of that was paid into the bank—on 14th Feb. here is 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid—on 20th Feb. the amount made up is 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—that is the day that he left—he brought me a packet of money that even<lb/>ing, the envelope of which was either lost or destroyed—I did not think it of any consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Are you an assistant to your mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the bills are not all made out in my name—the bill heads are "Kenneth" only—they are receipted "Jas. Kenneth," when received by me, and are in your name when you received them—I do not know that I instructed you to put "Jeremiah Bees pro J. Kenneth"—you were John Bees with me, and not Jeremiah—I dare say you did put "J. Rees"—my mother and myself used to tell you to take money to the bank—the first thing you had to do was to put the money down—I was not always in the counting house, I was sometimes in the shop and sometimes in the street—I did not open the packets, to see what amounts they contained—the bank pass book should tally with the cash book, but it does not—I entered the amounts in a private book of my own—I have not got that book here—I did not always ask you for the pass book when you returned, to compare it with my own—I was very careless about it, and that was the cause of your robbing us—you used to deliver the pass book to me when the shop was full of cus<lb/>tomers—I used not, when you said that the pass book was at the bank, to say that I was very glad of it; not even when my uncle (my father's brother) wished to examine the accounts, but he was always grumbling at the amount of petty cash which was paid out—I frequently borrowed money from the till, and put tickets in for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you let it run over several days? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays—money would have to be taken to the bank on Thursdays, and any amount I had exchanged was made up of cash from the bowl, and the cheques put into the bowl—I cannot say whether any part of this 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered in the cash book consisted of cheques, but if it did, it was the prisoner's duty to put the cheques in the bowl, and draw money from the bowl to supply them—there was on each occasion three sums in hard money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you ever know me to steal anything? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I knew you to steal paper—the money sometimes went to the bank at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, we generally waited till there was money enough in the bowl to supply the tickets—this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced by the prisoner</hi>) is in my writing—I am aware that on Jan. 15th and 19th, a less sum went to the bank than appeared—I did not swear before the Magistrate that that was not the case, certainly not—(<hi rend="italic">The witness a deposition being read, stated</hi>: "I did not take any of the 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at least no large amount; the memo<lb/>randum produced is my writing")—I was so confused, but I acknowledge now that I took the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. stated in that paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the cash did not go to the bank at the time it was handed to me, you not having sufficient money in the till, or in your own pocket, did you not invariably request me to tell your mother that the cash had gone to the bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not remember having the cash in my desk two or three days at a time before it went to the bank—I have no papers of yours, you took them all, and some of mine into the bargain—I never told you that if Mr. Robert Kenneth asked me for the bank book to say that it was the bankers'—I did frequently express anxiety to you lest my uncle</p>

Mr. J. Kenneth; New Bond-street: Dear Sir. Long ere you receive this I shall be on my way to a distant land. Whatever my extraordinary conduct may have been, be charitable; you may rely on receiving every penny re<lb/>turned in a very short time, but I involved myself through the very errone<lb/>ous manner your business was carried on. I consequently risked some money to regain my position, but failed; now you know the consequence. A friend has promised to pay you at his earliest opportunity, until which I cannot but be a self-expatriated prisoner from my native land, and may fortune smile on you more highly than it has upon the poor miserable wretch, your late clerk. For your own interest, I beseech you not to make bad worse; for on the quiet you observe, you will be repaid the sooner, for if you shot other feelings there will be no inducement for my friend to procure my speedy return to home and happiness.

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old. In the month of Feb. last I lived with Mr. and Mrs. Somner, as their servant, at No. 18, Linton street, Islington—Mr. and Mrs. Somner, and myself, lived in the house, no one else—I used to sleep in the front kitchen—I recollect on a Saturday night in Feb. my mistress going out—I do not recollect what date it was—it was about 10 o'clock when she went out—I was in the back kitchen when she went out—she said that she was going to Murray-street, and she would not</p>

I am dying"—then the candle was put out, and mistress walked about the front kitchen, and she said, "You b——I will kill you! you b——, I will kill you! I will teach you telling any more lies about me: you are a liar, and you are a thief"—at that time the child was making a groaning noise in the cellar—the groaning noise was be<lb/>fore what my mistress said, whilst she was saying it—my mistress then came to the match box by my bedside, and lighted a candle, and she then went into the cellar again—I did not hear any noise from the child at the time my mistress went into the cellar a second time, nor afterwards—she did not remain very long in the cellar at that time—I saw her come out of the cellar, and she said, "There, you b——, you must be dead now, you must be dead now"—she then took the candle, and buttoned the cellar door up, and came into the kitchen—she shut the kitchen door leading into the area, and then took the candle into the back kitchen—she then came and drew the front kitchen blind down—that was the same blind that she had drawn down before—she drew it down when she came down the first time—she drew it up again before she came to me, when she took the candle into the back kitchen—when she pulled it down again she came and tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Rachel"—I did not answer, and she called again, "Rachel"—I turned round as if I was in a fright, and she asked me if I had been out before the master went out, to get some soap and things—I said, "Yes, ma'am"—I had been directed that evening to go out for some soap and other things—mistress said she had been down to the cupboard two or three times to get some soap to take into her bedroom—the cupboard where the soap was kept is in the front kitchen—mistress said she had been out to her greengrocer's to get change for half a crown, to pay me my money on Sunday morning, and she asked me if there was any hot water in the boiler—I said, "Yes"—she said she wanted to wash her hands—she said, "I owe you 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and it is 11 o'clock, and I am going to bed"—that was 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. she had borrowed of my wages—she then went into the back kitchen, and I heard her washing something there—she was there washing for about half an hour—she then went up stairs into the parlour, and remained there some time, walking about—afterwards she went up stairs to the bedroom—I heard my master, Mr. Somner, come home that night—I heard him say that it was 1 o'clock—that was when he came in—that was a long time after my mistress had gone up to her bedroom—he said it to mistress—he had been out from about 8 o'clock in the evening—I got up from my bed at 8 o'clock next morning—I remained in bed until that time—about half past 8 o'clock my mistress came into the kitchen—I had not got the fire lighted, and she told me I ought to have got the firt lighted before then—I was later than usual on a Sunday morning—I I was later than usual that morning—there was some beer kept in the area, close to the cellar door, between the kitchen door and the cellar door—my mistress fetched her beer from that place at dinner time, but not in the morning—she usually did so—she fetched it at dinner time—that was at 12 o'clock—in the course of the Sunday morning I went to the cellar door near the kitchen door—I was going for coals—in order to get the coals I had to pass the cellar where my mistress had been the night before with the little girl—as I went for the coals I looked into that cellar—I took a candle—it was about a quarter to 9 o'clock in the morning—I had</p>

I did not do it; I know nothing of it;" and then she said, "I heard a noise outside the area railings last night, but I not tell you, dear" (addressing her husband), "as I thought it would make you timid"—the husband was standing close to us—I then took her into custody, and took her in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> to the station, and the husband as well—the husband was afterwards taken before the Magistrate, and discharged—directly after I had conveyed them to the station, I went back to the house with the surgeon—I made a search up stairs, in the bedroom, and under the bed I found a black gown—I noticed upon it some blood, apparently as if it had been partially washed, still there were evident spots of blood—this is the dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I noticed some bloody finger marks on the cellar door, and also on the door leading into the kitchen—I examined the bed in which the servant slept, and saw one or two small spots of blood on the upper part of the sheet, the part that turns over—this lucifer box, with bloody finger marks upon it, was handed to me by the surgeon.</p>

I knew the deceased child, brought her up—she was born in my house, and in my presence—the pri<lb/>soner is her mother—I brought her up from her birth, and always had charge of her up to 7th Feb.—her mother then took her from my house—she had written me a letter—when she took her away, she said she was taking her away to place her with her sister, in Murray-street—she said that to me by word of mouth—the child was called by the name of Celestina Christmas, her age was ten and a half years, as near as I can say—her mother paid me for her support—I had different payments—she paid me half a crown a week latterly—she has sometimes paid me as much as 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I have never received anything from any one else for the support of the child—I know nothing of the father.</p>

On Monday, 10th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock, I saw Abbott in the Queen's-road—Edmondson came up soon after, and Ventham was on the other side of the road—Abbott had sent for me, and he asked me to buy a pawn ticket—I did buy it, and gave him sixpence for it—he then asked me where Mr. West lived—Edmondson came up soon after that, he asked me if there were any bells in the house, I told him I did not know—Edmondson came up at the time Abbott was asking me about the bells—he was near enough to hear what was said—Ventham was across the road, not near enough to hear what was passing—they said nothing more—oh! yes they said they would go there—they did not say when or what for—they said they would go to Mr. West's—I swear they did not say what for—they then left me, and went towards Chelsea College—on the Wednesday I heard that the robbery was committed, and I told the constable what they had said to me—on the Friday night I went to their lodging where they slept, in Orchard-street, Westminster—I went by myself—Abbott and Edmondson lodged there—I saw both of them in the morning and the same night—it was between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning that I saw them—they told me they had done the robbery—they told me they got in the back way; and Abbott showed me the pawn tickets—he told me they had pawned the things for 6£. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and they wished they had not done it—they both spoke—they asked if I would buy the tickets, or if I could tell them who would buy them—I said it was not safe to have anything to do with them—I then left them, and went and met the constable, 339, and I told him that Edmondson had a knife, which he took from him.</p>

On Monday, 17th March, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 10<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Holywell-street, Westminster—I went to the up stairs back room; the door was fastened—I tried to open it, but could not—I waited there for some few minutes, and then the door was opened by Ventham—I went in and found the room fall of smoke—I said to Ventham, "What is the cause of all this smoke?"—he said, "I have just been smoking a pipe," drawing my attention to a pipe that was on the window ledge—I picked up the pipe, and found it was quite cold—I handed it to the landlady of the house, and likewise to the con<lb/>stable—the smoke proceeded from a chamber pot that was standing in the middle of the room—I did not examine it then—I told Ventham I should take him into custody on a charge of breaking into a house in Manor-street, Chelsea—he replied, "I know nothing at all about it; I have been at work at Kingston for the last three weeks, for a man in Earl's-court"—I then com<lb/>menced searching the room, and underneath the bedstead I found Abbott secreted up in the corner—I got him out, and told him he was charged with being concerned with Ventham in breaking and entering the house in Manor-street, Chelsea—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I asked him what he was doing underneath there—he said, "I got underneath then because I did not want the landlord or landlady of the house to see me, or to know I was here"—I then took them to the station—I locked the room door—as we went along, I told them that Edmondson was in custody—they said they knew nothing at all about him—after taking them to the station, I went back to the room, and from the chamber pot I took these pieces of a duplicate, there being a quantity of other pieces also in it, but they were all burnt up into small pieces—I found the remains—I ascertained that they were the remains of pawn tickets, by applying to a pawnbroker—these pieces are dry now, but the chamber pot was half full of urine at that time—on examining underneath the bed where Abbott's head was, as he lay there in a stooping position, I found the remnants of some paper appa<lb/>rently burnt, with a lucifer lying on the floor, and the floor was much burnt—I produce those remnants—no property was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass dealer, and live at No. 7, Bedfordbury, which runs from New-street, Covent-garden, into Chandos-street I have known Brown for a long time—on 15th March, I sent a horse and cart to Aldridge's Repository for sale by my boy—I followed, and when I got there saw Brown; and my boy in the cart—about a quarter of an hour after<lb/>wards I saw Ayres—he and another man got into the cart with my boy and drove up Long Acre—I asked Brown what sort of men they were that were getting into the cart, and he said that it was all right, that was for the pur<lb/>pose of trying it—when they came back they all three went together, and I went to my boy and told him to bring the horse and cart home—I went home with the boy, and we put the horse and cart in the stable—the three prisoners and two or three other men came to me at the stable—Brown called me down the yard, and said in the presence of Ayres and Adams, "That is the master of the horse"—Ayres asked me the price—I told him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and they all went away together—in three quarters of an hour Brown came to me with the address, on a paper, of Mr. Henry Goodall, 19, Henry-street, Hampstead-road, who he said would purchase the hone, if I would go there with him—Brown and my boy went with me in the cart, and at the corner of Henry-street Brown advised me to get out of the cart, at it would be much preferable to let the gentleman see it with only two persons in the cart; and if he approved of the horse he would call me from the corner of Henry-street—I got out and stood at the corner three quarters of an hour—Ayres and another man and my boy came back with the cart and the harness—I asked my boy what had become of the horse—he said that it was sold—I asked him who sold it—he said that he did not know, and then Ayres said that he had sold the horse for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and produced a receipt—I asked him why the gentleman who bought the horse did not retain the receipt—he said that he forgot to give it to him, and then he advised me to go back to Camden-town to see if I could find Brown—I went to the end of Morn<lb/>ington-crescent, and he showed me the public house where he left Brown—I looked into three departments of the public house, but could not find him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185604070070"/>
               <p>—I then returned home with the cart and harness—on the Saturday I went to Bow-street—on the Sunday I went to a coffee shop in York-street, Westminster, by the direction of the police, and Brown came in, and was talking to the landlord, and two constables came in and took him outside—he wanted to know what he was charged with—I said, "I charge you with stealing my horse"—he was taken to the station—I asked him what he had done with the horse—he said that he had changed it, and then he said that he had sold it, spent part of the money, and lost the remainder—when Ayres came back with the cart and harness he claimed half a sovereign, and said that he would call at my place on Sunday morning for it—he said nothing about having bought the horse for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in partnership with Adams.</p>

I did not authorise you or Brown to sell it"—I had intended to sell it right out when I went to Aldridge's, not to exchange it—if the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been brought to me instead of the receipt I should not have said that it was perfectly right—I did not say that I ex<lb/>pected the horse would be sold when I sent him to Mr. Goodall.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the Directors of the City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company. The prisoner was our secretary in 1854 and 1855—he has acted so, I think, seven years—he had a salary of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and a house; also a commission of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent. on the gross receipts—he received burial fees and monies due to the Company, and kept the books—it was part of his duty to enter in the books the monies received and paid by him during 1854 and 1855—the Directors used, I think, to meet fortnightly; that is, the second Thursday in the month and the last—on those occasions it was the prisoner's duty to attend and lay the accounts before the Directors—the fortnightly account showed the monies received; the monies expended were cheques drawn by the Directors—the prisoner had to pay a commission to undertakers—it was his duty twice in the year to make up the half yearly accounts—he made up the half yearly balance sheet to the 30th June last, for the meeting in July—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—among the assets here appears due to the Company 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner was afterwards requested to make out the items of which that 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consisted—this is the account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, is here debited to the amount of 156<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that account was made out before the half yearly meeting in July—it was put into my hands in July—after that account was given, the Board came to this resolution—the prisoner took the minutes—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Wednesday, 30th July. Resolved, from henceforth, the parochial accounts be made out within a week from the termination of each quarter")—on that occasion we received this letter in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "City of London and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Company, 30th Aug., 1855. Gentlemen,—It is with feelings of the deepest grief that I shall be compelled to make disclosures of a most painful nature; I have done my utmost to avert the necessity of so doing, but it is impossible. For the sake of my dear family, I pray God that you will condemn me with mercy. Yours, &amp;c., W. S. Dowding.")—after that letter had been read by the Directors, the prisoner was called into the room where we were sitting, and made a verbal communication to the Board—he stated that he had received monies, and after receiving the cheques on account of these parish accounts, had lost them, by going to town to take them to the bankers, and, consequently, they were not entered in the accounts, and that they might amount altogether to between 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the keys</p>

               <p>Were then given up to the Directors, and an examination was made of the cash book and ledger, which had been kept by him—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cash book of 1854, and here are the minutes in this book of the meeting of 30th Nov., 1854—at that meeting the prisoner accounted for all monies he had received during the previous month, from 29th Oct to 26th Nov., inclusive—here is no account from the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster—the total amount of receipts for which he gives credit here for that month is 515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—here are the different items of hich that credit is made up—they were ready payments made at the time—at the next meeting; 28th Dec., here is no credit given for a sum of 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster—the amount of his receipts is 506<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is made up principally of ready money sums, but here is an item of 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from St. Margaret's, Westminster, on 28th Nov.—this account of 22nd Feb., 1855, includes a period of a fortnight—it does not include 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account of St. Margaret's, Westminster; the amount is 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is made up of other items—in the following fortnight, or month, here is no entry of 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from St. Margaret's, Westminster—I have seen certain receipts which purport to be the prisoner's writing—this receipt for 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his, and also this other for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for St. Margaret's, Westminster.</p>

Hankey's at once, without delay—I have not ascertained that it has been paid in—I cannot tell you when this cheque was paid in, nor the cheque of 16th Feb.—when he said that he had lost cheques, he did not specify any cheques—he did not refer to these two cheques—we understood that he referred to the losses he had had—I am not aware that he had to drink with undertakers—undertakers are our customers—it was not his duty to canvass them to procure custom, but he got a per centage—the more dead bodies he got, the more per centage he had—he had been well recommended to us, and has borne a highly respectable character—he was rather neglectful, but we had no idea of his dishonesty—he gave security, 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant and patentee of sewing machines; I am also the patentee of a gas regulating machine; I carry on my business at No. 98, Fleet-street, and have also a warehouse at Manches<lb/>ter. About Feb., 1854, the prisoner came into my service—he left At the end of July, or the 1st of Aug.—his duty ordinarily was to act as book keeper—about the end of July, 1854, there was an exhibition, or fair, of some description, at Plymouth—I sent one of my sewing machines to that exhibition by the prisoner—I instructed him to sell it if he could, and to take orders for others—he was to stay there one week—I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his expenses—he returned from Plymouth about 20th July, but I cannot say within a few days—I was in Manchester at the time—a Mr. Dresser</p>

               <p>lane, to Mr. Dresser, and took premises at No. 23, Cannon-street West we were not both carrying on the same business there at the same time—I have sold him machines, and I may have borrowed some back from him, if I was out of them; if I did I always paid for them, or returned them in kind—there have been a good many monetary transactions between me and Mr. Dresser at different times, all the way through, he owed me money at the time I received this bill, and so he has a great deal of the time since he has been in this country—I never pressed him for payment—he has accepted bills for me, not for my accommodation, but to cover the amount he owed me, in payment for the machines—I do not recollect that I was receiving bills with his acceptance about this time, I might and I might not—my circumstances were not very flourishing at that time; they were not bad—I have had the misfortune to become bankrupt about twelve months after the prisoner left me; I wonder I had not sooner—I discharged him for improper conduct, I swear that—there was no difference between us, or any ill feeling that I was aware of when I discharged him—I talked to him as I would to a brother, I was sorry he had kept bad company, and hoped he would try to redeem himself—there was no lady in the case that I know of—I do not know that he ever alluded to a lady to me, except on one or two evenings, when he asked me to let him go earlier, as he wanted to take his wife to the Panopticon, or some place of amusement, which I always allowed him to do—there was never any quarrel between us as to that matter, I swear that—I never spoke to his wife twice before he left me—I have been connected a good deal with bills of exchange—I do not know that I have discounted bills for other parties—I know Mr. Chandler—I never took bills from him to get discounted—<lb/>my bankers hold his dis<lb/>honoured bilk for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were bills given to me to get discounted by Mr. Paul, he wanted me to take them to my bank, to see if they would discount them, and gave very respectable reference to Mr. Chandler, de<lb/>scribing him as a merchant in a large way of business, and a very respectable man—to oblige him I said I would take the reference and forward the bills to the bank, and if they were willing to do them upon the reference, I would get them done—I sent them to my bankers aft Manchester, bat before I had any reply, Mr. Paul wanted to purchase thirty sewing machines from me; I agreed if he took the thirty, fee should have them at 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each; he had then made an arrangement with Mr. Dresser, to carry on business as A. P. Dresser and Co.—Mr. Chandler was to be partner with them, and was to furnish some money, so Mr. Paul said, and those bills then went as a set<lb/>off for ten machines that were then delivered, and that was all the payment I had for the machines—I afterwards delivered machines to that firm to a large amount, and I believe there is a large balance due besides those bills that lie dishonoured—the bills are indorsed by Mr. Paul—I know that the machines were traced into the possession of Mr. Chandler after Dresser and Co. gave up business at Broad-street-buildings—I do not know who finally had the proceeds of them or anything about them—since the prisoner's com<lb/>mittal, his wife has called upon me—I have not since the committal made an offer to retire from the prosecution, if the prisoner could pay me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I swear that, not at any time—I did not know where the prisoner was, until I gave him in charge; but I frequently heard that he was in France—Mr. Dresser informed me that he had met him in the street two, three, or four weeks before—he did not tell me that he had given him his address—I asked him if he thought he could find out where he was, and I have been on the look out for him since, I had no reason to doubt that he was in Paris at</p>

I left my warehouse about that time, leaving there a quantity of velvets and black silks—I returned at 2 o'clock, after being absent half an hour—I found thirty-two pieces of velvet gone, and tea pieces of silk, three pieces of which had been sold, and were wrapped up in paper, and left on the counter—they were perfectly safe when I left—when I came back I had some difficulty in opening my door—there were no marks of violence—I lost upwards of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property—I have not recovered any portion of it—the premises are in the liberty of Norton Folgate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames police inspector</hi>). On 22nd Feb., about 1 o'clock in the morning, I was in a police galley on the river Thames, and while off Horselydown saw a boat, in which Matthews, Massey, and Coving<lb/>ton ware—I saw them go ashore at George's-stairs, Horsleydown, and Massey carried a potato sack on his back, a three or four bushel sack—Massey lifted the bag on to Covington's back—I then rowed ashore, and followed all three into No. 1, Queen-street, Horselydown—Matthews was behind, and I asked him what those bags contained—he said they contained guano, "and if you go to Mr. Pillow you will find it is all right"—I then knocked at Bailey's door—Mrs. Bailey came, and I asked her if Mr. Bailey was in—she said that he was not—I did not see the bags in the house—I had seen two go in—after I spoke to Massey, Covington came up and spoke to him, and they all went away—I went away, and returned in about three quarters of an hour, knocked at the door, and Bailey came—I said "I want to speak to you, Bailey; you have got two bags of guano"—he said, "They are in the yard"—I said, "Will you let me look at the bags?"—he said, "I do not know whether it will be right; they are sweepings of three barges"—I said, "Can you tell me the barges'names?"—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "Can you tell me the veasel's names that they have gone away in?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Can you tell me who are the consignees for the guano?"—he hesitated and said, "Antony Gibbs I should not like you to go there, because it would give unnecessary trouble"—I left a constable to watch the premises, and proceeded to Antony Gibbs—I then went to Pillow's office, and found Bailey there (I had been there before)—I told him that I had been to Antony Gibbs—he said, "I think you have gone a very wrong way to work about it"—I then left Bailey and proceeded back again in half an hour to Pillow's office, and found Bailey there a second time—I told him that he must consider himself in custody on suspicion of stealing and concealing a quantity of guano—I then said to Pillow, "Where is your <hi rend="italic">prentice</hi>?" meaning Matthews—Bailey said that he was on Fenning's wharf—I walked down with Bailey and saw the apprentice in a barge alongside Fenning's-wharf—I followed him ashore, and told him he must consider himself in my custody on suspicion of stealing a quantity of guano—he said nothing—I took him into custody, and afterwards took him to Bailey's house—I rowed him down in the galley to George's-stairs with Bailey—I left Matthews in the police galley in charge of a constable, and I and Bailey walked up to Bailey's house—Bailey knocked at the door, and he and I and the constable who I had left in charge of the premises, went into his house, and he said, "There are the two bags," pointing to two bags out of the kitchen window—I said, "Have you got any more guano?"—he made noreply—I looked through a broken window of the washhouse and saw five bags uncovered, which held about two bushels, or two and a half—I said to</p>

               <p>Bailey, "You have got some more guano; how do you account for these?"—he said, "They are sweepings of six or seven months' accumulation, and they are my perquisites"—I said, "I shall have to take those as well as the others"—he said, "I do not think you are justified in doing so"—I then conveyed Matthews and Bailey to the station, and left a constable in charge of the house—I came back and found twenty-six bags in the wash-house and two tubs, containing together about one and a half cwt.—twenty-one of the bags were covered with a tarpaulin—the gross weight of all I found is twenty-eight cwt, or it may be a little more—I afterwards took Coving<lb/>ton into custody—he said that he had only done as his foreman had told him, and he thought he was a very foolish man to have anything to do with the guano—Massey came to the station on the morning of the 23rd, and I took him—an analyzing chemist has samples of the guano.</p>

I am a clerk in the employ of Antony Gibbs and Co., they are agents to the Peruvian Government, and are the sole importers of guano—it comes over in bulk, and goes to the West India Docks, and is packed in bags—it is then ready to be sent out to the various persons who pur<lb/>chase it—it is delivered to the West India Dock Company for Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">stated that a bag had been sent for</hi>). I have not got any samples of the guano—it is supposed to come from an island off the coast of Peru—I cannot say how much of what is called guano, that is to say, the excrement of a bird, coming from an island in the neighbourhood of Peru, gets to the docks—we only trace it from the loading—we take it from time to time and then discharge it—I should say 20,000 tons a month are landed in the docks—it all comes to us—there are no private dealers except the Peruvian Government—I value the 30 cwt. found at 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deducting 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton for dirt.</p>

               <p>—it is on the south side of the export dock—I know instances of my own knowledge where the men have constantly brought the sweepings, and merely claimed the price of the sweepings—I have not known that done by Pillow—he was in Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman in an extensive way of business I employ a great many men, and have a great many barges—the prisoners were in my employ in Feb. last, and have been employed to take guano from the docks ever since the commencement of our engagement with Messrs. Gibbs about four years ago—they had no authority to my knowledge to take away any sweepings left in the barges—we were always glad to get rid of it, because it was very much in our way—if there were any sweepings left we were glad to get them overboard or anywhere else; we could not load rice, sugar, or other goods of that description in barges, which had just contained guano, we were glad to get rid of it and wash out the barges—the only way I know in which we got rid of sweepings was throwing them over<lb/>board—we have had sweepings brought ashore when there was a larger quantity than usual, we have waterside premises, and it has been put there, and there it is now—there may be half a ton or more of it, we have never taken any account of it, we have simply put it ashore to get it out of the way—it has been accumulating three or four years—I have not examined it—I think I know pretty well what guano is, the half ton is principally guano, and not dirt—our barges are kept very clean, and the escape through the bags would be genuine guano—the escape is, a bag bursting, or if it is thrown down the dust will come out and surround you in a moment—if there is a break in the bag by accident or design the dust will come out too—if there is a break, it is the lighterman's duty to make the bag as perfect as he can, and put it in again—if there was such a quantity out that he could not get it into the beg, it would be his duty to take care of it, and if there was an oppor<lb/>tunity of putting it ashore at the docks, to do so; but I do not know that it was ever done—we never had any instructions—as a respectable lighterman, I should not sanction my man appropriating it to his own use.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever given any general order, that in no ease were the men to apply to their own use anything that accidentally came out of the bags? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did not allow that they should appropriate any sweepings to themselves—if there was any amount we should expect it to be returned to us—sweepings, when barges are cleaned out, would be very naturally thrown overboard—we should not allow them to put it into something for their own use—we never gave instructions to our apprentices or the others, that if there was anything that they felt rather disposed to put into a bag than to throw overboard, that it would be stealing; it did not come into our minds to do so—we never gave any particular instructions about guano sweepings, we always considered it much in our way, and were glad to get rid of it; but there would be an objection if it went away by their putting it into bags for themselves; we should not tolerate such a thing; but we did not suspect that such practices were carried on—I have never heard the question raised—I have never heard Mr. Rueker's protestation against it, not to us, and never heard the question raised at the Thames Police Office, on all these points; never before this time—I have been four years in Messrs. Gibbs' employ, and do the whole of the lightering for that firm—they of course sell to other parties, who may have their own lightermen, but for their account we have the sole business in our hands; we have all the guano orders that they have to execute for parties on their own account—no other guano comes up into the river that I know of than Messrs. Gibbs, nor I think to Liverpool or other places; they are the sole parties—I believe there is none besides that brought by the Peruvian Government—there is a spurious article manufac<lb/>tured, which passes off for guano—there used to be another quality besides Peruvian, but I have not heard of any lately; it came from Macapoo; it is a very inferior article.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Richard Cobden beershop, at Barking. The prisoner came to lodge in my house three weeks before 1st Sept., 1855—he gave his name as George Coleman—on the night of 1st Sept. the prisoner was in my house—he did not go to bed—he went into the bedroom, as if intending to go to bed—he followed me up stairs to his bedroom, and bid me good night—a man named Gosling found the door open, and called me down, between 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning—that was the back door, leading to the back yard—I had fastened that door myself, on the previous night, with two bolts, one at the top, the other at the bottom—I missed a watch from the bar, after I had been down ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; and I missed another watch from the bedroom, up stairs, where I had been sleeping—it was my wife's father's watch—I might have seen it a week or a fortnight before—there was a gold ring missing, which I had seen a fortnight or three weeks before, in the looking glass drawer, in my bed-room—I also missed a shawl—there was another lodger in the house besides the prisoner—he was in a room adjoining my bedroom—that man was ill—I had heard that man in his bedroom during the night—the prisoner was gone when I came down in the morning—he did not return before I fetched him away from Woolwich, on 6th March—there was a pair of trowsers taken away, and a waistcoat—these are them—they are my property.</p>

Some years ago I was employed on board the <hi rend="italic">Magnet</hi> steamer—I know the prisoner, I have seen him frequently at Boulogne—I did not hear of this robbery at the time it took place—the prisoner used to be frequently on board our vessel, and he said to me one day, "You are going to have a fine voyage this evening"—I said, "It appears so; come with us"—he said, "I should like it very much, but the man is not dead"—this was in the autumn of the first year he went to Boulogne, either 1840 or 1841—I heard of the robbery on the voyage after—I did not speak to the prisoner about it at any time—I did not like to say anything more about it.</p>

I was one of the officers who went to this house on 15th March, about 12 o'clock in the day—I and Evans were the two who went first up stairs—I went up to the top room on the second floor—as I went up, Jackson, Brown, and another man came out of the room and passed me—they rushed down stairs—I called out, "Stop them"—I went into the room, and on entering I saw Green, Kitchen, and Witton—Green and Kitchen were stamping on the plaster of Paris moulds and Witton was coming towards the door, holding something in her dress—I seized Green and Witton, and pushed them on the bed—I took charge of Green, and called Evans to take charge of Witton—I put my hand in Wit<lb/>ton's dress and took out sixteen half crowns, thirty-two shillings, and six<lb/>teen sixpences—they are all here—I searched Green in the room, and found in his left hand pocket two half crowns and three sixpences, good money, and in his right hand pocket I found this purse, containing one good half crown, three good shillings, and four good sixpences, which I believe had been used for making moulds, by the glossy appearance of them.</p>

I was on duty in Waterloo-road, at nearly 1 o'clock, on the Sunday morning—in consequence of Mrs. Miller's communicating something to me, I went to the top of Granby-street, which runs into the Waterloo-road—I found the prosecutor lying senseless on a stretcher, and four constables with him—I do not remember seeing Robert Collins, the railway policeman, there—in consequence of other information, I went to No. 73, Granby-street—I there found Hedges in bed—I told him he must get up, and go with me to the station, respecting a man who had been ill used in the street—I said, "You must go to the station, till the man comes to his senses, to see if he can identify you"—Rose had followed after me into the room, and, when I made that statement, she said, "He does not know anything about it"—she said that the man had given her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I took Hedges to the station, the prosecutor was not sensible—it was after 2 o'clock before he came to his senses—when he did, I intro<lb/>duced Hedges to him, and he identified him, very shortly after he raised himself up, but he was some time before he came to himself—Rose was brought in afterwards by another officer, and the prosecutor identified her.</p>

Between 12 and 1 o'clock on that Saturday night, I heard cries of "Police!" in Granby-street—I saw the prisoner challenging the prosecutor to fight—I went out of the gate to see what it was, and saw the prisoner challenging the prosecutor—I believe the prosecutor struck the prisoner first, and with that the prisoner knocked him down—I saw that distinctly—the prisoner attempted to lift him up, and a bystander said, "Don't ill use the man any more, you have done quite enough to him"—the prisoner said, "As often as you get up, I will knock you down"—the man appeared in quite a senseless state—I sent a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man for the police—Hedges said to the prosecutor, "You have got as much as you can put up with for half an hour"—the police afterwards arrived, and the prosecutor was taken on a stretcher to the station—I was called there between 2 and 3 o'clock, and I could identify the man—I heard the prisoner say, "If you have a mind for anything, come on: what were you doing in that house? what were you doing with that girl?"—it was then the prosecutor struck the prisoner in the face, and then the prisoner knocked him down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the grain manager, at the Bricklayers' Arms sta<lb/>tion, of the South Eastern Railway. There is a warehouse there, appro<lb/>priated to the grain sent up by our railway, where it remains until the consignees send for it—I have an office in that warehouse—the grain be<lb/>longing to the different persons is deposited separately from each other—some beans were deposited in bin No. 18, belonging to Mr. Turner; they had been sent up by another party, and were purchased by Mr. Turner on the market—on Monday afternoon, 31st March, three empty sacks were placed near my office on two sacks of seed—one was quite a new sack, and the others nearly new—they were folded up—they were in a different part of the warehouse from where the beans wore—the prisoner came that afternoon with two other persona, and three carts for the beans—they drew up to the landing place where they are loaded—these sacks were three or four yards round a projecting corner; the prisoner could not have seen them without leaving his cart and going to a different part of the warehouse—I missed two of those sacks some quarter of an hour after I had seen them safe, and before the prisoner and the others had left the premises—I had occasion to send them to Dartford, and directed a porter to go and fetch them—upon finding they were gone, I went and spoke to Lovell, the officer on duty at the entrance to the station, and whilst I was with him the prisoner and the carts came up to go out of the station—I told the prisoner that I had lost two lacks, and I had suspicion that they were in the carts—he denied it—he said he only had his own sacks—I believe he said that twice—£instructed Lovell and one of my foremen to get on the top of the carts, and see if they could find them; but as they could not see them, the cans were taken back to the warehouse to be unloaded—the prisoner's cart was unloaded first—it was loaded with beans—after taking off three, four, or five sacks, I found one of the missing sacks placed in between two of the bean sacks at the side of the cart, so that they could not possibly be seen without unloading the cart—I think there were also one or two old sacks at the tail of the cart—this is the sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is not the new one—I have no doubt it is one of those I missed, from the appearance of it—it is not at all like the other sacks which he had in his cart, they were old, and</p>

               <p>much used and branded—we then proceeded to examine the second cart—I found nothing in that—on the top of the third cart was a fodder bag, with horses' food in it—I examined that, and in it found the new sack, tied up—that cart was in charge of one of the prisoner's compa<lb/>nions named Palmer—upon finding the first sack, I asked the prisoner how it came there—he said he did not know, it must hare been thrown up with the other sacks—I asked how the second sack came in the fodder bag, and they all denied knowing anything about it—the prisoner said he knew nothing of it, he did not know how it came there—I was then about to give the prisoner and Palmer into custody, and after some little demur, the prisoner said he had taken up the sack, and seeing it was a clean one, he had put it into the sack with the fodder, thinking it was his own—I then let Palmer go, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>
