She had not been long gone down before she called Ma'am, ma'am, here is a woman in the kitchen! I went down and saw the prisoner with a loaf under her arm; I lifted up her hat to see if I knew her.

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Elwell. I was down in the kitchen; my mistress called me up and sent me for some vinegar; I went for the vinegar. I found the door open and I left it open. The door generally stands open at that hour of the day; it was between two and three o'clock. When I came back I left the vinegar in the parlour and took the meat down stairs; when I came down into the kitchen I saw somebody lying down; I asked who the devil was there to frighten me!</p>
               <p>Who was the person that was lying down? - The prisoner. I went round the great table which stood in the middle of the kitchen, and said, you may get up now you won't frighten me; she crawled up; I asked her what she had got; she had a loaf in her apron, and the linen was rolled up under her, she had taken it off the table.</p>
               <p>What linen was it? - Five pair of sheets and three tablecloths.</p>
               <p>Did you leave the linen on the table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it did not fall off the table? - Yes: it is a large ironing table; I had set it in the middle of the kitchen. Seeing the linen on the ground, I asked her what that linen was; she said she had nothing but her own loaf.</p>
               <p>The linen was not in her apron? - No, it was on the ground; when she got up I saw the linen; I went round the table to meet her at the door, and asked her what she wanted; she said a pint of purl, and if she could not get it there, she desired I would let her go where she could get it; I said she should not go till my master or mistress came down stairs; I called out to my mistress who came down and lifted up her hat and looked at her; the prisoner told her she wanted a pint of purl; we asked her if that looked like a public-house; she said she did not know.</p>
               <p>What part of the table were they lying upon? - Upon the middle of the table.</p>

               <p>Jones. She did not seem much in liquor; she said we were in liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you make any noise when you went down? - No,</p>
               <p>Was she asleep? - No, I had not been out of the kitchen long enough.</p>
               <p>She was not lying in a place concealed was she? - She was between the table and dresser; it was dark in that part of the kitchen.</p>

On Tuesday the 28th of December we went to bed about twelve o'clock having been at the Opera that night, otherwise we generally go to bed about eleven. It is my method to take a servant with me round the house to see if every thing is safe. I went that night particularly into the study, which has some windows toward the garden, and one door only which opens into the house; that study lies remote from the other part of the house. I saw the windows fast; I locked the door myself. The servant that warms my bed brings me up the keys at night; and she comes up in the morning for them to distribute to the rest of the servants. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning, and went down into the study; I found the sash thrown up and the window shutters broke; there was a writing table in the room belonging to Mrs. Bentham, which was broke open; there were two book-cases in the room, one opposite the chimney, the other opposite the window which looks into the garden; that opposite the chimney had mahogany doors, they were broke open. In the other bookcase opposite the window is a drawer, in which I generally put my money. I had the day before received of a tenant some bills and fourteen guineas, which I put in that drawer. The fourteen guineas were taken out of the drawer. The glass doors of that book-case were broke open. I do not know any thing of the spoons.</p>
               <p>Were there not other valuable things in the study? - Yes, silver candlesticks and a tea chest with silver cannisters; they were not taken away. The prisoner lived servant with me six years and an half, and behaved exceedingly well, till the latter part of the time, when he got connected with an infamous woman; I recommended to him to leave her, and go out of the kingdom, or she would be the ruin of him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. BENTHAM sworn.</p>
               <p>There was a writing table in the study which was broke open this night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was any thing lost out of that writing table? - Yes, two silver spoons; one was broke, the other nearly broke.</p>
               <p>How long had they been in that writing-table? - A considerable time. During the time this man lived servant with me they were broke; he brought them to me, and I put them into this writing-table.</p>
               <p>Court. When had you seen them there before you missed them? - I cannot positively say, very near the time I missed them.</p>

               <p>I write for Mr. Bentham, and live next door to him. I was present when the prisoner was apprehended at the Black Horse in Petty France, Westminster, where he lodged. On Wednesday the 29th of December, between the hours of ten and eleven in the morning; I searched him in the back room, and took out of his pocket three silver teaspoons, and about thirteen shillings and sixpence, in silver, two of the tea-spoons were marked J. B. the other A. B. the constable has them in his possession. While we were searching him, when we took the money out of his pocket, he said he would swear a robbery against us for taking the money from him. At first when I saw only the thirteen and sixpence, I thought him innocent, but when I saw the tea-spoons it gave me great reason to suspect he was the person who committed the robbery; upon searching him farther we found a pocket-book upon him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120005"/>We took him to Mr. Bentham's and examined the pocket-book, and found in it eleven guineas sealed up and four pawnbroker's duplicates.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner; I searched him and found three teaspoons in his breeches pocket. I first took thirteen shillings and sixpence out of one breeches pocket, and then the tea-spoons out of the other. He shuffled about and wanted to put his hand to his coat pocket; I bid him keep his hands before him. I searched his coat pocket and found a pocket-book. We brought him to Mr. Bentham's, where we opened the pocket-book, and found eleven guineas sealed up, and four duplicates.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the money taken out in the presence of the prisoner? - It was.</p>
               <p>Do you remember, as you found only thirteen shillings and sixpence at the Black Horse, any question being put to him about it? - No. He said this is all the money me got, me swear a robbery against you if you take my money away. That was at the Black Horse.</p>

               <p>Dr. CHELSON sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was recommended to me as a servant by the prosecutor, in May last. He was in my service four months; he accompanied me abroad, and was three weeks in my service after I came home. I wish to be understood that I have the highest opinion of his honesty, diligence, and abstinence, as to eating and drinking. I allowed him board-wages; and I believe from the frugal manner in which he lived, he saved money. Between the 18th and 27th of December I had a conversation with him, and I advised him to get rid of his connexion with that woman, as I was persuaded he could not be safe with her; he said he was convinced of it, and should be glad to get on board a privateer. I understood that to arise not from any consciousness of his having done wrong, but merely to get rid of that connexion. When I was abroad, knowing the friendly design with which Mr. Bentham recommended him to me, which was that he might go out of the kingdom, I asked him if he wished to stay on that side of the water, or return to his own country; he said no, thank God, he had done nothing to be afraid to come to his own country, and he came with me to London, and was three weeks in my service after he came home. I beg to observe, that when I had that conversation with him after he came home, he appeared to be extremely lame, and was supported by a crutch.</p>
               <p>To Buckmaster. The prisoner's wife was with him, I believe, when you took him? - Yes, she was in the tap-room at the time.</p>

               <p>Dr. Chelson. On dismissing him on the 3d of October, I paid him the remainder of the account between us, amounting to fourteen guineas. I believe the whole I paid him during the four months he was in my service amounted to about thirty pounds.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 19th of December, about half after eight in the evening, we heard an uncommon noise.</p>
               <p>Do you live with Mrs. Crucius? - Yes. We presently found this noise was made by a maid servant coming up stairs. She came into the drawing-room where we were sitting; we could scarce understand any thing she said, but at last understood there were rogues in and about the house, and a man murdered in the yard. As soon as we could recollect ourselves, we opened one of the drawing-room windows and called for the watch; I got a watchman's rattle and rattled it out of the window; some of the neighbours came to our assistance; we proceeded then to search the house, but could not find any person in it. We missed a box which was usually kept in Mrs. Crucius's bed-room, this caused fresh alarm; somebody asked if we had any way out backwards; I said yes. In a short time after the box was found at the upper end of the garden. I immediately ran out and met some persons (I am not sure whether there was one or more persons) bringing it in; I followed them close back again to the house; I stopped at the bottom of the stairs to examine the box; I found the bottom was broke out; some parcels had been opened, most of them wet and tumbled about. I immediately missed a remarkable purse, in which there were some parcels of money kept.</p>

               <p>Who put them in it? - I did.</p>
               <p>What was the amount of the money? - Either 120 l. or 140 l. I cannot say which possitively, but on enquiry after the purse was found, we heard such a thing had been seen tossed about at the top of the garden. I examined the box again when I went up stairs, and missed a remarkable remnant of muslin and two snuff-boxes.</p>
               <p>That is all you know about it? - That I at present recollect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was sent that night to the apothecary's at Ludgate-hill. My mistress said she suspected a person she thought guilty of the fact.</p>
               <p>Did Mrs. Crucius mention any person she suspected to be guilty of this? - The person she said she suspected was the prisoner.</p>

             on the Tuesday afternoon; the prisoner was then questioned as to the fact; his account of it was that he had been out into the yard on the Sunday evening to a pantry, that returning from that pantry he saw a man coming from the back door of the house. He had lived with Mrs. Crucius as her servant about three months. That is the same account he had given to the family. He said likewise that he had a loaf under one arm, and a candle and lantern under the other; that he threw them down and went to seise the man, upon which the man knocked him down with a horse pistol, and when he was down, I think he said he struck him a second time, upon which he called out murder, thieves! And here I ought to add another circumstance that he called out murder, thieves! fasten your doors!</p>

               <p>Mr. Woollaston. That he was stunned, and the man got over the garden wall. Justice Adington asked him then what was lost, and whether he himself had lost any thing; he made answer that he had lost a suit of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120008"/>clothes of his own, and I think two shirts and a great coat. This was the whole of his account. Upon that the prisoner was ordered to be searched; they searched his pockets and found nothing. I should first of all have mentioned whereabouts these things were stolen from: the box which was missing was taken from under a bed in the one-pair-of-stairs back room, his clothes were taken from the garret; his great coat was taken from some of the rooms below stairs. I state this from the account I had from others; I was not in the house nor in town at the time. In the room from whence the box was taken, there were two chests of drawers, neither of those were opened at all. These circumstances I mention because they led me to think of going to Sir

               <p>Was there any promise made to him to induce him to confess? - I believe none at all; I was not in the other room; they returned presently and said he would confess; he came in and made a confession seemingly quite voluntarily. He said that he was perfectly alone, that nobody was with him; upon this Sir John asked him, where was the money, and where were the things; to which he replied, in the cabin, in his mistress's garden. That is a place where they usually clean knives. Sir John ordered him to be carried back that he might fetch them; upon Sir John's ordering him to be carried back by the constables, I proposed going with him left it should over-set Mrs. Crucius, who had been in a dying state; we went with him quite through the house to this place in the garden; the two constables went in; I stood at the door; I saw him stoop down, lift up a board of the floor, and there was a little hole, in which there was a little parcel wrapped up in a handkerchief; he handed this parcel to the constable; we went together into the kitchen, and opened the handkerchief; we found in it two snuff-boxes mounted with gold, and seven parcels of money; I think some of the parcels were in the snuff-boxes, but I will not be positive, I think there were two in one and three in the other; the others were separate. As we were going along, he told us there were three shillings missing out of the whole sum which he had taken out. We opened the parcels, three of the parcels contained nineteen guineas each and no shillings; three other parcels contained nineteen guineas and a shilling each; one parcel contained twenty shillings only. There was in the whole 120 l. 17 s. The other servants were in the kitchen. I said to the prisoner, where are the clothes you said were stolen? to which he replied, O that was nothing. I do not exactly recollect the words, I understood it, that that was only a pretence. We then went to Sir

The next day, as the key of the prisoner's box had been taken out of his pocket and delivered to Mr. Bond, as belonging to the family, I asked Sir John what was necessary to be done with his box; he had sent for some things out of it; I thought it was not proper to open it without directions, and I went with Prothero to search his box; the clothes, he pretended had been stolen, were found in the box, and some candles; and the great coat which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120009"/>he said was lost was found under his bed.</p>

My mistress said if I knew of any person who had done it she would not hurt them, but give them twenty pounds if they would restore the money.

               <p>What did you loose? - Fourteen guineas, which were in my trowsers pocket; there were six whole guineas and sixteen half guineas; they were in a leather purse. She kept a disorderly house. We went in there to get some girls; she and I were standing in the middle of the room; she was close to me; she asked me for two shillings for the bed; I gave her a half guinea to change; she went down stairs and then brought my change up; and put the remainder of the silver into my pocket.</p>

The prisoner took my money out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Did you see her do that? - When she took the purse I asked her what she was going to do with that; she said the girls were strangers to her, that they were clean, but she did not know for their honesty, and I had better let her have it till the morning; I told her I did not like such ways as that; she said she was landlady of the house, and her house and goods were good for that, and I should have it in the morning; I told her I did not like that, that I was capable of taking care of my money, and would have it myself; I offered to take it from her, and she went down stairs; I did not go down after her. In the morning when I came down to get my money she was gone from the house.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get any of your money again? - No, I never got a farthing of it. I went that morning and acquainted Justice Sherwood's men of it; they went along with me, and we found her and the man that she used to keep company with in the Borough, at one

             while you was there? did you see him pay for any thing? - He had paid for some liquor that we had had and we had some pork steaks for supper; we were to have a girl a-piece to go to bed with.</p>
               <p>Were you to pay for the bed? - Yes; two shillings a bed.</p>
               <p>Who demanded the money of you? - That girl (the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Did she demand any of Herring? - Yes, two shillings, which he paid; he wanted a guinea changed; she got change and gave him the change.</p>
               <p>From whence did he take his money, was it in a purse or loose in his pocket? - I believe in his pocket loose; I did not observe that; I saw him give her a guinea; she brought him the change, she kept the half guinea and gave him the rest in silver; he had paid for the bed, then he had to pay her for the girl afterwards; then she slipped the purse out of his pocket, saying, what have you got here; he said it was his money; she said I insist upon keeping it till to-morrow; he said no, no, he would keep it himself.</p>

               <p>How came she to see his purse? - I am not sure whether he took the guinea out of his pocket or out of the purse; but I saw him have the guinea in his hand and I saw the purse afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason why she would keep it? - She said she would keep it for him; there was no fear of it if it was fifty pounds, she said; no, no, said he, I would rather have my money, and I will have it.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason why she would take the purse and keep it for him? - No reason but that she would keep it till to-morrow morning; he would not let her have it.</p>
               <p>Did he offer to take it from her again? - He asked for it, she would not let him have it; there were the two girls there at the time; she went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Did he go down after her? - No.</p>
               <p>What became of the half guinea; did she keep that half guinea? - Yes; she kept it all but the silver, she gave him that.</p>
               <p>You do not know what money there was in the purse, or whether there was any? - I know what money was in the purse, she told it down into her own hand.</p>
               <p>What became of it then; did she return the purse? - No; she would not return either purse or money, she put the money into it again.</p>
               <p>How came she to tell it? Did she say any thing of this sort; I desire it to be known how much there is or what? - She told it to herself and said there is fourteen guineas of it.</p>
               <p>Did she speak that out to all the company? - Yes; when she told it over he asked her for it, but she would not let him have it; the money ran in my head all night; I got up about six o'clock, I went down stairs and enquired of the landlady's sister whether the landlady was in the house; she said no; I asked where she was; she made no answer; I ran up and told him she was gone; he put his hand in his pocket and said she has got all my money, I said I know that.</p>

I sent my boy for a constable; the boy came back some time after, and could not get one; I said then, my friend, you had better tell how you came by the spoon; you must have stolen it, or come unfairly by it. The woman got away. Soon after one of Justice Wilmot's men came by and secured the prisoner; he then said that he would tell the truth; that he had met with that woman, who gave him a pint of beer to dispose of it for her. We then took him before Mr. Wilmot; one of Mr. Wilmot's men and I went to the Hercules, and enquired of Mr. Humphreys if he had lost any thing; he said not that he knew of; he shewed me some spoons which tallied with this; I bid him look over them and see if he had his number; upon looking them over he missed one.</p>

The prisoner's son lived with me as a servant from the 8th of October till the 4th of December, and on the 22d I had a person came to enquire for some cuttings; I had deposited them all in one compter, for they are an article which are seldom called for, when I came to look into the compter, which should have been full, I found it half empty. The next day I went to the piecebroker's in Cloth Fair, to see if I could find any of these goods sold there; I enquired at several places, at last I came to Mr.

            's shop; I asked him if he had bought any scarlet cloth cuttings within these two or three months; he hesitated a little, at last he said he had. I asked him if he could describe the person he bought them of; he said he could; he gave me a description, by which I knew the prisoner to be the person. I then desired to look at the goods he had bought; he shewed me a part of them. He said he bought them of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did he mention the person by name? - He did not know the prisoner's name; he said he bought them of a person, whom he so described that I knew him to be the prisoner. He said he was a tall man, in a lightish-coloured coat, and had black hair. I asked him if he should know the man again in case he saw him; he said he should. I then got a warrant to apprehend both the prisoner and his son who then lived with me. Mr. Goodman went along with me and the officer to serve the warrant. We first took the boy, afterwards we went and took the prisoner. As soon as the officer had got the prisoner into custody, I asked Mr. Goodman if that was the person; he said he was. We then took him to Wood-street Compter; being there informed that there was an alderman sitting at Guildhall, we took him directly to Guildhall; when we came there the boy was examined, and denyed stealing them; the father was then asked how he came by them; he said he bought them of one Tucker, who lived a servant in Cateaton-street. Tucker was sent for and when he came he denied having any dealings of that kind with the prisoner, except about two years ago he employed the prisoner to make him a waistcoat, that there was a part left sufficient to make the fore part of a waistcoat for a child and that he sold to the prisoner for one shilling. The prisoner and his son were both sent back to the Compter, for him to find the person he bought them of. The next day they went under another examination; the prisoner was asked if he had found the person he bought them of; his answer was that he had not, but that the people he had them of brought them to his house, and when he had sold them they called for their money, but that he did not know their names nor where they lived then.

When we left the shop to go home it was about half after twelve in the morning, my son, my apprentice, my wife, myself and the prisoner, all went home together; she went first into the room with a great deal of courage, then she said, Lord have mercy upon me, here is a piece of work! my wife's clothes lay all about the room.</p>
               <p>She spoke as if there had been thieves? - Yes; and I supposed so myself at first; my clothes were flung about in the next room upon the bed and upon the floor; we looked in the other room and there was a door broke open; at last I went into the yard and looked upon the leads; I saw there had not been any body in that way. I then suspected the prisoner. I bid my wife see if the money was safe, but I was afraid it was gone. We missed the money; I took the prisoner up to St. Andrew's watch-house, and then I went with the constable to her sister's to enquire for her, for I suspected one of her sisters; when one of her sisters came down, I asked her if there was not another sister? she said there was, but she was not at home; but the constable went up into the garret, and there he found the other sister. The constable searched her, and took from her eleven shillings, and a half-crown piece; she said her own money was only two shillings and some half-pence; we asked her whose money that was? she said it was her sister's; we went down to the sister in the one pair of stairs room, and asked her if that was her money? she denied that it was. We then returned to the watch-house, and the constable said he had got the money in his hand; I said then there were two guineas I could swear to; I did not say that to influence the prisoner to make a confession, though I believe it had that effect, I believe she thought the money was discovered from her sister; she then told my son if he would go out of the watch-house with her, she would confess; she then said that her sister had often persuaded her to rob her master; that she came on Saturday about one o'clock and tapped at the window, and she let the sister in; that she gave her the money; that she threw the clothes about in one room, and the sister in the other; that she went away with the money, and she never saw her afterwards.</p>
               <p>That was the next day? - It was in the morning; she was taken then to the Compter; we took both the sisters to St. Sepulchre's watch-house. The constable searched the prisoner; she behaved with a good deal of impudence, and laughed; since that I have found several bad affairs.</p>
               <p>What age is the prisoner? - I do not know, I believe about 21.</p>
               <p>Have you ever had any of the money again? - Not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Had she had opportunities of seeing where you put your money? - I believe she had; she acknowledged that her sister had been with her above a week before to induce her to rob me; I have found since that she has been several times concealed in the house, and lain with the maid without my knowledge. The wards were taken out of the lock of the street-door, and there were pick-lock keys found; she has confessed she could open any door in the house.</p>

               <p>I am the son of the prosecutor, when the prisoner was in custody she desired me to go out of the watch-house and she would speak to me; I know nothing of it before that time.</p>
               <p>Before she spoke to you did you say any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120019"/>thing to induce her to confess? - Yes. I said it would be better, if she knew any thing of it, to confess; she said if I would go out of the watch-house she would tell me; when we went out she told me, her sister had been above a week persuading her to rob my father.</p>
               <p>Did she do it voluntarily of herself, or did you give her to understand it would be better for her? - I said, I thought it would be better for her, before that she desired me to go out of the watch-house, and she would tell me; she said her sister persuaded her to rob my father, and that her sister came home to my father's house about one o'clock, and tapped at the windows; that she let her in, and shewed her where the money was; upon which she said her sister took the money and went out of the house, and she never saw her afterwards. She said she threw the clothes about the room, and her sister broke the door open.</p>

               <p>What part of Holbourn is that? - It is above the Bars, between Great and Little Turnstile; she asked me to give her a glass of wine, or I asked her to drink one, I cannot say which. We went into the French Horn.</p>
               <p>Did you speak to her first or she to you? - I cannot tell exactly, I believe she spoke to me first. We went into the French Horn, and had some wine and water; while we were drinking the wine and water she picked my pocket of my pocket-book; I had it when I went into the house; there was nobody in the room but she and I, only the landlord brought in the wine and water.</p>
               <p>Which pocket was it in? - My waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Were you sober or in liquor? - I was not far in liquor; I had been drinking with several friends whom I had been doing business with, but was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you were perfectly sober when you went into this house? - I had been drinking two or three glasses of wine with some people I had been going business with; I was not fuddled.</p>
               <p>Had you a great coat on over your waistcoat? - I had no great coat on at the time, I had this coat on.</p>
               <p>Was your coat buttoned over your waistcoat? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120023"/>How long before you went into the house had you felt the pocket-book in your pocket? - I cannot tell, it was not long, I had my hand in my pocket just before I met her and felt it in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you had it after you left the house you was in before you met her? - Yes, I felt it in my pocket in the street. I often feel in my pockets as I walk along the street, to see if my books and things are safe.</p>
               <p>How long were you in the house with the prisoner? - About ten or fifteen minutes. I agreed to go with this gentlewoman to her lodging; she desired me to go up the horse-ride, and she would go up the alley, and meet me in Holborn. I went like a fool, but did not meet with the lady. I missed my pocket-book, and returned immediately, and told Mr. Parry I had been robbed in his house. The horse-ride is in the yard, and there is an alley. She was to meet me in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where she lodged or was she to shew you to her lodging? - She did not tell me, she was to shew me; I had not been out of the house above four or five minutes before I missed my pocket-book, and returned and told Mr. Parry.</p>
               <p>Did you go back into the room where you had been with her to see if you could find it? - Yes, we went and looked round the room directly but could not find it.</p>
               <p>Then it occurred to you when you missed it, that you might have dropped it in that room? - It was impossible to drop it out of my pocket unless it was pulled out. I went to the room and looked, but had no great notion that it had dropped out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Had not your waistcoat been open while you was in that room? - No, my waistcoat was not unbuttoned while I was in the room with her.</p>
               <p>What did you do on missing it? - I went to bed; I staid there all night; I asked the landlord the next day if he knew any thing of her; he said he knew nothing about her; then I staid till after dinner, to see if I could get any intelligence of her.</p>
               <p>When did you get any intelligence of her? - In four or five days, I cannot tell exactly the day.</p>
               <p>How did you hear of her? - Mr. Parry sent me a letter by the post, and I came to town immediately and got a warrant for the prisoner; she was taken before I came to town. When they sent for me to town I swore to her. She was taken before Justice Triguet, in Hart-street, Bloomsbury; she owned being with me but denied knowing any thing of the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Did you ever get your book again? - No.</p>
               <p>What was in the book? - A twenty pound bank note; I put it in that afternoon; I took it for some cattle I had sold.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the bank note was in it? - Yes; there were besides memorandums and bills and receipts in it.</p>

               <p>You took this to be the woman you had the warrant against? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she searched? - No.</p>
               <p>Neither at that time nor any other? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you enquire for her lodging? - Yes, we found the place where she lodged.</p>
               <p>Did you search the lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Why did not you search? - Because it was the 14th of December when I took her, it was a long while after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Upon her examination at Justice Triguet's, or at any other time did she say any thing about the robbery? - No, she only said she had been with the person drinking some mulled wine, but denied the fact.</p>

             and the prisoner came to my house about a quarter after ten at night, and had some wine and water; they staid about a quarter of an hour, then they both went away; Mr. Deverell came back in a short time and said he had lost a pocket-book. As soon as they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120024"/>gone I went into the room and took the bowl and candle away. There was no pocket-book there then; nobody but me went into the room.</p>
               <p>Did you look round the room then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you go and look in the room when Deverell came back? - I cannot swear to that, I do not recollect; I believe we did go and look into the room. I asked him why he thought the woman had taken his pocket-book from him, and he gave me his reasons.</p>
               <p>When the prosecutor came back and you searched the room you did not find any thing? - No; I told him his best way was to remain in town and I would make what enquiry I could after her.</p>
               <p>You did not know the prisoner at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know where she lodged? - No, I did not know where she lodged; I made all the enquiry I could and as soon as I heard of her wrote to Mr. Deverell in the country consequence of which he came to town.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing further of the matter? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the examination of the prisoner? - Yes; she always denied it from first to last.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I met with the prosecutor promiscuously in Holborn; he came up to me and asked me to go and drink a glass of wine at this man's house. I went in with him; he asked what I chose to drink; I said a glass of red port mulled; he sat down on one side of the table and I on the other; he pulled out half a crown and asked me if I would lie with him for that; I said I never accepted of any thing so mean as half a crown; he said it was immaterial, if I would not do it for that; he had been with two other girls that evening. He said perhaps if I took him home he might make me a present of something more. I said I could not take him home for any such money. He asked me where he could find me again; I said in Holborn; he said he would go up the horse-ride, and I went up Holborn. The prosecutor passed me afterwards in Holborn; he was very much in liquor; he said nothing to me nor I to him. I was afterwards informed that Mr. Parry charged me with taking a bank note from the prosecutor; I went to Mr. Parry's, and gave him a direction where I lived, and asked him where the prosecutor was; he said he was gone into the country, but would come to town that afternoon; I said very well, there I lodge, if he has any such thing to charge me with, he may do it any time. I was at Mr. Parry's house almost every night after the warrant was out against me. He said nothing to me. I asked him before the constable if he did not know where I lodged; he said he did; I asked him why he did not call upon me at my lodging; he said the prosecutor had been several times in town, and never came near him; that he should never have come after me if he had not met with me.</p>

               <p>To Parry. Did the prisoner come to your house to give you a direction where she lodged? - I gave it out that she had taken this bank note and that she had better come to my house; a few nights after she came in such a bullocking manner that I begged she would walk out of the house, and she might depend upon it she would hear of it again.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you where she lodged? - She did not; I heard afterwards that she lodged at one Rushworth's in Covent Garden; I said it looked bad her never coming to my house afterwards, she never was there but that once.</p>

I thought they had been on board a ship with the sugar, and that the master not being on board they were carrying it back again; they were stopped with the sugar by Isaacs and Jenkins; I counted the sugar twice over on the wharf and found three loaves and a lump were missing.</p>

               <p>Where does he live? - In a court there.</p>
               <p>What is he? - I have seen him at the horse trough watering his horses.</p>

               <p>Did you stop at any public house, or at the door of any public house? - No; I did not; I had been at work, I go a charing at gentlemen's houses; I had been that day at Mr. Bull's at Carnaby Market.</p>
               <p>How came you to be out so late? - My mistress had somebody from the country she went out with, and therefore I could not finish the washing so soon or else I am never so late.</p>

               <p>On the 21st of December, I was in a boat with my brother, I said somebody was robbing my master's craft, we had better row after them, which we did; I saw a skiff alongside of the barge; we came up to them and asked them how they came by the coals; they said they were given to them. The skiff was near to them. There was about eleven bushels, which were worth about thirteen-pence a bushel; we took the men up and put them in the watch-house; they then said they had lost their skiff, and that they gave a man three-pence to take them down to the barge.</p>
               <p>FEELING's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I had two loaded craft belonging to a gentleman who was my employer, which lay along-side these gentlemen's craft. I thought I had a skiff ashore, but when I came to look for her she was stolen away. I said to these two men, I will treat you with a pot of beer if you will lend me a hand in with two craft which are loaded; they agreed to go with me and lend me a hand. I went down to the water-side, and the skiff, as I said before, was stolen away. I got a skuller and gave three-pence to carry off these two men and me; when I got along-side, I had Mr. Wood's craft to step over to get into my master's barge; just as I had stepped over one or two of these craft, I happened to see my own skiff along-side my master's craft; I said here is my - skiff, I will take her to the wharf and see if any body owns any thing about the coals, if not I do not know what to do with her. There came off five or six of these men; they asked, who are you? I said a lighterman. Have you been robbing the craft, these are my master's coals? I said I do not know that they are your master's coals, they were along-side my master's craft? they said we will take the skiff away to Mr. Wood's our master; I said if you will you must, to be sure there is a supernumerous of you; I said did you see me or either of these men touch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120029"/>a coal. They said, O, you have had them out. I said, if they would say that I could not help it; I said, they may belong to you for any thing I know. They stopped the skiff and then fetched a runner from Mr. Sherwood's and took these two men that were in the barge astern of my master's barge. I said to Mr. Sherwood's men, you know me, I am not going to run away nor fly, I have done nothing I am afraid of. They said we know you and will take your word. I said either to-night or in the morning I will surrender myself voluntarily up to you. They took my word, and in the morning I went and surrendered myself up, having done nothing to be afraid of. We had a hearing, and according to what these men said Mr. Sherwood committed us; he said it is petit larceny; after that Mr. Wood made it grand larceny. I did not know any thing about petit or grand. As to the coals I did not touch one; it is natural for a lighterman to walk over other people's craft without any design of ill-behaviour. If I had any inclination that way, there was property enough of my master's, without distressing any other gentleman; there were thirty chaldron of my employer's coals.</p>

The crowd was behind and she stood before me and kept me in the crowd.</p>
               <p>How long did she keep you in that situation - I believe about five or six minutes; I asked her what she kept me there for; she said why do not you go about your business; I said because you will not let me out. I got out by force with her striking me on the stomach; I got beyond the print-shop; I thought of my pocket; I felt my ring and money were gone; the ring and two guineas were in a box; the crown piece was loose in my pocket; they were all gone.</p>

               <p>What did she say to her? - I cannot say; I was in a great fright; I had things of value which belonged to other people in my hand.</p>
               <p>You did not see who she spoke to? - No, I did not; I did not think of her robbing me till after I got out of the crowd.</p>
               <p>When you missed the box out of your pocket what did you do? - I thought to follow her wherever she went, she walked by the side of me.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing to you when she came out of the crowd? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to her when you missed the box? - Yes, I said I had been robbed, and she was the person that had done it, for she struck me up in the crowd; she was sorry for my loss, but why should I suspect her.</p>
               <p>How long did she continue to walk with you? - Till she came to Water-lane; she turned down there; I told her I should have her taken up for she was the person.</p>
               <p>Did you call for any assistance to take her up? - Yes, there was a constable just by, and she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Was she searched? - Yes, they took her to a public-house, and the neighbours all came about me.</p>
               <p>Was any thing of your's found upon her? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you lose sight of her before you had her taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Your things were never found then? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see her stop to speak to any body after she came out of the crowd? - No. While I was in the public-house, I said I would go and have the advice of a friend; when I returned they told me there had been two women lurking about to see what became of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Smith in Lombard-street. On the 11th of December my mistress sent to me to pack up her things; I packed up the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) to go from the town house to the country house. She was in the country at this time. I packed them up in a packing cloth, and put them in the errand cart to go to my mistress's at Tottenham.</p>
               <p>Whose cart did you put them into? - One Richardson's; he comes from Tottenham. The cart was in Nicolas-lane. I put them into the cart myself.</p>
               <p>Whose care did you deliver them to? - Into the care of

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I took these things (producing them) out of the prisoner's left hand, in Houndsditch. I saw the errand cart coming towards Bishopsgate-street.</p>
               <p>Do you know whose cart it was? - I do not; I saw the prisoner behind the cart undoing the tilt. There were four or five of them, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120031"/>Are you sure the prisoner was one? - Yes; after he had undone the tilt, he went out of the highway into the pathway. After the cart had gone about twenty yards he went to the cart again; he put his hand upon the tail of the cart, and with his left hand pulled out this bundle; he turned his back to the cart, and was coming from it; I said to my brother get on the left hand side of the pathway, for that man has robbed the cart; the prisoner ran from behind the cart with that bundle before him.</p>
               <p>Did you or your brother stop him? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Is that the bundle you saw him take out of the cart? - This is the bundle, I delivered it to Ponsonby the constable. When I took hold of him, he asked me what I wanted with him? I said he had robbed the cart; he attempted to drop it, and it fell between him and me. I took hold of him by the collar, he began to be outrageous; having him in one hand and the bundle in the other, he was almost too much for me, till my brother came up and I got assistance. I delivered the bundle to Mr. Perke.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Between six and seven o'clock on the 11th of December, on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>It must be very dark at that time? - It was dark.</p>
               <p>How far was you from the cart when the bundle was taken out? - About ten yards off; it was almost opposite Mr. Perke's shop.</p>
               <p>Could you see distinctly what was doing at the cart? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you tell the carter of it? - The prisoner ran from the cart, and the cart kept going on. He desired me to let him go but I would not.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him with taking the bundle? - Yes; he said he found it in the street. It was a sloppy night, but the parcel was not dirty.</p>
               <p>LAZARUS PERKE sworn.</p>
               <p>At the time of the bustle did that young man deliver that bundle to you? - Yes, he brought it into my shop. Wilcox crying out, I went out to their assistance, and we brought in the bundle and the prisoner. I opened the bundle and looked at it and sent Wilcox after the cart; it was not to be found. I looked over the things and said they would bear advertising. I sent for a constable and delivered it to him; it was only left in my custody while he took the prisoner to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You cannot say that this is the bundle which was left in your shop? - It is the same bundle; I examined it before the constable took the prisoner to the Compter and after he came back.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Messrs. Chambers, Langston, and Hall. On the 22d of December, between the hours of two and four in the afternoon, the two prisoners came into my master's shop and asked to see some thread edgings; I shewed them one box in which there was nothing fine enough for them; I shewed them another out of which they bought two yards and an half; they then asked to see some broader and finer lace; I shewed them some; they bought a yard and a quarter; while I was measuring it, I perceived Jones take a card, which she had been looking at before, and slide it into Gaskin's apron, which Gaskin concealed.</p>
               <p>One card of lace? - Yes; Gaskin took it out of her apron and put it into her pocket-hole.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing else? - There was more found upon them when they were brought into the shop again. I took no notice of it to the prisoner, but put up what they bought of me, and they paid me for it. I let them go out of the shop, and then went after them and brought them both back.</p>
               <p>Did you follow them directly? - Yes. When they were got into the shop they placed themselves very near the compter, and Gaskin dropped five cards, almost as soon as she got into the shop, before we could get a constable. I saw her drop them.</p>
               <p>What quantity did they contain? - About thirty-five yards.</p>
               <p>What was the value? - Five pounds, and upwards. Two of the pieces were not measured.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This was done so public that you saw her take it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where were the cards of lace found? - On the floor of the shop.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts? - On the outside of the counter.</p>
               <p>Did you never say that it was on the other side of the counter? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I went with the warrant, and searched two houses of the prisoner's and found three pieces of tin plates, which Mr. Jones says are his, that is all I found in both houses.</p>
               <p>Did you take the prisoner up? - No, he was taken up before.</p>
               <p>Jones. I was not at home at the time; he was kept in custody, till I came home, and a constable sent for.</p>
               <p>Was he searched? - No.</p>
               <p>How comes the door of this warehouse to be open in the day time? - It is opposite to my house; it is left open for the work-people, and our people, to go in and out.</p>

               <p>I was employed by a gentleman to whitewash the house. There was a place where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120034"/>Mr. Jones put his lumbering things; I could not do it without removing some of Mr. Jones's things, such as chairs and other brokery things. Mr. Jones came and said I had taken some things; I said I had not; that if they had lost any thing I was sorry, I knew nothing of it. I moved the things as carefully as I could. As to the pieces of tin we swept them out; I took them up to be sure afterwards, I thought they were pieces of waste tin; I might move the tiles out of the way; I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>To Jones. What is the value of these pieces of tin? - Little or nothing; I have valued the three pieces at three-pence.</p>

I said a bundle; he demanded that.</p>
               <p>What did he say about your money? - He put a pistol to my head, and said give me your watches and money or I will shoot you through the head. I said I was a poor man and had no money. He asked what I had in my hand? I said a bundle; he took that bundle from me; there were two horse-cloths in it. When he had taken the bundle he went a second time to the coach door, and looked through the glass and found there was nobody there; he came back and presented a pistol again to my head and said, your watches and money or I will shoot you through the head; we told him we had got none; he then went and opened the coach door. I thought we must die if he came again, and therefore jumped off the coach-box and laid hold of him by the right-hand and got him somehow on the ground. I found he was very strong and I called to the coachman who was along with me to help me as soon a possible. He got down as soon as he could, and assisted me. I called to the watchman; he came, and presently after about ten or a dozen more. The prisoner was very strong; I was afraid he would get from me; I secured him and took this pistol from him.</p>

The prisoner said what is it o'clock? I looked at my watch and said it is about half after five; a customer came then to be shaved; I went into the shop to shave him and the prisoner then asked my mother if she would drink a glass of any thing.</p>
               <p>That was while you was in the shop? - Yes, I heard it; there is only a glass door between the shop and back room, which always stands open. My mother said she did not want any thing, she was going to tea; the prisoner said she should like to have something, it was very cold, and she sent my mother out for a quartern of gin. While my mother was gone the prisoner went out. There was nobody else in the room when my mother went out but a child not five years old. My mother came in and said the watch was taken away; I said then, that woman must have taken it.</p>
               <p>Do any other persons live in your house besides you and your mother? - Yes, I have lodgers.</p>
               <p>Could not some of the lodgers come into the back room? - There was no other person in the back room.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure no other person was in the back room? - Yes, I am sure there was not; my mother was not gone a minute.</p>
               <p>How far did your mother go to the alehouse? - About four or five doors. When my mother came back, the prisoner was gone and the watch too.</p>
               <p>Did you follow the prisoner? - No, I did not. I went to the top of the street but could not see any thing of her; I never saw her again till I was sent for by Justice Clerk. I charged her with the fact she denied it.</p>
               <p>Was the watch found? - No.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A silver watch, I take it to be worth two guineas; the justice set it down at twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>An Officer. My Lord, the prisoner says she cannot speak English; she is a Welsh woman.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Did she speak English when she came to you? - Yes, very good English.</p>
               <p>To the Officer. Did she tell you in English or Welsh she could not talk English? - In very good English. She says now she has a cold and cannot speak.</p>

I had been up almost all night, because I follow chair-work; I left the three guineas there for fear I should lose them and drawed four shillings. The prisoner was there; we went out together; she persuaded me, because it was a strange house, to go back and get my money. I went back and got it; then she told me she would take me to a place where I should be used well and taken care of:</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - Yes, a little matter, not much.</p>
               <p>Did you go with her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where to? - I do not know the name of the place, nor the house; it was a little way from thence. She shewed me a bed and put me to bed; she sat by the bedside; before I went to sleep I felt something stirring under my head. I had put my breeches under my head; I felt in my breeches pocket, and my money was gone. She sat on the bed the whole time; there was no body else in the room.</p>
               <p>Was she in the room then? - Yes; there was a guinea and a half lay on the bed close to her; when she got up I charged her with having it; she began to swear and use me very ill, and said she knew nothing about it. I got up directly and went to the office in Litchfield-street.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how much money you had in your pocket? - I had three guineas when I left the King's Head.</p>
               <p>What were the pieces? - Two guineas and a half, and the rest in silver. I lost a a guinea and the silver.</p>
               <p>You went and complained to a magistrate and had her taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was she searched? - Not that I know of; I staid at the office till they brought her there. There came a parcel of women up stairs when I got up, and I was afraid of my life.</p>
               <p>What did she say before the justice? - She said very little.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much in liquor? - Not very much.</p>
               <p>She said she would take you to a house to be taken care of? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had not you a home of your own? - Yes, but I did not care to go there till I was better.</p>
               <p>How do you know you had your money when you was in the house? - I counted it before I went to bed, because I had a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Could it not drop out of your breeches when you put them under the bolster? - Not without somebody took them out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Whether there was not another woman in the house besides me?</p>
               <p>Hughes. There was nobody in the room but her, till after I missed the money.</p>
               <p>Did you look at all behind the bolster where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120040"/>you laid your breeches, to see if the money was dropped out? - I did look, there was none.</p>

               <p>Are there any shutters to the windows? - No; it is a back window on some leads which come to the back of the house.</p>

Mr. Dinmore found them in her lodging.</p>
               <p>Do you know of any thing that was lost? - Ye, the shop had been robbed several times, but we did not know who did it. She came a third time and pledged a gown; I suspected it was her who robbed the shop.</p>

               <p>She came again a third time? - Yes, to pledge a gown; my mistress placed me behind some steps, at the end of the compter, while she went out, and I saw the prisoner get upon the compter two different times. She could not see me. She took some blue and white handkerchiefs the first time; the second time she took three stocks and a pair of sleeves; she then went out. My mistress immediately called her back, took her into the kitchen, and called one of the men; the man came in and saw her drop the blue and white handkerchief from under her arm; I saw her drop the stocks and sleeves; I took them up. My mistress sent for Dinmore, the constable.</p>

               <p>On the 23d of December I was at work at Mrs. Clark's; she called me and said she had got a thief, and desired me to detain her. The prisoner tried to get by me two or three times; I desired her to let me look under her arm; she let me look under her right arm, but refused to let me look under her left. I gave her a chuck under the arm, and the handkerchief and some other things dropped from her; I do not know what they were, but the handkerchief I saw under her arm, and saw the other things drop, but I do not know where they dropped from. She went down upon her knees, and lifted up her hands, and called God to witness that she knew nothing of the matter.</p>

I said I believe you have a quart pot; and felt down one side of her clothes and felt a quart pot; I felt down the other side and felt a pint pot, as I supposed it to be, through her clothes, it proved so afterwards; I sent for an officer and gave him charge of both the women; we went before Justice Blackborough, there he searched her and found a quart pot of mine, and a pint pot of Mr. Bates's.</p>

               <p>Do you recollect how much money you gave him? - No; I believe it was about 12 s. I don't know exactly what I had in my pocket; my son ran towards the turnpike to get help for me; I went as fast as I could home to get help to see whether my son was murdered in the road or not; I expected he was dead in the road.</p>

               <p>How came you to take any notice of him? - Because I had some suspicion of him.</p>

               <p>How soon did you come to your recollection to see what was doing? - I cannot tell; I did not stay to see any thing else; I got up directly and ran to the turnpike for assistance.</p>
               <p>Did you, before the man knocked you down, take so much notice of him, and see him so well, that you should know him again? - Yes; I think I should know him again.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120048"/>Upon that was there any search made for a coat? - A search warrant was granted the next day; I searched at his house and found the coat under the bed, between a straw mattrass and a featherbed.</p>
               <p>Was that the coat he has on now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he was carried before Mr. Bishop after that, what did he say about the robbery? - He then confessed it.</p>
               <p>What did you say in order to induce him to make that confession? - Not a word that I know of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you both say it would be better for me to tell the truth?</p>
               <p>Welch. We did not. I found in his lodging the coat, a stopping iron, and a plough paddle. When I returned with them I said to him, now, my friend, I must confine you closely, for here is the coat you denied; he said then, that he wanted to save himself; I went out with him and he begged and prayed of me to intercede with Mr. Bishop for him; I told him I would not hear it; he then confessed to Mr. Bishop, and then he went into a room and told it to five or six people without being asked any thing at all about it.</p>
               <p>What was the iron you found? - An iron they stuff collars with; he owned that that was what he had, robbed them with instead of a pistol.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Welsh. Do you recollect what coloured coat the man had on that robbed you? - Yes, a light-coloured ragged coat;</p>

The prisoner took the things, mentioned in the indictment, last Monday was a-week; she lodged in my two-pair-of-stairs back room. She took 4 china coffee pots, 2 china dishes, 4 china plates, 4 tea-cups and saucers, and a china tea-pot stand; I lost one pair of silk stockings; and I missed 20 l. at several times. On Sunday was three-weeks, I had six shillings in my pocket; I lay with her, and about an hour after I laid down, she took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Why do you charge her with taking them? - There was nobody in the house but her, and they were found upon her. I found the coachman that drove her away; and he drove me to the place; he searched her lodgings and found up stairs the stand. I felt her hand in my pocket when she lay with me; she had three shillings, and she gave me the next morning, when I charged her with it, two sixpences out of it; she said she would not leave me while I had a bed to lie on.</p>
               <p>She said that out of friendship to you? - No; she said possession was nine points of the law, and she would not go.</p>
               <p>You turned her out at last did you? - I told her I was going to move, I was stripped so bare.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>I believe you was so bare of money that you was obliged to sell your things to pay your rent? - I was.</p>

               <p>What business did she carry on? - None.</p>
               <p>What business did you carry on? - The coal trade, while I could; I lost forty pounds by her.</p>
               <p>The morning she packed up to leave your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120050"/>lodgings, you was present was not you? - No; I was below she was above.</p>
               <p>Had she bought any china of you before this? - Yes, half a guinea's worth.</p>
               <p>You did not know where she was going? - No; she desired the coachman not to tell where she was put down.</p>
               <p>When you was before the magistrate you did not mention any thing about this money? - I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>I believe you sent to this young woman and told her, if she would give you some money you would not go on with this prosecution? - No; she offered me a guinea not to go on with it.</p>

             stopped on the first floor. I said I had a search warrant to search her place. What for? said she. I said some china you have stolen from Mrs. Davis. She said she did not know that she had got any. I opened the door, and called for Mrs. Davis; she came up; when she came into the room she had four cups and saucers in her hand which she got from the people on the first floor; they said she had left them there. I examined all the prisoner's things over, and found some more china in her trunks, which Mrs. Davis said was her's. Some time after Mrs. Davis said, I want two china dishes. Said the prisoner, if the constable will go along with me I will find them. She went into Covent garden; to a woman in the market who went home and gave her the two dishes, which she gave Mrs. Davis. The prisoner said she had left them at that house a day or two before, and that she had only just come to her lodging.</p>
               <p>Did she say they were her's? - No; she said they belonged to Mrs. Davis. When Mrs. Davis saw them, she said they belonged to her, and the other delivered them up directly.</p>
               <p>Did she say she had bought them? - No.</p>

               <p>The only piece of china found in her room was the stand for the tea-pot? - Four coffee cups were found in her trunk, and that stand for the tea-pot. They are trifling things, but they were found in her trunk.</p>
               <p>The prisoner claimed no property in these two dishes? - No; she said they were Mrs. Davis's.</p>
               <p>Court. What said Mrs. Davis to her, did she charge her with having taken them away? - Yes. The prisoner said she did not know how she had taken them away, but said she had got them at such a place in Covent-garden, and would return them.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. You could never have found out these dishes if she had not told you where they were? - No.</p>

I thought till he began to run that he was the book-keeper.</p>
               <p>Can you tell what was in this box? - It was perfumery goods, but I cannot tell what was in it.</p>

On the 8th of December I went there in the evening at about seven o'clock; I went up stairs about half way up the stairs to the two pair of stairs room; there was a turning in the stairs, and it was very narrow from thence to the top about three or four steps; I then stood and saw both the prisoners at work.</p>
               <p>How were they dressed? - I believe Benfield had the same clothes on that he has now; his great coat was off.</p>
               <p>What were they at work about? - It was at a drawer, a kind of trough; I saw both their hands in the trough busy at work; I said to Mr. Clarke, there they are at work; the door was wide open, as I was going into the room I kicked against the steps, one of them I don't know which called out holloa; upon that Turley turned down the drawer where the moulds and flasks were; one of the moulds has the impression very clear; Turley catched hold of the flask and hit it against the window and broke two or three panes of glass in attempting to throw it out; I hit him with a stick on his arm and caused the flask to drop within the window, instead of going through the window. Turley attempted to run by me but I prevented it; and by that time Clarke and Jealous were in the room and had hold of them; when we took up the drawer where the mouldings were; there were patterns for half crowns and shillings; the impressions were chiefly broke, but some of them are very clear now; we examined the fire; there was a crucible on the fire three parts full of metal; Mr. Clarke will describe the metal.</p>
               <p>Did you search either of the prisoners? - I held them while Jealous searched them; we found three crucibles, and the frame and the boards of the flask which makes the flask complete; there was some bad silver found on Benfield, and some in the room I believe, but I did not find them.</p>

               <p>How many windows are there in the room? - One I believe.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - To the right as I stood on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Where was the fire place? - To the right too; I could not see the fire place on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Where did the trough stand? - Close to the window; a child on the stairs where I stood could not help seeing them from foot to head.</p>
               <p>What part of them was towards you? - Their backs were to me; the one stood at the end, the other at the side of the trough; they might have seen me if they had looked.</p>
               <p>I need not tell you, as you know very well that you are entitled to a part of the reward if they are convicted? - That is nothing new to me.</p>
               <p>What led Clarke and you to this house? - Mr. Clarke told me what he was going there for; I went with him; he told me he had received an anonymous letter.</p>
               <p>You was lucky enough to go unperceived by these men till you saw them at this trough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Turley. Was my hat on or off? - I I don't know.</p>
               <p>You say you saw two men working at that trough, was there room for two men to work at it? - There was room for three men to work at it; it was a drawer out of the chest of drawers.</p>

               <p>Did you find any thing else in Turley's pocket? - Nothing else; in Benfield's pocket I found a bad shilling and a bad six-pence, and a good shilling and a good six-pence with it, in his other pocket I found some bits of cuttings, I believe they are bits of six-pences cut, it is bad seemingly; I found two shillings and a six-pence in the room behind the fire place, they are bad.</p>
               <p>Was there any other money found in the room? - That is all that I have.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you go to this house with Prothero and Jealous? - Yes; I went next to Prothero up stairs; he turned back and told me they were both at work; he went up stairs; I heard the flasks and money fly; Turley threw the flask at the window, but it did not go through. We secured the prisoner. I then applied myself to the place where the flasks were; I picked up the sand which fell out of the flasks; I found a quantity of pieces of metal in the window; I found some black copper in the window likewise. I found these four shillings, they are counterfeits; they are quite finished. Upon the ground and in the sand I found these pattern shillings from which the others are cast, they are good. This crucible was in the fire with this metal in it; I poured it into the sand to cool it; it is a mixed metal. There were all the implements complete for coining, file, scowering-paper, a pair of cutters, crucibles, facing sand, and moulds.</p>

               <p>The whole apparatus is complete? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any aqua fortis? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You have produced and specified every thing that was found in that room? - Yes.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120056"/>You do not recollect any thing else which was in the room; you have brought every thing? - Every thing in that room.</p>
               <p>Look at that money which is said to be taken out of Benfield's pocket? - There is a shilling and sixpence bad, and a shilling and sixpence good.</p>
               <p>Is the bad money cut or cast? - One of them is cut I believe, and the impression put on afterwards; the other may be cut too, I rather think it is cut.</p>
               <p>With all the implements you found in the room could a piece of money have been completed? - No; there could not in my opinion.</p>
               <p>In the next place there is a fluid necessary to complete it? - No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>For the purpose of throwing up the silver colour? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing else wanting? - No.</p>
               <p>Without the pickle it remains of the colour you have produced it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know who the house belongs to? - No. By information we heard that it belonged to Mrs. McGinnis.</p>
               <p>Did either of the prisoners live in that house? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>What made you go to this particular house? - An information.</p>
               <p>What was the description of the house, by whom kept? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you any objection to tell from whom you received that information? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that it is necessary to prove the persons at work in these cases? - No, I do not know it.</p>
               <p>You do not conceive it to be of the essence of the proof that they should be proved to be at work? - No; I do not.</p>
               <p>Prothero told you they were at work? - He did.</p>
               <p>You was contented with that information, you did not see them at work? - I could not see through him.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing of that? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you look over the house, to see if there was the appearance of any people lodging there? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you see any beds? - No.</p>
               <p>You have never heard of Turley's being concerned in this business before? - Do not ask me that question.</p>

               <p>JOHN CLARKE sworn.</p>
               <p>After we took the men, we went to the lodging in Long-acre. When I came into the room I heard a shilling drop, I could not say from whom. There was some aqua fortis in a cup, and this was inside it (producing a pipkin with some pickle in it) by putting the mixed metal into this pickle, which is aqua fortis and water, it purges the silver on the outside. The shillings were perfectly white when they were taken out of the pickle. There was scowering sand upon her hand.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner the only woman you found in the house? - No, there was another woman in the other room.</p>
               <p>An old acquaintance? - No.</p>
               <p>The street door was on the latch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the other door open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Is it a lodging-house? - It is supposed to be Benfield's brother's house.</p>
               <p>This woman lived with Benfield as his wife? - She might; upon enquiry I heard he lay there one night.</p>
               <p>Then she acted under the direction of her husband? - They were pretty far apart.</p>
               <p>Court. Would these shillings have continued white if they had been in use? - They would have turned coppery by wearing in people's pockets through the silver wearing off. By lying by, they are turned black.</p>
               <p>To Carpmeal. The shilling appeared wet and dirty? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of dirt was it upon it? - It was sand.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GREGORY sworn.</p>
               <p>Look at the pieces of coin, and see if they are or not counterfeits? - They are all bad.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lost some stack-wood in December last; I missed it when I went with my cart to fetch it out from where it stood upon <placeName id="t17800112-35-crimeloc177">Enfield Chase</placeName>

                        targets="t17800112-35-off175 t17800112-35-crimeloc177"/>. I went with my cart to bring it away on the 22d of December; when I came there the part which I went for was gone.</p>
               <p>Was all that was there gone? - All that stood upon that spot. I followed the track of the cart till I came to the prisoner's house, and found it upon his premisses.</p>
               <p>Is there any road or tracks over that part of the Chase; - Several roads.</p>
               <p>How came you to follow this particular cart? - I do not imagine there had been a cart upon that part of the Chase for a month or six weeks before, the time of year was so bad. The track I followed was a fresh one, it had been made but some few days.</p>
               <p>Was the track so fresh that you could distinguish it from the old tracks? - Yes, very plain.</p>
               <p>When you came to the man's house you taxed him with it and he denied it? - In looking round I found a great part of the wood in the yard under his hovel.</p>
               <p>Had he any wood of his own there? - He had split some into small pieces.</p>
               <p>How did you know this wood which you found in his yard under the hovel to be your's? - By a particular mark that was upon a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120059"/>stick; I brought it away with me. There was a mark of a saw upon it, which my people, who I had employed, had fixed on it; there was a dispute between the two men, one thought it was not long enough; they measured it again, and then cut it an inch longer than where they had begun. I know a great part of it. Besides, there were one or two more which the saw had touched.</p>
               <p>Was there any other particular mark than the mark of the saw? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not your wood like other stack-wood? - There was no other such upon that quarter.</p>
               <p>In what did it differ from other stack-wood? - This was a butt of an oak.</p>
               <p>Was not there a great deal of other oak upon the Chase besides this which was cut for your stack-wood? - This was rather a large stack.</p>
               <p>Was your's the only large stack upon Enfield Chase? - That was any way near there that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was this wood covered up or concealed, or was it lying open in the prisoner's yard? - It was lying open in the yard. I took that stick away, and had the prisoner taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You have not told us quite all you know about this business have you? - I do not recollect any thing else.</p>
               <p>What business may you be of? - A publican.</p>
               <p>Did you go with your own cart yourself to fetch home this wood? - With my servant.</p>
               <p>You had not received information of any of the wood being missing before you went for it? - Yes, I had heard that some of my wood was gone.</p>
               <p>There are pretty large quantities of stack-wood about the Chase? - Not just at that place, the wood has been taken off.</p>
               <p>I am told there are four or five thousand pieces of oak of much the same kind there now? - Not near it.</p>
               <p>There is such sort of wood upon the Chase? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>You have been talking of the butt of an oak, what do you mean by the butt of an oak, is it the stump or body? - The lower part.</p>
               <p>What lengths might this be cut into? - Three feet. One of the men was for cutting it three feet, and the other three feet and an inch; it was at last cut at three feet two inches.</p>
               <p>You have been asked what enables you to swear so positively to this piece of wood, the answers you have given, if I understand you right, were that there had been a saw in it; might not that have happened to any other piece of wood? - I cannot say; I know this very well.</p>
               <p>So the whole mark upon that wood is a cut? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that is it which you mean to swear by? - I do.</p>
               <p>Do you know such a man as Mr. Smith a wheeler, in you neighbourhood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did any body see the mark of the wheels of a cart besides yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have been giving an account that there are a great number of roads where there are wheel tracks? - Certainly upon such a forest as that.</p>
               <p>You are acquainted with Mr. Rookes, I believe? - I have seen him.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Some time.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect having any meeting with Mr. Hall and Mrs. Rookes? - Meeting! Mrs. Rookes was one of the prisoner's bail.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect any meeting you had with them? - I keep a public-house.</p>
               <p>If you have had a meeting do not be ashamed of it, say so? - Only when they bailed him, and when we took him into custody again.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect telling Mr. Hall that unless he would give you twenty guineas you would hang him? - I never told him any such thing in my life.</p>
               <p>What then is become of the notes you got from this man? - I do not know; I have got no notes.</p>
               <p>You do not know any thing about that then? - No.</p>
               <p>Then tell the court plainly, have you got notes from this man? - I never had any in my life.</p>
               <p>Do you deny that you ever had any notes given you by the prisoner at the bar? - I never had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120060"/>Do you recollect the prisoner's waiting upon you to pay the first of these notes? - The prisoner came one day with a handful of money, but I knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Is your wife in town? - She is near at hand.</p>
               <p>Was not she present when this transaction happened? - She might be at hand.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell the prisoner if he would not give you twenty guineas, and then you reduced it down to ten, that you would prosecute and hang him? - That I deny. There were some notes drawn up between him and his bail, but I know nothing about them.</p>
               <p>They were not then made payable to you? - I do not know who they were made payable to.</p>
               <p>Did not Hall wait upon you to pay you one of these notes? - I never had the notes.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Hall that you should not deliver him up this note unless he would agree to have them both burnt? - No.</p>
               <p>The whole of this is a fiction then, it is all a story? - Certainly; what his bail and he did I know nothing about.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A labouring man. I cleft some stack-wood for Mr. Bickley; it was upon Enfield Chase.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any of it afterwards? - Yes, I saw one piece of it, which Mr. Bickley shewed me at his own house, which I cleft. I never saw it at the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>(The piece of wood was produced in court by the constable.)</p>
               <p>To Bickley. Where did you find that piece of wood? - In Mr. Hall's yard.</p>
               <p>That is the piece of wood you take upon you to swear to? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>To Tulett. Do you know any thing of that piece of wood? - Whilst we were cleaving this, there arose a dispute between my partner and me in sawing it off; we set the saw in; I said we will go an inch farther.</p>
               <p>How do you know that to be the same piece of wood again? - To the best of my knowledge that is the piece.</p>
               <p>Have you often been employed in cleaving stack-wood? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did it never happen in all your cleaving wood, that you put the saw in a wrong place and took it out again? - Yes, to be sure that might happen.</p>
               <p>Do you take upon you to swear that that is the very piece of wood that you cut for Mr. Bickley? - No, I certainly cannot.</p>

               <p>- FRANKLAND sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bickley, the prosecutor, desired me to go along with him to trace the cart from the place where the wood was taken.</p>
               <p>Do you know the place where the wood was before it was taken away? - Perfectly well. I saw the tracks of a six-inch wheel cart. The tracks began from the three quarters of a stack of wood which was taken away. We followed it all the way to the prisoner's yard.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the tract any farther than that? - No farther than his yard.</p>
               <p>But at the other end, next to where the track was, did you look to see whether the track went any farther than the stack? - I did not examine that.</p>
               <p>If Mr. Bickley had not pointed it out to you should you have taken notice of that more particularly than any other track? - No; but when Mr. Bickley pointed it out to me we could follow it very plain.</p>
               <p>Did it appear to be a fresh or an old track? - It appeared to have been made within a day or two.</p>
               <p>Were there any other fresh tracks besides that from that part of the Chase? - None but what were gone down in the right road, but this went across the other tracks.</p>
               <p>As the Chase lies open are there not tracks going almost every way across the Chase there? - In different places there are.</p>
               <p>When you followed the tracks to this man's yard, did the tracks go into the yard? - We followed the tracks up to the gate and when they came to the gate, going into the yard it is a very hard stony gravel, there the track was lost.</p>
               <p>Is there any way through Mr. Hall's yard? - None on the other side at all, I am pretty sure.</p>
               <p>How far from the prisoner's gate is the ground hard so that you lost the track? - Not more than twice the length of my stick, it is only just the gateway.</p>
               <p>Did you look about Mr. Hall's yard or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178001120061"/>beyond it to see whether the tracks began again and went farther? - We did, but could not find any tracks; when we went into the yard Mr. Hall was at work in the yard; the prosecutor said to him what have you been at, Mr. Hall, you have been robbing me; he said no I have not been robbing you; the prosecutor said I am very certain of it; I have suspected you a great while, but could not find it out before; we have traced the cart all the way to your yard door; he positively denied it; the prosecutor turned round to come out of the yard and he saw some wood lie piled up; he examined it and found this piece of wood among it.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Hall present at the same time? - Yes; Mr. Hall freely gave him leave to take this piece of wood away.</p>
               <p>Was there any cart there? - Yes; there was a body of a cart and a pair of six-inch wheels; I measured them.</p>
               <p>Could you discern distinctly from the tracks whether it was a four or a two wheel cart? - I could discern very distinctly that it was a two wheel cart.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A herdsman to the parish of Edmonton, to look after the wood and the cattle.</p>
               <p>You have an allowance for that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>There is a considerable quantity of wood? - There is.</p>
               <p>This happened in the month of December? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The chase was extremely wet at that time? - Yes; it was before the frost set in.</p>
               <p>What depth do you suppose this track you have been talking of might have been? - I cannot tell that; it varied in various places; in some places it was harder than others.</p>
               <p>Is there any great difference in the appearance of a track whether it is made to day or three or four days ago; can you by your eye undertake positively to swear to a fresh or an old track? - I can to a track that has gone across the other tracks, I could not upon the main road.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted in this chase there are a great many cross tracks? - There are so.</p>
               <p>Is it not possible for there to have been a track from Mr. Hall's yard up to the stack-wood, and for that to have broke into some other track that was upon the Chase; can you undertake to swear that the track was continued from Mr. Hall's gate to the stack wood, and did not break in upon any other track, and was it not possible to go from the house to the stack a different road? - Yes; many different roads.</p>
               <p>Court. Then there was no track leading from the house to the stack? - I never examined that.</p>
               <p>You must have seen it if there had been two? - No; he might possibly have gone different ways; there was but that one track all the way to his house.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Does it not follow that if the ground was so wet there must have been two tracks with the cart, one going the other coming back? - If he had gone that way there would.</p>
               <p>The wood in Hall's yard was lying open? - It was piled up in the yard, either in the shed or adjoining to it; it was no ways concealed.</p>
               <p>I think you said Hall voluntarily offered Bickley to take away this piece of wood? - Yes; Mr. Bickley when he examined the wood said, I suppose if I take away a piece of wood you will swear a robbery against me. Hall said no, he was welcome to take it. He asked Mr. Hall where he bought this wood? Mr. Hall said he bought it of one

               <p>Do you recollect any meeting that happened between Bickley, Hall, and you? - They met at Mr. Bickley's house to take into consideration the settling of it.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Hall then persevere in denying the charge Bickley had imputed to him? - He did to me.</p>
               <p>Were any terms proposed by Bickley to Mr. Hall to settle the business? - Hall asked Bickley what terms he would settle it upon? Bickley said if he would give him five pounds down and five pounds shortly afterwards. Hall said he would give him a note for five pounds, and another note twenty one days afterwards accordingly.</p>
               <p>Court. Tell me the very words Bickley said? - He said he would have ten pounds; five pounds down immediately, and Mr. Hall promised to give him five pounds in twenty one days after.</p>
               <p>Did Hall give him five pounds? - He could not then; Bickley accepted of his note till the Saturday.</p>
               <p>I understood you just now that Mr. Hall persevered in denying that he was guilty of the charge that was imputed to him? - He did.</p>
               <p>Then did it not appear to you a little extraordinary that he should consent to give the prosecutor ten pounds? - I cannot say his meaning for so doing.</p>
               <p>Was it through teriour of mind, or for what cause that he consented to pay this money? - I cannot say unless it was through fear of further trouble.</p>

               <p>From what did you make this copy? - I was desired to make a copy of the notes as nearly as I could; I made that from my memory.</p>
               <p>Then you could as well have told us from your memory what was the substance of the notes? - I can clearly recollect that is as exactly the copy of the notes as possible. (Repeats the notes from memory exactly as the copy.)</p>
               <p>This was on the 8th of this month? - Yes, that the first note came due.</p>
               <p>When were the notes given? - On the Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
               <p>That was the 5th or 6th? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then how came they to be dated upon the 8th? - They were so dated.</p>
               <p>Who desired them to be so dated? - Catlin told me to date them from the 8th; Catlin is bail with me.</p>
               <p>After these two notes were given to Bickley, what further conversation passed? - He said we had done; accordingly Hall discharged the reckoning; it came to eleven shillings and ten-pence the whole day's expence.</p>
               <p>Was you present when Hall went to pay the first note to Bickley? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you present when these notes were burnt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was that? - The day before yesterday.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - We were then coming to town to Hicks's-hall; this was at the Bell and Hare, at Tottenham; Mr. Bickley and Catlin went into a parlour, where there was a fire; Catlin asked if we would not go into a little room, as we had no call to tell our business to people that were in the tap-room; we went into the parlour; Bickley pulled out the note, he shewed me the notes, and asked me if I knew them; I said they were my hand writing; he gave them to Catlin, the constable, and the constable put them into the fire.</p>
               <p>Was it by the directions of Bickley that they were burnt? - He did not positively tell him to burn them in my hearing.</p>
