            . On the 25th of last month, between the hours of one and two at night, I was going to my lodging in Covent-Garden; but it raining very hard I was obliged to stand up, and got upon the steps of a night cellar in the <placeName id="t17441017-1-crimeloc4">Strand</placeName>

I said, I only stood up for the rain; but thinking she expected I should call for something, I said, bring me a pint of beer, and then I shall give you no offence: she would have pulled me down stairs, but I did not care to go down. The pint of beer was brought, I called a watchman and gave it to him, and he called a link-boy to drink with him, and asked me if I did not want a link. I said I did not want a link: the watchman said you are very safe, you may step down and stay till the rain is over. I believe I went down two or three steps, and staid about five minutes; I found the rain ceased, and went homeward. About three or four perch from the place I met the two Prisoners, and they said, Sir, where are you going? I said, I don't want any thing with you; they laid hold of me, and began to pull me and hustle me, and riot me to pieces; in the struggle I missed my stock and clasp, said I, You damned jades what do you rob me of my stock? For I missed my stock; but it is possible in the struggling with them that it might fall off, for it has fell off my neck two or three times as I have been at my work. - I missed it about three minutes after the struggle began; I put my hand up to my hat and wig to secure them, and called out watch, upon which Page run up an alley by Hungerford-Market, the watch and I followed her and took her, and Andrews was taken the next morning upon the steps of the Round-house in St. Martin's-Lane. - There was a Sailor with them but he got away.</p>

They were taken up, and my wife's two checquered aprons were found in the room where they lodged, between the bed and the sackings I asked Morris where the aprons were, and she said Sears had them to wash. - My wife is dead, and according to all accounts she died about three quarters of an hour after this thing was done.</p>

The little one (I think 'tis Sears ) would have turned evidence, but the Justice would not let her, for he said they were all equally guilty: they all confessed the robbery, Morris d - d her eyes and asked what I did there, and said that Simms and Sears robbed the woman, and Sears said that she stood by while Simms and Morris robbed her; one of them said, What a fine ride we shall have, and another said, G - d d - n your eyes what do you laugh at.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Morris. We found the things; I was coming along and kicked them before me, and never opened them till I came into Mrs. Terry's house, and there were several people there playing at cards.</p>
               <p>Terry. I had no foul in the house but one man, and I was afraid to speak to them upon that account. <rs id="t17441017-3-verdict20" type="verdictDescription">

I looked through the key hole and saw two men in the house, one of them was dressed in grey, the Prisoner is the other. They presently opened the door and rushed out of the house. I laid hold of the Prisoner by the breast of the coat and said, Sir, you shall tell me how you got into the house, for I have the key in my hand; the Prisoner got from me and run away. I went to the end of the court and cried stop thief! He fell down flat upon his breast in the lane, and got up again; the neighbours run after him and he was taken. - There was nobody in the house - The doors and windows were all secured when I went out, and when I came home the door was either locked or bolted on the inside.</p>

            . I sell fruit just by Mr. King's shop; I saw the Prisoner lay himself over the shop window, and he seemed as if he had been a little in liquor. I did not much like him, so I watched him and saw him put two books into his bosom. I did not interrupt him at all, and presently he took a third and went away. Then I left my stall and took hold of him, and said he must come back with me. I carried him to Mr. King, and said, Mr. King, here's a customer for you, and took these three books from him: then he began to be very obstreperous and fell a beating me, but I did not mind that, for he had not strength enough to hurt me; and as I was going out of the shop he drew his knife to stab Mr. King: Then I went in again and he tried to bite me, and tried to bite every body; then we tied his arms, and he kicked like fury and swore most desperately, and said, You old rogue, if ever I am let loose again, I'll be the death of you and your wife too.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by these knives?</p>
               <p>Henderson. I felt something about him, and took these knives out of his pocket; I searched him farther, and took 3 s. 6 d. and five pennyworth of halfpence out of his pocket, and then he cried he was robbed. <rs id="t17441017-5-verdict33" type="verdictDescription">

We were afraid to break open the door, for some persons in Field's house held candles out of the window and showed cutlasses to us in order to terrify us, and threw brickbats and glass bottles at us (as I imagine) and other things that they could<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170006"/> find. Then the mob began to rise upon us; there were but three or four of them at first, and one of them in particular came behind me and shoved me, in order to shove me down. I said, Who are you that offers to shove any body here; I took hold of him and said, Let us see who you are. I spoke to the Constable and he took charge of him, but the mob afterwards increased so great, that the Constable was obliged to let him go. - They call him Lippy, he has a hare lip.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you to Field's?</p>
               <p>Forfar. There were Mr. Blewmire , Mr. Montgomery, myself, and three more.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after?</p>
               <p>Forfar . After the mob had increased so much and were so outragious, the Constable and his assistants went away, and left only Mr. Montgomery and myself. He was cut down the coat, and went under a shell belonging to the next house to shelter himself; seeing none but him I was willing to get away as well as I could: them one of the fellows presented a musket to me, and said he would shoot me. I said, Take care what you do, for if you miss me I will not miss you; then I pulled out a pistol and presented it at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you presented your pistol before?</p>
               <p>Forfar. I had not, I had it in my breast; when I saw that Mr. Montgomery was attacked, I endeavoured to defend him as well as I could, (and he told me he was hard attacked) but he got into a house and so escaped from them: then seeing all my friends gone, I made the best of my way to Cow-Cross; when I came just by the White-Lion in Clerkenwell, Wells cut me on the top of the head with a cutlass and desperately wounded me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he assault you for?</p>
               <p>Forfar. I don't know for what: after Wells had wounded me, the whole mob got about me, knocked me down, cut me in several places, and stabbed me in the shoulder, my coat was cut in several places. I was very saint with the great loss of blood, and was carried home for dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Name the persons that assaulted you?</p>

            . On Sunday the 23d of September, I was coming from St. Giles's church, between 12 and one, after chapel was done. I was a going home to dinner, and just by <placeName id="t17441017-8-crimeloc53">Newton Street</placeName>

I said, I did not know of any, he must go to some intelligence office. He asked me what countryman I was, I said I was a Herefordshire man. he said he was of that country too. Said he, I have been in London about a month, I am very poor. I have no money at all. But when we came to Newton-Street, he said, I have one penny. I'll be a penny to your half-penny, and we'll go and drink together. He said he had a thing which he wanted me to read.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any thing?</p>
               <p>Price. No, he did not shew me any thing at all. I thought it was a letter he wanted me to read. I said I would not go and drink with him that way, for I knew it to be a very bad place, I said if he would go with me any other way, I would go and drink a pot with him. When we were going down Newton-Street, he took hold of me, and begged me to come on, says he, Here's another man following me, I have found a thing, and he wants it, but if you will come along with me I'll shew it you. - There was a person behind, and he said to the Prisoner, Young man will you take a crown more than I offered you. The Prisoner said, For God's sake come on, this man will not let me alone, let us go into some house or other, and I'll tell you what this man is about. He offered me his waistcoat all in gold, [his gold waistcoat] his hat and wig, and 15 s. in money for the things I have found. Said I, how for are you a going this way? He said, just by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hawl you, or force you along?</p>
               <p>Price. Not in a forcible way. Then he carried me to

Just as the Prisoner got me into the entry, as I was going in at a door into the kitchen, a man came up to me, and they forced me along the entry into a room backwards. The prisoner took me to the other end of the room, and the other fellow stood at the door. Then the prisoner said he would shew me what he had found, and pulled a ring out of his pocket, and said, This is the thing I found, which that man offered me all the money and things for that I told you of; and asked me if I would read the Posey upon the ring, and I would not read it. Then he called the other man to read it: I love none, but you alone. Then he put his hand into his pocket, and said, he had another of them. He said, As you are my countryman, if you have a mind to have these two rings you shall have them. Then he began to ask me what I had about me, and whether I had money to pay for those two gold rings. I said I did not want any gold rings. He look'd at my shoe buckles to see whether they were silver, and looked at my stock buckle, and buttons, and he asked how much money I had about me, I said about ten shillings. Then he said could give him my shoe buckles, and stock bucd buttons , and the ten shillings, I should have the two gold rings, which were worth five pounds me . I told him I would not have them upon any account: he said they were gold. I said, If they are gold you did not come honestly by them. Then he cused me . He pressed me two or three times to take them, and I told him I would not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170009"/> have them. Then he swore that I should have the rings, and he would take the things. When he found I would not take the rings, he took off my hat directly, then my wig, and stock buckle. (he left my stock in the window) Then he said, Now I must have your money. When he said that, I was so frightened, that I thought I was in danger of my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other man all this while?</p>
               <p>Price. He stood at the door with a stick in his hand. - The other man said he would have my money, so I thought I had better give it them than run the risque of my life, and I pulled out the money my self.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them the money?</p>
               <p>Price. No, I did not give them the money; the Prisoner took the purse out of my hand with the money in it. - I think there were 10 s. in the purse. After he had got those things, and the money, he said, Here are the two gold rings for you, but I would not touch them. When he found I would not take the rings, he laid them down upon the window in a paper, and went away directly. Then I thought as he was gone, it was proper to take the rings, in order to shew to people. - I h ave not got the rings.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they gold rings?</p>
               <p>Price. No, they were nothing but brass. When I went home to my master's, ( - I am a smith) I complained how I was served, and got a warrant to take up the woman of the house, and the Prisoner; and she said, if you will be quiet I will get you your things again, and a girl brought to my master's house my hat and wig, and every thing but my money. So by the persuasion of the constable, and my master, who thought his life in danger, I took the things again and said no more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the prisoner's name?</p>
               <p>Price. The girl said it was Country Dick who took the things.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you make any noise, when you were robbed?</p>
               <p>Price. No, I did not make any great noise.</p>

               <p>Price. No, I did not drink a drop.</p>

            , Constable. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I know the Prisoner at the bar to be a very notorious man. Last Monday was se'nnight we had a general privy search night. Upon searching a house at the end of Church-Lane, in St. Giles's, the sign of the Harp and Pound. about 11 at night, going up stairs on the left hand there was a little bed, I put my hand into it, it was warm as if somebody had just been in it. I went up two pair of stairs, and there was a room with three beds upon the ground, with one man in each bed, and I searched under the beds to see if there were any arms, after every body was gone out of the room, except a soldier and myself. Says the soldier, here's a closet you have not searched yet. No more I have, said I. I put my hand in, and felt something like linen, I pulled it to me, imagining it to be something of linen hanging in the closet, and it tore. Upon examining it, I found it to be the slap of a shirt. I put my hand in again and pulled the Prisoner's head out at the door, then I called out, and said, Gentlemen, I have got hold of a fellow, who is a common rescuer of Prisoners, and pulled him quite out. His shirt was tore, and I had the slap in my hand. I wanted to see him with his hat on, for I knew him by the cock of his hat. When he had it on, said I, You are the person who sent me word, you would blow my Brains out, and I said, Now I have a mind to blow your Brains out, and I secured him. Next morning he was examined before two of the Justices, and who should come in but the young man that he robbed, (

            .) Said he, I know that man. Said I, Do you know Country Dick? Yes, said he, He robbed me of my hat, wig, and other things, and 10 s. in money, said I, I am glad I have got him. And as Price was giving an account of the 10 s. he had in his purse; says Country Dick, there was but 8 s. 6 d. in it. Then, said I, You have done for yourself now. I would advise you to turn Evidence and save your neck, for I was sensible he belonged to a great gang, and he gave me informations of several, whose names I have in my pocket; which he did in hopes of being made an Evidence. I went afterwards to him in Newgate, and told him I believed there was one or two he had given me information of, that I had got, and if he had a mind to make himself an Evidence he might. Then he said, I don't know any thing of the matter, you made me drunk among you, that I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Constable says I wanted to make myself an Evidence, and gave an information against some Persons. I told him of two or three that were concerned with me in selling * Rings, but as to robberies I never was concerned in any. <rs id="t17441017-8-verdict54" type="verdictDescription">

            . On the 15th of September in the evening, I was at Mr. Jones's smoking a pipe with Mr. Barney. Serjeant Wackett was there, and had 2 or 3 pints of been before the Prisoner came in. When the Prisoner came in he said he was very glad to see the deceased, and they seemed very glad to see one another. The Prisoner was for going away several times, but one Lloyd said he should not go, and said, Clem sit down. (the Prisoner was very much suddled when he came in) After that the Prisoner and the deceased had some discourse about a Corporal's, or a Private Man's duty, or some misdemeanors in the regiment. The deceased said, let it all drop, we'll have it decided by the Captain, on the parade to-morrow. Some time after the Prisoner said to the deceased, Sam lend me half a crown; the deceased said, Poh! Poh! you don't want money; the Prisoner said, I do want money, lend me half a crown. The deceased put his hand in his pocket and threw half a crown down. Then the Prisoner said to the deceased, Do you know God? The deceased said, I hope I do. The Prisoner said, God pay you, or God will pay you, and then they all three went out of the house together. This was about 11 o'clock. It was not long before they came in again, then the Prisoner asked for some brandy or rum, the deceased said he would drink no drams, if they had any thing, they would have a tankard of beer, which they had. Mr. Jones and I were playing a game at draughts. The Prisoner and deceased were in a box by themselves; presently I heard Mrs. Jones cry out, There will be murder. I looked and saw a small sword in the Prisoner's hand drawn; the deceased turned himself round and said, The villain has stabbed me; then the deceased turned about and gave the Prisoner a cut in the back.</p>
               <p>Q. When you turned about first, after you heard the deceased say, the villain has stabbed me, was his hanger drawn, or had he it by his side?</p>
               <p>Holden. He had it by his side - When the deceased first cried out, he had it by his side; and I saw him draw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner stab the deceased?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170011"/>Holden. I did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see first?</p>
               <p>Holden. The first thing I saw was the small sword drawn in the Prisoner's hand I would not hurt any one, I would speak the truth, and no more than the truth God knows.</p>

             called again .</p>
               <p>Pris. Council. You hear this man says the deceased was stabbed, before the hanger was drawn, was it so or not?</p>
               <p>Jones. The cut on the Prisoner's back was given before the deceased clapped his hand upon his belly, and said, The villain has stabbed me.</p>
               <p>Pris. Council. Will you take upon you to say the deceased's hanger was drawn then, and he made no use of it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Jones. His hanger was drawn, when he said he was stabbed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Holden. Did you hear any challenge given?</p>
               <p>Holden. I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hewitt, (Surgeon.) I was sent for to the deceased, he had a wound between the third and fourth ribs, which penetrated into the Cavity of the belly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that wound the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I opened the body, and I found a vast quantity of bloody matter in the belly, which came from the wound, which was the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Pris. Council. Can you give any opinion as to the nature of the wound, how it was given, or in what position the deceased was?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . It appears to me, that as the deceased was a right handed man, that the wound could not be given when he was upon his guard. - The wound was on the left side of the belly. Upon opening the body, I examined the Spleen and Kidney , and I can't say positively, whether the Spleen , or the Kidney was wounded; but I think the Spleen was wounded.</p>
               <p>Pris. Council. Supposing two men had stood directly facing one another, quarrelling; do you think they could have given such a wound as that?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. Indeed, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the Prisoner any wound?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. The Prisoner had a wound back .</p>
               <p>Q. Was that a cut or a stab?</p>
               <p>Hewitt. I took it to be a stab, from the nature of the wound, for it had first penetrated, and then turned round; to the best of my remembran deceased said it was a stab. - I was sent for that night, about a quarter of an hour after the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the deceased live afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . From the Saturday evening, to the Friday se'nnight following. He desired I would attend him, and so did his colonel. As to the Prisoner, he was left to the care of the Surgeon of the Regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased tell you the occasion of it?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . He told me he and his comrade had some words about a private man's doing his duty, but had agreed in the end, and were very good friends. But returning again to drink something , they received the dispute. The deceased was for bringing it before the colonel, and that exasperated the Prisoner, and he challenged him, and upon his challenging him, the deceased said, Then turn out .</p>
               <p>Q. Was the deceased in great danger from the first?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . He was in extream danger, and I thought there was occasion to call in more Surgeons , I mentioned the Surgeon General, but the Colonel said he was satisfied with me; however I took that Gentleman with me for my further satisfaction with relation to the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased desire you to dress the Prisoner's wound first?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . He desired me to take care of his comrade , for he had a value for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the deceased say, with relation to any complaint of the Prisoner's behaviour or usage?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . He said the Prisoner stabbed him first.</p>
               <p>Q. What before his hanger was drawn?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . He did not say any thing of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any complaint of any foul practice , or proceeding, or did he say it was a fair quarrel?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . He did not say much of that to me, but I think , if any thing, he complained of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say the Prisoner had murdered him?</p>
               <p>Hewitt . I don't know that he said any thing of that .</p>

               <p>Mrs. Jones. When the Prisoner, the deceased, and Lloyd came into our house the second time, the Prisoner called for a quartern of brandy or rum, and the deceased said if he drank any thing he would have beer.

             . The 27th of June in the morning I heard a noise in the house, and came down and found a hole in one of the shutters of my shop, which had been made by a nail piercer. The glass was broke, and several pair of never buckles, with two gold cane heads were taken away. - My dwelling house is the corner of <placeName id="t17441017-10-crimeloc68">Pallmall</placeName>

On the 30th of July my man told me he believed he had got the person who had stole my goods, and Mr. Chidleigh one of the Constables of St. James's told me he believed he had got a man who had some of my buckles, who was taken attempting to break open a house: I found some of my buckles, two pair of shoe buckles, and two pair of knee buckles, but the marks were pretty near taken out of them. The Constable and I went to the Round house where the Prisoner was confined, and I was confounded at the thing, upon account of the number of people that appeared for him, and the appearance that he made himself. He told me the place where he lodged, upon which I got a warrant from Justice Fraser to search his lodgings, and upon searching them I found two ivory hook heads for canes, which I believed to be mine, but the man [Prisoner] was such a concern to me, that I would not be positive to them; but upon opening another drawer, I found some childrens metal toys [a metal castor and a metal cup] (and saucer, and a metal teapot, which is not mentioned in the indictment) which I am certain are mine, for I made them several years ago, and there were none of them made before nor since; they are marked at the bottom with the two initial letters of my name, I have had them a good many years and never sold any of them. We took the things with us and went to the Round-house again, and carried the Prisoner before Justice Fraser. When I mentioned the buckles to him, he said he was a person that dealt in that way, and I find he is a Jeweller; then I produced these little toys and the ivory hook heads (then I was sure to the ivory heads, though I was doubtful about them before) he said he had bought them, and should be able to make it appear who he bought them of upon his trial. He had a pair of silver buckles in his shoes such as I lost of my workman's make. I have since had some of the goods brought me by other people, who will declare they had them of him.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170013"/> I think I can take upon me to say I saw the silver buckles in my shop the day before, because I had shewn them to a customer: and when I looked at a pair of silver buckles he had in the knees of his breeches , he said, they are not yours, no more they were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How do you know these buckles are yours?</p>
               <p>Pinchbeck . I don't say I am positive they are mine, for my workman works for other people; the marks were filed out.</p>

             . On the 30th of June I was at the watchouse, and Mr. Hill of Pallmall brought the Prisoner into the watchouse, and charged him with breaking his shop. I took him into custody and put him into the hold, and hearing that Mr. Pinchbeck's shop was broke open before, thinks I, this is the gentleman, though he looks like a gentleman; he threatened me very much, and said he was a gentleman, and then a Jeweller. I said I would lock him up, but I searched him fi rst for fear he should have any pistols, and I found these buckles; said I, You look very much like a gentleman because you have so many buckles, I take these to be Mr. Pinchbeck's buckles. I took this saw from him, and the teeth of the saw were as full of deal sawdust as they could hold, which I believe came out of Mr. Pinchbeck's shutter with his boring the holes; these are the gimblets which he made use of, this is the piercer he bored Mr. Hill's shutter with. I went to Mr. Hill's and fitted it to the holes in the shutter, and it fitted as near as could be. - I am in the building way: I went to Mr. Pinchbeck's on the Saturday morning between one and two o'Clock, and his man got up; I told him I believed I had got the thief who robbed his master, and he was then in the Round-house . I shewed him the buckles, and he positively said he could swear to them. I put this nail piencer into the holes which were made in Mr. Pinchbeck's window shutter, and it fitted as well as a nail piercer could do: he had ripped down the holes with a small saw, till he had got a piece out; this is the piece of wood which fitted the hole in Mr. Pinchbeck's window shutter, I fitted it to the hole myself. [There was a piece of the window shutter produced, about 4 or 5 inches square.]</p>

             . I am a servant to Mr. Pinchbeck , this piece of wood is part of my master's window shutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it?</p>
               <p>Pugh. I found it in the hole it was taken from - Loose in the hole - The shutters were all whole after it was dark.</p>
               <p>Chidleigh . When this piece of wood was put to the shutter, then the holes appeared, for they were all bored before it was cut out; it was bored either with a gimblet or a spike bit. - Tis a spike bit, we tried several of the holes, and this spike bit was as full of the saw dust which seemed to come out of that shutter as could be. I said to Mr. Pinchbeck it is the best way to get a search warrant; we got a search warrant and searched his lodgings, and there we found these things: there were some metal toys which Mr. Pinchbeck swore to, and one ivory hook head he was positive to, because part of it was broke off by an accident, [the goods were produced.]</p>
               <p>Pinchbeck . These buckles are the same make as mine, but I can't positively swear to them, there were a great many chases of buckles found in the Prisoner's room, but the silver was all gone: we found two small files and a burnisher, which are used in taking out names and marks.</p>
               <p>Chialeigh. Mr. Pinchbeck's man said before the Justice, that the Prisoner had a pair of buckles in his shoes which were his master's, and he said may be there may be another pair in his knees, and the Prisoner said, they are not yours. Mr. Pinchbeck's man took out one of them, and it was not his master's: then the Prisoner was carried to Clerkenwell Bridewell, and he said he would endeavour to make friends with Mr. Pinchbeck to find the bill Ignoramus, and then he should be saved. I said he should send what goods he could of Mr. Pinchbeck's to him, and that would be the way to make Mr. Pinchbeck his friend (there were several of the goods sent to Mr. Pinchbeck) when I advised him to that, he said he would; and that he had ordered several people, particularly Mr. Bell a Taylor and his washerwoman, to carry some things to him. He desired I would recommend it to Mr. Pinchbeck to be easy with him, and he would get all the things again that he could, and make satisfaction for what goods he could not recover by raising friends, and said he hoped I would not be his enemy. I said it was not in my power to help him; he said, O Lord! what a sad thing it is that I have happened to light upon such a Constable that was so hard: I asked him if he had any confederates, he said he had none; said I, You must have some confederates to receive your goods, you should impeach them; he said he had nobody to impeach, there was no soul concerned with him, and he was a very unhappy man to fall into such hands as would not shew him mercy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came you to go to Mr. Pinchbeck to enquire about me concerning this matter?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170014"/>Chidleigh . I don't live above a dozen doors from Mr. Pinchbeck. I had matched this piece of wood to the window shutter the day before, and I said I would look out, and may be I might find the person that did it.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you find that the house was broke open?</p>
               <p>Pugh. About two o'clock in the morning, I found the shutter broke, the glass of the window broke, and the show glass broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the show glass stand?</p>
               <p>Pugh. It stood I believe about three inches on the right hand of the hall, just on the inside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner do you think he took these goods out?</p>
               <p>Pugh. To be sure he must take them out with his hand, and he could by putting his hand in at the hole, take them out of the show glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the things directly after you observed the shop to be broke open?</p>
               <p>Pugh. I missed no more than one gold cane head at first; I called my master about a quarter after two, but did not miss the things directly: my master went to bed again, but I would not go to bed, and when my master came down, we missed the rest of the things, this castor and cup were missing - They are my master's: I took a pair of my master's buckles out of the Prisoner's shoes before the Justice, I believe these are my master's buckles.</p>
               <p>Chidleigh. These are the buckles which were taken out of the Prisoner's shoes before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Pugh . The Prisoner sent these silver buckles to Mr. Pinchbeck by his washerwoman Mrs. Prees.</p>
               <p>Jaquelin Prees. I had these two pair of silver buckles from the Prisoner at the bar, which he gave me in part of payment for some money he owed me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What did the chairman say to you against me, when I was taken up?</p>
               <p>Chidleigh. He said you were leaning against Mr. Hill's window shutters, and he thought you intended to do something you should not do, and stood a little on one side to watch, and heard the shutter crack, and then he came up to you and you run away, then he made a run at you and you fell down and he fell over you: he said you dropped the nail piercer and he took it up.</p>

             (a Chairman.) On the 30th of June I was in Pallmall about one o'clock in the morning, I was about twenty yards off the Prisoner, and he was stooping against a shutter. I came up a little nearer to him and heard the shutter crack: he was then standing upright, and I believe he saw me; then he went behind the lamp post at the next door, I went up to him in order to lay hold of him, and heard something drop, what it was I could not then tell, but I afterwards found a nail piercer; then I called the watchman, and kept the Prisoner till the watchman came to me, the Prisoner made an attempt to get away from the watchman; I run after him again and he fell down, I must either have tumbled over him or have fell upon him, if I had not stepped over him. Then the watchman came up and gave the rails a knock with his staff and said, I have done for him now, he'll never run again: the watchman thought he had struck him, but he only hit the rails: then I knocked at Mr. Hill's door and shewed him the place the Prisoner had been attempting to break open; he had bored 13 holes in the shutters. We carried him to the Round-house, and Mr. Hill searched the Prisoner and found two pair of silver buckles upon him; he asked him what he was, he said he was a Jeweller by trade, and that he made buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the nail piercer?</p>
               <p>Knox. As near as I can guess about six yards from the place where the holes were bored, and the Constable tried whether the nail piercer fitted the holes, and nothing could fit better. When the Prisoner was before the Justice next day, he was asked how he came by the buckles; he said he bought them, and if we would let him alone for three or four days, he would find the man he bought them of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He says he was in Pallmall, ask him how he could see me, as he was on the other side of the way in Pallmall and the street is so broad?</p>
               <p>Knox . There were two lamps, and by the light of the lamps I saw him leaning against the shutter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have persons in Court to prove that I have bought buckles and deal in buckles, all the rest is a malicious prosecution. I don't know whether 'tis for the sake of the reward or what, I can't tell, I can prove that I bought the things.</p>

            . I lived at the Mitre tavern in the Strand - I kept the house. About the 28th of June - it was on a Friday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock, the Prisoner and another person came in and called for a pint of white wine. I went into the room where they were, and saw a tea kettle and lamp stand upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a tea kettle was it?</p>
               <p>Hewson . A little doll's thing.</p>

               <p>Hewson. Gold, I took them to be.</p>
               <p>Q. What else was there?</p>
               <p>Hewson. There were a coffee pot, a pepper castor, a sugar castor, a cup, a saucer, and I believe about a dozen and a half of silver buckles; I took the tea kettle in my hand and asked if it was gold, and one of them said it was metal gilt.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing that passed relating to these things?</p>
               <p>Hewson. I saw the Prisoner at the bar give the other person five guineas, and the person he gave it to said he would not have taken it, if he had not been very much put to it for money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the money?</p>
               <p>Hewson. Yes, I saw him take the money into his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember the day so particularly?</p>
               <p>Hewson. It was the day to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing particular to remember it by?</p>
               <p>Hewson. I remember it for a very good reason, because I left the house the Wednesday after.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you kept the house?</p>
               <p>Hewson. Not above three months. I never lived in London before I took that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a husband?</p>
               <p>Hewson. Yes - he is in the army - he is at Plymouth now.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to keep the house but three months?</p>
               <p>Hewson. I took it by the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the toys you saw at your house?</p>

               <p>- Harrach. I have known the Prisoner about four or five years, and believe him to be as honest a man as any in England. He always had a good character, he has had goods of me upon return; - and what he did not sell he returned very justly; if I had thought he had been a rogue, I would not have dealt with him. - He was a <rs id="t17441017-10-deflabel69" type="occupation">jeweller</rs>

I told him I would not give it him, unless he was a better man than I; he said if I did not he would blow my brains out. I took hold of the gun, and shook the gun in his hand in great hopes it would have gone off. After I had disputed a great while with him, he bid me go about my business, or he would blow my brains out. Then I watched him, in hopes<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170016"/> some body would come up, and I got a watchman afterwards and secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a gun with him then?</p>
               <p>Norman. He had not a gun then, but I bid the watchmen look into the quarters as far as they supposed a person could throw a gun, and I believed they would find it; they looked for it there, and there they found it. - I am sure he is the man, for we were under a lamp, and he was hardly out of my sight till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I desire you would enquire into the character of the Prosecutor, for he bears a very good character in Newgate, he has been in Newgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been confined in Newgate?</p>
               <p>Norman. I was, but it was only for a quarrel, in a publick house, for assaulting Mr. Hunt, a Beadle, in one of the hospitals; I was removed from the Poultry Counter there.</p>

I went to the walk that goes from Old Bethlehem, and asked for our watchmen. I stood there a little while, and the Prisoner (as I think by his voice) called hollo! and I said, hollo! the Prisoner came running without hat or wig. I asked the Prosecutor, and the watchmen if they had seen any body, they said no. I said there was a little man run by, and run up Fore-street. I asked the Prosecutor how he was served, his name, and where he lived, and he told me. I said, you seem to be an honest sort of a man, I'll go out again and see for him; and as I was going from the watch-house, the Prisoner came back again from that place where he had passed me; said I, There's the man; I went to the corner of Little Moorfields, and called after him, and said, I want to speak a word with you ; said I, What business are you; he said, I am a shaggreen-case-maker, I live in Fell street , in Wood-street; said I, This is an odd time of night to be out . I said to Mr. Norman, is this the man, Mr. Norman said, That is the man; the Prisoner asked him what he charged him with, he said he would tell him when he came before a justice, but the Prisoner insisted upon knowing what he charged him with; he said, with assaulting him with an intent to rob him; I said, if Mr. Norman charged me with him, he must go to the Counter; Mr. Norman said, If you will let the watchman go, I believe they will find the gun pretty near the rails; they went out and found it pretty near the rails, and came with it to the watch-house, in about eight minutes and when it was brought in, I said, Now, Mr. Harris, what do you think of that; but I thought it odd that he should rob with such a long gun.</p>

            . I live in Fell-street - My husband is a Chimney-sweeper; the Prisoner has been a lodger in my house two years, and always behaved handsomly: he came in on the 17th of September between eight and nine at night very much in liquor, and sat himself down in a chair: he was so much in liquor that he could not sit in the chair, but laid down upon the boards, I thought to get him into his own room, but I could not: his wife and I went to bed, and left him in the kitchen; after the clock struck twelve, I said, Mrs. Harris, Let him lye there, and she said, so she would, for then he would be safe - What became of him afterwards I can't tell.</p>

I went out just at six o'clock in the morning, and left no body in the house but the Prisoner, and some sailors, one was called Davy; and when I came home she was reading a news paper; said I, I am robbed; says she, How can you be robbed? I sent for my husband, and when he came, I said, John, I am robbed, I am robbed of all I have in the world; all my husband's wigs and hats were gone, of which my husband had four; she gave me this wig of my husband's. She would have gone out of the house, and said, who dare touch her. She said, it was impossible I should be robbed for no body else had been there, and she had not been out all day long. She said afterawards she had given these things to Davy; for he lay with her ever since she had been in the house, which was about a month.</p>

He knows I had received 112 l. and upwards, for a little estate in the country, and I suppose he wanted some of it. I kicked Keene in the face, and I served a warrant upon him, and the Alderman I carried him before, said I had served him right if I had kicked his brains out; he cursed me, and said in a little time I should have no money, nor my wife should have no fine cloaths, nor no rings.</p>

            . I lost two chissels and a plain, Mr. Heybourne had lost some timber from a building in Duke-street Westminster, some of the pieces of wood I can swear to, one was the end of a girder.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find this wood?</p>
               <p>Gray. In a house where the Prisoner lodged, and there I found my tools.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going down stairs, and saw a man with two or three boards on his back, and he sat down in the yard; he desired I would let him leave them there, and he came two or three times after that with more, and desired I would let him set that bag of tools down, and I said yes, if you will be sure to come and fetch them again; and he said he would come in an hour and an half, but he did not come any more.</p>
               <p>Jury. What sort of wood were the pieces?</p>
               <p>Gray. They were oak?</p>
               <p>Q. What scantling were they of?</p>
               <p>Gray. They were nine inches square and two foot nine inches long.</p>
               <p>Jury. The Prisoner could hardly carry a piece of that weight.</p>

I saw my cheeks hang up to be sold at a smith's, in Red-Cross-Street, I cheapened them, and the smith asked me 4 s. for them, and said they were worth five. I asked him where he had them, for they were mine; he said he bought them about three weeks ago of a man with a parcel of iron; said I, that can't be for I have not lost them so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170020"/> long, upon which his wife came down, and said, No, you did not buy them, I bought them last week of a woman: she said she knew nothing of the woman; and the smith said, if I would give him the money they cost him, I should have them. I knew I must be at the charge of a warrant, and I said , I'll give you a shilling if you will let me have them again, and he let me have them. They sent to me afterwards, and said the same woman came and offered them a pair of cheeks, and a grate bar; I went there and the Prisoner owned the selling the cheeks, and that she had 15 d. for them.</p>

             . I had been at a house in Smithfield with a load of glass bottles; (I'll tell you the whole story from the beginning to the end) I was going through an alley, and in that alley three women laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what alley?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. An alley as you go down Holbourn, I don't know the name of the alley - They told me it was <placeName id="t17441017-22-crimeloc134">Black-Boy-Alley</placeName>

               <p>Q. Look at those two women, and see whether they are any of the women?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . These are the two women - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do to you?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . One of them put her hand in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them did that?</p>

             did; I had ten shillings in my pocket, wrapped up in a paper, and that was taken from me.</p>
               <p>Q. You may go nearer and look, if you are not sure. [The old man looked very stedfastly at her.]</p>
               <p>Hamilton . That is her, I know her. They throtled me, and after they had throtled me, she [Barefoot] took half a crown more from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Gwyn do, did she hold you?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . Three of them held me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Gwyn one of them?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . It was 12 o'clock in the day time.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it a bye alley, are not people walking backwards and forwards there?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . There were some people walking, but no body came to my assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when they took your money from you?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . They had dragged me into a house, and into a room, and took my money from me in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a publick house?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door open?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . The door was open when they drew me in.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . As soon as I was able I got into the street, and there was a Gentlewoman over-against the alley, that said I should have money from her to go before a Justice; so I got a warrant, and we took one of them in another house just by .</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take then?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. Gwyn .</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . Within half an hour, or an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any of the money?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . She had some of my money at the same time, I could swear to one piece, an half crown; I know the half crown. [The High Constable of Holbourn division produced the half crown.]</p>
               <p>Hamilton . This is the half crown - I know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170023"/> it by a little notch in it, I could not swear to the rest of the money; we carried her before a justice, and she was committed to Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the other taken?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . She was taken by the information of the accomplices.</p>
               <p>Barefoot. I was just come home with a basket of sisters , when the Constable took me. Do you know me?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . I did not know you when you first came up to me, but I knew you too well afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this done?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . Last Friday.</p>
               <p>Gwyn . Was I ever in your company, or ever drank any thing with you in my life?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. No, you never drank any thing with me.</p>
               <p>Gwyn . Did you ever see me before?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. No, I never did before, and it was too soon then.</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . I have a piece of ground adjoining to this place, where the Prosecutor was robbed; one of the Prisoners held him by the throat while the other picked his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this done?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . This was in Black-Boy-Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your piece of ground?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . It joins to the house, where this robbery was committed. I saw one of the women have him by the throat, and as soon as I saw it I went to his assistance; we had taken them all four if we had had any assistance. I am sure I have seen forty robberies committed in that place; has a very by place, I don't doubt but there have been 500 robberies committed there, and I believe some murders too if they were known, and I believe all the neighbours know it, there are neighbours to testify it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives in the house?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . It is an empty house, only they make use of it for this purpose. They pick up the men, carry them in there, and rob them, then beat them, and turn them about their business.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the Prosecutor by the throat?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . The woman in the blue gown, Barefoot .</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see that from your ground?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . I could see into the room as plain as I can see into this court.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade are you?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . I am a carpenter, I keep my timber there. If the men had not been taken out of the place by the Constables and Soldiers, I durst not have gone to have assisted this man.</p>
               <p>Barefoot. He only wants to take our lives away for the sake of the reward.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor was again directed to go up to the Prisoners, and look at them, to see if he was sure they were the persons.</p>
               <p>The Prosecutor went to the bar, and look'd hard at them, and said to Barefoot, You are the woman, you are indeed; if these were the last words I was to speak, these are the women that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the women was it that laid hold of you by the throat?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . That's the woman, [Barefoot.]</p>
               <p>Q. Who picked your pocket?</p>
               <p>Hamilton. The other woman, Gwyn.</p>
               <p>Justice Poulson said that was not the account he gave before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure which of the two Prisoners picked your pocket?</p>
               <p>Hamilton . To the best of my remembrance, she in the blue, [That was Barefoot .]</p>
               <p>Q. Who does this house belong to?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds. It belongs to one

               <p>- Reynolds . There are openings between the pales, that I can see as plain into that room as I can into this rt .</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure these are the two women you saw commit this robbery?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . I am sure these are the two women.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your yard distant from that room?</p>
               <p>- Reynolds . I believe about 7 feet.</p>
               <p>Barefoot . I asked Mr. Reynolds , whether he knew me, and he said he knew nothing of me; this is only because he owes me a spight for selling him some oisters . <rs id="t17441017-22-verdict135" type="verdictDescription">

We went to the Ale-house about nine o'clock, Mr. Townley went out to serve a warrant upon another person, and did not return till about 11 o'clock, and he was pretty much in liquor. Page wanted to go before the Justice to have the thing decided that night, and Townley said it was too late, and I said I believed it was not. Townley refused to take his word for his appearance in the morning, though he said he would leave 20 Guineas in his hand if he would take toward . Page went to the back door to make water , Long went to the door and caught hold of him by the coat, called him rascal, and son of a bitch, and said, What are you a going to make your escape ? Page said, I am no son of a bitch, I am an honest man, and have an honest wife, and several fine children . Upon that, Long shortened his cane and hit him several blows on the stomach and other parts; the deceased fell down upon the ground with these blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the blows given with violence?</p>
               <p>Tiller. They were given with great violence. Mr. Townley went to his bar and fetched out a short staff or truncheon, and gave him several blows upon the head?</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a Constable's staff?</p>
               <p>Tiller. It was a painted staff. Then the deceased begged for mercy, and said, for Christ's sake don't murder me. The widow and I fell down on our knees and begged for mercy. There was one

               <p>Q. Did she see her master do it?</p>
               <p>Tiller. She could not be off of seeing him do it, for she took the staff out of his hand. While she was trying to get the truncheon out of Mr. Townley's hand, Mr. Long, repeated a heavy blow upon the deceased's leg.</p>
               <p>Q. With what?</p>
               <p>Tiller . With a stick or a cane, I can't tell which - of a midling size.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he upon the ground all this time?</p>
               <p>Tiller. Yes, for he had not power to rise.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the last blow light?</p>
               <p>Tiller. Upon the left leg, about the ankle bone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it done with violence?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170026"/>Tiller . Really I think it was with a very good will that Mr. Long gave it, and in a few minutes after the blow was given, the deceased said Mr. Long had broke his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then?</p>
               <p>Tiller . Then Mr. Townley gave orders that the deceased should be carried to the Round-house. There were two men came to drag him out, and he said he could not go for his leg was broke; then they dragged him some doors from Mr. Townley's house, and

             said, Master his leg is broke, and then Mr. Townley came and blew out my candle.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did they carry him?</p>
               <p>Tiller. About seven or eight doors. Townley called me bitch, and bid me go home or he would do for me. Then the deceased's wife went to fetch her young child to lie there, for she was a Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get to the Round-house?</p>
               <p>Tiller. I can't tell, but I saw some men take him up to carry him there.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the house where this was done, to the Round-house?</p>
               <p>Tiller. I believe it is twice the length of the Old-Bailey-Yard, but I am not a judge of yards in this case.</p>
               <p>Q. What other blows were there given?</p>
               <p>Tiller. Long gave him several blows upon the back.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the deceased's leg was broke in Townley's house, I ask you whether or no he complained that his leg was broke, before he was carried out of the house?</p>
               <p>Tiller. He did indeed, and they dragged him seven or eight doors, and I pursued them with a candle in my hand; and Townley beat the deceased with the truncheon, and said he would make him walk.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part were these blows given him?</p>
               <p>Tiller. I believe they were upon his back.</p>

               <p>Tiller. He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. When he was carried to the Round-house, which of the Prisoners was there?</p>
               <p>Tiller. They ordered him to be locked up, and went away directly, they did not take any care at all of the Prisoner, and he was laid down upon the boards, and lay there for 3 or 4 hours.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of night was this?</p>
               <p>Peate . I believe it was about ten o'clock when they took them out of the house to go to Mr. Townley's house; after they came to Mr. Townley's house, Townley went out and Mr. Page thought it long that he did not come in to do them justice; at last Mr. Townley came in and the deceased got up, Mr. Long took hold of the flap of his coat and said, D - n you you son of a bitch where are you going? With that the deceased called him son of a bitch again, and said he was going to make water. Long said, What are you going to make your escape? No, says he, I am only going to make water. Mr. Long took his cane and punched him several times upon the breast, and with his pushing him the deceased fell backward, and Long lays on very hard with his cane, (I don't know whether it was a stick or a cane, for some sticks are painted and look like canes ) then Mr. Townley went to the bar for his truncheon and laid on very hard, so, I believe it was very hard, but I did not feel the blows; I said to the maid servant, for God's sake, my dear, beg your master to have mercy , and the poor girl came out of the bar and said, for God's sake Master, don't commit murder; then she went into the bar and he struck him again; then the girl came out of the bar again and got the truncheon from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the blows fall?</p>

               <p>Q. Was he standing or lying?</p>
               <p>Peate. No, he was down all the time, for they would not give him time to get up, and he could not get up.</p>

               <p>Peate. No, he did not indeed.</p>

             . On the 28th of September I was at Mr. Townley's, Mr. Long and the deceased had a few words, I don't know what: Mr. Long called him rascal, and fell a beating him with a cane; there was a little staff which Mr. Townley had, and he struck him with it, and they repeated their blows very often. Mr. Long the Beadle broke the deceased's leg with his walking cane, and beat him as he lay upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the leg broke?</p>
               <p>Mussell . It was broke by the bar, and afterwards they dragged him to the fire side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time was it between the beginning of this affair, and his leg being broke?</p>
               <p>Mussell. I believe about half an hour, or a quarter of an hour. - I can't tell how long, but I perfectly heard the bone snap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the deceased cry out that his leg was broke before Townley beat him, or after?</p>
               <p>Mussell. It was after.</p>

            . I am an assistant to the Constable of the night, he sent me to see for Mr. Long, I went to Mr. Long's house, and they said he was at Mr. Townley's; I went there and the deceased was lying upon the floor bleeding, and Mr. Townley's maid was there (if she is the maid) and she said to Mr. Townley, What, will you have murder done in the house? and the Shoemaker, I don't know his name [Savage] was paying off the deceased as he was lying upon the ground, and he did not stir at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Savage strike Page?</p>
               <p>Gasson . Yes, a great many times, and I received several blows myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he strike him with?</p>

               <p>Gasson. He was lying bleeding upon the floor, Mr. Townley pushed me on one side, and asked me what I struck his assistant for, for I really did strike his assistant on the head, and I said, Murder must not be committed in the house; I helped the deceased along as well as I could by the arm, and led him to the Round-House; when I had got him three or four doors from the house he complained that his leg was broke - I believe it was his left leg, I told Mr. Townley I believed his leg was broke: when he was in the Round-House Mr. Townley insisted that he should be put into the hold, and the Governor said he would not put him into the hold; and I went to one of the Overseers of the Poor to get a note to go to the Parish Surgeon to come to him; then Mr. Long came to the watch-house, and went to sleep, and Mr. Townley went to bed.</p>
               <p>Townley. Did you know any thing of the deceased before you came into my house?</p>

               <p>Gasson. I saw no body but Savage strike him.</p>
               <p>Townley. Was not you the first person that discovered his leg to be broke?</p>
               <p>Gasson. Indeed I was.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you made the discovery, had you got three doors or ten doors, or how many doors from the house?</p>
               <p>Gasson . It was about four doors from Mr. Townley's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him complain before he got out of the house?</p>
               <p>Gasson . No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Urias Caldwell. I went into Mr. Townley's for a halfpennyworth of tobacco, and saw the deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170029"/> lying upon the ground in the house, I had not been out of the house above a minute before I saw two men or more lugging him out of the house; they had not lugged him above two or three doors before he fell down and could not go any farther for his leg was broke. Mr.Townley came out and said, why don't you carry him along, and they said, Master, he says his leg is broke; Mr. Townley said, he shams it, I'll make him go, lift him up again, and punched him several times on the back with his short staff, and the man cried, don't murder me; then the men who had him under the arms pulled him a little more, then he fell down again, and the men lifted him up a second time: then Mr. Townley said again, he shams it, I'll make him go, and punched him again about his loins with his short staff.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it done with violence or gently?</p>
               <p>Caldwell. It was very hard to my knowledge, for I perfectly heard the sound of the blows; a woman who is one of the witnesses came by with a candle in her hand, and he called her bitch, and said I'll have you all by and by; then he fell down again, and one of the men who was lugging him along clapped his hand upon his leg and said his leg was broke. Then Townley said, take him upon one of your backs and carry him to the Round-House; when he was there a woman who had his head in her lap said to him, if you should do otherwise than well who do you lay your death to? He said to Mr. Townley and Mr. Long, and their assistant.</p>

            . May it please your Lordship and you Gentlemen of the Jury, on Wednesday the 19th of September the deceased was brought to St. Bartholomew's hospital, and on the 28th died; and I was in hopes there would have been a good care , for four days things went on well, but on Saturday about four o'clock the sister of the ward sent to my house to inform me that he was in convulsions; when I saw him I was surprized there should be such an alteration in two or three hours. She said somebody had been to see him, and had frightened him and put him into a disorder, by telling him his children were carried to the workhouse. I took all the care of him that I was capable of. He had a wound in his head, and for my satisfaction after his death I opened his skull, and there was no concussion or fracture which occasioned his death. As to the leg, the fracture was so oblique that it might be done by falling down, and not by the blow of a cane.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the wound on his head was the occassion of his death?</p>
               <p>Phillips. No, I do not think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the broken leg the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Phillips . I cannot say it was, for I was in hopes that no dangerous symptoms appearing, he would have done well.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a fever?</p>
               <p>Phillips. He had from Saturday a great fever upon him, great tremor, and was delirious.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his death owing to?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I believe it was owing to the fever.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not such usage as this produce a fever?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, to be sure it might, but be pleased to take the other circumstances with it, that he lived four days, and had all the good symptoms that could be expected.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any fever for the first 4 days?</p>
               <p>Phillips. No more than he ought to have, for there must be always a proper heat allowed, in order for the cure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not this usage, in your opinion, hasten his death?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I am ready to think, as he continued so long with good symptoms, that this fever arose from a second cause.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not a fright occasion this fever and convulsions?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, I do really think a fright might throw him into those convulsions.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think this fright in other circumstances, would have occasioned such a fever?</p>
               <p>Phillips. I cannot assert that.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon the whole, whether in your opinion, this usage did, supposing it to be true, hasten his death or no?</p>
               <p>Phillips. Yes, I believe it did.</p>

               <p>Pris. Council. Where did he attempt to go?</p>
               <p>Winship . He attempted to go into the street, and then Mr. Long took hold of the skirt of his coat, and Mr. Page was very rustical, snatched Long's cane out of his hand, and struck my master with it; that was the first blow which was given on either side; then my master went to sit down again, and he resisted still.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he resist?</p>
               <p>Winship . He struggled, and my master struggled with him, and held him, and in came the watchman, Gasson ; then the deceased tumbled down, and fell a fighting with another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he was carried out of the house, to the Round house?</p>
               <p>Winship . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any complaint before he went out of the door; of his leg being broke?</p>
               <p>Winship . - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he walk out, or was he carried out at the door?</p>
               <p>Winship . He walked out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. What complaint did he make?</p>
               <p>Winship . I saw him as far as the door, and he made no complaint then.</p>
               <p>Pros. Council. Don't you remember the deceased's being bloody?</p>
               <p>Winship . Yes, but nothing but his head, his leg was not bloody. I took hold of my master's coat, and said, come away. My master had neither stick nor truncheon in his hand, till he went away with the deceased to the Round house.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Kinder. I went into Mr. Townley's for a pint of beer about nine o'clock, when Mr. Page first came in; Mrs. Page came in about half an hour after, and brought a warrant, and insisted upon it's being served, and it was served by Mr. Townley. He came in again about eleven o'clock, and said Mr. Page must go to the Round house. Mr. Page was very rustical, and would not go. Mr. Townley insisted upon it, and said it was too late to go to the Justice's; Page said he would go no where but to his own house; for he would be no body's Prisoner; then he was going to run away.</p>
               <p>Q. What way did he offer to go out?</p>
               <p>Kinder. Out at the back door next the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the back door go into the street?</p>
               <p>Kinder. Yes, Sir, he took Mr. Long's cane out of his hand, and beat Mr. Townley over the shoulders, and took him by the ears, and almost pulled his ears off, for I was the person who put some tallow to them. Page used Townley, Long, and Savage very ill - he walked from the fire-side to the door as well as I can go - I saw him no farther than out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he carried out upon any body's shoulders?</p>
               <p>Kinder. He walked out as well as I can do out of this place - at the time they were going to carry him to the Round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he complain of his leg being broke?</p>
               <p>Kinder. He said his leg was broke; but his leg was not broke in the house - if any body gave the blow it was Mr. Gasson, for he came in and began to pay away, and then they all fell a fighting and quarrelling together.</p>

               <p>Q. What condition was he in for the first four days?</p>
               <p>Blowes. From the 19th of September, which was on the Wednesday, to the Saturday, he was in a fair way. On Saturday two men and the deceased's wife came and talked of an execution, and of some children going to the work-house, but whether they were her own or no I can't say. Towards candle-light, he began to be very delirious, and pulled his leg out of the box; upon this he had a sort of a shivering, his senses were taken away, and he was quite delirious; the bandages which were upon his leg were either rubbed off, or he had pulled them off, and I was obliged to get a person to put his leg into the box again, and it was obliged to be set a second time.</p>

            . I have known Mr. Townley about eight or nine years, and take him to be one of the most inoffensive men I ever knew, he is remarkably modest. There is another circumstances in his behalf, that at the election of officers, he was reckoned by all the persons present at the vestry, to be the most unexceptionable person to serve the office of constable. As to Mr. Long, he is a man that is very well regarded among the heads of the parish, but he is a little disregarded among the inferior sort of people, because he is by his office employed to remove nusances. I take him to be a very honest man, and incapable of doing such a thing to any body that is committed to his charge. My Lord, as to the place that these people come out of, it is the most infernal part of the Parish; I do not pretend to impeach the characters of the Evidence, but I am sure there is no good comes from thence.</p>

            . I have known Townley about 7 years, and Long about four years; Townley's character was always that of a quiet, peaceable man; and Long's is the same for what I know; he was my beadle last year, when I was Headborough, and always behaved in a civil manner; as to Bowl-yard, it is as bad as Drury-Lane, or Black-Boy-Alley .</p>
               <p>Mr. Harrison. I have known Long twenty years, I have had a great many hundreds of pounds of dealings with him in the Hackney-coach-way, and he always behaved as well as I desire any person to do - I don't think he would be guilty of such barbarity as he is charged with.</p>
               <p>- Hoddy. I have known Long 23 or 24 years, he has as good a character as any person in any parish whatsoever, and always behaved as well as any man whatever, and I believe he would not be guilty of any such thing as is laid to his charge - I don't know the witnesses for the Prosecutor, but Bowl-yard is a very wicked place.</p>
               <p>- Gibson . I have known Townley and Long many years, they are persons of very good characters.</p>
               <p>- Scot. I have known Townley between five and six years, he always bore the character of an honest man, a good husband, and an indulgent father; he was always very good natured, and used the Prisoners he had under his care with a great deal of humanity.</p>
               <p>- Gregory. I have known Townley seven years, he has the character of an honest, quiet, peaceable man. <rs id="t17441017-24-verdict151" type="verdictDescription">

I examined her, and found she was in a bad condition in her private parts; I sent for the Doctor to examine her, and he said she had got the soul disease.

            . On the 17th of September I received a letter from Justice Spurling, to desire me to examine this child, to see what condition she was in. I examined the child and found she had the foul disease to a very great degree. I passed my finger into the part to know whether she was injured there, and I found there had been a penetration, but not to lacerate or tear the parts. I presume he must have dilated the parts, for I apprehend the child could not have had the foul disease without the parts had been dilated in order for the emission; had the appearance of the disease been only external, or had he not in some degree penetrated into the child's body; it would have appeared outwardly by an inflammation or an ulcer, and would not have been a gonorrhoea, but this is a true gonorrhoea occasioned by a penetration into the parts.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wilson. Somebody must have entered her body, for I passed my finger very easily into the part, which I could not have done into the body of a child of that age, without great pain to her.</p>

            , Esq; The father of this child made a complaint to me the 16th of September in the morning about an hour before church time, and I granted him a warrant. I examined the child in what manner the Prisoner had used her, she said he took her into a shed and laid her down on some hides, and hurt her very much, but she said she did not know what he did to her, and the child told me when he had done what he did to her he threatened her, that if she told any body he would cut her throat. Mr. Coulson examined the child, and he said she had the foul disease. I examined the Prisoner with relation to this, and he said he had endeavoured to enter her body, but that he had not entered her body; and as to his giving her the foul disease, he said he did not know he had it himself. Mr. Coulson said he had taken two doses of physick from Dr. Swift an Apothecary at Edmonton , for this disease, yet he had it upon him still.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What I said before the Justice was when I was in liquor, for I did not offer any such thing to the child, and as for the physick I took, it was not for that, for I did not know I had any such thing upon me, and I have taken nothing for it, what I took of Dr. Swift was for a strain; and I work as hard as any man in England to get my bread in an honest way. <rs id="t17441017-25-verdict155" type="verdictDescription">

Some time last month, but I can't be positive to the day, I lost a pair of shoes, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170033"/> 11 o'clock in the day time: I was in the shop when they were lost, but did not see the Prisoner take them, my man went after him, seized him and brought him back, and the were in the bosom of his coat.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mr. Hose; I saw the Prisoner take the shoes one by one off my master's show-glass, I followed him and took the shoes out of the left side of his coat and brought him back to my master's shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say but this, I am out of my senses once in a moon, that I don't know what I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he plead that as an excuse when he was taken?</p>
               <p>Game. He did not say any thing to me about that when I took him, he desired nothing, but that we would use him well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he looked like a man in his senses?</p>
               <p>Game. I think he did not look like a man in his senses , to take the shoes in the day-time and come by the door with them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hose. I saw the shoes in his bosom before he was brought back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think he looked like a man in his senses?</p>
               <p>Hose. I don't think he looked any wise like a man that was out of his senses. <rs id="t17441017-26-verdict160" type="verdictDescription">

             . I am a watchman of Portsoken Ward, on the 21st of August last, I was beating the hour of 11 o'clock, some men were coming along, and one of them struck my lanthorn with his stick - I don't know who did it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were there?</p>
               <p>Dadley. I believe about ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this done?</p>
               <p>Dadley. In <placeName id="t17441017-27-crimeloc165">Aldgate High-street</placeName>

I lost my staff, one of them with a cutlass, or a hanger, offered to strike me over the head. Sparkes had several cuts upon his head, he was cut very much, and his arms and wrist were very much bruised.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he carried that night?</p>
               <p>Dadley. He was carried home, and the next day he was carried to the London infirmary.</p>
               <p>Lancelot Howlett. On the 21st of August, about 11 o'clock at night, I was in the watch-house, and hearing a noise in the street, I went out; Dadley, he cried out murder; I went to his assistance, and found him upon the ground, upon his breech, and helped him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a great number of people there?</p>
               <p>Howlett. There was a great possy of people with hangers drawn - I believe about 10 or 11, but I can't be sure in the dark. We began to play with our staves as well as we could, and then Cartwright, another watchman, came out, and played away. Parker, and Appleby a poor, honest, innocent man, were cut down at once.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of you?</p>
               <p>Howlett. There were six of us in all, Dadley, Sparkes, Cartwright, Parker, Appleby, and my self.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you distinguish any of the persons that were there?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174410170034"/>Howlett . Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you distinguish?</p>
               <p>Howlett. Mr. Morgan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him?</p>

               <p>Howlett . He kept the tap at the Bull-Inn, I have known him about three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you consider what you say, this is a very material case, whether he did any thing, or whether he was only a looker on?</p>
               <p>Howlett. When Parker, Sparkes and Appleby were knocked down, Morgan pursued me, and I jumped over Mr. Appleby, and Morgan was flourishing his stick at me, but being pretty nimble, I got out of the way, and I bid Appleby go into the watch-house, for he had got enough already. Then I saw Mr. Rawlinson, a Tallow-chandler, come to my assistance; one of the watchmen was going to knock him down; and I said, What are you going to do, don't meddle with him, I know him. Morgan was flourishing one of the watchmen's staves and said, You villains, what will you do, I will knock your brains out?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after the watchmen were knocked down?</p>
               <p>Howlett. About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was Morgan?</p>
               <p>Howlett. When Morgan was flourishing the staff, I asked Rawlinson , who that was, that was flourishing his staff, and he said it was Morgan, who keeps the Seven Stars in Whitechapel - Morgan said, You wicked vile Rascals, if you come up I'll knock your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the meaning of this, did you give them any provocation?</p>
               <p>Dadley. No, one of them that was in company hit my lanthorn, and I said, Why do you use me so?</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any quarrel?</p>
               <p>Dadley. There were some fractious words; I might say some, and they said some again.</p>
               <p>Q. When these people came up, did you see Morgan among them?</p>
               <p>Dadley. No, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>- Cartwright. On the 21st of August, I was at the watch-house, and hearing an outcry of watch, I came out and saw several men, either with sticks, or other weapons, assaulting

I went to make sure of one that went up Checquer-yard , and we knocked him down. They beat me in a terrible manner, but it was so dark, I could not see who they were.</p>

            . I was invited by Mr. Baker who keeps a public house where these persons dined, to dine there; I told him I could not be there at dinner upon account of business, but would be there in the evening; we all came out of the house together about eleven o'clock. I said to Mr. Morgan will you go home with me and drink a bottle of cyder, which he agreed to do, for I found the company (who were some of the crew belonging to Commodore Anson's ship the Centurion) were in liquor, and I did not care to keep them company. As Morgan and I were going quietly along, I heard a cry of watch , upon this outcry I saw one of the watchmen come running, and another after him, and they run down Checquer-Yard . I did not go down the yard but stood at the end of the passage, and heard a cry of murder; the lieutenant, I forget his name now, stood at the end of the place; the watchmen came up to the lieutenant and he had his hanger drawn, I said don't cut any body, he said. - d d - n them I'll fight for my King and Country.</p>

               <p>Q. You must see it, or you could not tell whether he had any or no?</p>
               <p>Rawlinson. Indeed I did not know what sort of a stick it was; then two of the watchmen came up, and one of them said he would knock me down, and the other said don't knock him down. - This was as I was standing at my own door.

            . I am Beadle of Portsoken Ward, I was not present at the fray, but the day after this fray happened I went to Morgan's house, and told him I heard he had been in this fray and was very sorry for it; he said he was in the fray but it could not be helped: he said one of the company had been a good customer to him, and had hired his horse to go to Portsmouth, and he had engaged him to be there; he said I did a foolish thing in bringing a staff away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he took it from any body?</p>
               <p>Day. He said he saw several staves lying upon the ground, and he thought it was a fray among the Butchers, and that the staff belonged to one of them; and he said he neither gave nor received a blow from any body, and shewed me his head to let me see that he had not received any blow: said he, do you think I would engage in such an affair as this? I said in an engagement they are not all killed, one falls on one side, and another on the other side, and a man in the centre may stand: he owned that he had a staff in his custody, and a scabbard of a hanger. I desired he would let me see them; he said he could not let me see them then, for his wife had them and she was not in the way, but I never could get the fight of them: I desired he would not let the scabbard go by any means, for it must be produced in Court. I asked him how many hangers there were, he said he was sure there was but one; I said there must be more than that, for we had got two. I advised him not to fly for it, but whenever the warrants were issued out to surrender himself, but he did not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Harrison, Surgeon. I was present at the London-Infirmary at the time Sparkes [the deceased] was brought in: there was one Dadley and a third Watchman brought in as wounded in this skirmish; one of them had a broken skull. The Deceased had two wounds, one on the fore part of his head, a little above the ear; that was the wound his death was principally owing to: the other wound was on the back part of the head, but of no great consequence. - He was brought into the Infirmary the 22d of August, and died the 6th of September of those wounds.</p>
