On Sunday morning, 16th May, I counted my master's ewes and lambs; there were forty-seven ewes and fifty-eight lambs—I saw a lamb produced on Monday afternoon, covered with mud; Heavens pointed it out to me—it was my master's, and had been safe in the field the previous morning—there was no footpath in the field where the sheep were.</p>

On Sunday, 16th May, I was in one of his fields; there was a field and two hedges between them and Mr. Bishop's field, in which there were some sheep and lambs—in the afternoon I saw two persons going up the field—I only know them by their dresses; Barrett has the same dress on, a velveteen coat, but I cannot swear to him—I saw Mr. Bishop's boy come running to them, they were then reaching under the hedge, but were not carrying anything—I did not notice what they did when the boy came to them, but some time after the boy was gone I saw the same two coming down with a lamb; one had hold of the fore and the other of the hind legs; they got over the hedge into Mr. Cox's field, and then into another, and when they came to a hedge the tallest was carrying the lamb in his arms, and when he saw me he threw it into a ditch—Barrett appears to be dressed the same—I saw him again on the same day.</p>

On 31st Aug., I received a letter purporting to be from a person named Gaskill—I do not know what has become of it; Mr. Alderman Carter passed it over to the reporters, at Guildhall Police Court—that evening, in consequence of that letter, I went to No. 22, Wellington Place, Eaton Square; I rang the bell, and saw the woman who was in charge of the house—I was waiting for Rawson, who had left the house, and he walked up the steps, and said, "You are late;" I said, "It is a long way to come from the City; I have brought those watches for your inspection," and showed them to him—he selected one which he put in his pocket, and a gold chain, which he put round his neck—he then said, "Have you brought a bill;" I said, "I have not, but if you will give me a sheet of paper I will make one out"—I took some letters out of my pocket, and he took back his own letter, saying, "Half a sheet will do," tore the fly sheet off, and I wrote a receipt on it—he then took the bill and walked out—I heard the click of the street door, and then I knew it was a swindle—something was said about payment, only in the letter—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am a news-seller of Shoe Lane. The prisoner was in my service—he had access to the part where the "Illustrated London Newspapers" were kept—in consequence of something that occurred, I searched my stock on 12th May, and missed a quantity of the "Illustrated London News," of Nov. 28th, 1857 and Jan. 30th, 1858—next evening, I told the prisoner that, in consequence of information I had received, I had reason to suspect that he was robbing me, and that he was seen to take a parcel of newspapers from a house close by; he said that they were his own—I asked him how he came by them; he said, "I bought them up the lane"—I asked him what they were; he said, "Some were 'Illustrated News,' others were various newspapers, and some were 'Bell's'"—I told him that, unless I was satisfied that they were his own papers, I should prosecute him—he made no answer, and I sent for an officer—he then said, "I did take them from here"—I asked him what they were; he said, "Illustrated London News"—I asked him how many there were, and he said, "About two dozen"—I have seen two in Greenfield's custody of the dates which I missed, Dec. and Jan.</p>

On 13th May, the prisoners came in together, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—they sat down in front of the bar, and Judd asked for a pot of beer; the price was 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him, and he put down a shil<lb/>ling—I took it up, and gave him a sixpence and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—I put the shilling in my pocket, where I had one other shilling and eight sixpences—they drank the pot of beer, and were still in front of the bar—in half an hour afterwards they called for another pot of beer—Standon paid for it with a shilling—I put that in my pocket, and gave him a sixpence and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they all drank that beer, and they then asked for the skittle ball—I gave it them, and they went into the skittle ground—in about a quarter of an hour, Judd came to the bar for another pot of beer—I served him; he gave me a shil<lb/>ling—I put that in my pocket, and gave him sixpence and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, because the beer is 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pot in the ground—in about a quarter of an hour, Reeve came for a pot of beer—he gave me a shilling; I put it in my pocket; I gave him 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change and the beer, and he took it into the skittle ground—shortly afterwards Reeve came for another pot of beer; he gave me another shilling—I felt it, and found it was bad, and gave it back to him to be returned as not a good one—he took it away, and shortly after brought me a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece and a penny, and from what he said to me I examined the money I had in my pocket—I found I had five shillings; one was good, and four were</p>

The prisoner came to my house about 10 o'clock in the morning, on 19th May; he said he had just come from the country, and wanted a back drawing room, which I said I could not accommodate him with, but I had a small room, and a bedroom at the top—he asked what I wanted for them; I said 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; he said it was too much, he should be in town five or six weeks—I said, in that case, I would take something less—he went away, and did not take the rooms—he returned at 5 o'clock, and said he had come to say that he would take the rooms—he said he had written a letter to me, but had forgotten to post it—he said, "I have been to the Crystal Palace, I am very tired, I am going to the hotel to dine, and I will return"—he returned at twenty minutes after 7 o'clock, and asked if his room was ready; I said, "Yes"—he then asked me to send to the Great Western for his luggage—he said his hands were dirty, and he would go up stairs to wash them; that he expected a gentleman to call on him, and asked me to come and tell him—while I was up stairs the last witness called, and my wife showed him into the room—I went up and told the prisoner; he came down, and they remained together about a quarter of an hour—I heard the prisoner come out again, and he went up stairs very quietly to where he had washed his hands—I had occasion to go up, and I met him coming down—I asked him whether he intended to take tea; he said he could not tell, he was just going out for a minute, and when he returned he would tell me—he went out, I shut the door after him; I never saw him again till I saw him at Guildhall, in custody.</p>

I recollect the examination of the prisoner—a letter was produced referring to this particular case—I saw that letter on 22d May; I read it, and wrote it out—the prisoner was remanded till the 25th—between the 22d and the 25th my minutes had been copied by a clerk—on the 25th, further evidence was given, and the prisoner was committed—after each case is disposed of, it is my practice to have my letters and papers taken into another room for a clerk to copy—no doubt, I saw the letter at the examination, and, no doubt, it was sent with my minutes to the adjoining room—it is the officer's duty to see that he has all the papers before he leaves—my impression is, that the letter must have been delivered to the officer—there were three officers, but the only one that I recollect was Green—I have made every inquiry, and every search for that letter, and we cannot find it; I never heard of its loss till yesterday morning.</p>

About seven days before the robbery, about 7 o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner Britcher about the premises, in company with another man; they were talking together, and viewing our premises in front—I was alarmed by them—they crossed from one corner to the other, and took a view of the premises—Britcher came into our shop the same evening, when they parted—he asked for half an ounce of tobacco, he asked me if we really manufactured our tobacco, and he took some leaf up in his hand, and asked if this was the leaf which we manufactured from.</p>

On Friday morning, 14th May, I was leaving home to go to work—I live in Quaker Street, and a man ran by me just as I came out of my door—I went on to the bottom of the street, and I saw a horse and cart standing at Mr. Simmons' side door, and I saw three men put three bags, or sacks, into the cart—the three men then walked up Quaker Street, and the man who was in the cart drove away in the same direction—I cannot swear to the other men, but Coote was the man who was in the cart, and he drove the cart away.</p>

On 24th April, I was waiting at Charing Cross to cross the road, at about 1 o'clock in the day—the pri<lb/>soner came to me, she asked me what my name was—I said, "Knott;" she said my mother sent her to tell me to go to my aunt Susan and borrow 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or as much more as she could afford, till Monday, 4 o'clock—I went to my aunt Susan, and asked her for the money—I said, "Please, aunt Susan, my mother sent me to borrow 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or as much as you can spare, till Monday, 4 o'clock"—she gave me the money, and I went to St. Martin's Church with it—I saw the prisoner, she told me to come to St. Martin's Church, and I gave her the money—she then took me to Bedford Street, Covent Garden—she then went to a public house, and told me that was her house; she told me to wait outside; I waited a long time—I then went to my mother, and spoke to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Lord Foley. His Christian names are Thomas Henry—he lives at No. 26, Grosvenor Square—I have been nine years in his lordship's service—the prisoner Whetstone was in his service, as steward's room boy—the plate was kept in a strong closet, in the pantry, under the charge of Tomkins, the under butler—the plate closet had an old lock to it, not a patent lock, and there was three keys; one was kept by his lordship, one by me, and one by the under butler—when his lordship left town, on 27th March, the under butler asked leave to go into the country, on his own business, and I gave my key to him to seal up, in a paper parcel, to deliver to me, which was done, and I locked up that paper parcel, sealed with his seal, in my desk—that parcel contained his key and mine—I after<lb/>wards saw that parcel opened by our under butler, in my room, and the two keys were then in it—the seal was unbroken, until the under butler opened it—the family left town on 27th March; at that time I had in my possession the sealed parcel—Whetstone had received notice to leave on 24th March, for his general bad conduct—the male servants then left in town, were, her lady<lb/>ship's footman, James Suthers, William Cork, the hall porter, and Colonel Foley's servant, Henry Burbidge—the family left on 14th April, and it was between 9 and 10 o'clock that morning that the sealed parcel was opened, as I have described—shortly after it bad been opened, Tomkins came back from the strong room, and made a communication to me, in consequence of which, I went into the plate room, and found a considerable quantity of pro<lb/>perty gone, about 4,500 ounces in weight—amongst it was a silver gilt dessert service, and two glass claret jugs, silver gilt mounted—there were, also, some tops, belonging to some scent bottles, of Colonel St. George Foley's dressing case; they had been in the strong closet—when the femily were at home, Whetstone slept in the pantry; that is a room out of which the strong room opens—Tomkins, the under butler, also slept in that room, when he was</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Henry Brooks, a coachman in the service of a gentleman in Grosvenor Square. On 3d April, about half past 9 or twenty minutes to 10 o'clock in the evening, I was passing through Grosvenor Square, and saw two men standing at the area gate of Lord Foley's house, one was talking quite loud, and the other was not; they were in the street, with their backs quite close to the gate; they were looking in the direction in which I was coming—I could not see the other one answer; I looked then to see who it was that he was talking to, and there was a man down the area steps answering him—I know one of them, they told me his name was Cherry; he is the fourth prisoner, the other I have not seen—I believe Whetstone to be the man who was in the area, I could not see that he had any hat or cap on—he was about four steps down; it turns round a little, and it was in the bend.</p>

               <p>Friday my husband told our butler that I had seen some men outside, and it was then he said that his wife had seen some, and requested the police to come to me—I had not been talking about the matter and comparing notes; I never conversed with any one about it, only my husband—I did not take notice what the men were saying; I thought they were gentlemen's servants talking to the other—I did not walk on as fast as I could, because, seeing them stand with their backs to the area gate, I thought it was remarkable, and turned my head, and one of them smiled at me, and that made me notice them.</p>

               <p>without a coat, but it was his face I looked at—the same observation applies to when I saw him at Lord Foley's house—he is the man I met on the stairs, he wore dark clothes then—I was going up the stairs and he was coming down—it did not take a minute, he just stood aside and I passed him—I had never seen him before—there was a great deal of whitewash on. the stairs and dirt in the passage, I had my dress raised to escape it, and the man smiled just when I met him, and I thought that was why he smiled—I was going up quite quietly.</p>

               <p>10 o'clock at night, I was crossing Grosvenor Square and was hailed by two men and a woman; Puzey was one of the men and Pickett was the woman—they were standing by the enclosure railings of the square, near a house, which I have since ascertained is Lord Foley's—I pulled, up, and they put some parcels in which they had at their feet; I cannot tell which of them had the parcels, the parcels were on the pavement at the time—Puzey put a parcel in first, I did not take particular notice of it, it was about the size of my hat; I do not know whether it was round, I did not take particular notice; it was covered over with some loose sort of article—I was going to get down to assist in putting the parcels in, and Puzey requested me not to get down—Pickett got into the cab, Puzey then put in the other parcel and got in himself—the parcels appeared heavy—they told me to drive to Goswell Street Road and make haste, and they would give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than my fare—when I got into Hanover Square, they requested me again to make haste, offering me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and something to drink if I would go faster—when I got into Theobald's Road, they requested me again to go faster—we ultimately got to a public house in Goswell Road, and they ordered me to drive to a public house opposite; I do not know the name of it—then Pickett and the short man got out, and Puzey last—he ordered Pickett and the short man to go in and get me something to drink; he waited outside—we went and had something, and as we were having it, I looked through the door and saw Puzey taking the largest parcel of the two out of the cab—it appeared heavy because he was like cuddling it, in a manner of speaking; he could not get it out with one hand—I went out then and shut the door after him, and he went down the street towards the City Road with the parcel—I stayed there about eleven minutes, when Puzey returned, and Pickett and the short man then came out of the public house, and Puzey took a parcel out then—when the other parcel was being taken out, the woman said, "Mind how you take it out, if the glass should break"—that was all she said—Puzey then told me to drive to the Ashby Castle, and wait till he came; that is close to Northampton Square—I did so with Pickett and the short man, and waited at Northampton Square about eighteen minutes—Puzey then came back, and asked me what my fare was—I told him I would leave it to him; so he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that was more than my fare, as he had promised me—there was some conversation among them ultimately about sleeping at some one's house, but I do not remember what female's name they said—they all three went away together—it was about a quarter to 11 o'clock when I left them, as near as I can judge—I should say it would take about twenty minutes to drive back to the neighbourhood of Grosvenor Square, at the pace they went at first.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Bryer, a gold and silver refiner of No. 54, Barbican. On Thursday afternoon, 13th April, about 5 o'clock, Benjamin came, and said that he called for an assay of a bar of metal which he had left to be assayed—I referred him to another assistant; we bought the bar of him, and our cashier paid him the money; I only know that from a memorandum—it was 40 ozs., 10 dwts, at 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an ounce, which would be 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., less 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the assay—this is the memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—; it was not made at the time; it is copied from our assay book—there would be a portion of gold in it to bring it up to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per ounce, about one dwt. in the pound; that is the usual proportion of silver gilt articles—I told him he would get it at the other counter; and, while they were making out the assay, he came back to me, and said, "Here are two pieces of silver I may as well sell you"—I do not remember whether the assay was handed to him at all—we are generally supposed to give it to the purchaser—he produced these two tops from a dressing case discoloured in this manner (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—; I took up the larger one and touched it with a file, to ascertain that it was silver, before purchasing it—Benjamin had this one in his hand on the other side of the counter, filing it over the top where the crest is—I said, "These have a crest on them;" he said, "Yes, they have been in a fire"—I said, "Yes, I can see that, it is all right"—I was filing on the side, not on the top where the crest is—they have been in some fire—I offered him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce for them; they were weighed, and I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I gave them to Bull the policeman—I gave information myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MONTAGUE CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you dealers in a large way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have known Benjamin ever since I have been in the establishment; he has been in the habit of bringing silver and gold bars—he has been a dealer ever since I have known him—I only knew from his coming that his business was selling gold and silver; it is not a new thing—I always understood that he lived in Sun Street, Bishopgate—I think this dealing in the bar of silver was on the 13th, it was Tuesday—I do not remember that there had been a transaction the day before—I have received a letter this morning, and have referred to the books, and find that a gold chain, to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was sold by him the day before—we have half a dozen files lying on the counter, and when there is a question as to the nature of an article, we take up the files to find out—by filing the centre of these it would tend to take the crest from view; it would obliterate it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think your judgment is perfectly incorrect, and in order to test your judgment the jury must look at it, and they will perceive that by filing the centre the crest would be more brought to view; perhaps you never noticed that the crest by filing becomes more visible to the naked eye? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Possibly it does—I left the articles just as they were—inquiries were made of us two days</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185806140062"/>
               <p>afterwards which led us to hand the articles over to the police; and the moment they inquired I was able to recognize the crests and hand them over to them—I told them at once that I took them of Benjamin, so that without difficulty the police officer could have found out who had sold us these articles—they came to me two days afterwards, making inquiries and describing the crests; I took down the information, looked at the silver, and found these two—I had not to look through many articles with crests before I discovered these two; it was from the description of the articles by the police—we had articles with crests, and names, and all sorts of things—we do not always buy articles unless we know the parties—whenever there is a plate robbery, as a matter of course, from our large dealings, the police come to us and make inquiries—we have a list every morning—this is not the first time after plate robberies that our establishment has been resorted to, and we have delivered up the plate we have bought; but we have information of all the robberies committed during the previous day—on one occasion, the whole of our things were taken away to be examined—it would be notorious that the police would come there—there were other customers in the shop at te time Benjamin was effecting this sale with us—there was no concealment—I gave him a ticket to get the money.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you tell whether these have been in the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they would not be particularly difficult to melt, not more than other silver—if the bar which was brought to us had been melted, these might have been melted into it and made part of it—this silver appears to me to nave got to a red heat, and then taken from the pot, it has run—I cannot conceive why two pieces of silver should be taken out of the pot and not melted, but it is very certain they have been in the fire—I cannot tell whether they have been in a melting pot—we assayed the bar a day or two before we received in<lb/>formation of the robbery—silver generally comes from abroad in bars of 1,000 ounces; this is an English made bar—the bars we get from abroad are fine silver; this is not quite standard silver—many manufacturers melt down their filings and then sell them to us, or they might bring them to us to melt them—persons melt them themselves to save expense, but we can melt then cheaper than anybody else—I cannot give you the reason why persons melt things before bringing them to us—I should be sorry to say that I could not account for any honest man being in possession of a bar of silver which bad been melted in England, but the jewellers and silversmiths melt for them<lb/>selves, they prefer melting their own stuff, because they know that they have got it all and that they lose none by sending it to a strange place to melt—they melt them into bars and send them to us to be assayed.</p>

He keeps the shop and two back rooms—he deals in ginger beer and harness—we had several railway wrappers on the cot in the middle room—on the morning of 28th May, I was called up by the last witness, as near as possible, about a quarter before 6 o'clock—I came down, and saw these wrappers had been removed, and were placed against the street door—when I went to bed the night before, I left my parents up—when I came down, I saw the prisoner in the shop; I let her go outside, and followed her, and gave her in charge—these are my father's wrappers.</p>

The defendant introduced me to Mr. Masters—I remember Fray and the defen<lb/>dant coming to my house on 23d Oct.—Fray delivered five sacks of flour—we went across the road, and had a pint of ale, and while there he said that Mr. Masters had only sent me five sacks instead of ten.</p>

About 10 o'clock that night, I came out of my shop; I looked at Mr. Watts', and saw the prisoner in the shop—I turned, and saw him run away, and heard the last witness call, "Stop thief!"—I pursued him, but I had only my slippers on; I lost them, and could not proceed—I cannot say how the prisoner was dressed—he had a light coat on—I have known him for five years—I am certain it was him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, living at Walthamstow. On Wednesday, 9th of June, I was returning from my dinner, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I passed the prisoners in a field adjoining Mr. Wilkinson's premises; they were hanging on a gate—I knew them before, and have no doubt they were the men—Barrett had a blue Guernsey on, corded trousers, and a cap, and Cansell, a flannel jacket, a cap, and corded trousers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, in the employ of Robert Nicholas Halfhead, of Walthamstow. On Wednesday morning, 19th May, about ten minutes past four o'clock, I came across a field near Mr. Halfhead's premises, and saw the prisoner standing in a field of Mr. Halfhead's, about a quarter of a mile from his premises—I stopped, and looked at him, and he went on towards Ferry Lane—I went towards Mr. Halfhead's shed, in the direction from which the prisoner was coming, and missed the lead off the shed, which I had seen safe the previous night when we left work—I went after the pri<lb/>soner, overtook him in Ferry Lane, and told him I wanted him to come back to Mr. Halfhead's; he said that there was no occasion for him to go back, but afterwards he went back, and when we got to the shed I told him I accused him of stealing the lead—he said that he should not steal such heavy luggage as that; if he did steal anything, it should be something lighter—I afterwards went to Ferry Lane with a policeman, and found the lead there, in a ditch, at a gate which I had seen the prisoner pass through—I compared it with the place from which it was missing, and it was the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How far was I from the foot path when you saw me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About sixty yards—the lead was found 100 yards from where I first saw you—I saw a person in the field going in the opposite direction, who one of my men went after—he was nearer to the lead than you, when we first saw him com<lb/>ing towards you—I saw you go out at the gate, you turned to the right, and the lead was to the left—one man passed the gate, that was not the same man—you walked about the premises pretty well half an hour before my master came—the lead was nailed down, it formed part of the gutter of the shed—you had no parcel when you went through the gate, nor were you different in bulk that I saw.</p>

I was on duty in Ferry Lane about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Halfhead's—I received information, and went in search of the prisoner, but did not get him—after he was taken, I found these two pieces of lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)., weighing about fifty pounds, in a ditch in Ferry Lane—I compared them with the lead on the gutter and stabling, and they corresponded exactly—I saw some foot prints, coming from the shed towards Ferry Lane; I put one of the prisoner's boots hy the side of a mark which had been pre<lb/>viously made, close to the shed, and I observed another foot mark near another piece of lead, about 150 yards from the shed, and 2 or 3 yards from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185806140079"/>
               <p>the first print—it exactly corresponded with the prisoner's boots—when the prisoner was walking about near the shed, he did not go near the third piece of lead; I found no footmarks near that; it is hard ground there—the foot print was going away from the prosecutor's premises.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> It is a case of mere suspicion; the man had time to take a quarter of an hour to go to his master's premises, and miss the property, and come back, and follow me; nothing was said about the footmarks on the two previous examinations; all I did wrong was to stray a few yards from the footpath; if there had been anything like guilt on my conscience, I had plenty of time to get away; this is a common pocket knife, and there are no marks on the lead, as if these pincers had been used; these are men's boots, and there are hundreds like them; there are no nails deficient; it is clearly proved that plenty of other men were about; who would be likely to have boots on like mine.

                  </hi>. I am watchman at the zinc works at the Surrey Docks. About 2 o'clock on Sunday morning, 9th May, I heard a noise in the store room, it was like the shutting of a window—the window slides on one side—I ran up, looked out of the window, and saw some one pass through the wicket gate which leads to the duck—the prisoner Beech would naturally remain on the premises, he was the watchman on duty that night—he should have had the key of that gate—we have no second key—his watch box is about twenty yards from the wicket gate on the further side to where I was—I went up into the store room, and found two layers of spelter had been removed—I had been in that place about 11 o'clock, after all the men had</p>

               <p>left—after missing the spelter I went to the wicket gate, and I found it shut—I stopped there some time; I heard the noise of spelter breaking, it came from the direction of the watch box—I went round and went to the other side of the wicket gate—I opened the large gates and went round—I heard nothing there—I did not go within twenty or thirty yards of the watch box—I did not see any one about then—I went back inside the wicket gate, I remained there some time, and I saw Beech and Winchester coming down from the Baltic yard, that was where some broken metal was afterwards found—they both came down and went together into Beech's watch box—Winchester had no right to be about the premises at that time—I went and gave information to Mr. Fletcher, and then went on with my work inside—in about twenty minutes afterwards Mr. Fletcher and I went to the watch box; Mr. Fletcher went in, I went just to the door, I did not go right in—after Mr. Fletcher went away, I went through the large gates, and back to the wicket gate—I then saw Beech by the watch box door, and Winchester coming from a barge into the Rice Mill yard—I heard two splashes in the water, but I saw nothing go in—the sound appeared to come from near where Winchester was—I saw nobody else near that place—the prisoners afterwards went down to the gate and were detained.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the oxyde and zinc manufac<lb/>tory. There is a passage which is common to my employer and the Rice Mills—there is a large pair of gates, which ought to be closed from Saturday evening till Monday morning—Beech was the watchman there—there is only one key of the gates—they are within the Surrey Docks—if you want to get access to the front or back entrance, you must go through the gates—both the prisoners are in the employ of the Rice Mills—I believe Beech has been so for about twelve months—on 9th May, I was called up about 3 o'clock in the morning—I dressed myself, and came down—I went into the works with the last witness—I went into the store room we keep the spelter in; I missed seventeen or eighteen plates of metal off the piles—I went down to the front entrance, and made inquiries—I went back to the works, and went with the last witness to the watch box; I saw Beech standing in front of it, leaning over the half gate—I said to Beech, "Have you any objection to my search<lb/>ing the watch box; I have lost something, and I wish to find it;" he mut<lb/>tered out what I conceived to be an oath—he came out, and I went in—I found Winchester lying on his back on the bench, pretending to be asleep; the bench is about 3ft. 6 in. or 4ft. long—he lay with his knees up—I shook him two or three times, in order to wake him; he pretended to be asleep, and half drunk—he rolled off the bench, and went outside—I searched, and, at the head of the bench, I found a bag containing a number of new brass bearings—the weight of the bag was about 25lbs. or 26lbs.—the bearings had never been used; they were cast from a pattern, and are such as are used in the Rice Mills works—the two prisoners still remained outside—they saw what I was doing—I opened the bag, and I said to Galland, "You are wit<lb/>ness</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185806140082"/>
               <p>to what is here"—there were three different sorts of bearings; two of them were runners, with holes in them, and there were circular bearings, and the others were bearings of the ordinary description—I closed the bag and put it back, and under the bench I found another bag, with two new bearings in it, weighing 5lbs. or 6lbs.—when I took the bag, Beech said, "You will not take that away, they are not your property"—I replied, "I am aware of that, they are not mine, nor are they yours, you have no right to have them in your possession, they are the Rice Mills' property"—I then left the place, and requested Galland to watch—I went to Mr. Pepper who lives next to me—I roused him up, stated what I had found, and requested him to come with me—we went to Mr. Steaton and to the watch box, and saw Winchester, who appeared to be fast asleep on the bench—Mr. Pepper roused him up, and asked him what he had there; he stated he had come to pump Henry Yates' barge out—I picked out the bag of bearings, and missed two different ones; one of the runners with the hole in it, and one of the circular bearers—I challenged the prisoners with having taken a portion of these bearers away while I was gone for Mr. Pepper; they denied it—Mr. Pepper asked Beech how he came in possession of these bearers; he said about half past 1 o'clock, he heard a noise and went and opened the wicket gate and found the bearers just inside—I replied, "How was it you did not find them last night, when you came on duty, in broad daylight?" He made no reply to that—Mr. Pepper took the bag and bearers, and conveyed them to the station—I heard Beech given in charge, he said, "For God's sake Mr. Pepper what shall I do; for my poor wife's sake I beg that you will look it over"—Mr. Pepper said he could do nothing of the kind, he must do his duty—he made use of the same expression to me, and I made a similar reply—I went to Winchester's house and the policeman found a quantity of metal; I should say 7 lbs. behind an old bedstead in the yard—I was present when Beech's house was searched, and a piece of leather was found with a brand on it—from information, I went to Baltic wharf, and found a labourer who had found, secreted under the timber, fifteen pieces of metal—I was not present when they were found, but they were not removed, and I went and saw them there—they were brought away by my direction, they weighed 3qrs. 24lbs.—on 11th May, there was found at the back of the watch box in the soil three brass bearings, and a hammer was found in the stoke hole of the Rice Mill—on the 20th there were nine pieces of spelter found, and four brass bearings, and amongst them was the circular brass bearing that was in the bag when it was first seen by me on the morning of the 9th.</p>

On Sunday, 23d May, I received these two half crowns (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mrs. Hosgood—on the next day I apprehended Elizabeth Marchant, in the Priory Road, about 150 yards from Cavendish House—I told her I took her for passing bad money at Mr. Bullen's shop, in Spring Place; she said, "I passed no bad money there"—I took her there, and Mr. Bullen gave her into custody—the prisoners have all three lived at Cavendish House for the last eighteen months, taking care of the house—I locked Elizabeth up first, then went to the house, and met Emma going in; I went in with her, and found George Marchant in the front parlour—I said, "I am going to take your daughter into custody, for passing bad money at Mrs. Hosgood's, in Spring Gardens"—Emma said, "I never passed any bad money," and George said, "I know nothing about it"—I took Emma to Mr. Hosgood, who identified her, and then took her to the station—later in the same day, I went with Sergeant Soames to Caven<lb/>dish House, and in a work box on the table I found these four shillings and one half crown, all bad (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)., they were wrapped up separately in pieces of newspaper—George saw me find them, he said, "I was not aware they were bad; I know nothing about it."</p>
