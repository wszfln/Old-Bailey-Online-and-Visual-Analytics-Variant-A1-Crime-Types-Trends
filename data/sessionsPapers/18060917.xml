                  <note>[Pages missing in original.]</note>Q. Had they the opportunity to see that you had notes besides the guinea when you took it out. - A.They had; when I put the guinea on the table, the first man took it up, and give it to the prisoner Travers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the landlord called for or the waiter. - A. No, I asked the first man for the guinea, he said I should have it in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get it again. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the first man say any thing when he gave it to Travers. - A. He said I should bet a guinea as well as him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to bet at all. - A. No, I told him I could not bet, it was not my money; then I sat a little while, and got up, and I said I must go; they insisted on my paying for the porter, I pulled out the notes, and held a five pound Bedford note in my hand, and while I was returning the other notes in my pocket, the prisoner Burke snatched the five pound note out of my hand, I asked him for it, he said he would give it me directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give it you again. - A. No; then the tipsey man went out, he said he would order a crown bowl of punch; the first man and Travers went along with him, and left me and Burke together, I offered to go out, Burke said stop a minute, they will be in directly; I stopped, and then got up and said I will not stop any longer, I must go, then Burke got up and went to the door first and stopped me, he would not let me open the door; I said I will go, he went out of the door and went into Tavistock street, I followed him, I asked him for the note at the corner of Tavistock street; he put his hand in his pocket, took out a bit of paper, and said here is your five pound note, I was going to look at it, he said put it in your pocket, you fool, you will lose it; I was going to read it, then he offered to snatch it from me, I put it in my pocket rather than he should do that, I thought I had got my own note again; I followed him and asked him for the guinea, he said he would give me the guinea as soon as he got change; he went down Tavistock street, and just crossed Caroline street; at the corner of Caroline street in Charlotte street he went into a public house, he called for a pot of porter, I said I could not stop, I wanted my guinea; he said he must call for something to get change, he called for some gin, he drank it, and went out of the house the back way into Caroline Mews, I followed him to the back door, he set off running as fast as he could down Caroline Mews, I ran after him, crying out Stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch him. - A. No, he ran down Great Russel street into St. Giles's, he kept all the while before me, I kept crying Stop thief, but nobody stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way you lost him. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. And after that Burke was taken up and Travers likewise. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of their being the men. - A. No, I am quite sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. And then a guinea was tossed up for. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was proposed that you should toss up. - A. They asked me to bet a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you did not bet a guinea. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose the waiter came in and out occasionally. - A. He did, the guinea was taken out for the purpose of paying for the pot of beer.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I apprehended Travers on the 20th in Dyot street, St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Burke's Defence. On my going into the Cock public house, Tottenham-court road, there were three or four people in the room, I called for a pint of porter, and sat separate from them, I did not know any of them whatever; in about ten minutes time a tipsey man came in, he said he had been to New-market; the man that was drinking with the prosecutor said he would toss up with him for a pot of porter, if he would call three out of four; they tossed, and the tipsey man lost; the tipsey man then proposed to toss for a guinea a-piece, it was agreed to, I stood up on hearing they were tossing for money, I being a sporting man, and we all bet a guinea apiece, the prosecutor put down a guinea and lost it, we all lost a guinea a-piece; then the tipsey man said he did not mind if he tossed for five pounds, we all put down five pounds a-piece, the prosecutor put his five pound note into this man's hand, he lost it; they then left the room, and the tipsey man threw down a five pound note on the table, saying, there was a five pound note, take it and drink it among you; they left the room, and the prosecutor and I were left together, I took up the five pound note, O, says the prosecutor, I must have that five pound note, I have lost my master's money, I am a going to pay a bill in the city; I took up the note called the five pound note, the said note I had in my hand the whole time; I told him I had no right to give him any of the money back, for I had been losing my money as well as him; we both went to the door, and in the street he insisted on my giving him the money back, he took the five pound note out of my hand, whether good or bad I do not know, he put the said note in his pocket; he says, now all that I want is a guinea, I told him I had no right to give him any money whatever, I wished him to give me part of the five pound note that he had got in his pocket, he replied that he would not; I then left him in the street.</p>

               <p>Travers's Defence. I was going down Tottenham-court road, I went into the Cock public house, I saw the prosecutor and another man at the door talking; the man who was along with the prosecutor said to me, How do you do, I replied you have the advantage of me; he said he was going in to drink, he asked me if I would drink with him, I said with all my heart; I drank with them, Burke came in, a little while after that a man came in intoxicated, he said he had been to Newmarket, and had lost a great many bottles of wine, he would toss for a pot of porter with them; he tossed, he lost, they tossed again, he said he would toss with them for a guinea a-piece, Burke put down a guinea, the prosecutor put down a guinea, they asked me to hold the stakes, with that I took up the money and held it in my hand, the drunken man won every time but once; at the last toss, the prosecutor he said to me, young man let you and I go out, I said no, they tossed again, and the man that was drunk won, the young man the prosecutor got up and said, I am ruined, it is my master's money; the tipsey man went out, and said he would send them a crown bowl of punch; Burke and he went out together, in about two minutes I went out, I knew none of the parties whatever till Burke's name was mentioned, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Burke called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Travers called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

I was, about four o'clock in the afternoon; I there saw the prisoner at the bar in company with three other persons, I fancied that I had seen two of them before at Bow street; in consequence of my suspicious I watched them, they were close behind Mr. Burrel in Bond street, Mr. Burrel and his two friends were walking together; I observed one the men frequently put his hand into Mr. Burrel's pocket, I did not see him take any thing out, nor am I certain it was the prisoner, to the best of my recollection it was not the prisoner that put his hand into the pocket of Mr. Burrel, but one of them in whose company he was at the corner of Little Brooke street; I asked Mr. Burrel if he had lost any thing, he put his hand into his pocket, he said he had lost his pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these four men. - A. They were in Little Brooke street leading into Hanover square; we immediately followed them into Little Brooke street, they were conversing together, they separated, and the prisoners turned up King street, Mr. Burrel followed them, I went round by Marlborough street, meaning to go along Argyle street to meet them; I called at the police office to desire an officer to follow me; when I got to Little Argyle street I met Mr. Burrel with the prisoner, holding him by the collar; he was taken into the police office Marlborough street immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the prisoner at the bar was one of the four men that you saw together before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170004"/>you saw them do any thing to Mr. Burrel. - A. I am certain, I have not the least doubt but he is the person.</p>

               <p>Q. You remember Mr. Christie making application to you, and your feeling in your pocket, and losing your pocket book. - A. Yes; it was a red pocket book, containing three ten pounds Dorking promissory notes, one five pound bank note, and four one pound bank notes, it was in my outside coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that a place to put bank notes in. - A.(Mr. Knapp) It is not every body that has inside pockets.</p>
               <p>Court. I know it is the fashion of the day to hold out temptation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. At the time that Mr. Christie informed you, did you see the four persons. - A. Yes, the prisoner was one of these four persons; when Mr. Christie informed me, I put my hand into my coat pocket, I found my pocket book was gone; he told me they were gone down Little Brooke street, there I saw them, and I perceived one of them shift the pocket book from their right side to the prisoner; the prisoner put it in his coat pocket; we followed the prisoner into Swallow street, Mr. Christie said I will go to Marlborough street office, and get you an officer to seize him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose sight of him. - A. I followed them till they got into King street, he got rather the start of me, and ran about thirty or forty yards, I ran after him, and called out Stop him; we ran about two or three hundred yards till we got into Swallow street, I then took him by the collar, I said you have got a pocket book of mine, he said I - me - with evident marks of confusion; I told him I would not let him go without searching him; he then took the pocket book out, and I said that is mine, he gave it me, I said now you must go to Marlborough street; that is the pocket book I had missed at Marlborough street, I examined the pocket book at the office and the notes tallied, I have got them here, I know the pocket book to be mine.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live at No. 91, Great Saffron Hill, I kill pigs by commission. On Friday the 29th of August, Evans came to me about six o'clock in the evening, he asked me if I would kill nine pigs; I told him I was tired, I had been to work all day; I asked him the size of them, he said they were from five to seven stone, I told him if any body would go and assist me I would kill them; he said they were at Hoxton, and the water was all hot, and there was a man that would go with me to help kill them; on that consideration I got my tools ready and went along with Donnovan, who was then standing in the street; he pointed out Donnavan to me, Donnovan took me to Hare Walk, Hoxton, to the house of Mrs. Titus; Evans informed me they were the property of a person in the Fleet prison for debt, and that the wife of that debtor was afraid of an execution,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170006"/>and had moved them off to have them killed; Donnovan shewed me the pen in which the pigs were to be killed, I saw there were more than nine pigs, I spoke to Mrs. Titus, she objected to having them killed there, she said the place belonged to a man that kept an ass there, Donnovan was present and heard it, Donnovan requested that she would not turn them out that night, but keep them till the next morning; I went home, and in little less than half an hour after I got home, Evans called on me and asked me the reason why I was not killing the pigs; I told him the reason, that they must be fetched away, and it was too late to kill them for the morning market; he asked me to kill them on Sunday morning, I told him I would not kill them on Sunday morning for any man; he asked me if I would keep them in my cellar; he came again about a quarter before ten, and in the room of bringing nine pigs he brought seventeen, I asked him the reason why he brought so many, Evans said they were all the woman had, I was to kill one for him that night, and he was to fetch it on the Sunday; eight I was to kill on Monday for Tuesday's market, and eight on Tuesday for Wednesday's market.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday did Evans come to you. - A. No, on Sunday morning I saw Evans, I went to his house, I asked him the reason why he had not come for the pig that I had killed, he replied, there is a pretty hobble about these pigs, they were all stolen, he had been to Croydon market on Saturday, and heard it there that they were stolen from a cow keeper at Paddington; he advised me to cut up the pig I had been killing of and make the most money of it I could, and take that money for my trouble; he would come in the middle of the night when all the people were a-bed, and take the other pigs somewhere else; alarmed at the situation that I stood in, I immediately went home and communicated to Mr. Lester what Evans had told me.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had communicated this to Mr. Lester, did you and Mr. Lester go and find out the prosecutor. - A. I did, and he sent his son.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those pigs that young Mr. Kendall saw at your house, the pigs that Evans and Donnovan brought to your house. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. So you get your livelihood by killing pigs by commission. - A. I keep a butcher's shop on Saffron Hill, I have lived there ten years.</p>

That handkerchief and pair of stockings I bought at the Bull, Pit's End, of the prisoner that stands there, on the same day the robbery was done, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon; I heard of the robbery the next day. After I had had my dinner in the public house the prisoner came in and called for some liquor, he sat a considerable time, then he pulled out these stockings and asked who would buy them, he said he must sell them, he wanted money</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whose they were and how he came by them. - A. No; after I bought the stockings, he fetched the handkerchief out of the waggon, he had put his bundle in the waggon, the waggon was standing at the door, I bought the handkerchief, the silver penny piece he gave me, he said he brought that from the Cape of Good Hope; I delivered these things to Mr. Wagstaffe, I saw him give them to Fenning the constable; I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

I had nothing to drink at all but one draft of porter; we called at a public house and had a quartern of gin, I gave him a shilling, because he was without money; we walked to Bear street, Leicester Fields, and there we had something to eat and drink, I asked him if he knew where Barker, a shipmate lived, he said he did; we went to him, and there we had something to drink with him, I paid for it; I came away from there, and called a coach to drive me to Lower East Smithfield; the prisoner and I got into the coach, I told the coachman if he wanted any thing to drink we would stop at the watering house and have a glass a-piece; we had a shillingsworth of rum and water, he brought it to the coach door, the prisoner jumped out of the coach and called for half a pint of gin, I told him I would not stop by myself, I would go in and drink with him in the house, I paid for what we had; then I asked him to come away, he told me he rather would not, I took him by the hand, and bid him good by; I got into the coach again, when I got to the top of Holborn Hill I missed the four pounds out of my pocket, I called to the coachman, and we went back, and we found the prisoner in the same place that we left him; I asked him the reason he had robbed me when I had given him money in his pocket; he replied he had not, the coachmen were thieves; the coachman sent for an officer, and he was detained; when he found the officer was coming he gave me three one pound notes in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they such as you lost. - A. Yes, the same; the officer coming up he took up the note, and in the scuffle we tore two of them; the landlord told the officer that he had changed a one pound note to pay for a pint of beer; the officer searched him and found more money on him.</p>
               <p>Q. You was rather in liquor. - A. I was very sensible, I knew what I was about very well.</p>

I am a police officer; the prisoner was searched by me and Trott the officer, we found fourteen shillings and sixpence upon him, I have three one pound notes which I received from the prosecutor, the prosecutor gave Trott and me seven shillings and a halfpenny, which he said the prisoner at the bar gave him with the three one pound notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man came to me at the Hercules, he called me out of doors and asked me to take a walk with him, I told him I would not; I was afraid I should get intoxicated in liquor; before I went with him he asked me to give him some beer, from there we went to Charing Cross, I stopped at the end of the street while he went up to the office, when he came down he asked me to have something to drink at the White Swan, he called for a quartern of gin, I drank a glass of it, he went to another public house and had a quartern of gin from there, he went to Bloomsbury and had six half pints of gin; the coachman stopped at the Coach and Horses in Holborn, he wanted me to go out of the coach, I told him I would rather stop in the coach rather than go out in the air, I was fearful the air would make me worse as I had been drinking; he gave me some halfpence and the one pound notes, with that he gave me a shove out of the coach, and I put the notes in my pocket.</p>

I had in my pocket, a half guinea, a seven shilling piece, and five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the seven shilling piece any where. - A. No, I took her over to the watchman, and he took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she be with you. - A. Not a minute, in fact I could hardly believe that it could be possible that she could take the money in that time; I took the money out of her hand, I kept it in my hand, and gave it to the officer at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me half a guinea and five shillings, he took me up a passage, and after he had connection with me he wanted me to give it him back.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. She accosted me in the street, and almost tore the coat from my shoulder, that is the truth.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY sworn. I was at the watchhouse, I was the officer, the prisoner is the person that was brought into the watch house, and this is the money the gentleman delivered to me (producing it); I searched her but could not find the seven shilling piece, she acknowledged taking the money from him.</p>

I was taking a walk in Ratcliffe Highway, he asked me to let him take a walk home with me, he gave me two shillings to get something to drink, he asked what he should give me to be with me some time, he said he had no more money, he would leave me his watch till the morning; after he was gone down stairs I took the candle, I saw the watch lay on a chair, and when I got down stairs he was gone out of the house; I did not hear any thing of his coming back in the mornning, I made free with it, I got that woman to pledge it.</p>

               <p>"one hundred pound draft on Marsh and Co.' There were two other drafts of Marsh and Co. one was eighty-five pounds three shillings, and the other was two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there was but one entry of one hundred pound to Marsh and Co. - A. There was not, I gave it to Bannister, our out-door clerk, for the purpose of collecting it.</p>

               <p>Q. Then they were deposited in a box in the care of Mr. Parry, and by him locked up until Monday morning. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. There are other clerks which you call outdoor clerks. - A. Yes, Bannister is one, and the prisoner is another, they both put their notes in one box, they are wrapped up in paper, separate, and tied up, and sometimes their names are wrote upon.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Bolland. You are a collecting clerk there, do you recollect calling over with Mr. Skelton on the 26th of July any draft which he charged to your account. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it to be delivered to you. - A. On the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. They consisted of bills for payment. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any draft drawn by Wade, Stables, and Wilson. - A. I did not look so particularly at that, because we merely called them over according to the sum; I called over the draft and Mr. Skelton read the book, the draft tallied with the book.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday evening what did you do with these bills so charged to you. - A. I sorted them for the walk on Monday, bound them up with a bit of paper, and pinned them and put them in the drawer used for that purpose; on Monday morning the paper was round it, and coming from my round I found I could not answer this one hundred pounds; when I came home I found I was one hundred pounds deficient.</p>
               <p>Q. State to the court what made you take these steps that you took with regard to the prisoner at the bar. - A. From the extraordinary manner in which he went on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Tell us facts. - A. He had two new suits of clothes, and the last evening that he was housekeeper he could not eat the supper, he ordered a fowl and some oyster sauce, at his own expence, and very lately he has been continually going to the Circus, and from thence to Vauxhall, with some girls of the town; in consequence of that we came to a determination to open a closet which belonged to him, the prisoner kept the key of it; it was on Sunday the 10th of August we opened it, and found therein three five pound bank notes, Mr. Aldridge and Mr. Willats were with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found you were a hundred pounds deficient did you tell Mr. Parry of it. - A. No, the next day Mr. Hallifax told me I was to make it good or my securities.</p>
               <p>Court. You had no knowledge of the deficiency till you came home to render the account at one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170011"/>o'clock. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you immediately tell your master. - A. I applied to some of the clerks; I went to Mr. Marsh to stop the payment at five o'clock; I returned at one, I found at four o'clock that it was drawn by Sanxton and Atkins, I then immediately went to stop payment.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. You are a clerk in the house of Messrs. Glynn and Co. the prisoner was also a clerk. - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was his salary. - A. Twenty-five pounds a year and small perquisites, and board in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the first time that you heard any thing of the loss of this hundred pound draft. - A. On Monday the 28th of July, the day it was lost, Mr. Bannister mentioned it when he came home from his walk.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that you observed in the prisoner's conduct did that occasion any suspicion concerning him. - A. Yes, he used to go continually to the Circus and to Vauxhall with some girls of his acquaintance, and four nights in the course of a fortnight he slept out; he bought a gold seal, and had some new clothes come home.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of all these suspicions did you, Bannister, and Willats, determine upon any plan to find out whether he was concerned in taking this note. - A. Yes, upon Sunday morning the 10th of August, I, Bannister, and Willats, went to the closet used by the prisoner, it was locked, and the prisoner had the key, as far as I know; the prisoner had slept out that night, we forced the closet, and after searching it some time, I found three five pound notes in the bottom drawer on the left hand side of this closet; the notes have been in the care of Mr. Parry, I gave them to Mr. Parry that morning they were found, we put our signatures on them when we found them. (The notes shewn to the witness.)</p>

               <p>Q. Looking at these notes with your signature upon them, have you any doubt that these are the notes you found in the prisoner's closet. - A. No doubt, we all three went together to the closet, and all assisted in breaking it open.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Bannister) Look at these notes, and tell me whether there are any marks on them you know, and whether these are the notes you found. - A. These are the notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in the prisoner's conduct that excited suspicion. - A. He used to go every night to the Circus or Vauxhall, and four nights after this note was missing he mentioned that he slept with a girl of the town at the Fountain.</p>

             a knife from his pocket and opened it, he said, cut my bloody head off, I told him no, I should not use him ill, he used many blackguard expressions, in fact, he cut his own hand with the knife, and I believe he would have done me some injury, provided the knife had not been taken out of his hand; there were two gentlemen who assisted, and I procured an officer, and he was examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The words he mentioned I did not make use of; I had a conditional pardon to go on board a ship and serve his Majesty; there were three men that were on board the ship, who had been tried for capital offences, they asked me if I would desert, I told them no, they said they should not hesitate, if I did not go with them immediately they would throw me overboard; when I got on shore it was my determination to get them apprehended, they kept me in the field by day, and marched me by night.</p>

On the morning of the 8th of September, I placed myself at the outside door, I saw the prisoner, he was looking about him as if he thought some person might see him; I brought him back to the shop, and took this decanter out of his breeches, this is the decanter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did he say that he took it to get some rum for the girls. - A. Mr. Shepherd told me yesterday that he heard so.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Fielding. I am an officer, in consequence of information I went to the prisoners' lodgings, on the 11th of August, about ten in the morning, one room was a one pair of stairs room and the other was a two pair, I I went in company with Brown, my brother officer, we found the house door open, we went up one pair of stairs, and opened the one pair of stairs room door, the moment we opened the room we secured the man and the woman; one of us bolted the door least any other person might come, we instantly examined their fingers and thumbs, and on each of the prisoners we found then green and yellow; I took a pin and pricked from under their nails, and took out that which had a strong smell of aqua-fortis, we both examined them; we told the prisoners they had been working lately, we told them if they smelled their own fingers they had the smell of aqua fortis.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say either of them to that. - A. They behaved exceedingly quiet, they made no answer; I then desired Mr. Brown to search the man, and to assist in searching the woman, when he had done with the man I searched the woman; among good money in her pocket I found nine shillings and two sixpences of base coin, I produce them, there was twelve shillings and sixpence good money in the same pocket; Mr. Brown assisted in searching the other pocket, I found nothing more on her person; after this I went up the other pair of stairs, which I understood to be their room, and left Brown in the charge of the prisoner; when I got into the second story room, I found the door open, I found this trunk laying on a bed, it contains forty counterfeit half crowns, three dollars, counterfeit, and six sixpences not fit for circulation; I found this little hand vice near by the fire side in the two pair of stairs room; an hand vice is used when they file, I found this piece of cork; that is likewise used in the process, I found this piece of leather with stuff upon them which they use for clearing up these sixpences to make them fit for circulation, I found this pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>A. Are they calculated for any purpose. - A. Goods that are not cut with an engine they clip them round, and then they file them; I found several sheets of sand paper, that is used also; I found this tin, it is like a cheese toaster, this put upon charcoal is used for the purpose of coining; I will not say it has positively been used; I found several pieces of sand paper that had been used, that vial I will not say what has been in it; these sixpences can be put in a state of circulation with this piece of leather; on this cloth are several stains of liquid, such as aqua fortis.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was the first person that went into the room, I immediately secured them and handcuffed them together, I saw what was taken from their nails, their hands, I believe, were coloured with aqua fortis; I searched the man, and found on him three shillings and sixpence good silver, and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any base metal on his person. A. One sixpence; I then searched the cupboard, there I found a quantity of le dust, I found this file with the filings of metal in the teeth in it; on the shelf of the same cupboard I found one counterfeit shilling, and I found some cream of tartar that is used in coining, I found by the side of the fire place in the same room, this charcoal; I found this bottle, in the cupboard, it a pears to me to be aqua fortis, but there has been asafoetida in it likewise; I found three pieces of cork in the shape they are now, they are necessary for coining; on the mantle piece I found a small piece of blacking, that is likewise used; I found these two pocket books in Mrs. Miller's pocket, and in one of the pocket books a counterfeited shilling; in this bottle I found some white liquor; these pans have been set over the fire apparently.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these used in coining. - A. Yes, I found several cloths with the appearance of aqua fortis on different parts of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. You know they are also applied to domestic purposes. - A. No doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not find any aqua fortis. - A. There was but a very little quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. There is asafoetida in the vial, you know aqua fortis is necessary to complete the coining. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no aqua fortis there. - A. Very little.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing. - A. No, just as the curtain dropped I got up to give a daughter of mine a shilling to get some oranges, I put my hand into my right hand pocket, I heard the money drop into the prisoner's hand as I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard money fall somewhere. - A. Yes, I put my hand into my pocket to see if it was safe, and there was no money at all, I had only my cloak in my pocket; he was at that time sitting by me, when I heard the money fall, he never got up from his seat, but he rolled himself into the side slip of the shilling gallery and was gone immediately, directly when he went away I said that man has robbed me, I examined my pocket and found the bottom cut in a slit, it was a new pocket made with double cotton, I had felt my money safe in my pocket about an hour before; I saw no more of him for twenty minutes, then he returned back again, the people took him in custody, I charged him with the robbery, and he returned to me four shillings and five pence halfpenny, he said if I would go down stairs with him he would give me more, and not make a bother there; I refused going down, he asked me if I was satisfied, I told him I was, but the officers being there they took him in custody. One of the shillings I should know again.</p>
               <p>- KNOTT sworn. I was the officer at Sadler's Wells that night, I was called from the pit to the one shilling gallery; when I came there he was just in the act of returning the money to the woman, at that time I said I must have the money; I took him in custody and took him into a private room, I found a one pound note and a half guinea in his fob; in the room that we searched him I found a small crooked knife that did not belong to any body.</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot swear to that. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you hired her by the week. - A. Yes, and I paid her weekly.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it that you missed any of your property. - A. I get my living in the street, I set in the street till ten or eleven o'clock, I sell fish and fruit; I always made it a rule to carry my silver and gold, or whatever I had, in a purse, which I put in my bosom; when I go to bed I take it out of my bosom and put it in my pocket, and I put my pocket under my head.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect the night that you was robbed. - A. Yes, I was robbed in the morning on the 3d of this month.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed at night, what did you do with your purse. - A. I took it out of my bosom, and put it in my pocket; as usual, I had in it a guinea, a half guinea, three seven shillings pieces, and nineteen shillings and sixpence; to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it. - A. It might be twelve o'clock when I went to bed, she and my children were in bed in the same room when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>Q. When you awoke in the morning, did you see or hear any thing of the prisoner. - A. I looked round when I awoke, to look for her, she was gone, I thought she might be gone out to get something to light the fire, I went to sleep again, I awoke again in a few minutes, I thought she might have come in, she did not come in, I said to some of the children, did you see nurse, I looked under my head for my pockets and they were gone; after I missed my pockets I put on the remainder of my things, I spoke to my neighbours, and said she had robbed me of all my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing besides your pockets with the money in it. - A. I went to my drawers, and missed two silk handkerchiefs, and a pocket handkerchief out of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at home that morning. - A. I went directly after her, but could not find her; on the seventh of this month I saw her again, a person told me she saw her go down Curtain Road; I found her at the public house next to the office, Worship-street, she was there drinking half a pint of porter, I says to her how came you to think of robbing me with five fatherless children, she replied if you live in a bad place where they rob you, more shame for them; I said you bad woman you have robbed me, she said you cannot stop me on a Sunday, I got an officer, the officer took her in a room and searched her, I was present, the officer took an old lace cap of mine out of her pocket, which had lain in my drawer.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at the sixpence. - A. I can swear to the sixpence; on Tuesday an acquaintance of mine asked me to give her change for a shilling, I took my purse out of my bosom, I gave her that sixpence, she said this is a bad sixpence, I looked at the sixpence, I said it is a bad one indeed, I gave her another and put it in the purse again; I am sure it was in my purse, the prisoner did not deny it at the justice's, she said I gave her the sixpence on that morning, but I never gave her none; the bottle I used to put a bit of myrtle in, or any thing that I brought from the market, she has made a gin bottle of it, I saw the bottle on the Thursday before.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, she lived in the house while I was there as servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 9th of July her coming into the room. - A. Yes, it was in the morning about nine o'clock, I was awaked by the rustling of the curtains, the prisoner called out to me not to be, alarmed, it was only Mary come to take the candlesticks, she took them from the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time where was the money. - A. I had put it the night before on the dressing table, it was in my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any bank notes. - A. There were notes to the amount of fourteen pounds, there was one ten pound bank note, I believe the others were one pound notes, I am sure there was a ten pound note, as to the others I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You had left this purse on your dressing table when you went to bed, I wish to know if you know what money you had in your purse. - A. I had expended some money in the day, having to go to Windsor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number of the note. - A. Yes, I sent to Liverpool to know the number of the note from whence I received it; I saw the girl lay her hand upon the place, exactly where I put my purse, but I cannot swear that it was my purse that she took away, I heard a rustling, upon that I got up, I saw her take something from the very spot where I had placed it, when I got up I was just awaked, but I was so very sleepy that I could not tell whether I should arise or not; in consequence of suspecting her having taken something, I got up soon afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to your dressing table. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your purse there. - A. No, it was not, the purse and the notes were gone, I followed down stairs after her, and while I was putting on a night gown she returned into the front room, and put the purse in the table drawer in the front room.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was this afterwards that you got up. - A. I dare say it was not above ten minutes altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard her go into another room, and there you found your purse with two one pound notes. - A. Yes, and the same seven shilling piece and some silver was in it that I had left there.</p>
               <p>Q. You had searched the drawers before she came up. - A. Yes, with my child, and the purse was not there; I pursued her afterwards from information that I received from a companion of her's; I went down to Mrs. Palmer immediately, she was in bed, I awaked her from her sleep, and I found the prisoner was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner again. - A. I saw her at Captain 
               <persName id="t18060917-20-person181">Fleming</persName>
            's in Titchfield-street, she came in there the same day before eleven o'clock, with a large parcel under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then charge her with having taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170017"/>your property. - A. Yes, she denied it, and afterwards the acknowledged it,</p>
               <p>Q. Before she acknowledged it did you tell her it would be better for her to tell you. - A. No, I told her I was determined to have my money, or she must be punished, then she confessed it; I said I saw her take it, and she confessed it immediately.</p>
               <p>- LUCAS sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 4, Rider's court, Leicester square, I produce a ten pound note. When I came in the shop about nine o'clock on the 9th of July, a decent dressed short person, I believe it was the prisoner but she was decently dressed, I cannot swear it was her, the prisoner or some other person very much like her, came into my shop, the lad in my shop was going to deliver her a small parcel, I took hold of the parcel, and sent the lad down stairs to his breakfast; I put the parcel towards her, she put down a ten pound note for me to give her change for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the parcel contain. - A. A table cloth, for four shillings and three pence halfpenny; I observed to her it was such a trifle to give change for, to which she did not make an answer, I then asked her her name and where she lived, she answered me her name was 
               <persName id="t18060917-20-person182">

            , living at No. 18, Lower Water lane, Cheapside, which I wrote upon the back of the note, I then gave her change.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the table-cloth being pledged at your shop. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear that it was the prisoner that paid that note at your shop, - A. I have very little reason to doubt it, she was very differently dressed, I gave her in change a five pound note, a two pound note and two ones, and the rest in silver; I produce the ten pound note.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live at No. 26, Cranbourn, street Leicester square</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes, on the 9th of July last, about ten in the morning, she came to redeem two articles that were in pledge, and bought different articles of wearing apparel, she paid me seven shillings and two pence for the sheets that were in pledge, and for the articles that she purchased, to the best of my recollection, two pounds ten shillings, she gave me a two pound note, and a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any other money about her. - A. I thought she had a five pound note in her hand, indeed she offered me the five pound note, I am sure the prisoner is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not offer you the five pound note.</p>
               <p>Witness. You did, you had all the notes in your hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had not.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am a parish officer; I apprehended the prisoner on the 9th of July, about eleven o'clock in the morning in Titchfield street, Marylebone, I searched her, and found two seven shilling pieces, and sixpence in small change, and some halfpence; I enquired what she had done with the bank notes, she referred me to Mr. Lucas, where she had changed it to redeem a table-cloth, which is in my possession; I looked round and saw a quantity of linen which she had purchased at a linen draper's, and the bill of parcels was with it.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Look at the ten pound note, can you speak to it from your own knowledge, can you from any mark that is on that note say that it is the ten pound note that you lost from your pocketbook. - A. No, the account that I had of it from Liverpool was, there was Strut upon it, and I see the same.</p>

Yes, it was brought there in a truck, I had it in my custody in Union street, Kingsland Road, it was placed there for repairs; I left the pipe there on the 22d of July, about ten o'clock in the morning, I missed it at ten at night; on the next morning, from information, I went to the prisoner's house, Saunders's Gardens, Kingsland Road, he is a pump maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you. - A. Mr. Anderson; at that house I found a wooden pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that pipe you found there the one you brought to Union street, Kingsland Road, on the Tuesday morning. - A. I have not the least doubt but it is the company's pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it bear the same appearance as it had when you lost it. - A. No, he had squared it then all the length but nine inches.</p>
               <p>Jury. What length was it. - A. Five yards long, it laid then across the prisoner's door, I did not take it away.</p>
               <p>SHADRACH JACKSON sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an ostler at the Basing House, Kingsland Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 22d of July observing any men, and what they were doing. - A. I saw a good many men among the pipes with a truck, I was busy, I cannot say how many nor did I see them take the pipe away, I went about my business, and when I came back again the men were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you you know his person. - A. I do not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing there. - A. I found a pipe in the prisoner's premises in a small inclosed yard, it was partly transformed into the shape of a pump, and a bit of the pipe had been partly cut away with a cross-cut saw, in order to take out the hook which is driven into the wood; one end of the pipe was not defaced at all.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170018"/>Jury. Did you find that part which was cut off. A. No, but still on the end of the pipe there was the place where the hook had been taken out very evident, I knew it to belong to the New River company.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the pipe away. - A. No, the pipe was removed from there to Kingsland Crescent, No. 1, in a gentleman's yard; the prisoner told us where he had removed it, he said it was not ours, he had bought it of a man of the name of Basing, the other side of the water.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They have taken a piece of timber out of my yard, they said it came out of the said pipe; I bought it of Mr. Basing, and I have got the receipt for my money.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am clerk to the prothonotaries in the Court of Common Pleas in the Inner Temple, the records are in the care of Mr. Sherwood and myself, we have access to them whenever it is necessary.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 14th of May last as you were going out of the office did you observe any thing. - A. I observed the prisoner at the bar standing on a stool looking into the cupboard; he had removed the stool from the other side of the office, I told him it was very impudent of him being in that situation, he told me he was looking for a piece of waste paper, I desired him to go out of the office, and come there no more, he begged pardon and went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine either of the closets, thereabouts. - A. I did not, it happened in the course of my business I examined the secondaries office, I found two shelves intirely stripped of the records.</p>
               <p>- WELLS sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am clerk to Mr. Loddington, one of the secondaries of the office in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you at any time seen the prisoner in that office. - A. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. At either of these times was your attention attracted by any noise that you heard. - A. Particularly so, it was about Hilary term in this year. I was in Mr. Loddington's office, I heard a noise of something falling, I went out and I found the prisoner in a nook or corner, to which no person that comes on business at either of the offices would go, I perceived three bundles of paper that I myself had taken out of a box, and I had put them on a high shelf, the papers belonged to the office; I asked the prisoner what business he had there, he replied, he was waiting for a person coming to the office.</p>
               <p>Q.How near was he to this paper which was so down on the ground from off this high shelf. - A. He stood within three feet of the paper, and about four feet from the place where they were taken.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. Did you sell bundles of parchment of this description to the witness in the month of May last. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you buy this parchment. - A. I bought them at three or four different times from a man in our shop, I believe the prisoner to be the man, I gave him from sixpence to ninepence a-pound for them, some of them was mouldy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. The quantity of parchment that is now produced you bought of a man two or three different times, you cannot tell me from whom you purchased it at any particular time. - A. No, the transaction took up a very little time.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in a situation to buy parchment of that description. - A. Yes, we keep a bookshop, we advertise for parchment or waste paper.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that as you purchase a vast quantity, you are not able to say that you purchased the parchment now produced of the prisoner at the bar. - A. I cannot swear positively that I bought it of the prisoner, but I believe to the best of my knowledge he is the man that I bought parchment of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any particular notice of him at the time that the parchment was sold to you. - A. I did not, he appeared to be some lawyer's clerk, some underling.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you upon your oath, will you take upon yourself to swear that is he the man. - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You have bought parchments of different persons. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever buy parchment like that of other persons. - A. No, this is a particular kind, I never bought any before like it or since.</p>
               <p>Court. Then where is your doubt, you first of all swear you believe him to be the man, then being pressed and asked about it, you say you will not swear he is the man, but now upon re-examination you say you bought no other parchment like this but of the prisoner. - A. I have no doubt in my own mind but he is the man, I think he is the man, but I will not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. He is so much like the man that sold it to you that you have no doubt. - A. I have a doubt, I cannot swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, ma'am, this kind of shuffling will not do, how came you to purchase parchment of a man whom you thought to be some lawyer's clerk, some underling, you know it could not be possible for him to have anything of this kind honestly. - A. I did purchase it.</p>
               <p>(The parchment identified by Mr. Hewlett.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the court of Common Pleas and the King's Bench, there are offices where we stick up bills for employment; being out of employ I used to go to see if my bills were underwrote, Mr. Hewlett saw me standing on a stool, he asked me what I was about, I told him I was looking for a piece of waste paper to write a bill; sometime after Mr. Sherwood met me and took me to Bow street, there the husband of Mrs. Scott said that he never saw me in his life, and I was discharged. Three weeks afterwards I met Mr. Hewlett, he says to me, you are the person that we want, he took me to Bow street, Mrs. Scott came, she said the person that sold the parchment was a dirty man, she did not believe me to be the man. On the third examination, she said she thought I was the man; I am perfectly innocent, I never saw Mrs. Scott in my life, nor did I ever take any thing out of the office in my life.</p>

             sworn. I am a hosier, I live in Great Marlborough street; on the 9th of April I paid him 5 l. 8 s. 6 d. on Messrs. Haddens' account, for which he gave me a receipt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was through distress that made me make use of that money, I meant to refund it, I was twenty months before I went to Mr. Hadden's with bad legs, and people were pressing me for money, I made use of it in that way.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable. On Wednesday the 16th of July, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going up Petticoat lane, I saw this man with the copper on his head, offering it for sale in the street to a Jew, he asked him a shilling a-pound for it, and the Jew rather saw me I believe, then he would not buy it, else he was going to buy it apparently to me; I then asked him how he came by the copper, he said he bought it of a man in the street, a stranger to him, and had given half a guinea for it, I told him he was selling it a considerable deal under the value of it, he said he did not know that; I took him in charge, I produce the copper, he had an old set of fire irons, he offered them all for fifteen shillings.</p>
               <p>(The copper identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Crown street, Moorfields, with a set of fire irons, there was a man before me with this copper on his head, he asked me if I would buy it, I asked him what he wanted for it, he asked me half a guinea, I bought it of him for my wife, she takes in washing; when I took it home it was too little for the place, I was going to sell it and buy another.</p>
               <p>Q. You was going to sell it to a Jew. - A. Yes, there was a boy walking with the Jew, I said put him in your bag, the man made answer he would sooner put my copper in the bag; with that I said I was going to sell it, if he was a mind to pay for it he might have it; he offered me a shilling a-pound for it, I did not let him have it.</p>
               <p>Court. No, the officer came and hindered you.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. I am shopman to Mr. Greenwell. On Tuesday the 22nd of July, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, a lady came in the shop and asked me if I had lost a piece of print, I immediately went out of doors and missed the print; from her information I went after the prisoner, she turned up the first turning she came to, from that into an alley where there was no thoroughfare, there I took her; she had dropped the print, I saw her drop it, I picked it up and still pursued her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it is the same woman who had the piece of print. - A. Yes, I produce it, I am sure it is my master's, there is his private mark.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am very sorry for what I have done, I came very honestly by the property; a person gave me the property, and they gave me a shilling to carry it up the street.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170023"/>Q. Did you turn you horses' heads into the gateway of the Castle inn. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many horses had you. - A. Four.</p>
               <p>Q. When you turned the heads of your horses into the gateway did you go in with them. - A. I went in with them, and then came back to look behind the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the tail of the waggon what did you find. - A. I found a box laying on the street, and the prisoner was standing about a yard from it.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he standing in the highway. - A. He was standing on the carriage way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Where were the other men standing. - A. I did not see anything of them then.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing this box in the street, and the man standing so near, what did gou do. - A. At first he says to me waggoner you have lost a box, I said to him I suppose you had a mind to take it, I have taken notice of you.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that. - A. He said nothing, but a man who was by, said stick to him, for I saw him pull it off; I laid hold of him then, as soon as I laid hold of him another man came and struck at me.</p>
               <p>Q. When you laid hold of this man did he give himself up quietly. - A. No, he struggled to get away, I got him down at the corner of Maiden lane, he struggled a minute or so, no long time; I never parted with him till he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether that box came out of your waggon. - A. Yes, that box had been loaded on the waggon at Paddington, it had been put on the top of the goods in the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it loaded high behind. - A. It was loaded a little higher than the rail of the waggon, there was a rope over across it, it was bound on at Paddington.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so secure that it could not come out without violence. - A. It was put on secure, so that we could rely on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the rope cut. - A. I do not know, I did not see the waggon afterwards till it was unloaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it was taken out, and while it was in the tail of the waggon, would it appear as large as it is. - A. No, it would appear only a foot square.</p>
               <p>Q. It is about four foot long, there was only the end visible, it would appear a smaller box. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had told the prisoner that you had noticed him, can you say whether he was or not in your judgment one of the three men that dodged the waggon. - A. I have no doubt but that he was one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had taken the prisoner to the watchhouse do you know whether he appeared to be lame at all. - A. I did not see him walk lame, but when we took him to the watchhouse he appeared to walk lame.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was upon my examination the witness said there were only two men in company, me and a stout man.</p>
               <p>Witness. There were three when I saw you first turning the corner of Wood street, but when I took you I saw no one but you and the man that struck me.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I believe you are a porter at the Swan with Two Necks, Lad lane. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 22nd of August did you happen to be in Wood street, near to this man's waggon. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any persons walking by the tail of the waggon. - A. Yes, I observed two men, I cannot say whether there were more or not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the horses were turning down the gateway of the Castle inn, did you observe any body do any thing at the tail of the waggon. - A. The prisoner at the bar and another person came to the tail of the waggon, I saw the prisoner at the bar, he was on the side nearest to me, I was at the off side of the waggon, I saw the prisoner make a plunge at the tail of the waggon; the box came to the ground that was placed at the tail of the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the box. - A. Yes, this is the box; when the box came to the ground the waggoner came immediately.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure that the prisoner made a stroke, or a plunge as you call it, at the tail of the waggon. A. Yes, and the box immediately followed it; the box came out on the left hand side, and then the prisoner was between the box and the other man, there was another person stood on the left side of the prisoner, but whether he assisted or no I cannot say, I was of the right side of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the street wide or narrow there. - A. It is just the width that two carriages could pass, I was across the street when the waggoner came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lay hold of the prisoner. - A.There was a scuffle, I called to him to stick to him, I believed that was the man that took the box.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you see any body strike the waggoner. - A. I did not, as soon as I saw him and the waggoner begin to scuffle, every thing disappeared, I saw nothing of the second man, he disappeared at that present time, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the second man come back again. - A. When I came to the assistance of the waggoner there was a man in Maiden lane, I called, Watch, stop him; he ran off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner walking some way before he made a plunge at the waggon. - A. I saw two men, there might be three, walking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of these men walk lame. - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner was conveyed to the watch-house did you see him appear to be lame. - Q. When he was taken out of the yard I could not see that he was lame, but when he was taken out of the yard he appeared to be lame, and he said he would have a coach.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Wood street, going home to my sister to bed, I saw the waggon going along Wood street, I ran across the street, and the box fell as I was going across, I saw the waggoner, I said I fancy this box belongs to you, he said I had a mind to take it, I said I had no such intention.</p>

On the night of the 23d of July last, about a quarter past three in the morning, I heard the spring of a watchman's rattle, I got out of bed and went to the front window, I slid the window up and looked out, I saw the prisoner at the bar between two watchmen at the adjoining steps. No. 13; the watchman informed me they saw her come up from my area, with a large pan of salt beef; knowing I had such a thing in the house the night before, I desired them to keep the woman till I came down and examined the bottom part of the house; when I came down to the bottom part of the house I found the entrance of the area window to the house had been broke open, and two squares of glass had been broke into one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wood work broke. - A. Yes, the centre piece of the wood that parts the two squares were broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any outside shutters to it. - A.None.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that last on the evening before. - A. About eight or nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it perfectly secure, or a rotten frame. - A. It was a very good frame, and perfectly found the night before; I found likewise five pair of silk stockings gone, which laid in a bason in a pink dye, three pair of boys worsted stockings, a pair of boys shoes, a blacking brush, and a bottle in which blacking had been in, a saw, and the rims of an umbrella, all these things were below stairs in the lobby; there was a door to the kitchen, but that was not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose they could have got up stairs. - A. Yes, they might have gone to any part of the house whatever; about eight o'clock the next morning we found there was a flannel petticoat missing belonging to my wife, I went to the watchhouse and the constable found it on her.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman took the woman did you go to her. - A. Yes, I went to the watchman, and saw the woman with his property on her, except the petticoat, which was afterwards found at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of the prisoner before. - A. I saw her on a step of a gentleman's door in the same street, a week or a few days before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to know what you found upon me. - A. There were six pair of silk stockings we out of the dye, tied up under your petticoats.</p>

Yes, past three o'clock in the morning on the 24th of July, I saw the prisoner at the bar stand at the area gate No. 12, Parliament street, she was outside the railing when I first saw her, I saw her afterwards go down in that area, and she came up again almost directly; after she came up she removed something from the grating of the steps to the door No. 13, I directly went to see what she was doing of; when she saw me coming she ran away and left the things, I ran and laid hold of her and brought her back; when I came up to the door I saw this pan stand on the steps full of salt beef, with a white wash hand bason with three pair of silk stockings, three pair of worsted stockings, I blacking brush, and a pair of boys' shoes, an old umbrella frame and a saw she had got in her hand; I then sprang my rattle, which assembled several more watchmen and patrols, I called to Mr. Winsor, he came down and owned the things.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose house was it. - A. I cannot call to mind whose house it is, I have not lodged in it long; I have known the prisoner and her husband for several years, they lodged at a public house, and they had a little difference with their landlord, she said she could not wash there, I said she might come and wash at my house, as I was going to wash; she came on the 24th of May and brought her things, and we both washed together; one of my neighbours came and told me my child had gone down the court, I went after the child, and that was the time, I suppose, that she took the locket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your locket again. - A. Yes, at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. What is that paper you have in your hand. - A. It is a bill dated 18th of March 1806, for twenty two pound fifteen shillings and seven-pence, that bill was produced to me by the prisoner, I cannot tell what day, it was in the latter part of last March.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did he produce that bill to you. - A. He told me it would be doing his landlady a great favour if I would give him the money for it, she being a baker, it being drawn upon Mr. Savage, a customer of her's: accordingly I gave him the money.</p>
               <p>Q. It had some time to run. - A. Yes, he having deducted the discount, which was two or three shillings, I gave him the balance; I had very frequently bills of him before drawn upon Mr. Savage, therefore nothing passed at that time but what I have related.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this pass. - A. In the front office of my own house in <placeName id="t18060917-41-crimeloc221">Castle-street, Falcon Square, Aldersgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that bill you have in your hand is the bill that he gave you. - A. I am sure I kept it in my own custody till the 21st of May, when it became due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue still in your service. - A. No<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170026"/>I had discharged him on the 10th April, in consequence of a bill that he had forged.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the bill on the 21st of May. - A. On the 21st of May I sent a clerk with it for payment, I sent it this particular way, having reason to suspect, in consequence of what had previously passed; I sent a note with the bill and desired Mr. Savage to call; it was not paid; this is the same bill; I am sure that the same that I had sent by the clerk was returned by him to me; the whole of the bill is written by the prisoner himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner's hand writing. - A. Yes, he was writing under my own eye, he was an elegant writer, he was transcribing letters for me two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. From your own knowledge of his hand writing, do you believe it is his hand writing. - A. The body of the bill and the acceptance is his hand writing; the body of the bill I am certain is his hand writing, and the acceptance seems to be his hand writing seigned.</p>
               <p>Q. The body of the bill and the acceptance is his hand writing, you do not speak to any other part; the drawer you do not speak to. - A. No, the drawer has none of his hand writing about it.</p>

No, my wife told me that nobody had been to the room but the girl and her; immediately after dinner this girl went out, she came home late in the evening very much in liquor, she went out a second time and came home very much intoxicated, and went to bed; on Tuesday morning when I arose she was gone out, and while I was getting my breakfast she came in very much intoxicated, she remained there till between one and two in the afternoon asleep, then she came down stairs and went into the kitchen, and sent a lad for a pint of beer; I denied sending her the beer, she immediately went out and I never saw her till between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, she came home very much in liquor and went to bed; I got up at four o'clock in the morning in order to detain her before she went out; I went into the room to tell my wife that she was come down, and the girl went out, I never saw her after till I applied to an officer and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. You never searched her all this time. - A. No, we never searched her till we applied to an officer, we found her in the street, just above my house on Wednesday about one o'clock in the afternoon; in the course of the time, I heard she had bought a great many things with the money; I found a one pound note upon her.</p>

Yes, he is foreman to a bootmaker of the name of Waylett; he came to me on Thursday the 28th of August, and told me his master would thank me if I would pay the account, it was only four pounds, I gave him a draft on Barclay's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You sometime afterwards had a suspicion of a forged draft. - A. I had, in consequence of that I did my endeavour in finding out the man; by the description the boy gave me I had a suspicion of the prisoner; I took the boy and desired he would go into Mr. Waylett's shop, and see if he saw the man in the shop that gave him the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time were there any persons in the shop. - A. There were several.</p>
               <p>Q. That was about two or three o'clock. - A. Thereabouts; the boy came out and said the man was not there, I went into the shop, he was not there; at ten o'clock Mr. Waylett sent up to me, to let me know the prisoner was come home; I then went down with an officer and the boy, I directed the boy if he saw the prisoner to pull my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened the door. - A. The prisoner; the boy pulled my coat, I then asked the boy if that was the man, he said it was; I desired the officer to take him in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you at any time before the master came in tell him what he was apprehended for. - A. No, nor to any body.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that these things, that you put in the bureau, belonged to the prisoner. - A.

               <p>- MATTHEWS sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a fruiterer and green-grocer, New Willmot-street, Foundling Hospital. I have known the prisoner some time, I was employed by him on the 13th of July last. He came to me, and said, he was going to leave Jervis's service, and asked me if I would move his boxes into Theobald's-road, which I did; I removed them from there and the prisoner helped me (I cannot say as to the day of the month), there were two deal boxes and two trunks. When I removed them from Theobald's-road to Mr. Pocock's, there were some plates and glasses in a basket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it. - A. About seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever he employed you to move to Theobald's-road, you moved them, and you also removed them to Mr. Pocock's. - A. Yes, I received them of the prisoner, he said they belonged to him. I delivered them at Mr. Pocock's.</p>

Yes, she seemed very unwilling to let Fox, the officer, look at any papers; Mr. Fox apprehended her in a shop in the street, he told her he had a warrant for her, she asked to go home, she went home and put a cloak on, he said he must look at her papers, she says you shall not look at them, then he replied I must by force; she took first out one paper and then another, and huddled them up, however, we arrived at the deeds; this is the conveyance of the estate to Mr. Cooper.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the clothes in such a condition that you suspected there had been a child. - A. Yes, upon that we sent for a midwife, she came and saw these things; after the midwife had looked at them, I awaked the prisoner, I said Hannah awake, she made some reply, but what she said I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When she awoke in what state did she appear to be. - A. She appeared as if she had been drinking, I fancy in the course of the evening she had been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to have been drinking, so as not to be able to understand your questions. - A. She did; I asked her where the child was, she replied she had had no child; I said to her Hannah you lay in an indecent posture, get up and have your bed made, she said she would not get up, her bed did not want making, I said you must get up your bed does want making, and another thing, I know there must be a child about; I told her if she would not get off the bed by fair means we must take her off; the midwife took hold of one arm and I took hold of the other, we got her off the bed, and sat her on a chair, there were two or three more people in the room, they lit a candle, I took the bed, and began to throw what I thought was the bed from the head to the foot.</p>
               <p>Q. What was that that you thought was the bed. A. It was something in a sack, I saw nothing then, I took the other that lay against the ground, and the last thing that I took off the ground I saw something lay all of a heap, it lay upon that part of the bed where her arms and her head was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find that matter to be. - A. Why a child.</p>
               <p>Q. Alive or dead. - A. Dead, it was wrapped up in a piece of coarse flannel.</p>
               <p>Q. But what was laying upon it at the time that she was laying her head and arms upon it. - A. Nothing but these two sacks that were stuffed with something, it lay under them two sacks, it was completely covered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it sewed up in a cloth. - A. No, it was folded up in a cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that cloth wet or dry. - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any water about in her room. - A. That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at her person. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had children yourself. - A. Sixteen.</p>
               <p>Q. In your opinion had she lately been delivered of a child. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a boy or a girl. - A. A female.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing about the child, how it was born. - A. She told me on the following day that it was born on a Saturday; that night I shewed her the child, she said she had no child, it was not her's.</p>
               <p>Q. But the next day she told you that she was delivered of a Saturday. - A. Yes, she told me it was by a married man, which was the reason of her denying it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at all suspected before that that she was with child. - A. O yes, she lived in the neighbourhood some time, and I have suspected is many times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any baby linen in the room. - A. No, I found no one thing; we searched first for the child, and then we searched for them.</p>
               <p>Court. When you awoke this woman she appeared to have been in liquor. - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had awaked herself, then she said she had no child, then she understood your question. A. She seemingly to me was very much overcome in liquor as she lay asleep, I then roused her and awakened her, and then I did not think she was so much in liquor as I thought she was, I shook her and asked her what she had done with the child, she said that she had no child, I said I was sure that she had.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not recollect your watch before you came out of the room. - A. No, and when I came down stairs again, the woman was gone out of the house, I went out of the door but I could not find her, I did not see her again till she was apprehended; Gillmore the officer, shewed me the watch at Queen square.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Queen square. On Monday night the 11th of October, I was out with a warrant to take up disorderly persons; on Tuesday morning about two o'clock, I apprehended the prisoner at the corner of Whitcomb Street, in company with two other women of the town, I saw her almost in a state of nakedness, and two women were dressing her, I conveyed them all three to the watchhouse; in the pocket of the prisoner I found this watch, I asked her how she came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170037"/>by it, she told me it was her husband's watch; there being a particular mark in the inside case, I asked her if she knew the watch by any particular mark on the inside case, she said there was no mark in the inside case, it was quite plain; that convinced me it was not her husband's watch; I enquired at all the houses in Whitcomb street, till I found the prosecutor out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Gilmore asked me for five pounds, and then he said I should have the watch again; he found a tin box in my pocket and fifteen duplicates, there he stands.</p>
               <p>Gilmore. The box and the duplicates are as she describes, but all the rest is false; why, I hold the duplicates are for five shillings, it is not five pound, it is for what she had at the watchhouse that I am accountable for.</p>
               <p>(The watch identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never saw that lady in my life before, nor do I ever recollect seeing that gentleman before I saw him on Westminster bridge; he wanted to do a very bad thing with me, and instead of the money he gave me the watch to keep me quiet, he said he had not a farthing of money about him; he wanted to do that which does not become a man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same person that you saw there that had given you the draft. - A. The self same, that person was the prisoner; when I came in he asked me if I had got the money, I replied no; I told him they said it was a forgery, and they had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170038"/>paid me the money; that was Mr. Pattisal and another gentleman that was with him said it was a forgery; then he replied, I must go to the person that gave it me; I made an answer no, you must not go at all; he got up up and I got hold of him by the collar, he was too strong and too nimble for me, he got out of the door, I made hue and cry, and he was making off across Holborn, making as it were for Brookes street in Holborn; Mr. Pattisal was at the door then, he made hue and cry, and in consequence of that he was taken before he got across Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get up to him at the time he was taken. - A. I was close by, I saw him when he was taken, he came into the coffee house after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing at the time he was taken or afterwards. - A I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the draft to see how much it was for. - A. Yes, one hundred and fifty pounds, upon Messrs. Bond and Co. he gave me the direction to go to Messrs. Bond and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner, and tell me whether you have any doubt that he was the person that gave you the draft, and whom afterwards you found in the coffee house. - A. I think it is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you entertain any doubt. - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was it you saw him at Seagoe's coffee house. - A. About three in the afternoon, I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. You brought him a letter from Gray's inn. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He opened the letter in your presence did he not. - A. He had broke the wafer as he came down stairs, he had not entirely opened the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you saw the letter in his hand before it was completely opened. - A. Yes, it was not completely opened.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you saw him take the check that you was to go with, out of that letter. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He took it out of that letter which you had brought sealed, and desired you to go to Mr. Bond with it to get the money, and he would wait your return. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then when you informed him that the bankers had not paid it, they believed it to be a forgery, he said he must go to the man that sent it. A. He said he must go to the man that gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. You were the person that gave it though you brought it from another person, to whom did you give the check to at Messrs. Bonds and Co.; when they refused payment you left it there. - A. I left it with Mr. Pattisal.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BOND sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. You are the master of the Seagoe coffee house. - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before this time. - A. I never saw him before that day to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his name. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at the coffee house at the time when the check was given to the porter. - A. I was in the way when the prisoner came in first, he called for a glass of brandy and water, and said that he expected a letter in the name of William Williams; in the course of ten or fifteen minutes a porter brought the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Metcalfe. - A. The same man, I called the waiter and sent the letter to him; he came down and sent the porter with the draft, I saw him do that; I saw nor heard no more of it till I heard a bustle with the prisoner at the bar, I heard the bustle of the prisoner running out, and being brought in again in custody. I was not there when Metcalfe first returned; the prisoner is the same person, I have no doubt of his person.</p>

On the 8th of August last, he presented a draft, the draft which I have in my hand, for one hundred and fifty pounds for payment; I asked him how he would have it, meaning what sort of notes, he said it was not material, I then asked him for whom he received it, he told me for Mr. Williams; knowing it to be a forgery, or at least strongly believing it, or having little doubt about it, I desired him to walk into the accompting house, that I might question him how he came by it more closely; I asked him who he was, he said he was a porter of Gray's Inn; I then told him he must go back to Mr. Williams, from whom he had it, and I would go with him, and if he was stopped on the way by any person to receive the money from him to take them in custody, I should be close at hand to assist him in taking them; he went to Seagoe's coffee-house, and I went after him, he went in, and in a short interval of time the prisoner at the bar rushed out of the coffee-house; I immediately cried out, Stop him, and followed him, before he had got across the way he was seized; I do not recollect who took hold of him first, he was brought back to the coffee house, I had hold of him myself; I sent for an officer and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass there from the prisoner at the time he was apprehended. - A. He expressed a readiness to go any where, he made no opposition after I got him; there were several that stopped him, and there was a mob collected, as is usual on these occasions, in two minutes, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. He was taken to a magistrate. - A. He was taken to Bow-street, and was afterwards committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a customer of your's of the name of Mr.

I assuredly say that I am intirely innocent of the charge I am indicted for, I laboured under very heavy embarrasments, in consequence of that I made application to a person for money, he sent me this draft to Seagoe's coffee-house, and the consequence of my not going by my right name was for fear of being arrested; I sent the porter with the draft; when he returned, in consequence of seeing people with him, I ran away, the person that sent me the draft was to have half the money; I made application to find him out but I could not; being in embarrassed circumstances the person promised to assist me, he sent me that draft, which was the only way of bringing me into trouble.</p>

               <p>TIMOTHY LEARY sworn. I am a labouring man, I was working out in the country all the week, I came home on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room on the Sunday when the prisoner and Mrs. Dee were there. - A. I was. The prisoner desired her to dress herself to go out a walking, after she had dressed herself, then the prisoner said she could not go out because she was sick at her stomach; go out said she, to Mrs. Dee, for a glass of cherry brandy for me, Mrs. Dee went out, and left the prisoner and me and three or four men in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. While Mrs. Dee was gone, did you see the prisoner do any thing. - A. Yes, I saw the key in the box, she took the clothes that lay on the top of the box and laid them on the bed, and then put down the box lid again; after that she went to the box again, she did so three times.</p>

This lady here (pointing to the prisoner) said will you have a pipe of tobacco, she went out and brought in seven pennyworth of tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you told the woman of the house that you had seen the prisoner go to her chest. - A. On the Monday morning when she searched her box, I told her the prisoner had searched her box two times.</p>

             sworn. I took the prisoner in custody on the fourteenth of July, I searched and found upon her three guineas and eleven shillings, I produce them, she said they were her own.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor) Look at these guineas, is there any one of these guineas that has got any thing particular about it. - A. This is a remarkable guinea, I had it for two years and a half, the head is a different way from the others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had sent my box on in the waggon, I went to look for creditable lodgings, I asked a woman that I met in the street, to recommend me to creditable lodgings, I found myself mistaken, she recommended me to Mrs. Dee's, Broad-street, St. Giles's, when I went there, Mrs. Dee took off the sheets from her own bed and she laid on the blankets, I left them on Wednesday, and on Sunday I went to her house, I took out my purse in which I had four guineas and nineteen shillings in silver; on Monday morning when I came there again, they swore I had robbed them, she gave me liberty to go to her box, there was nothing in it, and I believe all in the house was not worth ten shillings; she took the advantage of a poor stranger; I hope the gentlemen of the jury will take pity on me, that is my purse and my money. I gave her a new skirt, two silver spoons, three white handkerchiefs, six new knives and forks, and an apron. I think it is hard to loose that money, when my poor husband is in the army at Brighton.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Upon your oath did she give you these articles. - A. She exchanged a skirt, for a shawl, and she gave me a couple of old handkerchiefs and six knives and forks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of two silver spoons. - A. There were two bits of a mustard spoon, they are not worth a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she give them to you. - A. Two or three days after she came to me, I believe they are in my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they silver. - A. I do not know, they look like silver.</p>

               <p>Court. After you saw the pocket book taken out of the gentleman's pocket by the prisoner, did you see what he did with it. - A.

               <p>Mr. Valiants. Did you look over the balustrades. - A. I did, and I saw a red pocket book lie on the sterlings below, close to where he was; a gentleman got a waterman to get it, I gave the captain my address, and went away.</p>

               <p>Q. What may it be worth. - A. I cannot say, I look upon it to be one of the common sort.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you deliver the book to before the magistrate. - A. I cannot swear, I believe to Mr. alderman Lea, it was delivered again to me immediately; after that I had it locked up in my house, and the day before yesterday I left the book at Beal's house, the man that was with me, it has only been out of my possession twice; I have not a doubt but it is the same book by the writing that is in it.</p>

            , he declared that he came to England, and was going to sea in three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever claim that pocket book. A. He did not in my hearing, he knew at that time he was accused of stealing it; he heard every thing (the court was very full at the time), the deposition was taken in the minute book, and then a fair copy, as it is here, was read over in the prisoner's presence, on purpose for cross examination.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose your gelding. - A. My horse was put in the field on the 3d of July at nine o'clock; I wanted my horse very early the next morning, I got up about four o'clock, I believe it might be half after four when I got to the field, I missed my horse, I brought my other horses home, and then I went and searched for this horse, I could not find nor hear any thing of him; about ten o'clock I came to London, and went to Mr. Dixon in Barbican, I told him I had lost a horse; from that I went to Mr. Sadler's in Goswell street; then I came to Smithfield, I believe it was about five o'clock when I came there, there was about four horses tied up to the rails, and there among them four I saw my horse; I said to my friend who was with me, there is my horse, he was tied up to the rails for sale; me and my friend went over the way and contrived how we should get the horse, I went and got a constable and he went and cheapened the horse; I came back again with the constable with me, I told him there was a horse there that I had lost, I looked at the horse and asked the price, whether he was to be sold, and who it belonged to; me, says the prisoner at the bar; I directly then gave the constable charge of him; the man that was with me took him over to the Greyhound, and I took the gelding there likewise. The constable then gave the landlord charge of the horse, and we went to the lord-mayor the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it is your horse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a mare or a gelding. - A. A gelding.</p>
               <p>Q. Any marks. - A. Blind with one eye, he has got a blaze in his face; we have got the horse here just by.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it is the horse you had lost. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the man. - A. No, I never saw the man with my eyes, till I saw him in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you lost the gelding that you saw it again. - A. I saw it the next day, the day before it had been at work in the hay-cart all day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him again he was public in the market. - A. Yes, with his tail done up in a nice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170045"/>order.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a very nice horse perhaps. - A. Yes, it is a very good one.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked who owned the horse, the prisoner said it is my horse, did not he tell you he bought him at Bromley. - A. He did say something about that.</p>
               <p>Court. What colour was the horse. - A. Black.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What was it, a horse or a gelding. - A. A gelding.</p>
               <p>- WINTER sworn. I am a shopkeeper at Dulwich. On the 4th of July I went to Mr. Sadler's, I met Mr. Horton, he told me he had lost his horse, he was looking for it; he said he had been to the other repositories, he was then going to Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with him. - A. I did; there I saw the horse which Mr. Horton owned, I asked him to look at him again to make himself sure, he did so, and then he agreed to go and fetch a constable, and that I should bargain for the horse; I did, I asked the prisoner at the bar if that horse was his, he said yes; I asked him if he had had him long, yes, he said, a good while; I asked him if he was a good draught horse, he said yes, he broke a chain in last week's drawing; I asked him the price of it, he said fourteen pounds, I then saw the horse run up and down the market, I cautioned him not to say it was his horse if it was not, as many people brought horses to Smithfield that never saw them before; he said it was his horse, he had had him a good while. I then bid him seven pounds for it, I bid him that money to detain him, he said he would not take that, but he would take ten pounds; then Mr. Horton came with the constable, he told the prisoner it was his horse; the prisoner said it was very odd, he bought it that morning at Bromley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he bought it of at Bromley. - A. No, he did not know the man, he had a string of horses, and he bought one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the horse he was publicly in the market. - A. Yes, and he told me he lived at Bromley.</p>
               <p>Q. It is no uncommon thing to make a horse look fine, or to set him off in order to sell him to the best advantage. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- BETTS sworn. I am a constable; on Thursday the 4th of July last, Mr. Horton, the prosecutor, came to me at the corner of Hosier lane and asked me whether I was a constable, I told him yes; he said he wanted me to come along with him, he said he had lost a horse the night before, and he had found the horse in Smithfield; I went up along with him, I saw Mr. Winter with the prisoner and the horse; Mr. Horton asked the man who was the owner of the horse, the prisoner at the bar said that he owned the horse, Mr. Horton says, I give you charge upon suspicion of this man stealing his horse; I took him in charge and took him to the Poultry compter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner notwithstanding the accusation said it was his horse. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 4th of July I went into the country, our business was dead, I went down to see my brother, with intention of going into business myself; I intended to purchase a horse to carry goods about the country; when I came to Bromley this man came out of the road with five horses in a string together; he asked me if I wanted to purchase a horse, he asked me several times over, in consequence of that he prevailed upon me; I asked him the price, he said ten guineas, I told him I did not want one; he asked me again, he said the horse was rather refractory, he wished to sell it, I asked him the lowest that he would take for it, he said nine guineas, I bid him seven guineas, he took it; I had but eight guineas and three shillings; I took him to Smithfield, I had not money enough left to purchase any goods, and therefore I thought to sell the horse to see if I could get any thing by it, and to buy another cheaper, and to go into business myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

The door was perfectly fastened safe, and the window was shut down; we returned the same day, my wife returned first, I returned about nine o'clock the same evening, I supposed the robbery happened that evening; I saw no difference till the Tuesday following. On the Tuesday following I observed the window curtain on the ground floor was tore, and pinned over as a deception for us not to see it, the curtain was down, and likewise the pulley line of the sash was broken.</p>

             sworn. I went out about four in the afternoon, and came home about seven in the evening; I did not at that time take any notice of the house, I did not perceive any thing amiss till Tuesday, I then perceived the window curtain was very much torn indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that did you look to see if you had lost any thing. - A. Yes, I missed my gown directly out of my drawer in the same room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else. - A. Nothing else then, we missed a cloak and a sheet before in February.</p>
               <p>Q. That we cannot enquire about; this was in July. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your gown again. - A. I saw it on the 8th of July, the same day the prisoner was taken, the office produced it to the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner live. - A. The very next door, she kept the house, we had her place searched before she went to the justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same day. - A. Yes, we found a pocket book with a great many duplicates in it, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170046"/>officer has them, I found them myself in the ticking of her bed, in her house amongst the feathers or stocks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>

             sworn. Q. Are you the officer who searched the prisoner's house on Tuesday the 8th of July. - A. Me, and my brother officer, Renley, executed a search warrant on the house, the prisoner was present at the time, I told her my business; I searched all but the bed, the prisoner requested I would not search that, because it was not in a situation for a man to see; I requested Mrs. Johnson to search it, Mrs. Johnson immediately called to me and said she had found this book, I was just at the door, I saw her take it from the bed; in that pocket book I found the duplicate of a cloak, which appears to be the property of Mrs. Johnson; the prisoner immediately said if I would let her go she would go and take the gown out, she had pawned it for fifteen shillings, I told her I could not let her go, she must consider herself in custody; she did go, and I followed her, she went into the shop and asked the pawnbroker to bring down that gown she had pawned on Saturday night; the gown was sent down by some one that was in the warehouse; at that moment I said stop this, it is a stolen gown, produce it before the magistrate immediately.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did you advise to prosecute for a capital offence. - A. I laid it that way, I thought it was so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Coakley. - A. Yes, he had worked with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the month of August, had he left your employ. - A. Three months before, I think he came to my shop about six weeks before that, and did some work, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a workshop have not you. - A. Yes, the house stands in the street, and the shop is built in my yard, between the house that I live in, and the next house in the next street, it all belongs to one landlord.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the door of the workshop go to. - A. In the yard. On the 30th of August, about two o'clock, I and a young man that worked along with me went down to Blackwall, to see a ship launched. I had not been in the shop from two o'clock on the Saturday till about seven o'clock the next morning; I then observed a drawer on my bench, and another man's bench with many of the articles that should have been in them out, but nothing from that part gone, this gave me a suspicion; I looked about the place, I found there was a cramp gone, a stock, and four saws; I missed these at seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You have a yard. - A. Yes, our common way of entering into the yard is through the house, but there is a gate that leads into the street, and there is a door by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what state you left that door. - A. I had not opened that door for two or three days, we do not open it only when we get timber in, if any person is in the yard they have free access to the shop; I did not observe any door or window broken open. I have seen some of the articles again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would wish to ask my master to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was one circumstance which I think was rather to his advantage. A young child had been playing with a pair of boots the prisoner had of me, the child had dropped a silver tea-spoon in one of them without our knowledge, the prisoner took them home and returned the spoon. While he worked with me, his character was that of an honest man.</p>

I am an officer; I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the second of September, and upon searching him, I found two duplicates; one is a duplicate of two saws, pledged at Mr. Tillier's in Field-lane, the other is a duplicate of another saw, pledged on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170047"/>same day, the 1st of September, at Mr. Fleming's in Fleet-market; I asked Mr. Tillier if he knew the person that pledged them, he said yes. I went to Mr. M'Milian's and he swore to the property.</p>
               <p>- TILLIER sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I produce two saws, pledged by Gommersall, in the name of the White, for three shillings and sixpence, on the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>- GOMERSALL sworn. I am in the East-London militia.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time pawn at Mr. Tillier's two hand saws. - A. Yes, on Monday, in the name of White, they gave me three shillings and sixpence on them. I got these saws from the prisoner, he gave them me on Monday about nine o'clock, for the purpose of pawning them, and he told me they were his own saws.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you pawn them in his own name. - A. He told me that as he was a chair maker and was going to sell the tickets, he did not like his fellow tradesmen to know he was so poor. Mr. Tillier asked me whose they were? I told him they belonged to Coakley, he knew Coakley very well, and then he took them in.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you understood they were his. - A. Yes. On Sunday morning between six and seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner with these hand saws, he asked one Parkes and me in Field-lane, to wait there for him, he said he had some tools at his landlady's that he had left for some rent, and he went and fetched them. He said going along, Parkes, you did not think that I had got such good tools as these, as I was a soldier; I said that I did think that he had, because he had often told me that he had such tools; we carried them over Blackfriar's bridge, and left them at a public house. On Monday when we were at the parade, he said to me, Gomersall, come up to London with me. I want to pledge some of them tools, I went with him, we went into Fleet-market and pledged a saw, and I took two saws to Mr. Tillier's in Field-lane; I only pawned the saws for him. The next day he asked me to carry the things to Shoe-lane, I carried them up in the middle of the day to a public house in Shoe-lane. He then asked me to go to Mr. Tillier's, and ask him if he would take a cramp in pawn, I told him I should not go, as I did not understand what a cramp was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What hour did I ask you to go to Mr. Tillier's and pawn that cramp. - A. About five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you go. - A. I did. Mr. Tillier would not take it in, he asked what this work was about the two saws. Previous to that time, Stanton had been to me, I told him the saws belonged to Coakley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in custody at that time.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Stanton.) Did Gomersall tell you that the saws belonged to Coakley. - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Gommersall) What time on Sunday morning was it that you separated from him. - A.The left of our parting was when he went to fetch the things from Mother Burke's house, when he came t, d - n her, says he, I have got the things from the old b - h, and I will not pay her a farthing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the Saturday night we were playing a game at back gammon, at a house of an acquaintance of his, where did you part with me at that time.</p>
               <p>A. At the public house door. He had got some money for some stools that we had been making, and he would not pay the reckoning, ; we quarrelled, and I was almost ready to fight with him, then he parted with half the money. There is one thing will prove that he is the person; he said that when he was at the gate he was stopped by the watchman of the night, he told them at the watch-house that he was a soldier and a cabinet-maker; the constable of the night let him go, he having his apron on.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am shopman to Mr. Fleming, I produce two saws, pledged on the 1st of September; one was pledged by the prisoner to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>- TURNER sworn. I took in the stock and one bit, on the 2d of September, on the early part of the day, which I suppose was pledged by the prisoner. I produce them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never pawned the articles, I believe I was in custody at the time.</p>
               <p>TURNER. From the slight knowledge I have of him, I have no doubt. He told me at Hatton-Garden that he was in custody at the time, the magistrate told him he was apprehended in the afternoon, this was pledged in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>(The articles identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Gomersall and I was both in one regiment and in one company. He was generally at me when I was working at Greenwich, to learn him my trade; the chief objection was, I had not tools when I was at Mr. M'Millan's place, he wanted me to take these tools, I said if such a thing happens, I shall be the only person to blame, I will have nothing to do with it. On the evening we came up from Greenwich, we were together till between twelve and one o'clock, the reason that we quarreled, I wanted to go home. I was sitting down looking on at them at back-gammon; I went to the Artillery passage and slept there two hours, he came and another man to me, he had these things; this man met him in Finsbury-square, if he was here, he he would prove that he met this man with the things this man asked him if he knew me, he told him that he knew me, and that he had left me asleep in Artillery-lane, they both came together and awoke me out of my sleep; I never knew a word of it till he brought them to me, though the pawnbroker says I pawned the tools. I never pawned any of the tools.</p>

               <persName id="t18060917-69-person648">August. </persName>
            - A. Yes, Gore I had seen two or three times in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time of the day had you seen Gore first. - A. To the best of my recollection he was there about ten o'clock in the morning, he came again in the afternoon, but I cannot tell what time; Cuddiford was with him in the morning and in the afternoon. In the evening I saw Gore and O'Donnell there about nine o'clock, when O'Donnell came down Gore was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the room did they sit in. - A. Sometimes they sat in the parlour, and sometimes in the tap room, they were drinking together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cuddiford there. - A. He was drinking with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170049"/>Q. Where were they drinking together. - A. In the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the three, or all of them of these names you have mentioned, were in the parlour, was O'Donnell in the parlour. - A. He did go in, he came out directly; Gore went in the parlour, and Cuddiford was in and out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Court. And Gore the same. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did you or did you not see the other prisoner Carter there. - A. No, I did not, I did not know him, he might be there for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You in point of fact did not see him there. A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in the conduct of O'Donnell, if there was describe it. - A. When he came down stairs he came singing, laughing, and dancing.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Gore at that time. - A. Gore was sitting there to the best of my recollection, he was sitting on a chair by the door way.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us there was a door that led from the parlour into the bed room. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fasten that door, and at what time. - A. I fastened it when Mr. Kendall went to lie down about four o'clock to rest himself; about six o'clock in the afternoon I locked the door again myself, I am sure I left it fastened, I put my hand against it and tried it, I hung the key up in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you retire to rest that night. - A. About ten minutes after eleven; I took the key out of the bar, and went to unlock the bed room door, as there was no latch to the door, I found the door open.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in a different state to what you had left it at a quarter after six o'clock. - A. Yes, I went to the bureau, I found it had been forced open.</p>
               <p>One of the jury. When you first looked at the lock of the bureau was it sticking up. - A. The bolt was shut as if it was locked.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. How was the shot of the lock. - A. It was completely up; I opened the little drawers where the notes were, I found they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Cuddiford. - A. I had seen him frequently at the house ever since Mr. Kendall has been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Cuddiford a person that Mr. Kendall ever employed. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot of your own knowledge tell me how Cuddiford was employed in the day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, that the last time you saw the notes was at six o'clock in the morning, that was quite daylight. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.O'Donnell was not in the house till the evening of that day. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Cuddiford was there the greatest part of the day, going backwards and forwards from the tap to the parlour frequently. - A. Yes, he had been used to the house a great length of time before we came there.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he knew every room in the house, and every place there. - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean as far as from the parlour to the tap room and the bed room. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew the house better than these persons that were dancing and drinking there. - A. It was the first time that I saw O'Donnell there myself.</p>
               <p>Q. And this honest Mr. Cuddiford, that had known the house a great while, he was there a great while in the day time, and O'Donnell was not there till the evening. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw your notes after six o'clock in the morning, Cuddiford was there a great many times in the course of the day, and he was in the bar. - A. I did not see him in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. He had an opportunity of doing it if he had seen fit. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.O'Donnell came in the evening, might not the notes have been lost in the morning while Mr. Cuddiford was going backwards and forwards, as well as in the evening. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore for any thing you know they might have been lost in the morning when any body was going backwards and forwards, as well as in the evening. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore O'Donnell not being there till the evening, the notes might be taken away in the morning by any body so disposed so to do, for any thing you know. - A. Yes, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cuddiford you say you do not know a great deal of. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any good of him, I am speaking in plain English; do not you know of your own knowledge that he is as big a thief as there is in London at this time. - A. I cannot say that, his character is quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. How long have you lived there. - A. About three months, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How many rooms are there. - A. A tap room, bar, small parlour, and a bed room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Only one bed room. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Gore is the son of a respectable baker in Bond street. - A. He is for any thing that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know perfectly well that he is the son of a respectable baker. - A. I am told so.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that before this robbery took place he frequented your house for refreshment as workmen do who frequent your house, as he lived with his father as you knew before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You described some extraordinary singing and dancing in your cellar, did that never happen before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A drunken man dancing and singing, that never happened since you have been under the Worcester coffee house; have not you always been of the opinion that O'Donnell was very noisy, have you not always said so. - A.

               <p>Q. Tell me, did any thing pass between Gore and you, and what. - A. He asked me if I would go along with him, I told him I would; as we were walking along I told him that there was some money that I thought we might get at; he asked me if I thought so, I told him I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any reason why you thought so. - A. The people that lived there before Kendall, I had seen them pass in and out to get change there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Gore that. - A. No, he said if I thought so we would try, he thought, it would be a good thing for us if we could get it; he asked me if he should see me ormeet me the next morning, which day was the 29th of August; he came in the morning, he asked me if I thought any thing more of what we were speaking of yesterday, I told him yes, I thought there was money in the bureau which stood in the bed room, and the key hung up in the bar; he went away and said he would soon come back, he came back about noon and asked for something to drink at the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you down in the cellar when he came down. - A. I was, he had something to drink, we had some gin and bitters, and so had Kendall and his wife (she went by the name of Mrs. Kendall); soon after that he asked me for the key of the bed room, I unhooked it and gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the key hanging at that time. - A. Inside of the bar, he took the key, he went towards the door, and he brought me back the key again, I hung the key up where I took it from; he was absent with the key about half a minute; after he gave me the key, and I hung it up, he said the door was open and he said he thought he could do it, he went in, and tried to open the bureau; I heard him say that he had broke the top of the scissars in the lock, and that he could not open it, he brought out a cloak or a black silk handkerchief, I did not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with that. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it left with you. - A. No, it was never in my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing further pass between you and Gore at that time. - A. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Gore again. - A. He came down to me at the top of the stairs in the evening, and said that he would go and look for John O'Donnell, I think it was between seven and eight o'clock then; he went away, and I went into Tottenham Court Road with a trunk; when I came back I went down into the cellar to get something to eat.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were down first in the cellar, at what time did you first see Gore. - A. I think it must be nine or between nine and ten, he came down just before the other men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time know the persons of the other men. - A. A very slight acquaintance, I never saw but one of them before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. After Gore came down how soon did you see the other prisoner's. - A. They came down directly.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Carter in the tap room. - A. No, he was in the bed room; I believe Gore was in the door way, between the tap room and the bed room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might this continue. - A. It might be ten minutes or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Gore, you said, stood in the door way between the tap room and the bed room, how long was he gone. - A. He was gone for more than ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who did you meet in Carnaby-street. - A. Sam Carter and John O'Donnell; when Gore and I met them there, I heard John O'Donnell say that he would go and try to change the twenty pound note, he went away by himself, he was gone for some minutes, he came back and said he could not change it; we went from there and called at a public house, going along there, we had a pot of porter, some we drank and some we left, after that we went to St. Martin's-street, to a public house there, the sign of the Horse and Dolphin, we all four together went into a room there, called the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any thing there, - A. Yes, three bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect who brought you the wine. - A. I cannot positively say, but I believe it was the landlord, we went from that room into the taproom, and called there for a pot of porter, where they put me down seven guineas in way of share.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put you down the seven guineas. - A. I cannot say whether it was Sam Carter or John O'Donnell. I put it into my pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what the landlord brought by way of change. - A. I believe part of it was gold, but I cannot say it all was gold. I believe Sam Carter gave the ten pound note to John O'Donnell, and John O'Donnell gave it to the landlord</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know what there was in that box. - A. I saw a ten pound note at the bottom, I opened them, for him, he was all of a tremble when he came in, and they were rolled very tight; I changed the dollar for the prisoner to pay the coachman, he paid him three shillings; he told the coachman not to over charge him, and to go to No. 25, Cheapside, and to take care of him, for he was lame, he was going to an uncle or brother, I am not sure which, that would be very glad to see him; he thought the coachman charged too much, I said coachman, do you charge from here, he said no, I took them from the Horse and Dray, Gravel-lane, and now I have got to go to Cheapside; the coachman seemed very anxious for the prisoner to go in the coach, he said if he could not find it out it would be very hard to turn the man in the street, as he was very lame and intoxicated, the prisoner said he was in a hurry, he had to go over London Bridge, the coachman said if he would go and see the sailor safe home he would take him to London Bridge; the prisoner went out, and we both wished the prisoner to go in the coach, he said he must go and pump ship, I was obliged to go in; on my coming out again,

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent of the crime alledged against me by my prosecutor and the witnesses he has called; we were drinking together at the Horse and Dray one hour and a half on the ninth instant, my prosecutor insisted upon having a coach to convey him to East Smithfield, he prevailed upon me to convey him thither, a coach was called, we entered it, being much in liquor; on our way to the prosecutor's lodgings the coach was stopped at several public houses by his order, we drank freely of spirituous liquors, which further irritated our intoxication; during the time we were in the coach his protection box fell out of his pocket, and I put it in again; the last time it fell out he desired me to put it in mine, as he observed he might lose it in the coach, I received the box with great reluctance from him, after that we called at another public house, I went and offered him the box in the coach, he said bring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170055"/>me the box in Gravel lane; I wandered up and down the place to find him; that is the true state of the facts.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my protection box, and the paper that is in it is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she the care of these things. - A. My wife was out of town; the prisoner had not the care of them, only the management of the linen, she had not the keys of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she leave your service. - A. She went to Margate on the 18th of August with a child of mine, by the advice of the faculty; on that day about noon I had occasion to go up stairs for the cotton bed furniture; that led to the discovery.</p>
               <p>MARY M'LACHLAN sworn. I keep a pawnbroker's shop in Grub street; the prisoner came to my shop four times in the month of June; the first thing she brought was the bed furniture, I lent her one pound ten shillings upon it; after that she pledged a table cloth, a sheet, and a gown, in the name of Brown.</p>

             sworn. I am servant to Mr. Read, pawnbroker, Red-cross street, Cripplegate; I produce a piece of linen pawned at our shop on the 31st of July, it was pawned by a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. But the face of the woman you do not recollect. - A. No.</p>
               <p>- FIELD sworn. I apprehended the prisoner, I found the duplicates in her box; I fetched the box from on board the hoy at Margate, and brought it to Mr. Smith's house; I produce the duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Do you know the prssoner's box. - A. Yes, the prisoner gave me the key of it, it had been in my house.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to live with Mr. Smith, in consequence of his putting away his wife; when I went into the family he had one child blind and deaf; in consequence of my taking care of the child and restoring her to health, he seemed to have a partiality for me, and he even offered some familiarities, and gave a woman every encouragement; the bed furniture and the other articles were in my own care; after I had been in the country, he told me if I would confess, and give him up the duplicates, he would not hurt me; in consequence of that I gave him the keys of my box.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Did you ever permit this woman to dispose of any of your property, to pawn it for and money. - A. Never; I kept the keys of my drawers myself, and when I was at work, I carried them in my jacket pocket.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. On Tuesday the 9th of September was you with Nash and other officers in Silver street. Wood street. - A. Yes, I was, about six o'clock in Vincent's court, Silver street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner come there. - A. He appeared to be going to a person's house of the name of Lloyd, the first house of the left hand side; he had a parcel with him tied up in brown paper; when he came in the court he saw me and my partners talking to Lloyd, Lloyd gave him a wink with his eye, which I took to be a signal; Leadbetter said to him where are you going, he said, to the top house in the court; Nash went with him to the top house in the court, I joined them immediately; the person that opened the door of the house said they knew nothing at all of him wanting to come in there with a parcel; he came back, then we stopped him, we asked him what he had got there in the parcel, he was very much flurried, he said for God's sake do not stop me, it is not my master's property, I told him I should take him in custody, which I did directly; I asked him where he got the parcel from, he said he could not tell me, somewhere in Bread street, and then he said in Watling street, he could not tell me any person at all, he said he was going to send it in the country; I said how could you tend it in the country, there is no inn nor no place to send goods in the country here. Nash and I took hold of him by each arm, he said Cartwright (knowing me by name), I am ruined, do not take me to the compter, he repeated it over and over.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him. - A. I knew he lived at Mr. Watson's, I took him to the counter. On searching him I found this twist in his pocket, and his keys I took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find in that brown paper parcel. A. A large piece of flannel; I went to Messrs. Wilsons and Watson, I told them what had happened, and then we proceeded with the keys, in company with Mr. Watson, to search three drawers and his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the keys that you took from him open the drawers and the box. - A. Yes, we found three drawers locked and one open; in the middle drawer, which is adapted for him at the side of his bed in Mr. Watson's warehouse, the first thing we found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170056"/>was a quantity of bank notes loose, and some Irish linen, here is one piece and here is another; I found another piece of Irish linen in a box that was locked in the lower warehouse, four yards of cambric, a quantity of shirt buttons, twist and thread; we found in a box not locked, which the prisoner had over the other box that was locked, some trimmings, tape, two pounces of sewing silk, a great quantity of shirts, and a large quantity of wearing apparel.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at home when the officers came on Tuesday the 9th of this month. - A. I was, I superintended the search which they had in the drawers and boxes of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw these things found which the officer produced. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have the goodness to look at the Irish linen, what is it worth a yard, the wholesale price. - A. Four and sixpence a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place have you examined to find whether you have any linen of that description which you now have in your hand. - A. I have.</p>

               <p>Court. There are two numbers missing out of that book, and these numbers you find on these pieces. - A.(Mr. Gurney) There is only part of two pieces, and only one mark remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that number. - A. One hundred and three; it is cut in lengths of three yards and three quarters, there is about seventeen yards altogether.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Do you find upon comparing the pieces together that they match. - A. Yes, they match, I believe it all to be one piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be the property of yourself and partners. - A. I do, I have not the least doubt of it, there is one new shirt, I believe that to be of the same quality; the shirt buttons have my private mark on them, I have not the least doubt they are my property; there is no mark on the cambric, it is worth upwards of eight shillings per yard, as to the sewing silks they are articles that we deal in, and I have not the least doubt from the circumstance attending it but they are mine; they are such things as we deal in.</p>
               <p>Court. What number of yards of linen may there be. - A. About seventeen or eighteen yards.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Upon the day after the prisoner was in confinement did you receive a letter from him. - A. I think it was the Thursday after he was taken, I received a letter from him desiring me to go to him; in consequence of that I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any promise or threat to induce him to confess. - A. I did not, this was after the first examination and before the second; when I went into his room in the counter, I asked him what he wanted with me, he was in bed, he seemed to be exceedingly distressed, and felt much anxiety on his situation, I told him he had acted very improperly, I again asked him what he had to say to me, he did not give me any answer particularly to what he had done, he said what shall I do, what must I do, and several expressions of that nature; I then told him that I examined one of the pieces of linen which was found in one of his drawers, that it had the seal of Russel, and the number corresponded with the assortment of linen which we had bought of Russel; I then said that he had stole this linen from us, and that he must be satisfied in his own mind it was so; he then acknowledged that he had taken this piece of linen from me, I then asked him how he could say on his first examination that he had bought this linen of his mother in Devonshire; he replied, he did not know what to say.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you missed out of your till any money, and to what amount. - A. I missed money at various times to a very large amount.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that you found it necessary to apprehend the prisoner. - A. I did, on the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what passed with respect of the two seven shilling pieces. - A. On the 11th of July, about four or five in the afternoon. in the presence of Mr. Dagnell and Mr. Bennett, we asked him what money he had got in his pocket, he gave us two seven shilling pieces and a sixpence out of his pocket, which he said he had taken out of my till on the 9th, he said it was all the money he had taken on that day; I looked at it, and one of the seven shilling pieces I had some recollection, there was a dot on it which I had remarked on the Wednesday in the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon finding this, what did he say to you. - A. He begged for mercy, he said he had robbed me to a considerable amount. I said he could not expect mercy from me, he was one of the worst of villains, he entreated to remain in the house till Saturday, till his father or uncle came to town.

               <p>Q. How long was it he remained in your house before he was taken in custody by an officer. - A. From Wednesday till Saturday evening.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he was taken before the justice on Monday morning. - A. He was.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you well enough to go about when you were taken out. - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that your husband had a tin box. - A. Yes, and the last time I saw it it was in Mr. Barnfield's hands, he always carried it about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he had any money in this tin box, on the day he met with his accident. - A. I am sure of it, he shewed it me, it was a very remarkable thing for him to do so, I saw three seven shilling pieces in it, and I gave him change for a crown piece, I did not see it after the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the house fall in. - A. It fell in just after the bell rang eight in the evening.</p>

About<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170058"/>one o'clock on the 28th my son came to me, told me that Mrs. Male the wife of Mr. Male was at the door, and wanted an order to see her her husband; I told my son to send her into me at the counting-house, she immediately came.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the prisoner called herself the widow of Male; the widow of the man who was crushed by these houses, who lay at the workhouse. - A. Yes, she said she wanted an order to go into the house to see her husband, that she had been there, they had refused to let her in without an order, which is the custom of the house, I gave the order; we had a good deal of conversation on the subject before she went over to the house; I asked her her whether it was true of the danger they were in, she stated that her husband came home a little after eight o'clock, that she represented to him what people said, what danger the houses were in, he flew in a great passion, said she was a great fool, she asked him if he meant to go on that way, he said he did not, he meant to go out all night and get drunk; she then took on, and said she had lost her daughter who was buried in the ruins; she had been over to the public house where the people had been very kind, and had given her the gown she had on her back, as the other was torn off being dug out of the ruins; I then asked her what stockings her daughter had on, she said her daughter had white stockings, I then told her the young woman that had been dug out of the ruins could not be her daughter who was lying dead at the house, she had black stockings; I then told her to go over to the house with this order, to see the body, and if the young woman was not her daughter to send the master of the house over to me; very soon after the master of the workhouse came over to me, and told me that the young woman was not her daughter; I went to the house and found the prisoner apparently in distress, taking on exceedingly, she said she had seen her husband, but she had not seen her daughter, I asked her what she would do with herself, she appeared far advanced in her pregnancy, I asked her how long she had to go, she said about three weeks, I told her she had better stay in the house till she was delivered, she said she was very much obliged to me, but if I would give her her husband's watch, and tin box with two seven shilling pieces and some silver which was taken from her husband, she would go to her sister who kept the Ship public house, Leadenhall-street; believing the story to be true, I directed the master of the public house, Mr. Chapman, to give her the money, I saw him open the box, I saw there were in it two bits of paper with two seven shilling pieces, I told her I did not think there was any watch; immediately upon the delivery of that she went away; I did not know at that time that Mrs. Male was taken from the ruins; after I found I was imposed upon, and being directed to the place where Mrs. Male was laying in bed from the bruises that she had received.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards found the real Mrs. Male. - A. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the witness that has just been called up. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see the prisoner again. - A. I immediately left the spot with the officer, in hopes to find her, I turned up the alley where the workhouse is, I met the beadle, he told me he had seen Mrs. Male, he had been treating her with part of his dinner and beer; I went into the public house and charged her with being an impostor, of defrauding me of the tin box and fourteen shillings, I directed her to give me the money, or of course she would be searched; in the course of the time the beadle was gone she had changed one of the seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. You received the tin box and one seven shilling piece. - A. Yes, this is the same that she delivered over to me.</p>
               <p>Q. She persisted that she was the widow of this man. - A. She has always said that, she did before the lord mayor, the lord mayor remanded her for two days, in order for her to send to Chelmsford for her register.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable, I apprehended the prisoner on the 21st of August in the forenoon, I went up stairs and knocked at the door, the prisoner at the bar opened the door, she said she expected us; the prisoner went to a closet, took up a knife, and held it in her hand with the blade towards herself.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the mischief she intended was against herself, not against you - A. No, I do not think it was, she begged permission to go into the adjoining room where her sister was, lying in bed (she had only lain in a fortnight), I gave her permission, and put my foot against the door, to prevent her from shutting it, she stood behind the door, keeping it close to my foot, she endeavoured to prevent my coming in; some conversation passed between her and her sister, about a moment, I saw their hands pass from one to another, whether there was any thing in it I do not know; then I pushed the door and went in, she said, Oh! Charlotte, this is all through you, if it had not been for you I should not have done this; her sister hung upon her, and to appearance she seemed to be in sits, I got her away and took her to the watchhouse; I went back and searched the apartment, and I found nothing there; at twelve o'clock I took her before the magistrate; when she came near the office, she burst out in tears, she told me that the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170060"/>table spoon was pledged at the corner of Dean-street in her sister's name.</p>

On the 22nd of July, about two o'clock, the prisoner with another woman came into our shop, they enquired for some cambric muslin, which I shewed them, and none suited them, they then asked to see some prints for gowns, I shewed them all that was likely to suit them, they observed there was nothing that suited them, they would call in another day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay in your shop. - A. About a quarter of an hour; at the time they were going out of the shop, I suspected them, I let them go out of the shop, and then brought them back, I examined them, I found enclosed in M'Carthy's apron five shawls and a half, she threw them from her apron on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. What shawls were they. - A. Printed cambric shawls, I produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen these shawls before she took them. - A. I had shewn them to a customer a little while before, which was the occasion of their being on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. In order to shew the cambric muslin did you turn your back to get it to shew them. - A. Yes, I was under the necessity of going to the window.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170061"/>Q. Who was in the shop at the same time. - A. No person at the time, Mr. Poole came in the shop during the time they were there, he rather suspected them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of them take the shawls. - A. No, I am confident I knew nothing was taken, I only suspected them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did M'Carty say any thing when the shawls dropped out of her apron. - A. Nothing at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body else lodge with you. - A. Ashmore lay with me that night; I got up between seven and eight in the morning, I had thirty-six guineas in my waistcoat pocket in a purse, and three guineas in my pocket pinned over it; I saw the money all safe in the morning, when I got up, I put two of the guineas to the thirty-six, and one I kept in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he see you put them in. - A. I shewed him the two, I am not sure that he saw the whole after that I went down stairs, I treated Ashmore with a glass of spirits, and paid my way with Mr. Field; a man was sent for who wrote me a petition, after that we had some more drink, and with my being weak, having just come out of the hospital, the liquor had effect on me; this Ashmore took me up stairs that I might have a sleep, I was put on the bed; after a bit I felt at my pocket, I said I am robbed; Ashmore was then sitting at the foot of the bed, Ashmore said you had but two guineas, I said I had more than that, and I think it is you that robbed me, because I have been in no man's company only yours, and the man that wrote me the petition this morning; I said let me have my money again and I'll give you half a guinea, he said he knew nothing about the money; I went down stairs, told Mr. Field that I was robbed of thirty-eight guineas, Mr. Field came up stairs, with Mack his waiter, and a foreigner, the prisoner was sitting at the foot of the bed then; as soon as they began searching him there was six of the guineas found under him, where he sat on the bed, there were twenty two guineas found on the left side of the bed, by the wall, in the purse, and there was four guineas found in the prisoner's right shoe; there was six guineas wanting, I had thirty-eight.</p>
               <p>JOHN FIELD sworn. Q. You keep the public house, do you. A. Yes, the Earl of Howard's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I have known the prisoner some years. Ashmore, came to me and said he was broken down and he would be glad if I would give him a night's lodging; I gave him one, the prisoner and the prosecutor both went up to bed together, I did not know they slept together till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect their coming down. - A. Ashmore came down first, for a pot of beer, he said it was for the man that was robbed. I sent the pot of beer up, then Holmes came down about a quarter of an hour afterwards and changed a guinea, they had two or three glasses together, the prosecutor then begun talking why he should not have the augmentation as well as the other soldiers, he sent for a sergeant to write the petition, the sergeant said if he wrote it he was not fit to go before the officer to get it signed; he went up to lay down, in about twenty minutes afterwards, Holmes came down and told me that he was robbed of thirty-eight guineas; I called my man Mack, I says come up stairs, we all went up, and another man a German; I found Ashmore sitting on the bed, I said to Holmes are you sure that you had this money, he said he had, I said I shall search you first; I searched him, he had nothing, I said to Ashmore I must search you, there has nobody been in the room but yourselves; I am certain had two guineas, he had three yesterday. I changed him one; when Ashmore got up, we found six guineas under him, Mack found twenty-two between the bed and the wall, I made him pull off his shoes, and there was four guineas in one of them. I cannot say whether right or left, we researched the room, and the bed, and every thing, but we could not find the other six guineas. The prisoner said a guinea and a half of the money found in his shoes was his.</p>
               <p>- MACK sworn. Q. We understand you was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170062"/>waiter there, you have heard the account Mr. Field gave - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the money was found. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it found in the way he has related. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said that the money did not belong to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not hear him say that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lodged in Mr. Field's house that night, and the next morning we had three glasses of rum at his bar; afterwards he went in with an old college man to get a petition wrote, he could not stop with the man, he was getting too much in liquor, I was in liquor too, we both laid down on the bed, in a short time this man got up and was counting his money, he laid down again, after that he bounced up and says I am robbed, I got up and put my shoes on my feet, he goes down stairs and calls out to the landlord, the landlord came up with a Dutchman, and the waiter with him; the four guineas fell in my shoes, he was so drunk he reeled against the wall, and I would not move for fear he should think I had got the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you meet with O'Donnell. - A. I heard of his being taken the Friday after, I ordered the Bow-street man to give notice.</p>

               <p>Q. He was afterwards committed, that you heard. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never went to Marlbrough-street, after he was committed. - A. I did, I saw Foy, I went there to ask what officer took him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never intended to make any charge, till after he was committed, you never made any charge to the magistrate that he had robbed you. - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you understand there is a forty pounds reward, and that you would perhaps have a share in it. - A. I do not want it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you suppose that you would be entitled to a part of it. - A. I know now you have told me, I did not know it before. I have heard many say so both before I preferred the bill of indictment and after.</p>
               <p>- CODGELL sworn. I am the daughter of the last witness, I was with my father on the said night, I was asleep when the man was in the cart, my father awaked me, he told me there was somebody wanting money, there was another man at the horse's head; I did not know the man in the cart; after he had robbed my father, he laid a pistol across my lap, and he desired me to give him my money, I told him I had none, he said he knew better, if I had it not about me I had it in the cart. I then told him I had some halfpence, he put his hand into my pocket and took a handful, he dropped some in the cart, I gave him the rest, he got out of the cart and told my father to go on; we went on, about twenty yards, and then my father said he would go after them, I went home with the cart and my father went after the men.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner. - A. I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. - There was no property found that ever belonged to this man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (read in court) My Lord, I have had the misfortune to be here tried, and convicted of a capital offence. I hope that circumstance will not operate against me on the present occasion; I was led into that offence by Cuddiford, who was the principal witness in that case. I most solemnly declare I am innocent of this charge, and to this declaration. I call upon God to witness, as I expect for mercy here and hereafter. I did not know of this charge against me till last Wednesday, when I was informed that my prosecutor had sworn that I was the man that robbed him, that he knew my person only from happening to see me at prize fights. I understood also that he went to the Bow-street patrol, and informed him of the robbery, but not of my person. If he had known my name he ought to have mentioned it directly and have gone to the Police-Office. If he had so done, I should have been directly apprehended. He must also learn from the public newspapers that I was in custody, and had been several times examined at the Marlbrough-street office. I should humbly think he ought to have gone to the office and made his charge, and then I should have heard what he had to alledge against me, and when the circumstance was recent I might have brought to my friend's recollection where I was, but in this course of time I cannot; I must trust my case to your Lordship and the jury, being well assured that notwithstanding my unfortunate situation, every justice will be done me.</p>

I had fastened my door, about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170064"/>three o'clock in the morning, I awoke, I found the door broken open; I found the prisoner asleep on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner lodge in the same house. - A. Yes, she lodged in the same room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. I am an unfortunate girl.</p>
               <p>Q. What is she. - A. The same; I awoke her, I asked her how she came in, she said she did not know; I immediately went to my bed to look for my money, I found it was gone; the next day she took the bonnet and put it on her head, and went out of the room; I met her between eight and nine o'clock, I asked her for the bonnet, she refused giving it me, she had it on her head.</p>

I lived along with this woman a considerable time; what was mine was her's and what was her's was mine; she took the bonnet off my head, she used to lend me her things; she said first that the woman in the next room had taken her money, and then afterwards she accused me.</p>

On the 12th of July in the morning I was sent for to the Royal Oak, I went there, and saw the prisoner with a kind of a blue gown on, which the prosecutrix said was her's, I searched her, I found a duplicate of a petticoat belonging to the prosecutrix; I did not take off the gown, if I had she must have been quite naked; I produce the petticoat.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my petticoat, and I am certain the gown she had on is mine.</p>

             sworn. I was in company with Armstrong on the 29th of August at an old iron shop, Raven row, Spital Fields; when we were in the shop the prisoner at the bar came just with in the threshold of the door with something of that kind wrapped up in his apron; the shop is kept by a jew; he gave the prisoner a wink with his eye and a nod with his head, he immediately turned out of his shop and I immediately followed him; about ten yards from the shop I got hold of him, I told him I was an officer of Worship street office, and I would certainly see what he had got in his apron, I looked in his apron, I saw this bit of carpeting, I then asked where he lived or who he worked for, he said that was no business of mine; I searched his pockets, I found a letter with Mr. Sadgrove's direction, I sent down to Mr. Sadgrove, he came up to the office and said it was his property.</p>
               <p>(The property identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the piece of carpet to carry a bedstread; I never was in any jew's shop in my life, I was walking along, the officer stood on the cill of the door, he asked me what I had got there, I said I had a bit of carpet.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Aldridge) You are the smith that hung this bell. - A. I believe this is the same bell that I hung for Mr. Vigue, I cannot swear to it, because the spring is broke in two pieces, and one half is gone; I have no doubt but this is the bell I hung for Mr. Vigue.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you lose. - A. A leaden weight on the 29th of August; about nine o'clock in the morning these men came into my house, they were there about an hour and a half, then they went away; I went out and was gone about an hour, when I returned I missed the clock weight; I found the weight at an iron shop in Wheeler street, I had every reason to suppose they had taken the weight.</p>
               <p>- BARNARD sworn. I live in Wheeler street, I keep an old iron shop; two brothers brought the weight, named Grant; being neighbours' children, I did not know but it was safe my buying it, I do not know Harris, I gave them two pence a-pound for it; having no money in the house I went out and sold it to Mrs. Davis.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Grant is the man that brought it to your house. - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>JOHN RAY sworn. On the 29th of August the prosecutor said that the two Grants had been to his house with Harris, and had stole the clock weight from him; he saw them as he was coming down Wheeler street, they ran away from him; I went to Mrs. Barnard, I asked her if the Grants had been there with a clock weight, she said they had, she had not money enough to pay for the weight, she sold it; I produce the weight.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have every reason to believe it is mine.</p>
               <p>Grant's Defence. Mrs. Barnard swore at the office that this weight weighed fourteen or fifteen pounds, and now she says she gave two pence a-pound for it; at the office she said she gave three pence. God knows, I did not sell it.</p>
               <p>Harris's Defence. These men and I drank two pots of beer together, I never saw them afterwards till I was taken up; I am as innocent as any body that stands round here.</p>

Yes; having suspicion of the prisoner robbing me, I went to a neighbour's house about a quarter after three in the morning; the prisoner came, he usually rang my bell, and the boy let him in; after he had been in the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I perceived the prisoner coming out with two bags of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was it. - A. Eighty nine pounds of flour; after he came out a gentleman, who is in court, and I, pursued him, he made a kind of a stop and let one of the bags fall, holding the other under his arm; I then went to him, and asked him what he had got, he made me no answer, I said I suppose you have got my flour; he begged me to let him take it back and put it in the trough where we had taken it from, and if I would forgive him, he would leave the town; I told him I could not think of doing that, he must go along with me.</p>

             sworn. I am a pawnbroker, I live in Pultney-street. On the 24th of July, in the afternoon, I took in a gown; I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you take it in of. - A. I cannot swear to the prisoner. On the Sunday morning following the prisoner came to me and told me that she had lost the ticket, I stopped her, the prosecutor's girl having been at my house on the Saturday evening and said she had lost a gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all of the gown, I happened to go to see an acquaintance in the same house where the prosecutrix lives, I was charged with the gown; I never saw the gown with my eyes.</p>

             the room, when he came out of the room he said shall I leave this parcel here, I said he might, he laid it on a table and came out; I locked the door and put the key in my pocket; Davis not coming to the time to look at the room, I forgot the parcel; in the evening the prisoner and his wife came, asked for a lodging, a great many people were in my shop, I opened the door, gave him the bundle, and came away; I knew the parcel was there when he and the woman went in.</p>
               <p>Davis. On the following day after I had delivered the knives and forks to Barnard, I went into the Spread Eagle, I saw the prisoner at the bar there with a handkerchief that I well knew, I asked him to let me look at it, as I thought I knew the handkerchief, he told me he would not let me look at it, nor no one else, he had just bought it and gave half a crown for it; I called the landlord, I asked him it he ever saw that handkerchief, I told him that was the handkerchief I had delivered into his hands at three o'clock in the morning, till I found Barnard; he knew it directly, he said that was the handkerchief; I got away the handkerchief from the prisoner, it contained ten knives and eleven forks, I am sure they are my property; I had him apprehended, on the following day.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the print hanging. - A.Outside of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner when this gentleman gave you the information. - A. About forty yards off when I first saw her; when I came up to her, I saw the print on her arm with her gown over it. I put my hand on her shoulder, and asked what she had got there, she said nothing. I charged her with having stolen the print, she said I will go back with you; I took it from her; and brought her back, I produce the print. I am sure it is the print I took from her, and I am sure it is my property.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you lose your property. - A. On the 18th of August I went out about four o'clock in the morning to wash; I left the prisoner in my lodgings, I had taken her in to live with me, I had kept her in victuals and drink for almost three weeks; she had left her aunt.</p>
               <p>Q. You took her in because you believed her to be in distress. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the 18th of August did you come back. - A. About twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner there when you returned. - A. No, she was gone with my clothes, she left me nothing but what I have on me now; I saw her again when she was in custody, and my clothes were on her back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave your mother a shilling for the tea caddy, I gave a shilling off the bed gown, and whatever I had to expend they partook of.</p>
               <p>- GREGORY sworn. I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 28th of August; I found this gown on her back, and she had the stockings on, I believe, but the woman could not be sure; she acknowledged to the magistrate they were the prosecutrix' stockings; I produce the gown. I did not take her for this offence, I took her for six more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I pledged a light gown of mine to fetch this woman's out of pledge; I lent her a shilling to fetch some soap and candles; I was to give her a shilling for the tea caddy, the mother said this shilling will pay for the tea caddy; the bed gown I was to have for eighteen pence, I paid the mother a shilling off that to get some breakfast.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) Did you give her permission to pawn your things. - A. I never gave her any permission.</p>

Yes; the prisoner at the bar had been drinking in my parlour for two hours and a half, the saucepan was in a little side kitchen; my husband said to me he is in and out of that kitchen, then we both watched him, we saw him come out of the kitchen with his two hands before him, he had a large coat on him, I saw something behind him, he had the handle of the saucepan between his legs, he pretended to be very tipsy; this was about eight o'clock, we had just lit the candle, we lighted him out of the house; I then went into the bar, my husband and a young man, who is a witness, went after him and brought him back with the saucepan.</p>

             sworn. I produce the saucepan; I was in the public house in the parlour with him and others, he was in company with seven of us; the prisoner went into the back kitchen, I saw him take something from the top shelf, I could not see what it was, I thought it did not belong to him, I tapped Mr. Tapper on the shoulder and told him, he was very busy, I took hold of him by the coat, he lifted up the saucepan to knock me down, I received a blow from him with this saucepan which I found upon him; he would not deliver up the saucepan to me, I called out to Mr. Tapper, he came, and we secured him; this is the saucepan I took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you to be deprived of his senses at the time. - A. No, he appeared perfectly sober.</p>

No, after he offered me the six shillings he went out; I looked at the chair where the shoes hung, I found they were gone, I called him back, he being just inside of the step; I said you have got a pair of shoes, he said he had got none of my shoes; I told him to deliver them up or else I would charge a constable with him, I searched his coat and waistcoat, I could not find them; I said though I cannot find them about your clothes I am sure you have got them, I have lost a great many before, and I know you are the person that took them; while the constable was gone for, my wife saw him take off his hat, and the shoes fell out of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your wife say any thing. - A. Yes, she said he took them out of his hat; I heard them fall, I picked them up myself; I saw Tringham the constable, I called him in, and I said take charge of this man.</p>

             sworn. I live at No. 55, Bishopsgate-street; I was passing up Crown-street on the 1st of September, about twelve o'clock at noon. I saw the prisoner at the bar with a piece of print in her hands, as I thought, not as if she was going to buy it, I was at the door at the time, it was fixed up at the door of the shop; seeing me take notice of it, she sufficiently eyed me, and by so doing I took notice of her; I crossed over the way, and as I was returning she was just then coming from the house; I was sure, by her going away so quick, that she had got something. I had not an opportunity of going to the shop, she turned up a little court where there is a thoroughfare, I followed her, I was afraid of losing fight of her; I went up to her, and asked her what she had got there, she said nothing, I pulled away her cloak, and under her cloak she had got a piece of print. I directly brought her back to Mr. Tennant, he owned the print.</p>
               <p>(The print produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Timothy Lane's child. - A. Yes, she is a little girl of three years of age; the prisoner passed me at the corner of my court, where I sit selling my fruit; she had the child, she asked me who owned the child, I said Timothy Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar, and tell me whether you are certain she is the woman. - A. I think she is the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Go up close to her, is that the woman. - A. I partly guess it is, I cannot rightly say, I believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no suspicion of her at that time. - A. No. In about an hour after I saw people coming and looking for the child, I described the woman, and told them I saw the child with her; the child was found again the same afternoon. I saw the child again, it had only a little smock and linsey petticoat on then, it was about two hours after I saw the child with the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this woman again when she was before the justice. - A. I do not know whether it is the same woman, she is altered very much.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I do, I am positive of her. On Monday the 21st of July, about six o'clock in the afternoon, she pawned a child's frock and petticoat for eighteen pence, she asked half a crown, she went out of the shop and returned again in about ten minutes, I saw her twice, I have not the least doubt she is the woman. I produce the property, I have had them ever since I saw her in Lambeth street office on the 22d.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Lambeth street office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend this woman. - A. She is so altered, I cannot hardly speak to the woman, I hardly recollect her; when I apprehended her, it was about six or seven o'clock in the evening, she was so deplorable in dress she was nothing but rags, she was as black as a sweep; I believe her to be the woman that I took up, she was pointed out to me, she was laying drunk in a room in a court in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Carrol) What sort of a woman was it you saw with a child. - A. She way very dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the day was it. - A.Between four and five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear to be sober at the time she laid hold of the child. - A. Quite sober and sensible as I thought.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Burton) What was the appearance of the woman when she came to your shop. - A. She was quite dirty and black when she pawned these things, and at the time she pawned these things she was quite sober; she went and got drunk with the money that she got for these things. I am certain that she is the person.</p>
               <p>Griffiths. I have not the least doubt of her now I look at her face particularly.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day. - A. About a quarter after six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What manner were you travelling. - A. With a single horse chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen as you were travelling along in a chaise between Hampstead and Highgate. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the lane by Caen wood - A. I believe it is, I am a stranger to that part. In the lane there is a kind of a turning almost like an elbow, and just at the elbow there is a rising ground; the horse was walking up the rising ground, the prisoner came round that turn, and came up very near to my horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did he overtake you or did he meet you. - A. He met me, he was on horseback, he came very near my horse; I saw him put his hand in his pocket and pull out a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time how near was he to you. - A. I suppose about the distance from me to you on the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. On pulling out the pistol what did he do. - A. I thought I saw him cock the pistol, he came still nearer to me; he came close to my horse, and as I understood him, he said Surrender; my horse walked very slow and I did not stop him; he called out a second time the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop then. - A. I did. Upon my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170074"/>stopping, I asked him what his pleasure was, he held his pistol up, I then understood him, he said, Your money. I told him that I was very sorry that he was so very much mistaken, as I had not hardly money enough to pay my turnpike to London; he said, Give me your money, sir, give me what you have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that give him your money. - A. With a little hesitation; I repeated to him the second time, it is not worth your notice, I have hardly got any money at all, I should be ashamed to offer it you. He repeated and said, Give it me instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that give it him. - A. Yes, I pulled out my canvas bag, in which I had got two one pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it him. - A. I did, afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money in the bag. - A. Two one pound notes, a seven shilling piece, and two dollars; I was endeavouring to give him the two five shilling pieces, and keep back the other. When he found me doing that, he said, Give me your bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the whole. - A. I did; when I had done so, I told him that I was a very poor man, I had no money to pay on the road; I asked him to return me the money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return you the money. - A. He said his father was in jail, give me your address, I will pay you again. I think he said his father was in Newgate, but I will not be positive. I begged of him to give it me a second time, or a part of it, he then gave me back one five shilling piece (a dollar), and the canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time did that take place. - A. I think about five minutes; it might be about half after six, quite light.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it is the same man. - A. I am very sorry to say that I am.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. From all that took place on the occasion the man behaved very well. - A. He did, in his situation.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the young man before. - A. Not to my knowledge; as he came near to me I thought he looked like one of my neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Still you are certain that he is the person. - A. Yes, I am very sorry to say that I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You was somewhat alarmed. - A. I was something alarmed, or else I should not have given up my property.</p>
               <p>Q. This man's life is at stake upon your evidence. - A. I know it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the alarm that you were in, do you mean to swear that that man is something like one you have seen before, and having only that opportunity of seeing him, do you mean to swear that he is the same man. - A. I do; certainly I cannot avoid it, without doing a great injustice to my country and to myself, I should be very happy if I could have done otherwise.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAY sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. I live at Friern Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended the prisoner. - A. I did, I apprehended him in a lane leading from Edgware in the Edgware road; I apprehended him on the 7th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening. I searched him no further than I took from him a brace of pistols, I took one pistol from his left hand breast pocket, and the other from his left hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine them. - A. Not instantly; I did afterwards, they were loaded. I gave the pistols to Bridget, who came up some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the pistols were loaded, there was no priming in them. - A. There was priming in one and not in the other.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon him, and what you did, produce. - A. I found this purse as it is, in his breeches pocket; here is in the purse two one pound notes, a dollar, a seven shilling piece, and a six pence, this was loose; in the same pocket, eight shillings, seven sixpences, and two seven shilling pieces. In his waistcoat pocket I found this key, and a pair of black silk gloves in his right hand pocket. I found this smelling bottle full of gunpowder, and a bullet also; here is the powder that was in the pistols, and the two bullets; these are the pistols. I found this watch on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him. - A. No, he was at the Bear at Hendon when I came up to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

He brought me a saw to sharpen, he left it, he came again for it, it was not done, he came again for it and it was done; he did not take it away. He came again one morning between eight and nine o'clock, and paid me for it. I was called down to breakfast, we went down together, the prisoner going first; there is a passage goes along to my door, he pretended going along that passage, he watched me going down another flight of stairs to breakfast, I went down them stairs, he returned back again in about three minutes after he came down. We did not see him go up, we heard him come down a few of the stairs; my wife says to me, there is a man going in our house. Then we saw him come from the steps by the kitchen window; I pursued after him, but having my slippers on, I could make no ground, I returned back again, went up stairs and missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen it before you went down to breakfast. - A. Yes, it hung before me.</p>

On the 19th of July, the prisoner came to my bar, he asked for half a pint of porter, it was drawn him, he stood at the bar and drank half of it, he went into the tap-room to drink the remainder of the half pint, he then walked towards the door, the pint pot was standing on the table, I saw him stoop down and put it in his breeches, he wore a canvas apron which hid the pot. I stepped up to him, and said, what have you got, he said nothing, I unbuttoned his small clothes and took out the pot, he begged very hard to let him go, he said it was his first offence. I sent for an officer and gave charge of him, he searched him, and in his coat pocket he found another pint pot; that was mine also.</p>

             sworn. I am a patrol of Bow-street, attached to Worship-street. On Monday the 1st of September, about twelve o'clock at noon, I was going down Paul-street, Finsbury-square. I passed the two prisoners, Burgess had his great coat under his right arm, and Watson had this bag over his shoulder. I stopped them both, when I took the great coat from Burgess; this lead and this bag was in his coat, and Watson had lead in his bag when they came to the office to be examined. Mr. Saffell, the beadle of Bishop's gate was there; he said this lead was stolen from Mr. Coltson, he keeps the Crooked-Billet at Clapton. I took this piece with me to Mr. Coltson, it fitted the trough exactly, this part was torn off, and the other piece was remaining, one side of it is torn off and the other side is cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoners. - A. I know them both, they are in the Tower-hamlet militia, they told me they were going to carry this lead to Deptford, they brought it from Tottenham, that I did not believe. On Burgess I found this knife, there is no doubt but it is the knife that cut the lead, it is all over pitch, and the trough at the bottom was pitched.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any lead at any time. - A. Yes, three weeks ago last Saturday, I think it was the 30th of August, it was cut and pulled out of my trough; it was there on Saturday evening, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I saw it there myself; and when I got up it was gone. The trough was outside of the house for watering horses. I have seen Burgess before when they have been parading. I saw the lead fitted to the trough, it fitted exactly, I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Burgess's Defence. We were working at a gentleman's house at Tottenham High Cross, Friday was a holiday for us. On Saturday we went to work, we had got four or five hours to finish it, on Monday morning we went down to finish it, this lead was on the premises, there was a man there that gave us the lead to take down to Deptford, we took it to go down to Deptford with it, we got into Shoreditch, and this gentleman stopped us and took us before a magistrate.</p>
               <p>Watson said nothing in his defence. - Neither of the prisoners called any witnesses to character.</p>

             sworn. I am foreman to Mr. Rolfe. On the 7th of April last I went to lodge at Mr. Pullinger's house, he lives in Baldwyn's Gardens; he was not in the employ of Mr. Rolfe at that time; some time after that he went to work for Mr. Rolfe, I had property in his cellar, which he gave me leave to put there; I only rented the one pair of stairs room; a little after that he went to work for Rolfe. By going down the cellar I perceived wood there, such as bottoms and thick deals; in consequence of what I heard from the painters at Snow Hill, I perceived them deals belonged to Mr. Rolfe; I had seen them in the cellar before, I looked at them in the building, I found they matched; and seeing them in the building, and from what the painters informed me, I thought it my duty to mention it to Mr. Rolfe, Mr. Rolfe had a search warrant, and then he found them himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a lodger in this house had the consent of the prisoner to put some articles in the cellar yourself. - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other lodgers in this house. - A. I cannot say, there was a shoemaker in it, I never had any thing to say to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You frequently went down into the cellar. - A. I went down into the cellar when my business called me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner bring these boards into the cellar. - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the day of the month when you saw the boards come there. - A. No, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You had some little dispute with the prisoner at the same time. - A. None in my life, any more than seeing him not behave himself as he ought, he spoiled some work in the building, and that he ought not to have done, I never had any great dispute<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170077"/>with him in my life.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DURBY sworn. Q. Are you a painter - A. Yes, I work on Snow Hill, on Mr. Rolfe's buildings. On the 3d of September there were some boards lent to the Swan public house, by permission. of Mr. Rolfe, at the fair time; these boards were not carried over from the building to the public house till they had just left their work, the men that had them, they appeared to be running with them instead of walking; in consequence of which I thought they were taking them by stealth; I told the foreman, as he was a stranger to the buildings, I told him to keep a good look out, he had some sharp ones to deal with; I saw the prisoner take some boards from No. 49, Skinner-street, the prisoner was at that time working in Fleet Market. I saw the boards in the cellar, but they did not correspond with what he took at that time.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer. I obtained a search warrant, I went to the prisoner's house, Baldwyn's Gardens, there I found seven boards, two boards appear to have been used; we carried the boards down to the hoard in Fleet Market, there we found some boards had been taken away; we compared them with the hoards that were standing, there were some paper on them all, we compared them with the nail holes and the length, they had been in the ground; it tallied exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there more than one board of that kind. - A. There were two, they both tallied, exactly the depth in the ground and nail holes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rolfe. I was with them when they compared the boards; I have no doubt but they are my father's property.</p>

            ) You are the foreman, look at these boards. - A. They are the fellow boards as come from the fence, there be fifty of the same sort, and Pullinger was at the moving of them for the building of the houses; I do believe upon my oath that they are the boards; the boards were all put in the earth, through the brace as they go along; the nail holes tallied, they all answered exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether all the boards of that hoard belonged to Mr. Rolfe. - A. Yes, they do.</p>

             sworn. I am a carpenter, I know them to be Mr. Rolfe's property by matching them with those that are standing; I was two years foreman to Mr. Rolfe, I was perfectly conversant with Mr. Rolfe's goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the board that they were taken from. - A. Yes, they tallied exactly, not only in the length of the boards, but in the nail holes, and the depth of the ground they were put in, by the colour of the board, and the splash of mud above the ground as well as the mud on the board that was in the earth; I sincerely think that they are part of the hoard, and Mr. Rolfe's property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them. - A. Two shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the boards of a man one evening as I was standing at the door, he had the boards on his shoulder, he said he bought them for scaffolding, he was a plaisterer, he said he wanted some money for his club, or else he should be struck out of the book, he asked me two shillings and six pence a piece, I told him they were not worth that money, I gave him three shillings and six pence for them.</p>

On the 2d of September, this piece of printed cotton was on the outside of the shop, twisted round an iron bar; I had seen it about an hour and a half before, I heard it was lost between twelve and one o'clock, I pursued the prisoner, in consequence of information, and took hold of her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from the shop when you took hold of her arm. - A. About sixty or seventy yards; she was walking in a direction from the shop, I asked her to walk back, she complied and walked back, and threw the cotton on the ground, it was concealed in her gown or apron, I am not positive which, I picked it up and brought her into the shop.</p>
               <p>- KENNEDY sworn. I am an officer; on the 2nd of September I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; I have kept the cotton ever since, I produce it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been left any papers of Mr. Hawkins, the husband of the prisoner, in the care of your father. - A. There had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner at the bar apply for leave to inspect these papers. - A. Yes. About six months back she applied, she was allowed to come and look at them from time to time; the two first times she came there was a person to watch her; after that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170078"/>there was not. I suppose she came seventy or eighty times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they placed in a garret by which she would have to go near any quantity of books, papers, and parchment. - A. There were books and spars in the garret, and in the lost there were papers and parchment.; she would have to pass by the door of the garret where the books were, but she had not to go through, the door was not locked, nor was the door of the lost locked where the papers and parchments were.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any thing that you had discovered, did you go with Dorrington, the officer, to the Plough in Carey street. - A. I did, on the 4th of July; the son was drinking in the tap room. When I went there he requested me to walk in his own apartment, the first floor, in which he informed me there were books of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. In that room in which he took you, did you find any books belonging to you. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Q. Had the son ever access to that lost for the purpose of searching. - A. He had been there about a dozen times.</p>

               <p>Q. I understood you to tell my learned friend that the son has been there a dozen times, perhaps he has been there more. - A. I think more.</p>
               <p>Q. He has run away. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with this woman. - A. I have heard of her from my infancy, but not personally acquainted with her.</p>

             sworn. I am servant to Messrs. Gilbert and Bridger. On the 22d of July we lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170079"/>the article, it was piled outside of the door, exposed to sale, I was standing near the door, I saw the print begin to move from its place, I then began to watch it; it moved very slowly till it was half off the pile, then they drew it off very quick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the persons who were doing it. - A. I did not see them doing it, I detected them both with it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not look out far enough to see who were the persons that were doing it. A. No, the moment I was quite out, I went to the passage adjoining the door, I saw the two prisoners at the bar in the passage, they had both of them hold of the cotton, I seized them they immediately dropped the cotton; the tallest of the two desired that I would let them go, as he lived up the court. I took them both and sent for Mr. Griffith.</p>

Yes, we were treating him at different public houses; I had the pocket-book when I was in the coach, I missed it when I came to Mile-end, coming out of the coach. The landlord at the public-house, he stepped back and saw him taking the money out of the pocket-book, and putting it in his breeches-pocket, and the pocket book was found in the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had he of taking your pocket-book. - A. As I was stepping out of the coach, the pocket-book was in this jacket pocket that I have on now, and the dollars were in the pocket-book; the landlord charged him directly with it. I saw the dollars again, it was all found.</p>

             sworn. I keep the Plough at Mile End. The hackney coachman stopped with these two sailors at my house, I saw they were groggy; as soon as I went into this parlour I heard this young man say to his messmate, he had lost his pocket book, he swore pretty roundly, as sailors mostly do. Upon hearing this I went to the coach, which was standing at the door, I looked in the straw, I could not find the pocket book; somebody said the coachman was in the necessary, I went and found him shut up in the necessary, he was sitting in the necessary, he did not see me look over the door, I saw him take the pocket book from under his great coat, and empty the dollars out of the pocket book; dollars are a thing that make a great noise when they are disturbed; I put my head over the door and said Holloo, he said, Master, it is only the coachman doing a little business for himself, I says, it is a very wet day, I have been taking a little physic; he came out and I went in, I looked down the necessary, and there I saw this man's pocket book and protection, I put my hand down and took it up from the soil; when I got hold of the pocket book I saw the sailor's protection, he was discharged at the Nore; I shewed him the pocket book, he says there is my protection in it, I will take my oath it is mine. I called the coachman, I asked him if he knew any thing of that pocket book and protection, he said no; I said you are a great rascal, I saw you take the pocket book and protection and throw it down the necessary, and you took the man's dollars; I says for this business I will take you in custody, he said I was a great rascal for accusing him; I took him to a constable myself; he denied it to the very last push.</p>
               <p>- MORGAN sworn. I am the officer that took the prisoner. Mr. Rant and two men brought the prisoner down to me, I searched him, I found four dollars upon him, he took them out of his left hand pocket.</p>
               <p>(The property identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, and called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. That is the woman that was tried this sessions A. Yes, the prisoner was not there. On the bed, under the coverlid, I found these thirty-seven pieces of cambric muslins, I searched the room, I took the woman into custody, and I took the property to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the same muslin that you shewed to Mr. Eccles. - A. It was, it has been in my possession ever since. I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) I ask you, sir, whether that is the same that you saw before the magistrate. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is a part of that which corresponds with your invoice, have you any doubt that it is yours. - A. I have a doubt; from the invoice the quantity does not correspond, they have divided the pieces.</p>

He was apprehended in Pump court near Barbican; we took him in custody to a hackney coach stand, put him in a coach and took him to New Prison; we told the prisoner that if we had been in town that night we should have got the whole of the property; the prisoner said if it was not for the bloody Nosers we should not get half the swags we did. The next day the prisoner behaved very troublesome, he said that he saw us when we came to the Coach and Horses in Fann street. On the day after the robbery he was there and had bees steaks, though we did not see him.</p>
               <p>Court. What day was it you were in Fann street. A. The day after the robbery. We were searching after the parties, we went to the Coach and Horses in Fann street; the prisoner said if we had come where he was, we should have a four corner bowl, meaning the bowls that they played with they should have thrown at us; Armstrong and Vickery were present in the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner lodged. - A. I did, I never say him in his apartment, I understand it was his.</p>

               <p>JOHN GOTTY. I am a surveyor of the Thames police office. I took the prisoner into custody on the 22d of this month, at the Gun public house, Wapping, kept by Robert Green; after I had taken him into custody, he said he had sold some of the things; he took out two guineas and a seven shilling piece, he said that was some of the money he sold them for; there was a bed and blanket found in Mr. Green's house, the prosecutor said was his; I took the prosecutor with me, where he had sold the other articles, he identified them. I produce the property.</p>

             sworn. On the second of August between eight and nine o'clock in the evening I was coming up Oxford-road, I was going to the White Horse, Fetter-lane, I enquired for the White Horse, Fetter-lane, one in company with the prisoner said he was just going there. The man I first see and I crossed the road; one of these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170083"/>persons that he met on the other side of the road, says, Jack where are you going, he replied I am going into Fetter Lane, and this young man is going into Fetter Lane. I came from Bristol, I had not been in London two months.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had said this to these people, did they join company together. - A. Yes, this person said I am going to take part of a pot of beer, will you go with me. This man that I enquired the way of, he said you may as well go and take part of a glass of beer, I at last went with them.</p>
               <p>Q. The other two joined you did they. - A. Yes, we went to the <placeName id="t18060917-145-crimeloc795">Crown in Hog Lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18060917-145-crimeloc795" type="placeName" value="Crown in Hog Lane"/>

                        targets="t18060917-145-off793 t18060917-145-crimeloc795"/>, it is near Tottenham Court Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were three other persons with you, making four in the whole. - A. Yes, they took me through the house into a little dark parlour, and called for a pot of beer, the person I enquired the way of, drank once and gave the pot to me, then the prisoner came in and seemed quite intoxicated in liquor, he says, gentlemen I will toss with you for a five pound or a ten pound note, or what not, or any other sum you please. This person said that I enquired the way of, he was an old farmer and had got plenty of money, we will get his money from him, but I said I would not toss, I had no money to part with; they went on tossing, the four were tossing together, and when the beer came to me again, I said, gentlemen, it will not suit me to stop here, I am not in company that I think will suit me, I will pay my pot and go my way. I took my one pound note out into my hand, I put the note on the table and laid my hand on it, and then this person that sat by me that I asked the way of, damn me, he says, you shall be in it, he lifted my hand up from the note, the halfpenny laid on the table that they were tossing up with, he took and put the halfpenny in his hat and handed my note over to the other notes. I scrambled for my note, but a person shoved me back, he says to this other person, what will you have, at the same time one hand was going that way with the note; the prisoner says tail, and the man that I enquired the way of, says it is a woman by God, the money is all your own; the prisoner took up all the money and run away, he left the room immediately, I jumped over the table and stopped the man who took the money, and that was the prisoner. I took him, he was not gone out of my sight no further than the first door; I took him at the second door to the street. I called the landlord to assist me, but he did not come.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he heard you. - A. I cannot say, the others came out, and there was some papers that passed between them, the prisoner gave them notes, and notes were given by them to the prisoner, I took the prisoner from the house and dragged him into Oxford street; the other men ran down Hog Lane. I dragged the prisoner as far as No. 3, in Oxford road, I made as much noise as I could, but nobody came out of the tap room to assist me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this house in Hog Lane from Oxford street. - A. Thirty or forty yards. A man then of the name of Eakins assisted me. Then when he found himself overpowered, he threw down five shillings, two sixpences and a half penny, on the pavement, and said that was it. Mr. Eakin's the cheesemonger, desired me to pick it up, I did; Mr. Eakins said this is not the note, I desire you to give the young man the note, he said I will, he took out a ten guinea blank note, and proposed to give it me. I told him to give the note to the cheesemonger, and he refused, he would give it to me, but not to him; then the cheesemonger took it out of his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at last get your one pound note. - A. No, then Crocker came up and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you and three men go out of the house five minutes before me. - A. No.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Curwood. Q. You are a constable of the parish of St. Clements. - A. Yes; on Wednesday the 17th of September, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at the bar going up Clement's-lane, towards Clare Market; he had a hod on his shoulder, covered over with a brown jacket; it had a suspicious appearance, I followed him to an old iron shop in the same lane, I saw him go in, and he shut the door, I found the door was fast, I had suspicion of the house, and knowing the way of the house, I went to the back window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps it. - A. That I do not know; I there saw him take the hod off his shoulder, and shot the jacket and the lead out, the lead now produced in court is the lead that he shot out of the hod from his shoulder; I took the man and the lead too.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the shop. - A. Yes, I asked the man what he had got there, he told me that he had nothing, I told him that I had suspicion of that house a long while, and that was the lead that he had on his shoulder, and I remarked it; he said he wished me to hush it up, or else he should be transported, and he would give me his weeks wages; I told him it was of no use offering me any thing, he must go to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this lead afterwards fitted to any part of the New Inn. - A. I fitted it myself to the ridge of the roof of No. <placeName id="t18060917-146-crimeloc801">5, New Inn</placeName>

               <p>Q. I believe you gave notice to the porter. - A. Yes, there is five nail holes on the ridge of the roof, he had got the nails out first, and then he tore it away; the nail holes in the lead matched the nail holes in the timber.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the man was in the employ there. - A. I am sure he was not in employ there, he was a bricklayer's labourer in that neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The same evening I had the lead in the day time, I asked the man if he would come at beer time, I went down to the public house, he was not there, I found him in his own room; he told me he would give me a shilling to take a parcel to Clement's lane, he put it in the hod as I went down stairs; I took it to Clement's lane. When I took it there the constable laid hold of me, he ran away, he followed me there; he has never come for his money nor his tools. He has not worked for his master afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Constable) When you saw him carrying this lead was any person with him. - A. No, when he was in the iron shop a person came up to him when I was bringing him out.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no person when you came up to the house. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What may be the weight of this lead. - A. Upwards of sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober. - A. Yes, a drunken man could not carry sixty pounds weight, he was not drunk.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember in September the prisoner coming into your shop. - A. Yes, about ten o'clock in the morning she came for some prints for a gown, I shewed her a number; after I had shewed her several different patterns, she said none of them suited, she wanted a frock instead of a gown; she fixed upon a pattern, she bought a yard at two shillings a-yard; knowing that not to be enough for a frock or a gown, it gave me some suspicion that she had stole something, I followed her out, I told her I wanted to speak to her, I thought she had taken more than she ought, I lifted up her apron, I found between ten and eleven yards of print under her arm; I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop when you were shewing her these prints. - A. Mrs. Drake only.</p>
               <p>Q. Is she here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that print. - A. Yes, it was the first piece that I took from the shelf to shew her, I laid it on the counter. I took it from the prisoner in a minute or two afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. You had known Mrs. Miller before had not you. - A. Only on the 5th of August, that was the first time I was there. When I went down stairs she followed me down di- directly, she asked me what I wanted, I told her I did not mind particular, she might let me have five shillingsworth of bad money, she put her hand in her pocket and gave me ten shillings, she put them in a paper, I gave her four shillings and two sixpences, part of the money Mr. Rogers had given me; I put the money she gave me in paper in my bosom, and kept it there till I gave it to Mr. Rogers in the street. I then went with him to the Northumberland Arms. there I gave him the three shillings, the remainder of the money he had given me.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Mr. Powell, you are an assistant to the solicitor of the Mint, you are acquainted with bad money and what is good, will you look at these ten shillings, are they good or bad. - A. The ten shillings are counterfeit, they appear to have a composition upon them, which is the last thing they do before they put them into circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the shilling produced by Brown. - A. That is a counterfeit also. I believe them to be of the same manufactory.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Did you go on the 7th of August to Mr. Miller's. - A. I did, Mrs. Miller and I went to the White Horse; coming out of the White Horse Mrs. Miller pointed to a man (the prisoner at the bar), who came up to us; Mrs. Miller asked him if he had got any thing about him, he said no, but he had got one half guinea in the house, which was rather the worse for wear. I went up stairs into his house with him, he told me to stop at the head of the stairs (Mrs. Miller went into the yard), and he would bring it out to me (there seemed to be several people in the room he went into), he brought me a crooked half guinea, I asked him the price of it, he said it should be five shillings, but as it was wore he took three shillings and sixpence. He called his wife up stairs, she came up, he told her he had not a sixpence to give me, she gave me a sixpence good money out of the four shillings I gave him. I wrapped up the half guinea in paper immediately, I put it in my box, and I put the box in my pocket, and I gave it to Mr. Rogers when I got out at Shadwell. I had no other money in my pocket.</p>

On the 4th of this month, between nine and ten in the evening, the three prisoners came together into my house, they came to the bar and requested a glass of liquor, two of the three had shrub, and the other rasberry, I charged them sixpence for the three glasses; Stewart tendered me a half guinea, he found I was inclined to give him all silver in change, he requested a seven shilling piece, as part of the change for the half guinea; I replied that I had not one, otherwise I would not part with the silver. Dowton observed that he had halfpence enough in his pocket (I had returned the half guinea to Stewart); Dowton searched his pocket, he said he had only four-pence halfpenny, on that Wise put his hand in his left pocket and took out a seven shilling piece, he stood a little reclined from the bar, I had not as good a view of him as I had of the other, but I am sure I took it of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took the seven shilling piece of him. - A. Yes, I weighed the seven shilling piece, it was a good one; I was going to give him change for it when Dowton said he should not change, for he knew Steward had in his pocket a penny and a halfpenny, they should be able to pay me in copper.</p>
               <p>Court. When Dowton said that Steward had three halfpence did you return that seven shilling piece. - A. I did, Steward took it up, I told him it did not belong to him, when I accused him of doing it he muttered in his own language, I did not understand what; he said he had detained it, and when he failed of finding the halfpence to make up Dowton's four pence halfpenny, he put down a seven shilling piece, observing you must take it out of it now; I took it up and put it in the balance, the same as I did the other one Wise gave me; I found it to be a bad one, I asked him how he could be so base to give me that one, I conceived it to be a bad one; my husband hearing an altercation at the bar, stepped-out of the little room, and enquired the cause of it, I told my husband, in the prisoners hearing, what had happened, my husband was not satisfied with me, he went into the bar and put it in the balance, he found it a bad one; on that he stepped out of the bar, and went into the parlour, in which Mr. Batho the ward beadle was sitting, he said Mr. Batho, I stand in need of some of your assistance, for he thought he had got some men imposing bad money on his wife; on hearing the name of Batho, Wise and Steward endeavoured to make their escape; Wise took to the right, which is the front of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170087"/>house, and Stewart made off at the back door; I put my hand upon Dalton, and observed that he should not go till the other prisoner returned, he did not attempt to go; my husband pursued and brought in Wise, and Stewart was brought back also; they were all then taken into the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Q. The last seven shilling piece you took of Stewart, what did you do with it. - A. I gave it to my husband.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the three prisoners coming to your house. - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the three persons, the three prisoners at the bar. - A. They are; when I got to the bar my wife was disputing with the three prisoners at the bar, I asked what was the matter, my wife gave a seven shilling piece into my hand, she told me that Wise put down a good seven shilling piece, Stewart had taken it up and gave her a bad one; I put it in the balance, I found it light, I opened the bar door, called out Batho, I shall thank you for your assistance, I have got three men at the bar that want to impose upon my wife; Wise ran out of the front door on my calling out to Mr. Batho, I perceived him running out, I said you shall not escape, I catched him at the corner of the warehouse, opposite to our house, I laid hold of him, we had a scuffle, we both were down, some neighbours came to my assistance, we took him and brought him into my house; when I came in with him, Stewart, Wise was brought back, and Dowton was standing with my wife at the bar; when we got them all three in the tap-room Mr. Batho insisted on searching them.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you received the seven shilling piece in charge from your wife. - A. I had it, I believe, I left it on the bar, my wife gave it me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Mrs. Daniels) I understand you to say that you had given the seven shilling piece to your husband. - A. Yes, to try it on the ballance, afterwards it was put on the bar; I afterwards returned it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the same seven shilling piece that he had left upon the bar. - A. It was, upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep your eye upon it the whole time. - A. I had one eye upon the prisoner and one upon that.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. After the bustle was over I gave the seven shilling piece to Mr. Batho; when Mr. Wise was searched, after he had put down a certain quantity of small gold, there seemed to be one bad one, Wise snatched at the bad one, and said that is mine, nobody shall have it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How many seven shilling pieces did you weigh. - A. Six or seven, and two were light.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in Still Alley, Hounsditch; when the copper came I lived in Stoney Lane, Petticoat Lane, in the City of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar. - A. Yes, he brought the first piece of copper, on Tuesday morning, August the 12th, he came with Richards, the porter, himself, he brought this very piece (witness putting his hand on one pig of copper); my wife was with me, he asked me fourteen pence a pound fer it, I said that is too much, I offered him a shilling a pound for it; he let me have it for a shilling a pound, he told me there was ninety three pounds; I borrowed five pounds, I gave him four pounds thirteen shillings. I went down stairs to the public house, we had a quartern of rum together, with that the prisoner at the bar said to me, do not carry it into Hounsditch; with that my heart sell at my feet.</p>
               <p>Q. You then began to entertain suspicions. - A. Yes, I thought my liberty would be taken away if I had been taken with it, perhaps he would not have owned that he had sold it me; I kept it from the Tuesday till Wednesday evening, I was very surprised, I could not do any business; the Thursday morning I met Mr. Crab and Hart, two constables, in Petticoat-lane, I told them what I had done with that man, that I had bought some pigs of copper of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree together that Crab should be at your house the next time the prisoner came. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed with the prisoner on the first time when he should come again. - A. No, I delivered the first piece to Mr. Crab. On Thursday evening the prisoner came to my house again, he told me he could not bring it till between nine and ten o'clock in the evening; at that time the prisoner and Richards came together, he brought another pig in his little basket, he told me that weighed one hundred pounds, I do not know whether he meant the short or the long hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy it. - A. No, upon his coming my wife went and called Mr. Crab and Mr. Hart, and they came up stairs, Mr. Crab said, I suspect you have got some stolen copper in your house, he laid hold of this basket; the prisoner was there, but the porter had just gone down stairs to the public house; the prisoner said he knew nothing about it, it did not belong to him; the porter owned that he had brought these two pieces of copper at different times, he first denied it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170088"/>then he owned that he brought it from the prisoner's house; they were both taken into custody.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Worship-street, I told the prisoner my business was to search her house for stolen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170089"/>property; for articles that Mrs. Cawthorn had been robbed of. I asked her if she had any such kind of articles in the house, she said no, I told her I should certainly search her house, she said I was welcome, for she had got no property belonging to Mrs. Cawthorn; I was going to open a closet, I saw she was very restless and wanting to put her hand into her pocket. I immediately said I shall search the right hand-pocket, I found nothing there, I searched the left hand pocket, I immediately took from there some ribbon and some sewing silk, there is more than ten yards of ribbon; I dare say there is twenty yards in the whole, and about one yard of lace; Mrs. Cawthorn looked at it and said it was her property, I informed her her daughter was in custody. She seemed very much alarmed, and said that her daughter had brought them; I took her in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. On his own account. - A. No, he had been in the employ of Mr. Imber, a long time; I understood Mr. Imber, the auctioneer, had sent him; I let him have them and he took them, with him, he debtored Mr. Imber for them, I believed at that time he came from Mr. Imber.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this paper. - A. Two pound, fifteen shillings, and eight pence. On the 5th of August he came again for a ream of fools cap and an account book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say on whose account he came for them. - A. I cannot say that he said he came for them on account of Mr. Imber, he always when he came mentioned Mr. Imber's name. On the 5th of August he asked me to give him a black lead pencil, as Mr. Imber was so very close a man, he only allowed so many in such a length of time, and he had cut his up. On the 6th of August he came for a ream of thick post.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take the second parcel with him. - A. He did, and he took the ream of thick post.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Mr. Imber from the 31st of July to August. - A. I had not till some time in the middle of August; it was discovered then, Mr. Imber struck off these articles in his account; about a week or a few days after that I saw the prisoner, he passed my door, I told him to walk in, he did, I accused him of taking these articles, I told him what Mr. Imber said, that he had no authority from Mr. Imber to get those articles; the prisoner was exceeding sorry that he was detected, and requested me to let him go home to his wife and family, said he would return in the morning; he said he had left Mr. Imber's service in March, he hoped I would not take any steps in it, and he would pay me for the articles; I sent for a constable and charged him.</p>
