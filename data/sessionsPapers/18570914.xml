                  </hi>. I am one of the directors of Bauwens' Patent Candle Company. I hare been connected with that company ever since 1853—as one of the directors of the company, I was cognisant of the apparatus, and the mode in which it was manufactured and used—I did generally make myself acquainted with all the process and the construction of the apparatus; not minutely—I have very frequently looked at this model—from my knowledge of the apparatus, it is a correct and accurate mode)—it was produced on the trial at <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius</hi>, and was looked at, examined, and spoken to by the defendant—this other model, marked "G," was produced on the same occasion, and was examined and spoken of by the defendant—I heard him refer to it—he was in the witness box, and these two models were just beneath him under the table, and he was asked by the Counsel for Bauwens' Company if that was the model he had made and sworn to in the proceedings in Chancery, and he said, "Yes"—I think he said that that was the model that he had made and sworn to in the Chan<lb/>cery suit—there was no other Chancery proceeding except that which resulted in an injunction being prayed for—these are the two affidavits made by Hastings—these are the only two that I know of as having been filed—there are exhibits on the back of the model, showing that it was exhi<lb/>bited at the time of making the affidavit on 16th Jan.—the letter "G," purporting to be signed by Mr. Wingate, has been on it ever since it has been in my possession—it was in my possession before July—I should tell you that it is not the same model that was on the table at the time, but it was the original model, and there was a copy—we were directed by the Chancellor to exchange models, and we each gave the other the original; and for the purposes of convenience, we had an exact copy made, which for convenience was admitted as the model—I cannot say that I heard the defendant make reference to his affidavit, other than as what he had was always, ever since I have known it, a separate flue, in which the pipes were placed, and by which it was separated from the furnace—some Stour<lb/>bridge tiles were at the time of construction placed between the fire and the pipes—a Stourbridge tile is made of a day with great power of resisting the heat—no portion of the pipes was exposed to the naked action of the fire, except what would get up through the little hole, when the damper in the chimney is out—when the damper is drawn oat it makes a draught through the flue—when the damper is closed there is no draught through the flue, and therefore the heat does not ascend—the Stourbridge lumps protect the whole area of the space upon which the pipes rested—I have never seen it in any other way than that—from the time this apparatus was constructed and put in operation, up to the time these proceedings occurred, I saw the apparatus very frequently—during the whole of that period there has never been any substantial alteration from the original construction that I have spoken of—there was never any alteration in the form of construc<lb/>tion; I never happened to have seen it under repair—I cannot say whether</p>

               <p>the pipes were made of wrought or cast iron—a person could not see the pipes by looking through the furnace door—I have myself ascertained that to be physically impossible—there is a small hole above the furnace door, called a sight hole—through that a small portion of the pipes can be seen—I have seen the apparatus at various times at work—I am conversant with the process of manufacture—I never saw these pipes red hot—I always understood that it was not a portion of the process to keep the pipes red hot—I have never seen them red hot—we endeavoured to make them red hot after these proceedings commenced, and found the greatest difficulty in doing it, so much so that when we thought they were red hot we found they were not—I cannot say that I remember the person of the defendant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are a solicitor, I believe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am; the management of the business is left to Mr. Bau<lb/>wen, he is the manager—he established the Company, it was formed in the summer of 1853—it was a Company of 50, 000 shares of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I possess between 3, 000 and 4, 000 shares, originally I had 8, 000; I am sorry to say the Company has not paid any dividend—I really cannot say whether we have registered any accounts—I do not remember whether or not I ever had the curiosity to inquire—I cannot tell the time when the furnaces were originally constructed, it is a considerable time ago; I remember on the trial I said it was about twenty months, but I believe it was about two years and a half, or something like that before the trial; I have since ascer<lb/>tained it was in 1854, by inquiry of Mr. Bauwen—I was at the manufac<lb/>tory very frequently, and with considerable regularity, almost always once a week, except I have been out of town or unable to attend, and very fre<lb/>quently twice a week, and sometimes even oftener than that; I have been there many hundreds of times—I have not on those occasions examined the apparatus particularly and carefully with the object of seeing in what state it was, because it was not within my functions at all to do that—I did not see the coil of pipes laid, I merely saw the bed which was built for the pur<lb/>pose of receiving the pipes which were to be laid on it; I have never seen the pipes except through the sight hole—I never saw the thermometers until after the Chancery proceedings—I know we were ordered by the Vice Chancellor to work with thermometers; and after that time we did, to ascertain the positive degree of heat in the still and in the steam—I think we began to work with the thermometers either the latter end of Dec., or the beginning of Jan.; we began before the Vice Chancellor ordered it, because we wanted to ascertain what the actual relative degrees were, by sight instead of by judgment—I cannot tell how soon the coil of pipes was laid after the furnace was built; I have never seen the furnace at any time, when the bed of Stourbridge lumps were not there—I could just see the end of the pipes through the sight hole, the turn I mean, it is not properly a coil—I have looked through the furnace door, dozens of times—I have looked through it occasionally ever since I have known the furnace, while it has been at work—I cannot tell you anything about the particular periods at which I have done so, because it is such a casual matter, it is not likely I should make a memorandum in my memory, or in a book, as to when I looked in at a furnace door—I looked in because I think it is a very fine sight to see a blazing fire burning; and when I have been there, and the door has been open, I have just looked down in that way and looked in—I hardly ever go to a furnace without doing so—that was the reason of my looking through the furnace door, and for no other reason until these pro<lb/>ceedings commenced, and then it became a matter of very great interest—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140007"/>
               <p>believe the first intimation we had of any proceedings being threatened, Was on 8th Nov.; and I have no doubt that within two days after that I should be down at the factory; I do not know whether it was on Saturday, or when it was—I will undertake to swear positively, that it was about two days after 8th Nov. that I looked in at the furnace door in order to ascer<lb/>tain the state of the apparatus—I do swear it most positively—I do not say two days after, I said I did not know whether it was a Saturday, or what day it might be, but the first available day; within two or three days after that I went down and made a most minute examination of everything connected with it, because it was then a matter of interest—I cannot fix the date nearer than this, that it was immediately or as soon as ordinarily convenient after receiving this notice; I have no hesitation in saying it was within two, three, or it might be, four days; I should say it was certainly within two, three, or four days after receiving the letter dated 8th Nov.—I might not have received it until the 9th, that might be Saturday—Tuesday was our ordinary day of meeting, and I have no doubt I was there on the Tuesday afterwards—the letter gave me information as to the particular character of the apparatus—I do not know whether it would do so to a per<lb/>son not' acquainted in the same degree with the apparatus, with the process carried on, and with the words of patent specifications—either the letter or. the subsequent inquiries that I made gave me information of the nature of the complaint that was made—whether I had got that particular informa<lb/>tion before I went to the factory, or whether I saw Mr. Bauwens at my office before I went to the factory and got it from him, I do not know, but when I made the inspection of the apparatus I did receive such information as enabled me to judge, and that was the time when the first inspection was made; I did not know as much about it as I did subsequently when I em<lb/>barked n it—I made an experiment as to obtaining a red heat by means of a damper in the flue—it appeared to be a red heat, but on pushing a steel skewer through the sight hole, and making it impinge on the iron pipe, of course the pipe being softer on account of being hot, it went in and made one of those stars which you see there; it was red hot then, and it scaled off—this is the damper which regulates the heat in the fire place; when this is opened the draught rushes through the furnace up this fine—I should say that that is not the direct course of the heat, it goes round the still, and round the chimney—anybody else is as capable of judging of the course of the heat as I am; there is a little hole, and the heat has to go through there; if you lift up the flue you will see that the hole is at the mouth of it, and it does not appear that the heat should go there to get up the chimney—I do not think that up the chimney at once is the direct way, but anybody in Court is as competent to form an opinion upon it as I am; in fact I have not formed one—by pulling out the damper the heat could be raised—the quickness depends upon the distance to which you draw the damper out; if you draw it out to the full extent it is hot very rapidly, because a great part of the draught will enter through the flue, but if, as. is the fact, the damper is only drawn out to a very small extent it would not—it was done entirely for the purpose of that experiment, so that there was no possible chance for the heat to get out, and by pulling the damper out of the coil flue, it heated it very rapidly—I did not then find that I made the pipes red hot; I do not know that we could not have done so if we had gone on a sufficient time; we went on sufficient time to prove the experiment, in the presence of three of the best engineers in the country—I do not remember how long we went on; you must not press me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140008"/>
               <p>too hard, possibly it may have been half an hour or forty minutes, or it may have been twenty-five minutes, I mean after the damper was removed; but I did not make the experiments myself, they were conducted by Mr. Nay<lb/>smith and other gentlemen—I found the flame ascending very much, it came through this hole, through the part which is nearest to the furnace door, and then it was drawn by the draught for a short way over the pipes—I do not know of any repairs to any extent, of the furnace; I remember seeing the still partly pulled down, I never saw any repairs at all done to the pipes—I have heard of the pipes being taken out and replaced since the furnace was erected—I did not see it done, but they would have to take off the top of the flue to do it, and I should see it—the proceedings against Bauwens' Company in Chancery, were for the infringement of four patents, and there are proceedings against Bauwens' Company for the infringement of two patents still—I should not think Hastings and Murphy were important witnesses for the purpose of proving the infringement—I have always thought that they would be called—they were the only witnesses in Chau<lb/>cery to the infringement of the four patents; there was another, a Mr. Robert Brown—Mr. Napoleon Bauwens is a brother of the manager, he is not here; he was present at Guildhall when I was in the witness box—he did not appear in the witness box on that occasion, and I can tell you why, as it is as well to know; he cannot speak English at all decently, and the Jury and everybody were so tired and disgusted with the length that it had gone to, that we thought it was a very good reason for not calling him—he could speak his own language.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the managing director of this candle company, which takes its name from me; it is carried on at Canal Bow, Pimlico. The prisoner was about a year or eighteen months in my employ<lb/>ment—he came first of all as stoker of the still, but he took too much, and was removed from that post to stoke the boiler—he left off stoking the still about six months before he left—he had a full opportunity of knowing the apparatus that I used for melting the fat, and was acquainted with the whole of the machinery—he supplied the furnace with fuel, and attended to things generally under the command of Wickham, the foreman—I was examined on the trial at <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius</hi>, and also in Chancery—my attention has been fully called to the matters in difference—I have seen this model before—it is as correct as could be made in small proportions—here is a loose damper here, which you may call the furnace damper—it is never used—it was my mind and skill which invented this apparatus—I superintended its being put up, and have managed the factory from day to day down to this time—the apparatus has not been in any way different in regard to the pipes since Aug., 1855, than it is now—the company was formed in 1853,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140009"/>
               <p>and I began to work the machinery in its present state about Aug.,—from the beginning of 1854 we only worked for the sake of trial, and to take the patent out, which we did in April, 1854—the pipes have been taken out, and fresh pipes substituted several times—we always keep two sets of pipes, because when one pipe breaks we have to take the whole set out, but they have always been the same kind of pipes, strong gas pipes of wrought iron—we are not particular about the bore—there is a great difference between wrought iron and cast iron as regards resisting heat—if the pipes were ordinarily red hot while working they would soon be worn out, and it would be injurious to my mode of manufacturing the fat—the pipes were not ordinarily red hot from day to day—I did not order Hastings to keep them red hot, but to keep them at a sufficient heat to distil the fatty matters over—I have seen the pipes from day to day from the time the furnace was first erected—they were generally black, and if they began to get a little reddish I made observations to the fireman upon it, and would not allow it—the prisoner was the fireman's assistant—the pipes would not have been kept red hot from day to day—there is no difference between the Stourbridge tiles and lumps, except in shape—this is one of the tiles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); two of these two feet square, and two others a foot and a half, formed the roof of the furnace—this is the exact sire of the front tiles—when Hastings acted as stoker, feeding the furnace, he must have seen these tiles, and knocked his poker against them—there could not be a period when we used these pipes in which this layer of tiles was absent—steam was passed into the still at certain periods, and we let the fat run constantly in—we have machinery to feed it gradually, but at first we have to feed it—the furnace acts directly on the still; the heat goes round the bottom part first, and then to the back, but the heat at the back is not required till we have got the stuff to run in—we throw steam in from a boiler, which we use for various purposes—the lower the temperature at which the steam comes in, the better it is for the quality of the stuff; but to obtain quality with quantity, about 100 degrees below the temperature of the fat is the best heat for distillation—if the tempera<lb/>ture of the boiling fat is exceeded it is not a profitable working—I aim at the quality of my article—you cannot look in at the mouth of the furnace and see the pipes—I have seen Hastings cleaning the pipes, taking the soot away—he took off the Stourbridge lumpe, but not the tiles—he had a broom, a rake, and a scraper—he stood on the top, and as he looked down he must see the layer of Stourbridge tiles between the pipes and the fire—the pipes do not lay naked to the fire; there has always been a layer of Stourbridge between them and the fire—since the proceedings by Price's Company against me, I have not made any alteration; there was no need—I first saw this other model at the Chancery Court—this coil of pipes is not at all like mine—it is not a careful model.</p>

Japp, 23rd and 24th May, 1856"—Japp first came to the factory on 13th Oct., 1855, and left on 6th Dec, 1856—I believe I discharged a dozen or more of my workmen after the law suit began—I do not recollect, on the occasion of the second, or Japp's coil, asking him whether any part of the pipes could be worked in, but it was my rule to use the old piping as much as I could—I do not remember who assisted in putting in the second coil, or whether it was put in between 6 and 7 o'clock on Saturday night after the men were gone—I do not recollect, on that occasion, desiring Mr. Wickham, as the men worked late, to give them some beer, but that was so—I cannot tell whether Japp's coils were fastened together with copper wire, or whether the second coil was fastened with iron wire—I recollect afterwards a third coil being made while Japp was in my service, by a person named Weeks, a brother of my foreman—Weeks came to my factory in Sept or Oct., 1856; Sept. I think—he was employed in making the third coil shortly after he came—the second coil had been in about four months—the third coil was put in as the others had been, raised from the ledge by a brick at the comers—it would have been prejudicial to have kept the temperature of the steam below that of the boiling fat, both as to quality and quantity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman at Bauwens' Patent Candle Company. Hastings was employed under my directions—he was in the service seventeen or eighteen months, during which time he had opportu<lb/>nities from day to day, of observing the machinery—I have seen him, five or six times, cleaning the pipes with a small piece of iron about two inches square, in the form of a rake—he stood with his feet across, and scraped between the pipes—he raked beneath the Stourbridge lumps, which were removed—he must certainly have seen the Stourbridge tiles—if these pipes had been naked to the fire, there would have been no occasion to clear away the soot—I am not aware that he is a person of some mechanical skill—I should not think he had the power to make a model like this—if there had been no layers, the soot would have fallen into the fire—this is a correct and careful model of the apparatus—no alteration whatever has been made in it from the time it was first set up—the flue formed by the Stourbridge tiles and lumps, in which these pipes lay, has always been there—a stoker stirring the fire must have been aware that there was something between the pipes and the fire, but he would not have known that it was Stourbridge tiles—you could see the ends of the pipes by look<lb/>ing through the sight hole only—the steam was generally thrown in at about 100 degrees under the heat of the fat which was to be distilled—that was the regular mode of working—the pipes are made of wrought iron, common gas piping—if they lay naked to the furnace, they would distort</p>

               <p>and split; they would not last three weeks—they were not ordinarily red hot, they were black—I have never ordered Hastings to keep them red hot—I have frequently found fault with him for having the fire too far for<lb/>ward, which tended to heat the pipes too much—when I have seen the pipes black, I have never complained to Hastings, and ordered him to make them red—it was the most advantage that they should not be kept red; it was less profitable—the pipes were not regularly cleaned—Hastings was suc<lb/>ceeded by Hubert Brown, and Dawson succeeded him as day man—there was no night man.</p>

               <p>were under the pipes, you could not see the pipes from the furnace door, but if the tiles were removed, of course you could—we sold the old pipes for old iron—I believe some were sold to Mr. Forseyth, which have been tested, and found to be valueless—by tested, I mean put in the forge fire, and tested, and found to open—according to the usual way that the pipes would stand, the splits would raise them from an inch to an inch and a half: I cannot say to the eighth of an inch, but about an inch above the bed.</p>

I assisted Mr. Bauwen to make out a specification of his patent, particularly the one of the 10th April 1854—the still was worked differently, but the other apparatus are the same as I described in that specification—I have examined this model—in April, 1854, there was the same kind of division between the fire and the pipes as now, but I cannot say what it consisted of—I visited the premises in the latter part of 1856, and at the commencement of this year, and the apparatus was precisely the same as regards the furnace, but the still was quite different—there was no alteration whatever in the mode of conveying the heat through the pipes—the action of the fire on wrought iron pipes would be much greater than on cast iron—it would wear them out, and if they got red hot they would get leaky in the joints, I imagine, but I never tried, and therefore cannot speak from actual experience—if they were to be red hot, cast iron would be the best material—this pipe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one-eighth of an inch thick—it is an ordinary gas tube—if the object of Mr. Bauwen was to keep the steam below the temperature of the boiling fat, and to keep the pipe from getting red hot, this pipe would be decidedly adapted to that purpose—I have seen the apparatus at work—it seemed to work satisfactorily.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and was employed by Mr. Nuttram in 1855, at the candle factory. Hastings was in the employment at the same time, I believe—I did' work at the still tinder Nuttram's directions—the steam pipes over the furnace were made of Stourbridge gas piping, which is wrought iron—this model is a correct representation of the still and pipes in 1855—the pipes could not be seen through the furnace door——I had to do something to these very pipes—if the naked fire came in contact with them, they would be burnt all to pieces in a week, I should say.</p>

I have been for many years foreman of the tallow pressing at Bauwens' Patent Candle Company, I remember the furnace being erected, and the still constructed—the pipes of the furnace were exactly the same as this model; it is a correct representation—there were Stourbridge tiles between the pipes and the fire, and it was not possible for the fire to affect the pipes—the construction has remained substantially the same to the present time—it is not possible to see the pipes by looking through the furnace door—they can be seen by looking through the sight hole when there is a fire—I have never seen them red hot—you may see the hot air, but as to seeing the pipes red hot, it is a thing impossible—the fire playing betwixt them might seem to be a little red, but they were never red with heat—I remember the flue which contained them being cleaned—soot used to collect in it—Hastings was employed there a portion of the time I was there, as stoker, and I saw him once engaged in cleaning out the flue.</p>

               <p>took the new coil from the smith's shop, carried it to the furnace, and rested it in its bed, and Wickham went to Mr. Napoleon Bauwens to find out whether it was suitable—he came and said that the heat could not get under the side pipes, and told us to raise it—we raised it with half a fire brick at each end, so as to allow a play round the coil; but the half fire brick was too high, and we altered it by putting what they call a slip—when that was done the coil rested on standards on one end, and a fire lump at the other, and was covered with sand—I could not see anything between the pipes and the fire—there were no Stourbridge tiles at that time—if there were I must have seen them—we had occasion to lift up the pipes while fixing them, and I knelt down, on the two surfaces, and had a great deal of trouble to get my hand down—I could not get it on the other side to put the bit of slip in, so I put my hand down in the centre of the coil to put it in, and am able to say that down the middle, underneath the coil, there was nothing between there and the fire—there was a space—after the coil was put in we tied it up with some copper wire to keep it up as a fixture, and we noticed how long the copper wire lasted—it was a question among us every morning, whether the copper wire had given way—we looked through the sight hole to see how the heat was, on the pipes, and they were red hot—it was work which I had not been on previously, and I took an interest in it, and looked at it often, and on such occasions the pipes were red hot—I have looked through the furnace door and seen the pipes, but if there had been Stour<lb/>bridge tiles between the pipes and the fire I could not have done so—that coil lasted nearly six months; and Mr. Bauwens, the master, came and told me he wanted me and some one else to do some work—it was to make a new coil of pipes for the still—I saw the old coil taken out for me—it was resting on the bits of tiling, as we had put it in—there were no Stourbridge lumps, only a fire lump for it to rest upon, but nothing in the centre between it and the fire—the coil was most dreadfully burnt, and I made a new one out of second hand pipes, and put that in—I cannot say the day, because it was regular work—there was a question asked, "These last pipes being new lasted six months, I wonder how long these will last, being made out of second hand pipes?"—I worked the old ones in, having cut the middle out of them to make a long length—the middles were the strongest—I took the best parts—we commenced to put them in on the Friday night, me and a man named Dawson; we left it on Friday night, and we had it in on Saturday night, I believe—Hastings assisted to carry the coil from the workshop to the place, but not at any other part of the workmanship—that coil was put down on the same principle as the previous one—there were no Stourbridge tiles between it and the furnace—it rested the same as the other—it was put in in the same way, and we had the directions from Mr. Napoleon Bauwens—we lashed these together with iron wire, and passed the steam through to see that it was all right before we left it—there was a question whether the iron wire would last longer than the copper wire—I saw it at work frequently, and the pipes were red hot—I cannot say that I took the trouble to look at them through the furnace door, because there was this peep hole which I had made the sketch for, and I could see through that that the pipes were red hot—that coil lasted some weeks longer than the other—when they were burnt out, a third coil was put in by Weeks—I was the stoker at that time—I cannot say when Weeks came—he was dis<lb/>charged after the Crimean war, and came to work there—the second coil was taken out some six or eight weeks before Christmas, but I did not see</p>

                  </hi>. I have been engaged in chemical pur<lb/>suits for a great number of years—I have made a great number of experi<lb/>ments with Dr. Hofmann, for the purpose of getting evidence in the action against Bauwens' for the infringement of Price's patent, in June last—they were conducted with the most rigorous accuracy—we stipulated that we should have complete command of the apparatus, and of the material to be distilled, and have every opportunity afforded for the examination of it, and that that which was left from day to day should be under our seal, and we had all those advantages—the laboratory was completely under our control—the result of our experiments was not that it was injurious both in point of quantity and quality to work with superheated steam; quite the contrary—in the first place, we found whether we distilled without steam at all by the direct action of the fire, or whether with subheated or superheated steam,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140032"/>
               <p>that the effect was the same in all cases; but when we came to compare the quantity produced and the amount of decomposition, we found that, without the use of steam, there was a certain amount of loss; when we used the sub<lb/>heated steam there was less, and still less with the superheated steam, and we had evidence of there being more pitch in the first, less in the second, and least in the third—pitchy matter arises from the decomposition of the original matter—comparing the subheated steam with the distillation by open fire, there is a loss of 98/10 per cent., when distilled by the naked fire, without steam, and 7 1/2 per cent with subheated steam, making a saving of 21/3; per cent, with subheated steam over that of the fire without steam; but when we used the superheated steam the loss in two experiments tried with one another was only 2 1/2 per cent; so that there was an advantage of 5 per cent, in the yield over the other processes; not only was the pitch less, but there was less gaseous matter produced—the result of the experiment was to satisfy us that persons having the right to work with superheated steam will adopt it as the most beneficial mode—the difference is considerable for such manufactories—that would be one candle in twenty—I have heard it stated that there was soot of a red character, by one witness, and that it was not of a black colour, by another—that would lead me to conclude that the temperature of the flue was above 800 degrees Fahrenheit, otherwise the carbonaceous matter would remain unconsumed—the red matter is the ash of the organic matter, containing a little iron—that is the lowest heat at which the combustion of carbonaceous matter would take place—I am able to say that wrought iron pipes exposed to such a temperature in a flue, not in direct contact with the fuel, and not subject to be red hot, and then allowed to cool, would last a considerable number of months—I have had great experience, and have apparatus at work constructed of wrought iron, similar to these pipes; but the case is different in allowing pipes to remain constantly, or nearly constantly, at one temperature, preventing them from cooling below redness, because the cake of oxide on the outer surface scales off on cooling, in consequence of the rate of expansion in the iron being different; if it is again raised to a red heat, a fresh coating of oxide is formed, and when it cools that flakes off, and thus you gradually oxidise and use up a pipe; but if it is kept at a red heat the coating of oxide actually protects it from the action of the fire; but if it is placed in contact with the fire, the coals containing sulphur, a sulphnret is formed, and the pipe is soon destroyed—these of Mr. Bauwens would last upwards of six months, because I have had pipes myself exposed in that way to the direct action of flame, but not of the coal, exposed to the action of the fire so as to produce a red heat, like heating by gas in contradistinction to solid fuel—here are several layers of oxide scaled off this pipe, and I should say it has been heated and cooled several times.</p>

"—the prisoner said he was going to the Chequers, and we went up there to the pigs—the prisoner then said, "Collins, I am almost afraid I have not got cash enough in my pocket, will you mind taking a walk down the town with me?" and he mentioned the names of two or three persons that he thought he should see; we went down the town, and into a beer house—we went back to the Chequers, and the prisoner said, "Now then, Collins, put the pigs into the cart, and we will go in, and have a pint of ale"—I do not know whose cart it was, there was no name on it—the prisoner then said, "If you will come and have a glass of ale, I will pay you the money"—the pigs were driven down the town—I thought be meant to go into the Chequers, but he went down the town—John got into the cart, and drove; I took hold of the horse's head; I did not want to let go till I was paid the money—I led the horse down from the Chequers to the Castle, 200 or 300 yards—in going along, John said once or twice, "Let go the horse; he is a young horse, and don't like to be led"—when we got to the Castle, the prisoner said, "Now John, stop the horse while I go in and pay for the pigs"—he stopped the horse, and the prisoner and I went in—there were a lot of men in there—I left the pigs in the cart—the prisoner called for a pint of ale, and when the land-lord wanted to know who was to pay for it, the prisoner had <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi>, and the cart and pigs were gone—I did not see the prisoner again till seven weeks ago to-day—I saw him at Twickenham, and identified him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Swan and Bottle public house, Uxbridge. I recollect the fair day, in March last—I saw Collins there with a man named May, which was the prisoner—I did not know him before; I am quite sure he is the man—I saw him about three quarters of an hour—I stood over him that time waiting for my money—he had no money to pay for his ale—at last Mr. Collins paid a shilling—I did not see who got the change—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this the fair day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a good many people used our house that day—my mistress was in the bar—she is not here—she did not try to get the money—this was in the parlour; there were many people there—I had never seen the prisoner before—I do not know how he was dressed—he had a stick in his hand—he did not pay me any money—I saw him again before the Magistrate, being examined—I was not shown him by the constable, I knew him without being shown—that was the first time I saw him again—they did not take me down stairs and show me a number of persons, and tell me to pick him out.</p>

I was in the dormitory at the time they were returning from chapel—the door of the dormitory leads into the passage along which we have to pass—if you were going to the dormitory from the chapel, you have to pass along one passage first, then to ascend some steps into another passage—the door of the dormitory is at the end of the passage, about six or eight yards from the angle, not more—after having turned round the angle, six or eight yards further on is the door of the dormitory—my attention was not drawn by any noise beyond the unlocking of the door; that was the signal that they were coming out of chapel, and I went to the door of the dormitory to meet them—Bevington was the first person I saw when I got to the door—he passed exactly in front of me, and nearly close to me, he staggered past me, but the side of his face that was injured was not next me, and I did not know whether he was taken suddenly ill or what; he passed me into the dormitory—I did not then see that he was wounded—there was only just room for me to pass between the officer and the prisoner; he was close to my right hand, and the officer close to my left—I should not think he was more than one yard from Bevington—I distinctly remember seeing two other penal class prisoners besides the prisoner, almost close up to him; they were all in a short space, the length of this Jury box—Gorman went in the direction of his ward after Bevington staggered; I asked him what he had been doing, or what was the matter; I looked towards the prisoner for an explanation; I am not sure whether he gave me any reply, but I think he said he had been doing nothing—he then passed me on his way to the ward, and I followed him—I went down two flights of stairs in going to the ward—there was an officer at the bottom of those stairs—I called to the officer to stop him; some suspicion crossed my mind, and I did not feel satisfied—he stopped at the end of the ward; I went down and laid hold of both his hands, and examined them, and took a superficial view of him; at that time I could see nothing about him—I questioned him again if he had been doing anything; he said he had not, and that he had nothing about him—I searched him thoroughly after that, and found nothing on him—I saw the warder Humphrey pick up the knife at the bottom of the stairs; he handed it to me immediately—he picked it up immediately underneath where the prisoner had to pass in going down to his ward—that was on the lower flight, where the wards are—he had not to pass where the knife was found, but I believe he went along the centre floor, and the knife was found on the bottom floor—a knife could have been dropped from the place where the prisoner passed to the place where it was picked up by Humphrey—when Humphrey brought me that knife, there was a small quantity of fresh blood on the handle,</p>

It was my duty to lead a party of the penal class prisoners from chapel on 21st Aug.—I came out of the chapel first; Learing came next to me, Harris next, and the prisoner next—when I was ascending the stain, I disco<lb/>vered that Gorman had taken the lead, and was next to me—we go along a passage, and then have to turn at right angles into another passage, that leads past the dormitory door—after I had turned that angle, I received a violent stab, which I supposed to be a blow, on the right cheek—I staggered into the dormitory door—I did not see who struck the blow, but as I staggered from the passage I saw Gorman pass me; he was next to me—I did not see any of the other prisoners at that time, for the officers led me to a chair—I do not consider that either of the other prisoners could have struck me—the passage where I was stabbed is about three feet wide—the men were walking in single file—the surgeon of the prison, Mr. Savory, attended me—I am not still under his care—I was under treatment for it fourteen or sixteen days—I had only been a warder in that ward for two days up to that time—I do not think I had had anything to do with the prisoner before; I do not think I had been in this ward before, since he had been in the prison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident surgeon at Millbank. On the morning of 21st Aug. I was called on to attend to Bevington, in the dor<lb/>mitory—I found that he had a wound on the cheek, it was bleeding very freely indeed—I probed it, it had passed a distance of three inches obliquely through the cheek, entering between the right cheek bone, and going between the gum and the upper lip—it was a dangerous wound—two branches of the temporal artery had been severed—for a week or ten days he was in a decidedly precarious state—the wound has now healed—this knife would inflict such a wound, it has a sharpish point, but net a very sharp blade; it would require great force to penetrate the distance it did with an instrument of that description—it is a dangerous part.</p>

On 24th Aug., when I went to bed, my window was not quite down; the shutters were closed, but not bolted, because it had been painted—I could not say whether there was room for anybody to get in—I was disturbed about half past 4 o'clock in the morning—I heard a noise in the front room; I got up, and saw a man going out and pulling the door to—I ran out, and saw the prisoner forty or fifty yards off—I hallooed, and he came back, and said he had taken nothing from me—I laid hold of him—he tried to get away, and said he had not taken anything, that he saw the door open, and went in for a necessary purpose—he asked me to let him go to his work, and he would give me what he had got, as he did not want to get into trouble—he then said he was hungry, and he had done it through hunger—I held him till a policeman came, and gave him in charge—I examined my house, but missed nothing—I expect he got in at the window, which might have been left wide enough for him to get in—I had left the door shut and hasped the previous night, and in the morning it was open—I gave an alarm, and he opened the door, and got out.</p>

I was present on 24th Aug., when the prisoner came—he had a lot of chains wrapped up in whity brown paper—I know that he can read English because he read some bills which were stuck up opposite the house—my husband told him that he would not buy the chains on his own judgment, but wished to take them to a pawnbroker's, and the prisoner lent him one for the purpose—he said that my husband was a long time gone, and said, "I do not value 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I shall not stop any longer"—I said, "Do not go without the chain"—he looked out at the window, and said, "Here he comes, with his long pipe in his mouth"—my husband came in, and said the chains were common, he did not like to buy them at all without having them assayed, and might he cut a piece off—the prisoner consented, and he did so—my husband went away for an hour while the prisoner waited—he came back, and said, "They are very common, I cannot buy them"—the prisoner said, "What will you give?"—he tied the parcel up with a bit of red tape, and put it into his pocket—my husband said he would give 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said, "No," and then my husband said he would give 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner said, "Yes"—my husband put the 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into his hand, and the prisoner took a parcel from the same pocket, and passed it to my husband—it was done up just in the same way—he then went away to get a receipt, and we detected that it was the wrong parcel, and the piece of chain that had been cut off was not in it—on 31st Aug. I met the prisoner in Leather Lane, at 10 o'clock in the morning—I followed him—he crossed over to the other side of the way, and stopped; I then stopped—he said, "Are you following me?"—I said, "Yes, I am looking for a constable, to give you in custody"—he turned round, came back, and said, "Me go to police station with you"—I said, "Yes"—he got a little further, and said, "No, me come down this way"—he got very restless, and tried to get away—I said, "If you run, I shall call, "Stop thief!"—he said, "Me come down to your house"—I said, "Well"—I then saw a policeman, and asked him to follow me home—we walked in, and I said to the prisoner, "You have robbed me of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., what are you going to give me back?"—he said, "Me</p>

On Saturday night, 23rd Aug., about 12 o'clock, I went into an ice shop in the Hampstead Road—after I had been there a little while, the prisoner came in, with his wife and brother-in-law—he was drunk, but not very drunk—he fell asleep; the shopman, Benzonelli, tried to wake him, but could not—he woke him up at last; I think that was about 2 o'clock—he tried to wake him first by throwing some water in his face; then they got a piece of ice and put down his back, but that did not wake him—he then put another piece of ice; that shook him a little, but he did not wake—a little while afterwards the master of the house, who had been asleep, woke</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140066"/>
               <p>up, and then they got him off the chair, and he fell down—he got up, and got on another chair, and then Benzonelli went and got the shutters, and pushed him, and then he got up and went outside—Benzonelli then went and put up the shutters, and came in doors; the prisoner spoke to him, but I did not hear the words, and hit him on the side of the face with his right hand—Benzonelli tried to kick at him, but he did not kick him; he kept following him up, trying to kick him—I did not see the prisoner do any<lb/>thing then—Benzonelli then turned back and got a stick; while he was gone to get it, I heard the prisoner say, "Let him come"—I did not hear anything else—Benzonelli tried to hit him with the stick, but he did not hit him—they ran in together up against the shutters, scuffling; they had hold of each other—then two policemen came up, and the prisoner was taken to the station house—I followed—as I was going along I saw a knife dropped by the prisoner's wife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I picked it up, and gave it to another boy.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">through an interpreter</hi>). I keep an ice shop, at No. 17, Adam's Row, Hampstead Road. The deceased, Gallo Benzonelli, was in my employment; he was twenty-one years of age—on Saturday night 23rd Aug., the prisoner came into my shop with a man and woman—he placed himself on a chair, and went to sleep, from about 2 o'clock until 3—while he was sleeping I do not recollect that anything happened; the deceased was doing his duty, and the prisoner was sleeping—it was about 3 o'clock when Ben<lb/>zonelli asked me whether he was to shut up the shop—I said, "You may do so, and tell the people here that they must go away"—he went to the pri<lb/>soner, and as he could not express himself better in English, he only said, "Come, get up"—the prisoner's wife also said to him, "Do not make a fool of yourself, but come along"—when I saw that the words of my servant were of no use, I stepped forward myself, and said to the prisoner, "My lad, this won't do; it is late, get up, and go"—he got up, and began to swear, and said, "I will crack your head"—I went to the window to see if I could see a policeman to put him out—while I was standing behind the bar, I gave a glass of ice to a man named Wood, and then went and lighted a cigar, and I saw the prisoner's wife pulling him by the coat, and the deceased pushing him behind—when he was once out of doors, the deceased</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140067"/>
               <p>came in doors to get the shutters to put up, and when he was outside put<lb/>ting them up, the prisoner said, "You are a b—Frenchman, and a b—rogue," and he gave him three blows behind his ear; the deceased defended himself by giving him some kicks—I can only say that he endeavoured to kick him, but I could not see clearly whether he did kick him, as I was too far off—I then went out of doors to endeavour to separate them, and bring the deceased in—after bringing him in, he took a stick, and walked out with it, lifting it up—whilst he was standing in that position, the prisoner rushed upon him with a knife, as I suppose, but I did not see the knife, and the deceased gave him a blow with the stick on his back—I then took the stick away—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the policeman then came—I desired the deceased to come in doors, but he cried out, "I am wounded"—I afterwards saw the wound, and the intestines coming out of it—I went to the hospital to see the deceased; he was then dead.</p>

               <p>Aug. I was on duty in Endell Street, Drury Lane, about half past 2 o'clock in the day—while there I observed a boy running, followed by some other boys; they came out of a court there—I caught hold of the first boy, who was being pursued; that was to keep the other boys away from him—he went into a fit, and I proceeded with him to the workhouse—as I went, the prisoner followed me from the court, with a number of other girls—the prisoner pushed me, and my hat fell off in consequence—I was turning round to save my hat, and touched the prisoner in the face—I did it as I was swinging myself round to catch my hat; it was with my open hand—she said she would have my b—life for that—there was another con<lb/>stable near, and I told him to turn her back—he took her away—I went on to the workhouse with the boy, and left him there—I returned to my beat in Endell Street about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and met the prisoner at the corner of Short's Gardens and Endell Street—she came over to me from the other aide of Endell Street, and asked me whether I had taken the boy to the workhouse—I told her I had done so—she called me a <hi rend="italic">lagging sod</hi>, and said, "I suppose you would like to have <hi rend="italic">lagged him</hi>, like you have a good many others"—I told her to go away, that I wanted nothing to say to her—I put my hand on her shoulder, and told her to go—that was all—at the same moment I dropped my glove on the ground, and, as I stooped to pick it up, the prisoner said, "I have been home for something that will do for you," and I felt myself stabbed in the back, of the head, on the right side—I felt very weak, but tried to recover myself and, on getting up into an erect position, she stabbed me again in the neck, on the right side; she then stabbed at me again through the collar; it went through both my stock and the collar of my coat, and penetrated my neck slightly—she then tried to stab me in the stomach, at the same time she cut my browsers in three places about the waist, but did not touch my flesh—she then said, "If I can't have your life, I will put your b—eye out," and at the same time she struck at me with the knife; it cut me on the cheek—I caught her hand as it came at my eye, and brought it on my cheek bone—at that time I was very faint from loss of blood—I called out, "For God's sake, take the knife," and fainted—a person named Buckfield came up, and secured her, and another constable came up, and assisted—I was taken to the hospital, and had, my wounds dressed—I was five days in the hospital, and am still an out patient—the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

               <p>and seized her hand with the knife in it—she threatened to serve me the same—the constable was bleeding very much indeed from several wounds—I did not succeed in getting the knife away from the prisoner, she held it firmly; another constable came up and struck her over the knuckles, and then she dropped the knife on the pavement; he could not get it from her without—she said she could only be hung for it—I assisted in taking her to the station; the constable was taken to the hospital, he was in a very exhausted state—I firmly believe the prisoner was sober, she was excited.</p>

                  </hi>. I am senior clerk in the office of the Civil Service Commissioners. The defendant came to my office on 27th July—I asked him to answer in writing certain questions, which are printed on a paper, placing the paper before him, one of those questions being, "What was your age on your last birthday?"—this is the paper which he wrote in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">This described his birthday as May</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, 1840, <hi rend="italic">and his age last birthday as seventeen</hi>)—he had before, or at the time he had that paper given to him, handed in certain papers which I examined, while he was filling up the form—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I looked at them, and noticed that there were erasures, and, when he brought me the paper filled op, I said to him, "Are you aware that both these certificates have been altered?"—he said, "Yes"—I then said to him, "How do you account for that?"—he said that Mr. Hatchard, who is the gentleman signing one of them, had at first sent them up wrong, and that he had returned them to Mr. Hatchard to be corrected, and Mr. Hatchard had returned them in their present state to him—I said it was impossible that that explana<lb/>tion could be the correct one, because one of the certificates was the super<lb/>intendent registrar's certificate, with which Mr. Hatchard would have nothing to do, and which he would certainly not alter—he repeated that that had been the cause—I again expressed some doubt, and he then replied that he did not know how it was; he supposed his father would know some<lb/>thing about it—I retained these papers—he was examined, I think, on the following day—the papers were then in the same state as they are now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the office for which he was an applicant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A temporary clerkship under the Admiralty—I have no means of knowing what the salary would be attached to that—the appointment would be one that he would be liable to be turned out of immediately, as I understand it, but I do not know exactly—I gave him the order for exami<lb/>nation in the usual course, and sent him in to the Commissioners, leaving it to them to do as they thought proper; turning him away from examination was beyond my power—he was examined before the Commissioners decided on the case, but the examination was never considered—I am quite certain that when I said to him, "Are you aware there have been alterations?" he replied, "Yes"—I can pledge my oath of it; I say so distinctly—he used the word "Yes"—when he spoke of the papers having been sent down to Mr. Hatchard, he said, "I sent them down," but that I am not so positive about; I believe he did not say they had been sent down, but I would not pledge myself that he did not.</p>

I was not in town on the night this happened; I left home on the Monday previously—I received a telegraphic message, and came to town—this silk was in stock when I left; it was purchased on 0th June; there were fifty-two yards of it—we generally sell thirteen yards, we never sell twenty-six yards and a half—we had sold thirteen yards of it, and twelve yards and half, which would leave exactly twenty-six yards and a half—it is a very particular pattern—this mark is quite peculiar to my business—I never knew it done by any one; it has been attempted to be obliterated—I have examined it with a microscope; they have left a certain portion, which I am able to say is my mark—on this paper is "329 at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" that would be the length of three whole pieces of silk that we lost—the price of it would be about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—this eighty-six yards I can say nothing about—the ninety-five handkerchiefs exactly correspond with a portion that we lost—the four table covers we lost were worth 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—the handkerchiefs were worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—here is some Coburg, and something else which I cannot read.</p>

The prisoner had a room in my house—a man named George Campbell lived with her as her husband—they lived there nine or ten weeks—she had lived in the street for some years—she had a child, whom I had heard called Jane Campbell—Campbell had left the prisoner on the Wednesday before this happened on the Saturday night—he had left her very much in debt—I thought that had an effect on the prisoner—on the Saturday night, 29th Aug., between 8 and 9 o'clock, I heard a great screaming as I was going up stairs—I went into my own bed room, and saw the prisoner there, with the child in her lap, twisting a rope as hard as she could round it's neck—it was struggling to get out of her lap—I called out loudly, and called Mrs. Quin—she came up, and took the child—she had got out of her mother's lap, and was making her way down stairs as fast as she could—I had taken the rope off her neck—she was bleeding very much from the nose and mouth—the prisoner looked to me as if she had been drinking, but are got perfectly sober afterwards—when she got to the station, she seemed quite sober—after I had taken the rope off the child, the prisoner said, "I</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Woolwich. On a Thursday evening, about the middle of Feb., I put a counterpane into a tub, put it on a copper, and set it at the foot of the stairs, and the next morning it was missed—the prisoner lived at the next house to me—I afterwards received the ticket of the counterpane from Mr. Miller—the prisoner had gone away before I received the ticket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a guard on the North Kent Railway. I have been on the line ten years next Nov., and have been a guard seven years—on Sunday, 28th June, I was the head guard of a train which left Strood at 9.15 at night—a person of the name of Hughes was the underguard—the train consisted of fourteen carriages—it was due at Blackheath at 10.17; we arrived there at 10.32—that was a station at which we ought to stop with that train; we took in and let out passengers there—the train was nearly full—we remained at Blackheath about three or four minutes, I could not say which it was—my mate started the train from there, by having the signal from me—I got the signal to start it, from Mr. Chapman, the station master; I gave the signal to Hughes, and he would give it to the driver—I occupied the tail end of the train, and Hughes the former part—the next station from Blackheath up to London is Lewisham—that was not a station that this train ought to have stopped at—after getting away from the station at Blackheath, a little way before coming to the first bridge, I saw the distance signal, the red light—that was the signal at Lewisham; when I observed that, my duty was to apply the break and to stop the train—I applied the break slightly on this occasion, and the steam was turned off, and the train ran up to the distance signal—we pulled up very nearly dead; I do not think we did quite stop dead at the distance signal, we did at the station signal—the end of the train had got ninety yards beyond the distance signal—the station signal was at red also, that is danger; a good red light is the danger signal—we did not draw the train up to the platform—when the train was stopped, I got out of my break where I sat; I was informed that we were waiting for the "All clear" signal—when we had stopped there six or seven minutes, I heard the whistle of the engine belonging to the Beckenham train—I did not see the Becken<lb/>ham train pass; it would come on the main line before us, and run up the same line that we were to run up—after I heard the engine whistle I came close up to my break, and stood on the "six foot," thinking it was our engine whistle, and that we should start, as we had staid there five or six minutes—the "six foot" is the space between the up and down rails—I expected to go on, but we did not—when I found that we did not go on, after standing at the break for a minute or two, I went back past the distance signal 140 or 150 yards—I should say we had then been there seven or eight minutes, or more; I cannot say now; I did not notice the time—I went down the line about 140 or 150 yards past the distance signal—I took a red lamp with me—when I saw the train coming I ran towards it, and whistled and waved the lamp—the light was in my hand before I saw the train coming; I had it all the time; it was a hand lamp of my own—I did not take the tail lamp off; that stopped on the train—there was one red tail lamp to my train—after I whistled and waved my hand the other train passed me—when it came opposite to me, I shouted out as loud as I could halloo for them to stop it—when it went past me I should say it was going at the rate of twenty miles an hour—after it had passed me I heard a collision—I then went towards my train, but before I got to it I thought of the other train, and I went up towards the Black<lb/>heath station, to stop everything up—I saw the station master, and made a communication, to stop all the trains coming up—I did not notice the distance signal as I went down the line from Lewisham towards Black<lb/>health;</p>

ROBINSON</hi>.). <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This train that you were driving came from Strood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from Black<lb/>heath to New Cross it would be an express train—we should not stop at Lewisham—there were fourteen carriages in my train—it was a very crowded train—we were about fourteen or fifteen minutes late at Black<lb/>heath—we were not as much as thirty-two minutes late there—it was due there at 10.17 and arrived at 10.32—that was just about the time we ought to have been at London Bridge—it was due there at 10.45—we arrived at Blackheath at 10.32, and we ought to have been there at 10.17—I do not know why my train did not go on further, that has nothing to do with me, the station master has got the control of the train when I am stopped at a station—we were not as much as 200 yards on the Blackheath side of the Lewisham platform—I should say we were not more than 100 yards—I am speaking of the tail end of the train—the engine was within five or six yards, or more than that, it might be—the tail end, by my calculation, was over ninety yards within the distance signal—I cannot say how long I have been on that particular line, because I have been changed—I have been on the main road, and on several of the branches—I have been on that road sufficiently to know it well—I have served five or six yean on it—from the Blackheath station, going to Lewisham, there it a decline, right down to the distance signal, I believe; and from the distance signal to the Lewis<lb/>ham station there is a very slight ascent—the train that came in on ours and caused the accident, was a very heavy train—I believe it was the weight of eighteen carriages, though it only consisted of fifteen—there were some composite carriages—I should say we waited, altogether, seventeen of eighteen minutes at Lewisham, from the time we drew up to the time of tile collision—if everything had been clear and right on the line, we ought not to have stopped at Lewisham that night—I should say that the Lewis<lb/>ham junction, where the Beckenham train would pass, is about 140 or 160 yards from the Lewisham station, but I do not know for certain; it is a good deal over 100 yards—the ordinary trains are allowed three minutes from Blackheath to Lewisham, and to put down and take up passengers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the ordinary course of things your train was causing an obstruc<lb/>tion to the up line, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They do not call it an obstruction, only waiting for the "All clear" signal; it may be an obstruction, but we do not work it as such—I know the Company's seventh rule, and also the third rule, under the heading of fog signals—I did not act upon the seventh rule, it was not my business to do so then—no fog signals were shown—we started from Strood at a quarter past 9 o'clock, and were fifteen minutes late at Blackheath—I was aware the 9.30 train would follow us, and that its time was up—I was not talking to a gentleman when this accident happened—I do not know Mr. Heath—I do not know whether any of the passengers were examined on the inquiry in the court below—I do no know that a gentleman of the name of Wilcox was examined—I have heard say so—I do not know whether Mr. Shaw or Mr. Spratt was examined—I did not hear them examined—I know that certain passengers were examined—I am prepared to swear that I was not talking to any passenger as the 9.30 train came up—there is a person of the name of Hughes connected with my train—I was not talking to a passenger when I heard the sound of the approaching train, nor did I call out "Hughes, Hughes!" and then run back as fast as I could—the time I called out for Hughes was when I heard</p>

               <p>the Beckenham train start—that was seven or eight minutes before the other train came up—I did not run back just at the time I called out, "Hugher;" it might be about a minute or so—I went back to where I started from—I did not hear any train, and did not know any train was coming—I did not know the train had started from Blackheath—our rules are not to start, and I did not know she was coming—we were waiting for the "all clear" signals at Blackheath, the same as we were at Lewisham, and at the Dockyard, and Charlton—we had been detained five minutes at each station—we were waiting for orders to go on at each, the same as at Lewisham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the engineer's office of the South Eastern Railway. I have measured the distances in question on this line—from the London end of the platform at the Blackheath station to the first bridge is 545 yards, that is the Love Lane bridge—the width of the bridge is 8 yards—from that bridge to the bridge just before you come to the Lewisham station it is 370 yards—the width of that bridge is 5 yards, and from that bridge to the distance signal is 53 yards—from the distance signal to the station signal is 281 yards—from the station signal to the platform at Lewisham station on the up line is 20 yards—the total distance from the two platforms is 1, 285 yards—the 9.15 train had fourteen car<lb/>riages, and an engine of the ordinary length—its total length was 103 yards—supposing that train to have stopped 13 yards short of the station signal, there would be 165 yards between the tail end of the train and the distance signal—the distance from the Blackheath end of the Lewisham platform to the junction of the Beckenham railway is 442 yards—the plat<lb/>form is 107 yards long—when I say that, supposing the train to have stopped 13 yards from the station signal, there would be 165 yards between the tail end of the train and the distance signal, I measure from the Black<lb/>heath end of the platform—the Beckenham line comes in at the junction, and runs upon the same line of rail—starting from Blackheath platform, there is a fall of 1 in 528 for about 187 yards—that is a moderate incline—from there, for about a distance of 484 yards, there is a fall of 1 in 132; and from there, through the Lewisham station, it falls 1 in 352.</p>

               <p>I to be filled with the average weight of passengers—I started with my experimental train from Blackheath station towards Lewisham—we had attained a speed, as near as I can guess, of about eighteen miles an hour before we endeavoured to stop it—I go, of course, from the driver's opinion of speed in preference to my own, he being more accustomed to it—my judgment coincided with his—we then shut off the steam, and endea<lb/>voured to stop the train—we were about seventy yards from the first bridge, the Love Lane bridge, when we shut off the steam, and applied the breaks, on the Lewisham side—when we stopped, the funnel of the engine was under the Lewisham bridge—the total distance from the point where we turned off the steam until the train stopped dead, was 300 yards—you can see the distance signal all the way from the Blackheath station—the state of the rails was not favourable for stopping at the time I made this experiment—it had been raining the greater part of the morning, and had stopped for about an hour or so before the experiment was made—that made the rails very greasy.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an engine driver on the North Kent line, and was the driver of the 9.15 train on the night the accident occurred—our train stopped at Blackheath, and after taking in passengers we proceeded on towards Lewisham—I was on the engine—Hall, the fireman, was with me—the guard gave me the signal to start from Blackheath—we were fourteen or fifteen minutes late—we had been detained slightly at Charlton and Woolwich—our train would go through Lewisham to New Cross—we were stopped at Lewisham by the distance signal—it had a red light—I first saw that about the first bridge from Blackheath, the Love Lane bridge—I turned the steam off before I reached that bridge—I cannot say whether the breaks were applied by the guards; they would not require it—I whistled, but not to put the breaks on—I do not think they were put on—our train all but stopped at the distance signal, and we proceeded between the distance signal and the semaphore, or station signal—we went in past the distance signal, and were between the two—the station signal was at danger also, red—we were just moving as we passed the distance signal—we could have stopped within two or three yards—I did that for the pro<lb/>tection of my train—it just went in beyond the distance signal, as we should be safe there from anything following us.</p>

I was head guard to the 9.30 train on the night this accident occurred—the train consisted of fifteen carriages in number, and eighteen in weight—they had about the average number of passengers in them for a Sunday night—we have more passengers on Sunday nights than on others—my under guard started the train from Blackheath after I gave him the signal—I got the signal from Mr. Chapman, the station master—I was in the rear of the train, and the under guard in front—Perry was the driver of the engine—Whiffen was the assistant, the fireman, or stoker—I did not hear Mr. Chapman ask any questions of anybody before he started the train—after we had started from Blackheath, on our way to Lewisham, I saw the red light—that was just as we passed the first bridge from Blackheath, the Love Lane bridge—the light I saw was the distance signal of the Lewisham station—on observing that red light, I put on the break the first thing—it would have been the duty of the engine driver to have given me the signal to have put on the break if he saw the red light—he did not do that—I put on the break on seeing the red light—I then leaned out of window, and saw two other red lights—I was in one of the observatory breaks, but I looked out of the side window, the door window—the other two red lights turned out to be, one, the semaphore signal at the station, and the other the tail light at the end of the train—the collision happened immediately afterwards—I am not aware that any<lb/>thing was done by the driver or the foreman in consequence of my putting</p>

                  </hi>. I am station master at Blackheath, I Started both these trains—I started the last train, the 9.30, from Strood, at about 10.53—I started it on the authority of the signal man—I saw Wiley that night after the last train had started—he came and made some communication to me—the distance signal at Lewisham can be seen from the Blackheath station both by day and night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station master at Lewisham. I was on duty there on the night of the accident—the 9.15 train was stopped at our station—it would not stop there in the ordinary course—I noticed the distance signal at the time that train arrived—it stood at danger—it also stood, at danger when the 9.30 train came in—the 9.15 train stopped, I suppose, about twenty yards from the platform—it did not come up to, the platform at all—there was no room in it for any passengers—a good many passengers were waiting to go to London—I noticed the Beckenham train come in on that line from the branch—I was on the platform when the collision took place—several persons were killed—I afterwards went down to look at the distance signal—I found it on full danger to Blackheath—I saw. Perry after the collision, and had some conversation with him—he did not make any complaint to me of the state of the red light—we make a point of adjust<lb/>ing that red light three times a day, and oftener, if required—it is operated on by means of a wire which works on a lever—the wire is apt to he, affected by the atmosphere—it had been rectified that day.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But complaints have been made to you of the state of that signal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Occasionally; not of its being a doubtful signal, but about the adjustment of it—the adjustment of a signal is the making it what it ought to be—it was not chronically imper<lb/>fect, if I may use the term—complaints were made from time to time that it required adjustment—a thing requires adjustment when it gets oat of order—I should say it has been out of order in that way half a dozen times in six months—I do not remember Hill, the driver, complaining of the imperfection of this, signal—I cannot swear that he has not—I cannot point out the driver who has complained—I have had complaints from drivers, probably from three or four; I should say not from so many as five or six—I did not report it to the locomotive foreman—we adjust the signal, every day—we did so before the accident, and we have done so since—all distance signals require it daily—I cannot say that this requires it more than others—the gas fitter has been there—I do not know, what he has done with the pipes—something has been done since the accident—it is not correct, that on the Tuesday following the accident the pipes were examined, and that water was found in them impeding the operation of the gas—I sent for the gas fitter to examine them, and, my impression is that he undid the pipes—I did not see what he did—I did not inquire what was the matter—he told me nothing was the matter—I believe he is here—I sent for him, because I found the light burning at midday, which it ought not to have been—that was on the Tuesday—it appeared to me then not to be so large as I had previously seen it, and I immediately wrote down to the gas fitter to come and see to it, and he did so—the light did not become larger in conse<lb/>quence—I did not perceive any difference—he told me it was the day pressure—there is a difference between the day pressure and the night pressure—the wire has been broken twice since the accident, and it has been repaired—the glass has been broken, and that has been repaired—the light has not been looked to in consequence of the accident, and repaired, and made a good light, instead of a bad one—it is not a bad light now, it is a good light, and it was a good light then—since the accident the gas pipes have been discon<lb/>neeted,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185709140110"/>
               <p>and looked to—I cannot say that they have been cleaned out—it is my impression that they have been cleaned out under my direction—the gas pipes have certainly been cleaned out under my directions, to improve the light—I am not aware that they have been cleaned out and brightened since the accident—I was not present—I really cannot say that they have—I am the station master there still—I have not been suspended or blamed, not the slightest—I have not been complimented or praised that I am aware of—the 9.15 train was stopped at the station very nearly twenty minutes, I should say—I was aware that that train was considerably past its time when it arrived at the Lewisham station—I was aware that the 9.30 train had to follow it, starting from Strood a quarter of an hour after it—I did not take any steps to give warning to the 9.30 train that was coming—a great number of persons were waiting at my station to go on to London—I should suppose not far off 100—I believe the distance between the Lewisham platform and the Lewisham junction is about 440 yards—the 9.15 train was standing right on the platform of the Lewisham station, between that and Blackheath—I knew that the 9.30 train was going to stop at Lewisham—it would have been totally against orders and usage to have taken the 9.15 train on to the space between the Lewisham junction and the station—I have not said that the reason I did not do so was because I was afraid that the people waiting at the station would get into it; the reason I did not draw it up to the platform was, to prevent parties rush<lb/>ing and attempting to get in where there was no room—the only reason why it was not drawn past the platform was, that it was against all orders and usage—I am not aware that there is any written order which says that I shall not place a train in safety under such circumstances—if I had allowed the train to have gone past my station, it might have gone across the junction crossing, and there was no signal man there to stop it; the engine might have gone over the cross road, nobody would have control over it; we trusted entirely to the telegraph and the road signals—then was a danger signal up at the junction, but he might have got across the line, and still hare been beyond the signal.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I n your judgment, would that have been a dangerous proceeding? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I knew that the 9.30 train was to follow this in due course—I knew that according to the rules and regulations it could not start from Blackheath without the signal being made that all was clear from Lewisham—I also knew that the red signal of danger was up at Lewisham—the complaints made to me about the state of the distance signal were mere passing remarks, that the distance signal did not stand light—those complaints were attended to immediately, and it was set to rights at once—it is turned by a wire that is worked by a lever; if the wire gets stiffened or contracted it does not turn it perfectly square round; it would, perhaps, be a little oblique, so that the next time it was looked at it would not be square—that was always remedied by altering the wire—there is a coupling for the purpose, so as to admit of the wire being shortened or lengthened—it is so with every distance signal, and every station signal; it is lighted by gas—I cannot say how often it is looked to by the gas workmen, it is occasionally looked to—after this accident occur<lb/>red, I sent for the gas man usually employed, and desired him to look to the light—I did not myself see anything that he did—after he had been there he returned to me, and told me there was nothing the matter—that is all I know about it—I do not know of any such operation as brightening gas pipes.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) I recollect sleeping in the infirmary ward on Sunday, 6th Sept.—I knew Hodges—in the course of the night I saw Preston get out of his bed, and go away into the closet, and take the bucket up, and then he came out, and walked round by the side of his own bed; then he went between the spare bed and Hodges', and then I saw him <hi rend="italic">job</hi> the pail down so (<hi rend="italic">with two hands</hi>); he did it violently four or five times—he was then close to where Hodges was lying—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pail.</p>

I was called up on Monday morning, 6th Sept., a few minutes before 4 o'clock—when I got there, I first saw the witness Sowerby, and then Hodges, who was lying on his left side across the bed, with his head hanging over, and blood running from it—I saw Preston sitting on his bed, in his shirt—he was quiet when I went into the room, until I lit the lamp; then he became violent, in consequence of which I and somebody eke held him down—I had locked him up the previous night—I had seen him for three month previously to that—I always thought he was of unsound mind—he went about the yard using very wild expressions at times—he appeared at other times in a very low and melancholy state—he said it was a wooden dolly when he saw the deceased lying on his bed—he said he had seduced his wife, and he did it, and it served him right—I took charge of the pail, and have produced it—I noticed some blood and a few gray hairs on it.</p>

I am a surgeon, living at No. 11, Trinity Street On Monday, Sept. 7th, I was called to Horsemonger Lane, about 4 o'clock in the morning—I saw Hodges, the deceased—he was quite dead—I exa<lb/>mined his head, and found a severe contusion over the eye, on the left side; and that side of the head, over the left temple, appeared to be beaten in—there was also a laceration on that side in the same place—there was some arterial blood dripping from the ear—in my judgment those wounds were caused by some heavy instrument being used on the head of the deceased—this pail is such a thing as would be very likely indeed to do it—it would be several blows—I should say that the death of Hodges was caused by those wounds—I saw Preston there—I had not seen him before that.</p>

                  </hi>. I had been attending at the gaol, as surgeon, for sixteen days before Sept. 7th, in consequence of the absence of Mr. Harris, on leave—I had seen Preston every day during that time—I con<lb/>sidered him of unsound mind from the first—I had had communications with Mr. Harris about him previously, about orders in the Surgeon's Journal—he was in the infirmary in accordance with those orders—I thought him of unsound mind—he was continually muttering to him<lb/>self, and had an idea that an operation was to be performed on him against his will—that was the chief thing—he was exceedingly low and depressed, and hardly ever looked up—I considered him entirely harmless.</p>
