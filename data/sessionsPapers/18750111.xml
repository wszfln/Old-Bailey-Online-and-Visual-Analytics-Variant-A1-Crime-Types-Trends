               <p>5th and 8th February, and then you appear to have left, because Mr. Strong, a solicitor, on your behalf called on the 10th—we have never ceased to take an interest in your affairs, we do so up to the present time; that is with a view of getting payment for your expenses when the time arrives, when the appeal is decided in favour of the claimants—Henry Robertson was willing to grant you a bond for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses—we did not obtain that, because you acted in such a manner as to refuse to allow Mr. Paddison to take the bond or to act for you—a suit was raised by you two and a half years ago against Henry Robertson to obtain payment of your expenses—I had to do with that suit, not in your interest, because you were claiming the money when you were not entitled to it—that action was defended by Henry Robertson, and very properly so—Mr. Tripp was the solicitor in that case; Mr. Henry Robertson employed him I believe—I do not know anything of Mr. Paddison employing him—he continued to act until the case was closed, he was at Guildhall at the time the case was tried; he instructed Counsel; we assisted Mr. Tripp in getting evidence in the case, we were then acting as solicitors for Mr. Henry Robertson in the Murfchley case; we had no retainer; it was not necessary, the case was carried on in Scotland, and the retainer, if any, is held by the solicitor in Scotland, not in England—we have no retainer from Mr. Henry Robertson, except a retainer that may be made out from written correspondence, no actual retainer—I had never seen Mr. Henry Robertson till I went to Aldershot, nor had Mr. Paddison to my knowledge—I was at Bow Street on the hearing of the sum<lb/>mons against Mr. Paddison for perjury, it was postponed for a week to give an opportunity for discontinuing an action at your instance against Mr. Pad<lb/>dison for the money alleged to be due on the Murthley estate; I was in and out of Court and really can't say what took place—the shorthand notes are in Court, you can refer to them—in the hearing before Sir F. Truscott I simply attended to prove your handwriting—I stated that you had to fly from Scotland; I had been told in Scotland that you had left in consequence of a warrant being out against you for breach of interdict by the Duke of Athol for going across Dunkeld Bridge, and that the warrant could not be served in England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The defendant came to Mr. Paddison in 1871 in reference to the case of a gentleman, his wife, and child, who were interested in the Murthley succession; that gentleman was Mr. Henry Robertson, at that time a sergeant-major in one of the cavalry regiments at Aldershot; he had mar<lb/>ried the widow of a Major Stewart, who was the direct heir to the baronetcy and estates of Murthley: the offspring of that union, her union with Major Stewart, was a son; there was a suit to declare his legitimacy and claim to the estates, and after the child died there was a second suit for the widow to claim her rights through her child; Henry Robertson was without funds—it was at the invitation of the defendant that Mr. Paddison was induced to take up the case—the defendant was to take his chance of the success of the suit—the second suit was decided in favour of the widow, the pursuer; one of the defenders, appealed to the House of Lords, and that stands for trial at present—the action brought by the defendant against Henry Robertson was tried at Guildhall before Mr. Justice Mellor, and the defendant was non-suited after having been examined; he then brought an action on the same facts against Mr. Paddison, in the course of which he delivered certain interrogatories to Mr. Paddison, and while that action was pending he preferred a charge of perjury at Bow Street upon Mr. Paddison's answer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110015"/>
               <p>to those interrogatories; that charge was dismissed—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter that he wrote to Mr. Paddison, dated 14th March, 1872; it is the defendant's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that unless an answer was sent by return of post he should prosecute Mr. Paddison for</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">damages on account of his false and fraudulent scheme in connection with the Murtldey case</hi>). Until that action was brought no claim whatever was made by him against Mr. Paddi<lb/>son for money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> In the first action there was unquestionably a claim of the child's right to the Murthley estates, claiming that he was the son of the late Major Stewart, of Murthley, and grandson of Sir William Stewart—of course the legitimacy of the boy could not be declared unless the mar<lb/>riage of the father and mother was proved—that action had to be aban<lb/>doned on account of the death of the child on 14th March, 1872—the change that took place in the litigation was entirely in consequence of the child's death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 57, Lincoln's Inn Fields—I have been in the profession since 1859; until recently I was practising with my father—Mr. Macrae Moir is a personal friend, of mine—on 7th December, 1871, he came to see me with reference to the defendant and introduced him to me on the evening of the same day—there was ultimately a conversation between myself and the defendant in reference to the claim of the wife of the deceased Major Stewart and her child to the Murthley estates; there were various negotiations between us after that with a view of prosecuting that suit—I never undertook any personal responsibility to the defendant for expenses that he had incurred or was incurring in that matter—the parties themselves were without funds, and I was to undertake to see that a certain amount should be found—I was informed that proceedings were then pending, and when the child died all proceedings were abated—prior to any proceedings my clerk, Mr. Macdonald, was instructed to proceed to Scotland and make inquiries; one of the conditions was that I should make inquiries and satisfy myself—after that the matter was proceeded with, after the death of the child—it is not true that I have left no stone unturned to accomplish the entire ruin of the defendant—I have not in order to reach that object resorted to felonious expedients; I nave not committed perjury—I do not consider myself a Willian of a considerably darker hue than Jean Luie—there is no pretence whatever for using those epithets towards me—in the event of the ultimate success of the suit the defendant will be entitled to remuneration from the Robertsons, not from me—he brought an action against Henry Robertson in respect of services rendered and was non<lb/>suited—he then brought an action against me for the same thing and with<lb/>drew the action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first heard about the Murthley estates on 7th De<lb/>cember, 1871, when Mr. Macrae Moir gave me a letter that you had addressed to him. This is the letter dated 4th December, 1871. (<hi rend="italic">This contained a statement of the case, and of the writer's desire to raise a sum to prosecute the suit through some solicitor who might be recommended</hi>). I have not got the papers that were enclosed in that letter—I have not been served with a subpoena to produce them—it was through Mr. Macrae Moir, and of course through you that I became acquainted with the Murthley case—Mr. Macrae Moir gave me no information about it—I read some extracts from the papers with him, and asked him a few questions as to the position of the Counsel in Scotland who had expressed an opinion favourable to the case; but of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110016"/>
               <p>course with reference to the details of the case, he gave me no information—I do not recollect that the first question I asked you was "I decline to have anything to do with this case until I first know the terms upon which I undertake it"—I think it exceedingly probable that in the course of the interview I may have asked such a question—I do not recollect your telling me that the sum you required for expenses incurred before I took possession of the papers, and got an introduction to the claimants, was 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't recollect your mentioning any sum that I should have to pay for expenses; the only sum mentioned was fees to McCaul and Armstrong, the agents in Scotland—I can't tell the exact amount, but it was considered that it would be between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you told me that you had incurred expenses in connection with the case—I absolutely declined to have anything to do with the case if it was to be saddled with the expenses previously incurred—I would only take up the case on condition of its coming to me unincumbered, with the exception of some fees that had to be paid in Scotland, and some other small amount—you told me that you were to be very heavily remu<lb/>nerated by the claimants in the event of success, that you were to obtain from them a bond for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I considered that would be remuneration sufficient—you told me that according to your agreement with Henry Robertson, you were entitled to current expenses from a date which I believe was June or July, 1871—you, no doubt, explained to me that the claimants were not in a position to pay your expenses—you did not explain that the loan was intended to cover your expenses as well as other expenses in the case—there was no reference whatever to your expenses in the loan—I would not consent to your previous expenses being paid out of the loan—I con<lb/>sidered that you had rendered such material service in the matter, and also were capable of rendering such material service, from your knowledge of the witnesses in the case, that I absolutely declined to take up the case unless it were to be with your assistance, and for your subsequent expenses you were to be paid out of the money that was to be raised—I was informed by you that there was a case then pending in Scotland about the Murthley succession, but I never took part in that case; the nature of that case was to prove the marriage in order to obtain the widow's dower, to obtain for the child the baronetcy and estates, which you told me were worth between 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—no doubt explanations were given to me as to the time when that suit began and ended, but I have no distinct recol<lb/>lection upon the subject—my impression is that it was actually going on at the time the child died; but I also recollect that you told me there had been some error in the summons, and that other proceedings would be advisable in consequence—it was. very likely in the beginning of February that I came in connexion with Henry Robertson and his wife—the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to McCaul &amp; Armstrong some considerable time after the death of the child—I can't give you the exact date it was when it was re<lb/>solved that litigation should be commenced upon an entirely new basis, rendered necessary by the fact that the succession to the estate had lapsed or abated by the child's death, and the widow only being entitled to some small portion, 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote to Messrs. Bellamy &amp; Strong on 16th February, stating that the original suit had to be abandoned on account of an error in the date of the marriage—besides the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to McCaul &amp; Armstrong, I think 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to a Mr. McQueen for something in connexion with the proceedings in 1871, through McCaul; I think about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid altogether—I distinctly stated that I would not pay you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110017"/>
               <p>any amount on account of previous expenses; you came in for a very heavy claim of an uncertain amount, but told me that about 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be all that was necessary to be raised for the conduct of the suit, but it might be well to provide 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—your claim was a fluctuating one; one day it seemed to be 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., another day 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., then it sprang up to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you never were able to name any definite sum, or give details of your outlay—I did not know of McQueen's claim until quite recently, within the last two, three, or four months—you must no doubt have incurred ex<lb/>penses, because you were exceedingly active and useful in the case at that time—I have the papers in the second suit—the nature of it was briefly this: to establish the validity of the marriage between Major Stewart and Margaret Wilson, now Mrs. Robertson, the wife of Lieutenant Robertson—I have my diary of 7th February—I have an entry that it was determined in Scotland to proceed with the case of the child first—of course the mar<lb/>riage must have been established; if there were no marriage there would have been no succession—I knew the child so far as having seen him in February, 1872—I believe Mr. Scott and Mr. Young were the Counsel who gave opinions in the case—I believe McCaul &amp; Armstrong were the solicitors in the first suit, but I am not certain whether they were the first" to insti<lb/>tute proceedings; they were in the second—I believe the first time I saw Henry Robertson was on the 3rd February, 1872; that was through you—in all probability he came to see me at your request—I recollect sending Mr. Macdonald to Aldershot to serve a writ on Henry Robertson; that was arranged between you and me on 22nd January—he did not serve it—this is the writ; it was issued by our firm—it was not done on purpose to scrape acquaintance with Henry Robertson; it was in consequence of your dis<lb/>agreement with Henry Robertson, and it was believed if he was served with a writ there would be an end of the disagreement—as to acting as your solicitor, you were introduced to me in order that I might act for the Murthley case, not for you, distinctly; afterwards, when it became a ques<lb/>tion of acting for Henry Robertson or you, I said you had better go to another solicitor—when I took out this writ I was acting for you simply as I have stated; it would have the appearance of acting for you, but it was simply in accordance with the arrangement I have already stated—about the 22nd December I wrote a letter to Henry Robertson, complaining that he had not paid—this is a letter in your handwriting, containing in the first few lines some pencil interlineations made by myself; this letter was never sent by me, I declined to send it—this is the letter I did send. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st December</hi>, 1871, <hi rend="italic">requesting payment of</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for expenses in<lb/>curred by the defendant, together with a bond for</hi> 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">as agreed, for his services</hi>). I was acting as your solicitor in writing that letter, but I must explain, you told me on the 7th or 8th December that you could bring the Murthley case to me; subsequently you found that you could not, because Henry Robertson, through a Mr. Crawford, was negotiating and raising funds elsewhere, and you had a disagreement with Henry. Robertson and then did not see your way to getting your expenses paid, and you thought that if I wrote that letter to him it would be the means of settling the matters in difference between you and placing affairs in such, a way that there would be a settlement, and in point of fact the case would be placed in my hands—I am not act<lb/>ing for Henry Robertson—I believe there was a reply to that letter, but I handed over to your solicitors, Bellamy &amp; Strong, all the letters I received</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110018"/>
               <p>from Henry Robertson—this is a copy of a letter written by my authority to Henry Robertson. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 30th December, 1871, acknowledging the receipt of letters, and concluding from them that both Henry Robertson and Mr. Crawford were desirous that the defendant should continue to act for him.</hi>) I recollect on one occasion it was arranged that you should go down to Aldershot to see Henry Robertson, and I gave you two guineas to go—you afterwards told me that you had been, and on your return negotiations for the loan of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were renewed—this is the letter stating the terms. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th January</hi>, 1872, <hi rend="italic">from the defendant to Henry Robertson, setting out in detail the terms upon which the suit was to be proceeded with</hi>) That was the basis upon which I subsequently conducted all the Murthley proceedings—there was some alteration in the terms, but substantially, no doubt, that was the basis—sums were from time to time advanced on the footing that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be charged at the rate of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is to say, after expenses were incurred bonds were given for four times the amount ad<lb/>vanced—all this was simply negotiation, but after the death of the child matters was talked over again; those were the terms substantially, but there were certain alterations verbally agreed upon—the fourth clause states "The claimants to be assisted in paying any previous claims apart from the law expenses to be afterwards incurred"—the interpretation put upon that clause was, the expenses incurred in Scotland through McCaul &amp; Armstrong, and some few incidental expense; it was not to include your expenses, distinctly not—I did not arrange on behalf of Henry Robert<lb/>son to pay you 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., nor any sum whatever—there had been an immense deal of discussion about your expenses, and at an interview between Henry Robertson and myself, he stated that he would give you for your services a bond for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said he had never agreed to give you; he also stated that he would give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a bond for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the latter being for expenses—he would have to give you the money, but I should have to find the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him to give—I did not find it—when this was mentioned to you you said that you had commenced proceed<lb/>ings at once, as you had been trifled with too long, and I said, as it seemed that you and the claimant would be likely to differ so seriously, I would give up all interest in the matter, and that I could only act for one party—you declined to take the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't say that it was offered to you—you subsequently brought an action against Henry Robertson, I think, for more than 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and were non-suited—I did not defend that action, Mr. Tripp atced on that occasion for Henry Robertson—I was in Court, and was also a witness; Mr. Tripp acted as my agent in the matter—I was responsible to him, and have paid him—on 8th February, I think, you sent your solici<lb/>tors, Bellamy &amp; Strong, to me with a letter you had addressed to them asking for all correspondence and papers between yourself and Henry Robertson—I did not authorise Mr. Philbrick to state that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be paid for your expenses as soon as the suit was gained; what I did state to Mr. Justice Mellor was that no doubt you would be liberally remunerated after the successful issue of the litigation, and that I state now—the litiga<lb/>tion has not been concluded in Scotland; there is an appeal pending in the House of Lords—there were two defenders; one was the Baronet Sir Doug<lb/>las Stewart, and the other a man called Nicholls; so far as Sir Douglas Stewart is concerned, he has succumbed, and he has paid a sum of money by way of compromise—I am not quite clear as to the amount, but 5,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Nicholls has paid nothing; Oh, yes, I believe he has paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110019"/>
               <p>about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—am not clear about the amount, but that is in Court in Scotland, or in the hands of McCaul &amp; Armstrong, simply by way of guarantee, in the event of the proceedings in the House of Lords being unsuccessful—not a sixpence of that sum has been touched and cannot be touched till after the issue in the House of Lords—5,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been received—no part of that has been handed to you for your expenses—in May, 1874, you commenced an action against me for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was ordered to file certain answers to your inter<lb/>rogatories in that case and I did so—this is a copy of my affidavit. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and stated "the plaintiff told me that he had incurred expenses, but no definite amount was mentioned; it was not arranged that I should pay him</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">or any other sum for expenses on being retained in the suit</hi>") In my letters of 21st December I did not specify a certain sum as the charge for your expenses it includes liabilities as well—a sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was named for expenses, disbursements, and liabilities—your claim was 462<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for work and labour done and money lent and paid by you for the use of the plaintiff, it was not expenses—I am not aware that a certain com<lb/>mission was to be given for obtaining the money in London; that was dis<lb/>puted by Henry Robertson, but you did state that a distinct sum 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be given to you for raising the money necessary to prosecute the litigation—I don't know whether that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to cover all—I did not obtain your authority to compromise the whole matter for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I can't say how the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was fixed upon, it was simply a round sum for a claim as to which you were not in a position to give any details or particulars—I was not quite agreed that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would be a proper sum, it was simply a round sum named in the first instance by Henry Robertson or myself, as a sum which might be offered for settling the whole of your expenses—I don't know what sum Mr. Philbrick mentioned—I say that you never mentioned a definite sum to me and you never were in a position to do so, you did not know yourself what outlays you had incurred—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not the definite amount of your expenses, it was the sum you might accept—300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not the exact sum stated in my diary of 3rd February, it is a sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bonds and those bonds were not equivalent to cash—on behalf of Henry Robertson I offered those bonds to you on 3rd February and" you would not take them—on 7th February I have an entry that I was to go to Scotland and see Mr. McCaul and ascertain what would be a reasonable sum to offer you as an ultimatum; it was desired to take their opinion about it; I had never seen the correspondence and had no means of judging what the agreement between you and Henry Robertson was—it did not depend upon the. decision of Mr. McCaul whether you were to get any money at all, it was to depend upon the correspondence which was in their possession—the difference between Henry Robertson and you was this, he said that you had sent him a draft bond for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he would not sign it, you on the other hand acknowledged that there was a distinct agreement on his part to give you that bond for 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no doubt there was reference to your expenses in getting up the case in my communication to Mr. McCaul, but it was considered that about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or something like that at the very outside was all that you could have incurred—I did not offer you the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not inform your agents, Messrs.

               <p>—there were also in the kitchen an English young lady Marie Massarelli and Joseph Massarelli, my husband and an English boy who they call Stephen, but I don't know his surname—Mariana's servant Paolo Ferri came down to the kitchen about ten minutes after we went down—he asked for a saucepan—he did not then go away—he did not get one—about five minutes after he had come down Mariana's husband and Philomena came down into the kitchen together, and while they were in the kitchen I saw Mariana standing at the door with her hands under her apron—her husband aid "What do you want from me?"—my mother said "I want the money as you owe me"—he then began to use foul fanguage and my mother re<lb/>sponded the same—they were angry with one another—the words went on for about a minute and Mariana's husband and Philomena made use of words but not Mariana—she was standing at the door about a yard, and a half from them—I saw Mariana's husband push my mother who stood facing him, with both hands—they were close together—he had not told her to go out—my mother then got hold of his whiskers and Philomena got hold of my mother's hair and dragged her towards the door—Mariana then went near to my mother and gave her three blows with her right hand in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>) close upon one another—Domenica leaning down at this time, because Philomena was pulling her hair—Mariana's husband. was behind his wife at the time—she was leaning against the wall—they were pretty close together—he was not doing anything—my husband was on the stairs out of the room—Stephen and Ferri were in the kitchen, and Joseph' Massarelli and his wife and Cortzi—Lutezzi came afterwards—those were all the persons that were in the kitchen—the foot of the stairs faces the kitchen door and between them is a very small passage where Mariana stood—the door towards which Philomena dragged my mother was another door where there is a small room—she was dragging her towards the door that leads from the kitchen to the foot of the stairs—my mother was leaning against the door at the time she received the blows and Philomena had her by the hair—when my mother received the blows she said "Fetch the police"—Joseph Massarelli was the first that went up to her, and he and Cortzi put her on the bed in the little room outside the kitchen—I then saw that she was bleeding—she lived about three-quarters of an hour.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Massarelli—I was in the kitchen on the 29th December when Philomena, Mariana, and her husband came down—a quarrel took place with Domenica and a struggle—I could not see what Philomena did to Domenica, there were too many together—I can't say how many—I should think there must have been about a dozen of them together—I don't know all their names—they were at the bottom of the stairs by the kitchen door in the little passage—my husband rushed to separate them and I rushed after him to pull him back—he got away from me and went in the midst I believe—I did not see any more until the deceased was put on the bed—I then saw the blood—I saw Cortzi go to separate them—he came from the table in the kitchen—I believe he got up before my husband—they were talking very loud and there was a little Screaming between them—it was very angry loud talking—I did not take much notice because I was sewing—all the people have their food in the kitchen and do their work there most of them—I can't say how many there were in the kitchen when they began—Cortzi was at work, the deceased was washing and I was sewing, and I think some of the others were talking to each other.</p>

I live at 44, Hatton Garden—on Tuesday, 29th December, about 3.45, I was called to 17, Eyre Street Hill—I found a woman sitting on a sofa in the front kitchen, supported by an Italian roan and woman—I removed her clothes and found a spot of blood about 1 1/2 or 2 inches in diameter—there was no wound apparent at first—the left breast was hanging over the wound, but upon lifting it I found a wound about five-twelfths of an inch in its long diameter—I did not probe it—I advised her removal to the hospital—the room was full of people—it was a wound that might have been caused by a sharp pointed instalment, and I believe a metallic one—I don't think such a knife as this (<hi rend="italic">produced by Cortzi</hi>) would have caused it.</p>

I am a lighterman living at Stratford Place—on the evening of Boxing night, the 26th December, I was going to the Standard Theatre with my wife, my brother and his wife, and two friends—they left me to go to the Norfolk Hotel, and I was about to go to one of the stalls in the main road—my attention was called to several young chaps behind me, one said "George this hat does not seem to suit me to-night," and another one said "No"—I turned round to see if my hat was going to be taken from me, and as I did so I felt Lloyd's hand touch me, and then he laid hold of my chain—he was in front of me then—I put my hand up to my pocket to stop my watch from going, but he had got it out—I took hold of his collar and he threw me to the ground—while on the ground I was kicked by Lloyd under the right eye, and I received several kicks in the left shoulder and arm, and I can't do any work with it now—my coat was cut where I received the kick in the elbow—there was another one kicked me, and I believe that Sizeland kicked me—he tried to rescue Lloyd—I am not quite certain that he kicked me, my face was towards the ground—I held Lloyd and called out for my brother who was in the house—I held him till the constable came up and I gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Abraham Rowe of 128, Pimlico Road—we keep a lodging house there—I have a son named Joseph nine-teen years of age and another named John who is seventeen—Joseph lodged with us—the prisoner William Bagley lodged with us—I do not know how many lodgers we had in the house on 26th December—there might be twenty, thirty or forty—we have a room downstairs for ourselves and there is a kitchen upstairs, a very large room, for the lodgers—on the evening of 26th December about 6.30 my husband, my son Joseph and I were having supper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110042"/>
               <p>in our apartment downstairs—I heard the footsteps of five or six persons go up into the kitchen—my husband and Joseph went up to see what was the matter and I followed in about two minutes—there were about five strangers in the kitchen and William Bagley—my husband said to the strangers "Young men go out, you don't lodge here"—Patrick Bagley who was one of then said "We wants John Rowe we will murder him"—my husband said "Go out young man, you don't lodge here"—Patrick then took up a shovel from inside the fender, which was formerly used for digging, a kind of spade that we used to put coke on the fire—it had a short handle, about 10 or 12 inches of wood and the rest was iron—he felled my husband to the ground with it—Joseph said "Do not kill my poor father for he is an old man;" he is 65—with that Patrick knocked my son down with his fist—I did not see the shovel after that—then three or four of them started kicking him when they had got him down—both the prisoners took part in that—I said "Do not hit my poor son, you are killing him"—William Bagley then fetched me a severe blow in the face and knocked me down and kicked me in the back severely—I got up again and they were pushing and dragging my son towards the window—both the prisoners had hold of him—they kicked him severely and another man not in custody as well—they took him to the window and William Bagley said "Up with the window and throw him out, that will be the last of the b----"—I came out as well as I could into the passage and Patrick Bagley met me and said "If you take up a weapon I will do for you you b----"—that was. after they had thrown my son but—I escaped into a private room for about two minutes and when I found the way was clear I came down and found my son insen<lb/>sible on the ground—he was thrown out at the window before I came out—they threw him out; when William Bagley said "Up with the window" he was thrown out by the two prisoners and the man not in custody and another young man whom I do not know—there were five altogether but four helped to do it—I cannot say who opened the window, but I saw it opened and saw my son thrown out—there had not been any quarrel or dispute between my son John and the others to my knowledge—he was not at home at this time—three weeks before this there was something about a shirt—my son had let William Bagley have it and he did not pay for it and when he was asked for it he took it off and gave it to my son Joseph—but there were no words nor yet blows then—my son was attended by two doctors—he was insensible and bleeding from the mouth.</p>

               <p>into the kitchen—I went up immediately afterwards, hearing rather a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> over head; my wife and son followed—I saw the prisoners there, and four or five young men with them, who did not lodge there—I begged of them to leave the house quietly—I asked them to be so kind as to leave and not kick up any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at all—the prisoners called out "We wants John Rowe, we will murder him"—my son Joseph went and shook hands with Patrick and asked him to be quiet, and to be so kind as to leave the room—Patrick went to the fire-place, took up a shovel, brought it across the room, and struck me on the head, and cut my head open—it knocked me down—Joseph said "Don't kill my father," and he was immediately knocked down by William Bagley, and when he was down they kept kicking him over the room, they kicked him to the fire-place—both the prisoners did so, and three or four more besides—after that I left the room to see if I could get a constable, and when I came back my son was lying on my bed bleeding very much from the mouth and nose—we had not done anything to excite the prisoners or had a word with one of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not strike either of the prisoners—this was on Boxing Day—I did not say a word to any of them, I had not time to open my lips—no violence was used by our party—I do not know Browning, I know Aldis; I believe he was there—he stood against the table as I went up—I did not try to get out of the window myself—I am quite sure I did not fall in trying to get out—it was the prisoners who caught hold of me I was then against the window—they kicked me all the way round from the door to the window, right round the room—I did not go to the hospital at all—they kicked me in the mouth and the head—they did not hurt my head much, but I was black and blue all down my hip—I did shake hands with Patrick Bagley for. friendship's sake, I thought if I seemed friendly it might make them quiet—I did not say anything, I only asked how he was, I did it to try and keep him quiet—on Christmas Eve, between 12 and 1 o'clock, as I went upstairs to bed I saw William Bagley on the landing beating a boy named William Palmer and kicking him in the eye, and I picked Palmer up from under him—he did not seem angry with me for that—the boy and he had had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I had had no quarrel with either of the prisoners; I do not know whether my brother John had—about a month or a fortnight before this he had lent William Bagley a flannel shirt, I asked him for it and he pulled it off and threw it on the floor—he seemed angry at being asked for it—I had no quarrel with him on Christmas Day, I don't remem<lb/>ber seeing him on that day—my father had his hat on at the time he received the blow with the shovel and the hat was cut through; I saw it afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at 128, Pimlico Road,. Chelsea—on boxing night I was in the kitchen—I saw William Bagley there—I can't speak to Patrick—I saw several persons come in, and there was a regular public-house or lodging house brawl—I don't know how it com<lb/>menced—Joseph Rowe said to me "For God Almighty's sake protect me"—no one was hurting him that I could see—he said "They intend murdering me, and I intend jumping out of the window"—I said "For God Almighty's sake don't do that"—and he went and got out of the window himself—I was close to him—he put one leg over first, and then the other, and got out—he opened the window himself, and I supposed he was trying to get on to the wall that is close underneath, whether he got a slip or no I can't say, he let himself down somehow or other—the Bagley's were nowhere anigh him at the time—there was no one near him but me, and I am an old man and meant to get out of it as quickly as I could—he was trying to escape from the row, to escape from these people—I believe he was excited and did not know what he was doing, but he certainly got out of the window of his own accord—he went out altogether.</p>

Bagley gave Mrs. Grant the present landlady, some money to go and fetch some beer for his brother and friends—soon after Joseph Rowe and his father came up, and the father pulled his jacket off and said he would fight the best man in the room, that was without any provocation of any sort—there was not a word said before—I don't know what he was going to fight them for—soon after a row occurred in the kitchen among them, and when they were fighting some of them were on the floor and some of them were standing up—I can't say who were on</p>

               <p>minutes opposite St. Mary's Church and then the female prisoner went into Mr. Baldwin's ahop—the two men walked some yards down Draper Street—I waited outside Mr. Baldwin's till the woman came out and then I went in and from what I was told I took her into custody and charged her with uttering a counterfeit florin—she said "It was given to me last night by a gentleman"—I took her to the station—I afterwards saw the two boys by the station and took them into custody for being concerned with the woman—they said they knew nothing about it—Tippett showed me a gateway in Parsonage walk; I looked about there and noticed the earth had been freshly turned up, and about an inch and a half underground I found a packet containing four counterfeit florins—I produce them and also the broken florin which I received from Mr. Baldwin.</p>

I am an auctioneer at 10, Trinity Street, Borough—in October last I was acquainted with a personamed Cogswell, and he introduced the prisoner to me about the 1st or 2nd of that month—at first Cogswell came and arranged for me to advance the prisoner some money, and I afterwards saw the prisoner—he represented to me that Captain Bayard was about to foreclose on His goods, and that there was a balance of 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing to Captain Bayard—he said he was behind and Captain Bayard had threatened to send a man in possession, and that Captain Bayard held a bill of sale as security—I said I would agree to lend him the money if Captain Bayard was going to sell; I would lend him the money if I had a proper security—he said he would agree to any security in reason—I said "You are a stranger to me, Mr. O'Neill; I don't know what your position is, but I will advance the money, but I must have your authority to sell by auction as an auctioneer"—he agreed to do it and signed this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is the authority to sell, and under that authority I put a person into possession of the premises in Tooley-Street—I asked him at the time he signed that if the goods were encumbered, and he said "Certainly not, not a shilling, barring Captain Bayard's claim"—I went to Captain Bayard and paid him out—that was on the 6th October, the same day the authority was signed—I paid him 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took a receipt but I have mislaid it—I got the bill of sale from Captain Bayard, but the satisfaction was registered on it, and I had to give it up to the solicitor—on the 7th or 8th October I advanced a further sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. O'Neill—he came with Mr. Cogswell to my office, and I gave the money to O'Neill in his presence—on the 9th October I received a bill of sale in the place of</p>

               <p>the authority to sell—the defendant came to me with reference to it, and he said that a Dutchman was about taking him in partnership, and he would be able to pay the money in about fourteen days, but the Dutchman had a great objection to a registered bill of sale, and if I would allow him to enter satisfaction that he could get the money and pay me, and I agreed to do so—the bill of sale was given after that—this is it.

                  </hi>. I live at Vernon House, Amherst Road, Hackney, and have an office in Railway Place, London Bridge—I introduced the defendant to Mr. Holloway—I don't remember the conversation I had with him prior to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my circular—I believe I sent Mr. O'Neill one—I had had four or five transactions with Mr. Holloway before—he has discounted bills for me—I asked him to introduce persons to me who would lend money—when I first saw O'Neill some mention was made about his property at Teddington—he represented that he had some beneficial interest; I don't think he mentioned any sum—he said he wanted a loan of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for twelve months—he might have said he had been carrying on business for three or four years, and he believed it was a business that would answer—he gave me the address in Tooley Street—I believe he said he would be able to get rid of all his liabilities if he had 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for twelve months—I asked which was the most pressing of them, and he told me that Captain Bayard had lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he had paid it off except 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he showed me a memorandum from Captain Bayard to that effect—I think the original loan from Captain Bayard was 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., leaving a balance of 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he told me that was the most pressing claim upon him—I went down to his place with Holloway—I think he brought some books out relative to a Building Society in connexion with the Teddington houses—it was suggested that Holloway should take a second charge of those houses, but at that time Mr. Followay was not introduced as a party to advance—O'Neill told me in my office that he would give a second charge on the Teddington houses—I may have told Mr. Holloway that—I told O'Neill that I would go and see the houses—I did not go—I have no recollection that Holloway agreed to go with me—there was some conversation about fourteen or twenty-one days, but nothing about a renewal of the loan—this receipt is for my fee for taking the inventory at Tooley Street—I think it was 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was paid to Captain Bayard—I might have been present when the bill of sale to Holloway for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was signed, but I don't think I was when the order was signed for going into possession—I know the prisoner has stated on one or two occasions that he did not owe a shilling—I don't remember any discussion when I have been present except with reference to Captain Bayard's bill of sale—my receipt is "Commission on loan and cash to satisfy bill of sale of Captain Bayard's," and from first to last that was the subject of my business relation with O. Neill—I have seen; thousands of bills of sale executed, and I am obliged to take people to money-lenders—it is the general custom for money lenders to require a statutory declaration when taking bills of sale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have had four or five transactions with Mr. Holloway in which he has found money for persons I have taken to him—the loan of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was talked about seven or eight days before the 6th October, and as far as Mr. Holloway was concerned he had given up any thought of advancing that amount for that length of time.</p>
