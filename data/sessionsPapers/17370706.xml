I sought about for her, and was informed that she was gone up the Road, so I pursu'd, and enquired at the Turnpikes, and of the People I met in the Road, if they had seen such a Mare, and I heard of her all the Way I went. At Highgate I overtook the Prisoner, and he had the Mare with him; the People inform'd me that he was on Horseback, and that my Mare was ty'd to his Horse; but when I took him he was on Foot, and was leading them both along the Road. I knew my Mare, - she was a young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173707060003"/> black Mare, with a long Tail, and a Star in her Forehead, - so I stopp'd the Prisoner, and examin'd him how he came by her, and I told him she was my Property; he told me I must prove that; but Company coming about us, I sent for a Constable, and took him before a Justice, there he said he had bought the Mare, and that she cost him 4l. The Justice advised him to send for the Man he bought it off, but he said he did not know his Name, nor any Thing about him. He was asked where he parted with this Man, and he said he left him at the Bell on Finchley-Common, but he would not let any one go there to enquire for him.</p>
               <p>Councel. Pris. Did not the Prisoner tell you that he bought this Mare upon the Road, of a Man that rode on a Bay Horse with a Star in his Forehead?</p>
               <p>Shortland. He said the Man rode a brown Horse with a Blaze on his Forehead.</p>
               <p>Counc. Pris. Did any Body go to Finchley to enquire for this Man?</p>
               <p>Shortland. No: No Body went as I know of. The Justice would have had him to have sent there, but he refused to send.</p>
               <p>Counc Pris. On enquiring after your Mare upon the Road, did any one tell you they saw a Man with a brown Horse, and a Blaze in his Forehead, leading such a Mare?</p>
               <p>Shortland. No, they described this Man all the Way upon the Road; I took my Mare from him, and 'tis now in the Constable's Hands at Highgate.</p>

            . I know the Mare is my Neighbour Shortland's.</p>
               <p>A Witness. The Prisoner came to my House, which is in the Road, and is call'd the Dirt-House, about a Mile and a half from Flower-Field, (from whence the Mare was stolen) and he told me, he was going to Litchfield. My House is in the main Road from Chester to London.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this? When was the Prisoner at your House?</p>
               <p>Witness. 'Twas the 9th of June in the Evening, the same Night that the Mare was taken away.</p>
               <p>Shortland. And I missed her the next Morning, and I took the Prisoner the same Day. I hir'd fresh Horses upon the Road and pursu'd him, and took him that same Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Highgate from your House, - in the Way to Litchfield? Is Highgate in the Way to Litchfield from your House?</p>

               <p>Witness. He was at my House the 9th of June. He came in about 6 o'Clock in the Evening, he baited, and staid 2 Hours; he told me he was going to Litchfield, and he went beyond my House into a Field, where (I believe) there was 60 Horses, and from whence (I suppose) he took this Mare, and he came back - he went past my House again. He went about 2 Mile beyond my House, as if he was going to Litchfield, but he came back again, and went past my House, the Way to Highgate.</p>
               <p>Defence. I bought this Mare coming along the Road, of a Man on a brown Horse with a bald Face. I desired them to go and find this Man at the Bell at Finchley.</p>
               <p>Shortland. I would have had the Prisoner to have sent to Finchley, but he would not, he never desired me to go there at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told them I bought the Mare upon the Road, of a middle aged Man, who rode on 2 brown Horse with a bald Face, and I told them I left him at the Bell at Finchley-Common. I desired them to go there and see if the Man was there or not.</p>
               <p>Shortland. He never desired me to send or go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. While I was bargaining for the Mare there were 5 Men riding by, I knew them, and here are their Names.</p>
               <p>Shortland. He said before the Justice that no Body was by when the Bargain was made, - nor was any Person present when the Money was paid, and he never saw the Man he bought her off before that Time, nor did he know any Thing at all of him.</p>

I was surprized, and said, - Gentlemen, don't use me ill, - you shall have my Money, - don't use me ill. One of them said, - No, - God forbid we should use you ill, - 'tis Necessity makes us do this, and he immediately put his Hand into my Pocket, and took out a Guinea, some brass Medals, and about six or seven Shillings in Silver. I don't know any of the Prisoners; but I believe the Man that took the Money out of my Pocket, is this Man here, who has made himself an Evidence. He look'd in my Face after he had done, - but I can't swear to him.</p>
               <p>One of the Prisoners. The Evidence, in his Information, said, there were three Queen Carolina's, and three King George's Medals; ask the Prosecutor what Sort of Medals he lost.</p>

            . 'Twas Easter-Eve, or rather Easter-Sunday Morning, between 12 and 1 o'Clock, when we committed this Fact. The Prisoner Runwell held the Pistol to the Gentleman, and Goswell came up and pull'd of his Hat to him, and told him, he must rifle him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was taken from the Prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Wilson. One Guinea, and six Shillings and Two-pence: The Two-pence we spent in Gin, and the Guinea we divided between Runwell and myself: Gosswell had only his Part of the six Shillings, and Part of the Two penn' worth of Gin, - we had a whole half Pint for the Two-pence. Runwell and I had 12 s. 6 d. a piece, that is, - two Shillings out of the six, and half a Guinea a piece out of the Guinea; for we sunk upon Gosswell, he did not know that we got the Guinea. When we took the Medals from the Gentleman, we thought they had been Guineas, and we went to an Alehouse, in Well-street, near Salt-Petre Bank, to see whether they were Guineas or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all go out on this Design together?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Runwell and I agreed to go out upon this Affair together, and as we were going along, we met Gosswell, and he agreed to go with us: So we all three went together, and meeting the Prosecutor, - There's your Mark, says I, and immediately Runwell clapp'd his Pistol to his Breast, but there was neither Powder nor Ball in it.</p>
               <p>Gosswell. This Man has been an Evidence before: he was three Days together at the Thief-taker's House. They took me several Times to an Alehouse, and would have persuaded me to have been an Evidence against Wilson, and as we had no Money, they lent me a Shilling, and Wilson a Shilling. I told them that I never saw the Evidence 'till I came from Hampstead Races, and that I knew nothing of him.

I asked him what he had done with the Money? He told me, he had laid out some of it in Cloaths; some of it he had spent, and thirty Shillings of it he had left in one Mrs. Wilkinson's Hands. I went next Morning to Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173707060005"/> Wilkinson's, and he said, he knew nothing of the Matter, but he would inquire of his Wife about it; and the next Day he brought me 22 s. 6 d. and told me, his Wife had laid out the rest of the Money for the Prisoner's Use.</p>

I asked him if there was any more there? And I think he said, there was some little Matter more there He was as fresh and sober, when he gave this Account, as he is now.</p>

               <p>Emanuel Slater. I was coming from Tottenham High-Cross, into the Town, and had bought a twelve-penny Loaf, and eight-penn'worth of Cheese. This was on Whitsunday in the Afternoon: So I sat myself down to eat some of my Bread and Cheese, and two Fellows came up to me, and asked me, where my Place of Abode was? I told them, at Tottenham Then they ask<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173707060006"/>ed me what Business I follow'd, and what I got a Day? I said, I work'd at <rs id="t17370706-7-viclabel37" type="occupation">Hay-making</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

They told me, if I would go with them, they would help me to a Master that would give me two Shillings, and they said, they were my Countrymen. Then they asked me for some of my Bread and Cheese; I gave them some, and they thank'd me. After this, they said, they would go to a Master of theirs, who ow'd them fifteen Shillings, and see if they could get any Money from him, and they pretended they would treat me. I told them I had no Money, and desired they would not make me drunk, so they had me to the Prisoner in a Cellar at the Seven-dials, and after they had spent all my Bread and Cheese, they desired me to go with them to their Abode at Marybone; it should cost me nothing, and I should go to work with them the next Morning. Upon this, I went with them into <placeName id="t17370706-7-crimeloc38">Marybone-fields</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17370706-7-crimeloc38" type="placeName" value="Marybone-fields"/>

               <p>Q. What did they take from you?</p>
               <p>Slater The Prisoner threw me down, and stripp'd (with Violence) the Coat off my Back, and they took my Buckles, and a Pair of Gloves from me. I count the Buckles were Brass, - they were wash'd over.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the Prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Slater. After they had robb'd me, I enquired my way back to the Seven Dials, and I li't of a Friend and told him my Story. He bid me be easy, and said he would direct me to them; they are villainous Fellows says he, and they live by cheating young People; so he help'd me to a Man that lives at St. Giles's Pound, who took up the Prisoner on Suspicion, and had him before Justice De Veil, and I swore to my Coat and to the Man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner say, when he was before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Slater. Why he told him that I pull'd off my Coat, my self; and that I gave it to them to pawn, and the Justice said, - how could he pull it off to pawn in Marybone Fields? there's no Pawnbroker there; - there's no Pawnbroker in Marybone Fields, - these were his very Words, so the Justice committed him to a Place of Abode 'till next Day, and then the Pawnbroker was brought in, - I don't know his Name, but he's here in Court now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never was nigh him; I was in a Gin-Cellar at the Seven Dials, and two Bricklayers who had pick'd him up brought him there to me.</p>
               <p>The Pawnbroker. The Prisoner at the Bar brought me this Coat; I ask'd him if 'twas his own? Do you question me say'd he, - 'tis not my own, - 'tis my Brother's; he is lately come from Exeter, and is in distress for a little Money; but we must have it again, (says he) in two or three Hours, therefore don't put it out of the way. I did not mistrust the Prisoner, if I had, I would have secur'd him. The Coat lay but a Day in my Hands, they came with the Prosecutor to ask for the Coat and I shew'd it them directly, and carried it to Justice De Veil's. - I never loved to detain any Thing, - that's base, - I have not liv'd fifty Years in the Parish of St. Martin's to do that. - This is the very Coat the Prisoner brought to me.</p>
               <p>Slater This is the very Coat the Prisoner took from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Two Bricklayers pick'd him up by Newington, or Shoreditch, and brought him to me; and one of them gave me his Coat to pawn. They drank thirty Quarterns of Gin, and were all drunk. The Prosecutor pawn'd his Bread and Cheese, and the Bricklayer's pawn'd their Tools. The Thief-takers at St. Giles's Pound, have had him in Hand ever since, and have tutor'd him to swear my Life away.</p>
               <p>A Keeper. Mr. Goddard and another Person has been 2 or 3 Times in the Gatehouse to see the Boy (the Prosecutor) and they had some Talk with him, but I don't know what it was about. <rs id="t17370706-7-verdict39" type="verdictDescription">

I immediately struck him a Blow under his left Jaw, which beat him from me; but I lost my Hat, and Wilson the Evidence says, that he (himself) was the Man that took it from me. I cry'd out, Fire, - Fire - Thieves - Thieves, and follow'd them down the back Street, but there was no body to stop them: so gave over the Pursuit. I know none of them: I cannot swear to the Prisoner; I only can say, I lost my Hat, and a small Stick I had in my Hand.</p>

On the 23d of April in the Morning, the Prisoner and I, and Lovell committed this Robbery: We had been walking all Night, and could meet with nothing to the Purpose, but about 3 o'Clock we stopp'd Mr. Cuttings. I clapp'd my Pistol to his Breast, gave him a Blow and collar'd him. He resisted, but I twitched his Stick out of his Hand, and said, it was very hard to stop a Man and rob him of nothing but a Stick, so I took his Hat off, and left him my own. Then he cry'd out, Fire, - Thieves, and we were all obliged to run off. The Hat is here in Court, but I can't take upon me to swear 'tis the same I took from Cuttings, because the Lining and the Loops are gone. We got a Woman to sell the Hat for us, and she happen'd into a Shop were Cuttings was telling of the Robbery; so she came back again with it, and would have nothing to do in the Affair. Then I gave it to a Woman I live with sometimes, and she sold it for us to Irish Peg; we were all equally concerned, and the Money was divided among us. They all assisted in the Robbery, and were all up with him as well as I.</p>

               <p>Cuttings. 'Tis like my Hat, but I can't swear to it now: They have taken the Lining out, and cut the Loops off.

               <p>Harris, Constable. I took the Prisoner and carried him before Justice Poulson, there he own'd he saw Lovell and Wilson stop Mr. Cuttings; he said, he went up to them, and told them, 'twas a barbarous Thing to use a Gentleman in that Manner they used him.</p>

            's Fleet, which was then going out for Lisbon: I was carried to Spithead, and there the Prisoner came to me, and asked me for a Power to receive my Wages. I denied to make her a Power, and she offered me 2 Guineas to do it; but I knew her Character, and would not consent, for she had used me ill before this, and the People assured me she was a bad Woman, and they bid me take Care of my self. I have Witness that she went angry away from me because I would not consent.</p>

            . I came to the Prisoner's House to work for her, and I saw some Papers lying there, and I asked her what they were, and she told me they were Wills; at the same Time she told me, I must not expect the Box which the young Man had promised to send me from Lisbon, for he was dead. I know nothing of this Will.</p>
               <p>Councel. To put the Matter out of all Doubt, here's a Man will prove the Body of the Will is filled up, with her own Hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lewis. I have seen a great deal of her Writing, - (looking on the Will) I verily believe the whole filling up is by her own Hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Consider my Life's at Stake. I am a Foreigner; here's 4 more Wills, could I forge all these 4 Wills too?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I believe the whole of this to be her own Writing except this Name, (Williamson).</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Look at the rest of them for Christ's Sake. Examine these Wills.</p>

               <p>Lewis. I have look'd over this Will very carefully, and I take it to be filled up by her self. The Mark of Joseph Bulleton, that too is her own Writing.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did Bulleton owe her any Money when he went to Lisbon?</p>
               <p>Bulleton. Before I went to India I owed her 3 l. 5 s. and I gave her a Note of my Hand for the Money: After that she got 4 l. 12 s. of my Wages, so when I came Home, she owed me Money. She received 4 l. 12 s. while I was in India, for the 3 l. 5 s. so I thought she was very well paid. After she had received this 3 l. 5 s. I never ow'd her a Farthing.</p>

The Night this happen'd I was in Bed in the Barracks, and after the Tattoo was gone by, the Deceased as Serjeant of the Night, came in his Office, to call over the Rolls, in order to see who was absent. When he came to one Darby's Bed, he found him missing, and said he would return him. The Prisoner told the Deceased he should not return him; the Deceased said he would: the Prisoner said he would lay him a Shilling he dar'd not return him; the Deceased replied, G - d sink me if I don't: the Prisoner repeated - that he dar'd not; the Deceased d - mned his own Blood if he did not return him just then, and he immediately laid down his Paper and began to write, in order to return Darby. When he had done it, he commanded the Prisoner to go to Bed; he told him he would not; upon this the Deceased blew the Candle out, and went into the next Barrack to call over his Roll there. Then he returned with a Candle into this Barrack again, and went to Bed, having first put out the Candle. The Prisoner lay in a little Apartment that is enclosed, and taken out of the Barracks for the Use of the Colonel, and the Deceased lay in a Bed that joined close to it. After the Deceased was in Bed, the Prisoner told him he wou'd do for him next Morning; and the Deceased said he did not value him, he could do well enough for himself. Then the Prisoner call'd him a Black-guard, scrubby Fellow, and the other told the Prisoner he was a saucy, ragged, Country Fellow, and came up to the Army without a Shirt on his Back; upon which the Prisoner called the Deceased a Blackguard scandalous Rascal; the Deceased then said, - if you call me so again I'll get up and pull down your Barrack Door and lick you. The Prisoner called him the same Names again and again directly; so the Deceased jumped out of Bed, and went into the next Barrack to fetch a Candle, and he came with it immediately to the Prisoner's Door, and taking hold on the Top he gave it a Shake. Whether he pulled it open, or whether the Prisoner open'd it himself I cannot tell, but the Prisoner had his Hand on the upper Bar of the Door; when the Door open'd, I saw both their Hands on it, and it had not open'd above 18 Inches before the Prisoner gave his Sword (which was drawn in his Hand) a Twirl round, and presented it into the other's Body, thro' the right Part of his Belly. I can say nothing farther, the other Witnesses will give a better Account of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell the Deceased that Darby had thrown up his Pay?</p>
               <p>Waterman. Yes, and you told him he had Leave to be absent.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I told the Deceased I would not go to Bed, did not he strike me over the Face, and beat the Pipe out of my Mouth?</p>
               <p>Waterman. No, the Deceased was not within 5 Yards of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I go to Bed before the Deceased, and make my Door fast?</p>
               <p>Waterman. He went into his Room, but whether he went into Bed, or fasten'd the Door, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Deceased attempt to force open the Door?</p>
               <p>Waterman. He took Hold on the Top of the Door and shook it: I think if he had pulled the Door, with half his Strength he might have broken it to Pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this Apartment separated from the rest of the Barracks.</p>
               <p>Waterman. Yes, it was divided from them by a Partition of Boards. 'Tis a little Place about 9 Feet long, - or not so much, and 7 Foot over: the Prisoner's Bed was in this Place. The Colonel puts his Goods in it, and the Prisoner has lain in it ever since I have been in the Company, and I commenced the 6th of May last. I'm but a young Soldier.</p>

               <p>Councel. Supposing the Prisoner had insulted the Deceased, or had given him provoking Language, had he Power to correct him with Blows?</p>
               <p>Sharp. He had Power to take him Prisoner, according to Military Law, and to have sent him to the main Guard.</p>
               <p>Q. If the Prisoner had had a Candle there, had the Deceased a Power to have gone there to have searched?</p>
               <p>Sharp. He is authorised and obliged to put out all the Lights, after the Tattoo has gone about.</p>

            . The Deceased and I had been out that Afternoon, drinking at a Friend's House: We came in about 10 o'Clock, and he did his Business and call'd over the Roll One Darby was absent, and the Prisoner said, he had leave to be absent. The Deceased said, he would return him, and the Quarrel began, as the first Witness has mention'd. After many Words, the Deceased put the Candle out, and went to call over the Roll in the other Barrack: When he had done, he returned to his own Barrack, and undrest himself and went to Bed. The Prisoner in his Room, still abused him, and the Deceased said, he would get up and lick him for abusing him: And accordingly, our Candle being out, he got up and fetch'd one from the next Barrack, and coming to the Prisoner's Door, he took hold of it and shook it; the Door was open'd, I know not how, nor by who; but when 'twas about a Foot and a half open, the Prisoner thrust out his Hand, with his drawn Sword, and stabb'd him immediately. As soon as he had done it, he shut the Door again, and fasten'd it in half a Minute's Time. 'Twas fasten'd on the Inside, for Corporal Thomas was forced to fix a Bayonet on a Piece and break the Door open to take the Prisoner</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not see the Deceased strike me, and break my Pipe, before I went to Bed?</p>
               <p>Toombes No; there was no Pipe broke, nor any Blow struck on either Side. The Push with the Sword was all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken, that Man went dancing and singing all the Way before me, and said, he had an Opportunity now to be revenged: And he would swear his Soul to the Devil but I should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever express'd any Ill-will to the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Toombes. I never used any such Expressions, nor have I any Ill-will to the Man. I borrow'd Money of him but two Days before, and have often drank with him; the whole Company knows it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any Words pass between the Prisoner and the Deceased at the Door, before it was open'd?</p>

            . When the Deceased was in Bed, many Words passed: The Prisoner call'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173707060012"/> the other Black-guard, Scoundrel and Rascal. The Deceased said, don't call me so, if you do, I will get up and lick you. You dare not, says the Prisoner, I have got something will keep you from it The Prisoner was then in his Apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the Prisoner said he had something would keep him from it?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; I am sure of that. Then the Deceased ran to the other Barrack, and fetch'd a Candle. He shook the Door, and it open'd; but I cannot say which of them open'd it. Then the Prisoner gave a Push with his Sword, under his own left Arm (for his left Hand was upon the Door;) no sooner was the Sword pushed out, but the Door was made fast, and the Corporal was forced to break it open to take him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not see the Deceased break my Pipe?</p>

               <p>Q. Was there Time after the Opening of the Door, for the Prisoner to draw his Sword?</p>
               <p>Smith. No: There was no Time to draw his Sword, it must have been drawn before the Door was open'd.</p>
               <p>Councel. What is the Prisoner's general Character?</p>
               <p>Smith. Since I have known the Company, he has not had an extraordinary Character. He very frequently disturbed the Barracks in the Night.</p>

            . The Quarrel began as hath been related, and after many abusive Speeches, the Prisoner and the Deceased went to their Beds. After they were both in Bed, the Prisoner aggravated the Deceased, and call'd him old rascally Scoundrel, and the Deceased said, if he abused him so, he would get up and lick him. The Prisoner continuing to abuse him, he got up, and went to the other Barrack for a Candle, and when he came back with the Candle, he pull'd once or twice at the Prisoner's Door, and it open'd; but who open'd it I cannot tell. Immediately upon the Opening the Door, I saw his Hand push the Sword into the Deceased's Body, he stagger'd and clapp'd his Hands upon his Belly. I was partly behind the Door, so I could not see whether the Prisoner had his Hand upon the Door, or not. I saw no Blows before this, nor did I see the Pipe struck out of the Prisoner's Mouth.</p>

            , Corporal. I was in the other Barrack when the Deceased came to fetch the Candle. I got up and went after him, and when I got into his Barrack, I saw him stooping as if he was wounded. I was very much flustrated (or very much surprized) so I ran to a Rack, and took down a Piece, and (I believe) I broke open the Door and took him the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the Prisoner lodged there?</p>
               <p>Thomas. We have been eight Months at the Tower, and he has lain there all the Time. I think he purchased it. 'Tis a particular Bed; enclosed with a Partition: The Bed belongs to the King, or the Barrack Master.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the Serjeant that is in Office for the Night, any Right, for the Sake of preserving Good Order, to go into that Place?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Whether he has any Right to go in there, I don't know, - any farther than to see that all the Candles are out, and every Body in Bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Could not the Deceased have seen whether my Candle was out, without coming into my Barrack?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Yes; 'tis but a poor slight Enclosure of slit Deal. If there's any Light in it, those on the Outside may see it; and if there's Light without, the Person within may see that too. There was no Candle in his Apartment, when I took him Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been a Light in this Place, had the Officer of the Night any Right to have forced the Door open?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I don't know. But if any Abuse is given, the Officer has a Power to take the Person that is Guilty of the Offence, and carry him Prisoner to the Main-guard.</p>
               <p>Q. Might he have enter'd, and have taken him from thence, in Order to have carry'd him to the Main-guard?</p>
               <p>Thomas. Yes: He was under the Command of the Serjeant for Night, in that Place, as much as if he had been in a common Barrack.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173707060013"/>Counc. Had he, as Superiour of the Night, any Power to go in and strike him?</p>
               <p>Thomas. There's no such Thing as striking, in the Military Way.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I ask if there was not a large Quantity of Powder there?</p>
               <p>Thomas. There is some Powder there to be sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the Key of this Place?</p>
               <p>Thomas. He padlocks it himself on the Outside when he goes out. The Serjeant that has the Care of the Company, keeps the Things that are for the Use of the Company; and the Prisoner kept the Company's Linnen there, and the Colonel's Things.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there's any Fastening on the Inside?</p>
               <p>Thomas. There's a Kind of a Nail and a String on the Inside.</p>
               <p>Councel. Did not the Prisoner buy this Apartment?</p>
               <p>Thomas. I don't know whether he or the Colonel paid for it.</p>

               <p>Vandervoren. No; I think not. I know, the Serjeant that commands has Power to quiet any Man; he is empower'd to take him Prisoner, and carry him to the Main-guard. Each Serjeant takes his Week, and we are to see every Man in their Barracks at such an Hour; he is to keep them in Peace and Quietness, and at such a Time, to take Care that all the Candles are out. By Virtue of this Power, if his Brother Serjeants, or Corporals disobey Orders, they are liable to be taken Prisoners, and Complaint is made to the superiour Officers, but they are not to give Correction themselves to any Serjeant.</p>

            . I was going thro' their Barrack when the Dispute began, and I saw the Deceased lift up his Hand and strike the Prisoner. He struck him with his Fist, somewhere over the Face, and I think I saw a Pipe fall, but I cannot say the Deceased struck it out of his Mouth. I have known the Deceased three Years, and never heard that he was given to Quarrelling.</p>
               <p>Councel. Did you never hear of his Quarrelling with Serjeant Vanderooren?</p>
               <p>Smith. No.</p>
               <p>Serjeant Lindsay. I can give but the same Account of the Quarrel as hath been already given; there was a great deal of ill Language given on both Sides, both before, and after the Deceased was in Bed, and the Prisoner had shut himself up in his Place. The Deceased lay with me, and I bid them both be quiet, or I would take a File of Men, and carry them both to the Guard. The Deceased said, he'd get up, and pull the Prisoner's House down, and send him to Hell. I know them both perfectly well, and have done so, 9 or 10 Years. In the Way of Strength or Handy-Cuffs, the Deceased, I believe, would have been too hard for the Prisoner, tho' he is a lusty Man. I could not prevail upon them to be quiet, but provoking Language still being given, the Deceased jumped out of Bed, and got a Candle from another Barrack, and came with it to the Prisoner's Door: He took hold with one Hand and shook it; then he sat down the Candle, and put both Hands to it, and shook it again: There was Room enough over the Door, for him to put his Hands in: As I was getting out of Bed to prevent the Dispute, the Door open'd, the Deceased fell back, and I caught him in my Arms, and laid him upon our Bed. He never quarrell'd with me, but he has quarrell'd with the Prisoner, and I have parted them several Times. The Prisoner always lay in that Apartment, and 'tis usual for him to fasten the Door on the Inside. I know he does, because I once wanted to speak with him when he was a Bed, and I shook the Door, but I could not get in, 'till he 'rose and opened it himself. The Deceased lov'd a Glass of Liquor, and in his Cups would sometimes be fractious.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any Words between the Prisoner and the Deceased before the Door opened.</p>
               <p>Lindsay. Not a Word.</p>
               <p>Vandervoren. I was the Deceased's Comrade 10 Years. In Liquor he would sometimes be good humour'd, and sometimes quarrelsome. He never quarrell'd with any Body when he was sober. I know the Prisoner too, very well: I have seldom seen him in Liquor. We have all been Friends together, the Prisoner, the Deceased and I.</p>

               <p>W - T - . I had been drinking very freely with some Friends in Thames-Street, and meeting with the Prisoner in St. Paul's Church-yard she conducted me to a House in <placeName id="t17370706-14-crimeloc77">Evangelist's Court in Black Fryars</placeName>

When I came to her House, we went up Stairs together, and a Woman brought us up some Punch; I staid some little Time, and then I lay down with her on the Bed, - and she pick'd my Pocket. My Gold was in this Pocket, and I had thrust a great Piece of whited brown Paper upon it, to secure it, but she pull'd out the Paper, and took 5 Guineas and the 36 s. Piece, the Paper I found on the Bed, but the 5 Guineas and the other Peice was gone. At the Watch-house she dropp'd one Guinea from under her Petticoats, and as she did not claim it, I took it my self, and I have indicted her for 4 Guineas and a 36 s: Peice. There was no one in the Room but our selves and the Woman that brought in the Punch, and she did not stay with us, - she went down Stairs. I was in Liquor, but I was not insensible, for I told my Money by the Candle.</p>
               <p>C. If you was sensible, you was a very wicked, impudentt Man, to pick up this Woman in order to debauch her.</p>
               <p>W - T - . I can't pretend to justify the Thing: 'Tis a wicked Thing to be sure; but 'tis what is often done when Men are in Liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say before the Justice?</p>
               <p>W - T - . I perswaded her to deliver my Money to save Trouble, and she said it was not in her Power: this seem'd to be a tacit Confession that she took it. After she had robb'd me, she ran down Stairs in a hurry; I follow'd her, and the Woman of the House let her out, and shut me in, and then she blew out the Candle. The Bell-man was providentially going by, and (he hearing the Noise; seized her</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him if he did not say when he pull'd out his Money before me, that he had been done some Injury to before; and that he was not willing to be served so again.</p>
               <p>W - T - . I told her what Money I had in my Pocket, and I bid her take Care what she did. - I had promised to make her a little Present, and that was 'all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was stripp'd quite naked in the Watch-house, and they found nothing upon me. He and my Landlady were fumbling in the Dark, - perhaps she might take his Money.</p>
               <p>W - T - . The Prisoner wou'd had me to have lain there all Night, and then I suppose I should have lost all the Cloaths upon my Back.</p>
               <p>C And you would very well have deserv'd it.</p>

            , Bell man. I was just by the Place, and I heard a Noise, - I am robb'd, I am robb'd - I will have my Money; so I came back, and got 2 Watchmen, and away we came all 3 to the Alley: we heard the Gentleman cry, - he would have his Money, and we perceiv'd they were struggling in the Entry; by and by the Door flew open, and the Prisoner tumbled down 2 or 3 Steps at the Door. Madam, says I, I believe you've hurt your self, I must take you up; so I have, says she, and shall feel it for some Time. If I had not been there to have help'd her up tho', she had gone cleverly off. The Gentleman came out presently, and charged us with her, so we took her to the Watch-house directly, and there she neither own'd it, nor deny'd it; but a Guinea dropp'd from her, and the Gentleman look'd under the Table and took it up. Upon this I bid him search her, for he would find more where that came from, and she had her Hands - ('tis a little immodest too,) - here. This is the Truth, and I'll stand by it, and die by it.</p>

She had no Petticoats on, only a loose Gown, and but one Stocking; as I was carrying her to the Counter, she desired to be search'd, where, says I; shall I get Women to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173707060015"/> search you now, except they are Whores, - like your self. She was asked for the Money, and she said 'twas out of her Power to produce it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg'd and pray'd, and crav'd, and ask'd them to search me: I had not a Farthing in the World, and my poor Cloaths, - they were not upon me. I have no Acquaintance in London, for I have been but a very little while in Town.</p>

            . On Thursday, June 16, about I at Noon, I went out to Bromley, and left my Wife well at Home; when I return'd, I found my Wife murder'd, her Throat was cut, and the Child's Neck bone was disjointed; it's Head was cut almost off, it hung only by a bit of Skin to the Body. I lost 2 Watches out of the House, and my Wife's Wedding-Ring was taken off her Finger. The Motto was, - God alone, - made us two one. I came Home about a quarter after 9, and there was a dismal Sight for me; they both lay on their Backs with their Throats cut. I heard what had happen'd before I came Home, for Mr. Shelley and Scott met me as I was returning from Bromley, and told me my Wife was murder'd. I imagine they were both knock'd down first, for on each of their Heads, there was the Appearance of a Blow, which seem'd to be given by a Hammer. When I got Home the Doors were shut, but there was Dr. Sprag, Dr. Hooker, Dr. Wilkinson, Mr. Hales, and the Father of the murder'd Child in the House. Mr. Jetsome was there likewise; but I was so 'frighted, I don't remember what any of them said to me.</p>
               <p>Councel. Look on that Ring?</p>
               <p>Long. 'Tis very much like my Wife's Ring: the Poesy is the same, and 'tis about the same Size, I believe it to be the same, but I won't swear positively that it is the same.</p>

             I remember the Prisoner; on Thursday was 3 Weeks I met him in Ropemekers Fields by Lime house, about 5 o'Clock, within half a quarter of a Mile from Mr. Long's House. He enquir'd for Mr. Long's House; I told him I did not know any such Person; then he went about 10 Doors further, and stopp'd at Mrs. Chapman's House. When he went from me he leaned upon the Posts before Mrs. Chapman's Door, but I did not hear any Thing he said there.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to swear the Prisoner is the same Person?</p>
               <p>Wentworth. Yes; he is the Man that spoke to me: I was with him before the Justice, and I am sure he's the same Person that I spoke to in Ropemaker's-Fields.</p>

            . I know the Prisoner again very well: I am positively sure he's the Person that spoke to me that Day the Murder was committed. 'Twas on a Thursday, but I don't remember the Day of the Month; he stopp'd at my Door a Moment or two before 4 o'Clock. First he survey'd the Gentlewoman's House, then he came up and lean'd upon one of the Posts, and asked which was Mr. Long's, - Mr. Staples's Brewer. Madam, says he, (for he gave me that Title) do you know where Mr. Long lives? I ask'd him, if he was sure he liv'd in that Street? He paus'd a little, and then he said he did not know, - but he was informed that he lived in one of the new Houses against the School. Presently Mr. Hester's School came into my Head, and I said, Sir you are mistaken in the Street; so I bid him go thro' that Arch (to which I pointed) and ask for the School, and 'twas likely he would hear of him there.</p>
               <p>Q. What Cloaths had the Prisoner on?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I can swear that he had the same Coat on then, that he has on now, but he had then under it, a green duffled Waistcoat. I have Reason to remember his Physiognomy, because he told me he hoped to have the Pleasure to see my Ears nail'd to the Pillory, or else he would cut his own Throat: I know him from 5000 Men.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance do you live from Mr Long's?</p>
               <p>Chapman. I live in Ropemakers-Fields, and he lives at the Limekilns, about 3 Stones throw from my House. He stood a moment or two after I directed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173707060016"/> him: I took him to be a Bailiff, and that he kept prating to me 'till he could seize his Prey.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the Justice she swore I had a Cinnamon colour'd Coat.</p>
               <p>Chapman. I have sworn to his Coat, and you'll find some body else will swear to it, by and by.</p>
               <p>- Gray I have look'd at the Prisoner, and have taken a great deal of Observation upon him: (have observed him well.) I saw him that Thursday after 3, 'twas not 4, - I won't say to a Minute or 2. I was above Stairs, putting on my Cap, and I looked out of my middle Window (for there's 3 in the Front) and saw the Prisoner standing cross the Kennel, and looking up to the Window. I thought he stood loitering there to stare at me, because I was without my Cap, so I slipp'd it on and look'd out again; still he look'd stedfastly up at me; then I imagin'd he saw something in the Beaufet that he wanted, for he did not look like another Man. After this I saw him go to Chapman's House, which is exactly over the Way: I expected News (from a Friend,) and at last I thought he might be enquiring for me; so I came down Stairs, but he was gone, - I saw no more of him. I took particular Notice of him at that Time, and I am sure he's the Man that spoke to Mrs. Chapman, but I cannot swear to his Cloaths. The Monday after, when the Prisoner was carry'd to the Justice's House, I saw him pass thro' the Room where I was, and that very Minute I knew him, and said to Mr. Betty, - that's the Man.</p>

            . I work at Mr. Birch's, at the Lime-Kilns. The Day Mrs Long was kill'd, about a Quarter before 6, I saw a full-body'd jolly fac'd Man, with a dark Wig full of Powder, come out of Long's House and he came towards me, as far as the second Post from Long's Door, - towards Lime-house Corner. He stopp'd as if he wanted to make Water, or was in a Consternation; then he turn'd round, stopp'd short again, and went away towards Limehouse Marsh Wall. I can't swear the Prisoner is the Man, but 't was one very like him.</p>

( Pointing to the Bale-Dock ) The Reason I took Notice of him, was this; the Day before, a Man well dress'd made Water before us all, and I thought this Man was going to do the same, and I resolved if he did, to affront him for his Impudence.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner some Years: I remember, the Day the Murder was committed, I met him about half an Hour after 6, and shook Hands with him, near Mr Hoar's Yard at Limehouse Marsh Wall.</p>
               <p>Q. What Cloaths had the Prisoner on?</p>
               <p>Harper: I won't swear to any Cloaths: - He had a green Jacket on. I asked him to go and drink a Mug of Beer, and he said he could not stay. I then went on to Dick's-Shore, and there I heard of the Murder.</p>
               <p>Q. You met a Man and talk'd with him, can you remember nothing concerning his Cloaths?</p>
               <p>Harper. I will not swear to any Cloaths.</p>
               <p>C. You are sworn already to speak all that you know; recollect yourself: - What colour'd Cloaths had he on? If you remember, you must tell us.</p>

               <p>Councel. I ask you upon your Oath, if you have not said already, that he had a green Jacket on?</p>
               <p>Harper. Why to the best of my Knowledge he had a green Jacket on, - and much such a Coat as he has on now.</p>
               <p>C. You are not to conceal any Thing, but to speak the Truth to the best of your Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Harper. To the best of my Knowledge he had the same Coat on then, that he has on now, and a green Jacket.</p>

A Man knocked at the Door, and asked if Mr. Long was at Home; I told him he did not live here, and while I was directing him, I let my Stitches fall, which prevented me from taking Notice of his Face: I look'd after him, and saw him lift up the Latch of Long's Door, but I can't say I saw him go in.

            . On Saturday Night after the Murder between 11 and 12 o'Clock, I went to the Prisoner's House in Ratcliff-highway; I saw him, and he every Way answer'd the Description given of the Murderer. This is the Ring that his Wife sold the Day after the Murder, to Mr. Bond. That which was taken from Mrs. Long, being in the Advertisements that were publish'd, Mr. Bond sent to let us know he had bought such a one. The Prisoner said he would carry us to the Pawnbroker he bought it of, and he told us, he gave 19 s. for it. We went there at this Time, only to ask them about the Ring, but the Man answering the Description given of the Person that was seen in Long's House, we went again on Monday to take him up; when the Constable took him, he said he had 2 Witnesses to prove where he was when the Murder was done; and I said, - what need you talk of that, before you are charged with it. Mrs. Long was at my House on the Sunday and Monday before she was murder'd, with the Ring on her Finger, and we talked about the Poesie: I believe the Ring that has been produced is the same, but there are no particular Marks on it</p>

The Ring having the Poesie mentioned in the Advertisement, I sent Notice I had bought such a thing; upon this, Mr. Rhodes came to see it: He seem'd positive 'twas Mrs. Long's Ring; therefore I told him what Discourse had pass'd between the Prisoner's Wife and me, when she was at my Shop, and by recollecting that, we found where the Prisoner lived.

             I live at Silsoe in Bedfordshire. On the 13th of June I pack'd up 40 l under a Lump of Butter, - in the middle of a Flat (of Butter) that was to come to London I saw it loaded in the Waggon, that it could not be come at, unless the Waggon was unloaded. I usually sent up Money to London in that manner, under a Flat of Butter. I put up 38 Guineas and 2 s. and the Basket in which the Flat was put, I ty'd fast with 2 Strings. The Direction was in the Inside of the Lid, that no one should see it, unless the Flat was unty'd. This Butter was directed to my Sister White, and William had the Delivery of it.</p>

             I loaded the Waggon, and drove it on the 13th of June to South Mimms, but I knew nothing in particular of this Flat of Butter, or of the Money, - I had 40 Flats (I believe) in the Waggon at the same Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this Flat remov'd before you came to London?</p>
               <p>Lee. I drove the Waggon to South Mimms, and it was not mov'd while it was carrying to that Place.</p>

             is Brother to the Carrier, and marry'd my Sister. I gave him Liberty to open my Letters, and take Care of my Money. On the 14th of June, I came to Market, about 4 o'Clock, and he gave me a Letter, and told me there was 40 l in this Flat, but the Prisoner had got it away: - A Villain! (says I) run after him, and see for the Money. William Best came back, and said the Butter was safe, but the Money was gone. I ran out of the Market to Mrs White's, and said to the Maid, - shew me where this Rascal lives; so the Wench and I, went to the Prisoner's House, and I look'd in an old Chest of Drawers, - if I could have found the greasy Bag, I should have been satisfy'd. But a little Trunk in the Room feeling heavy, I asked the Girl that was there to unlock it; she did so, and in this Trunk there were several Parcels of Money, - several little Parcels of Money, but not such a Parcel as I wanted. - I believe there might be about 40 l in all. What gave me Reason to suspect him, was this, - about 5 Weeks before, I saw him routing among the Goods in my other Shop (where I give a Brother of mine, Leave to pitch his Parcels;) and I said to him, - you Rascal, what Business have you there; for I had a Letter from my Sister, to inform me, she had sent me 328 l. 4 s. in the Goods. He told me at that Time, that he wanted his Mistress's (Mrs White's) Butter. I told him he had a great Assurance to rout over the Goods, when there was no body to deliver them to him; and I charged him never to touch them without Will Best was present; for he is appointed to deliver them, and take the Money, - or Book them. The Prisoner having seen Best take Money out of this Flat, occasio'd me to warn him not to meddle with any of them. He has used the Market many Years: I can't say I ever heard him charged with any such Act before.</p>
