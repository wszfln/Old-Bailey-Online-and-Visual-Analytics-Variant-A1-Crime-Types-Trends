On 28th February I was in company with Morley—I saw the prisoner outside the Marlborough Street Police-court in the afternoon after another counterfeit coin case had been heard—I followed him to Westminster, and then to the New Cut, and thence to Seven Dials—I lost sight of the gang there—I saw to prisoner again at night walking about alone outside the Burlington in Regent Street—I and Morley crossed the road—we caught hold of him, and Morley told him he should take him into custody, and he threw us both down to the ground—while struggling the prisoner put his hand into his left-hand coat pocket, drew out a packet, end threw it into the road-Morley was holding him at the time—I went into the road, picked up this packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), opened it, and found it contained five bad florins, each wrapped separately in paper; there are the marks on the paper now-after the prisoner was charged he said "I did not have them in my pocket.

I am a hosier, ox 29, Strand—on Saturday night, 24th February, Heard came into my shop—I gave her a hand<lb/>kerchief and received a bad half-crown from her—the price of the hand<lb/>kerchief was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—I remarked that the half-crown was bad, and gave her the change that I might see who her confederate was—I saw her in Savoy Street, returned to my shop, went out again from my shop, and saw her speaking to Harris—I called a constable and gave both of them into custody—I identify this bad half-crown (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) given me by Heard—I gave it to the constable—Harris threw away an old glove and a phial; I picked up the phial but not the old glove, as I did not believe it belonged to her—I saw the phial shown to the prisoner by the inspector—she said it belonged to her, and was medicine for a cold she had.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Eccleston Square—on Saturday, 17th February, about 2 in the afternoon, I received this letter, with this paper enclosed, in the same handwriting as the letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Your lordship's arrival here has been occasion of pleasure to those other than your friends. Does it need your humble servant to intimate to you that you have enemies in London who will conceal themselves under the appearance of friendship? May I say that a few years since I received a great favour from your hands, and have been ever grateful. It is now within my power to return that favour tenfold, had I a sum of money which must exceed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but need not exceed 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Believe this other than a hoax or an attempted swindle, for I assure your lordship you have determined and revengeful enemies in London, and it is within my power to thwart their movements against your lordship, but to do so will cost money, and I cannot afford to take it from my own little stock, otherwise your lordship should not have been troubled. If you will condescend so far as to incline to my appeal, you will one day know the benefit. At the end of this letter you will find a signature and mark, which if you will retrace your memory so far back as three years I have no doubt but that your lordship will recollect. Let your servant meet me with the money at the High Street Railway Station, Kensington, on Tuesday evening, the 20th instant, at 7 p.m. I will stand directly oppo<lb/>site the first-class ticket-office, and will have a piece of paper to fit to the one enclosed in this letter, which I will hold in my right hand. Rather tall, with short dusty overcoat. If this note should not be agreeable to your lordship, address 'A. E. P. Zuit, General P.O., London, E.C.' This letter is written from dictation. Beware to whom you confide the contents. I remain a well-wisher and an ever grateful friend.—J. W. Amherst. <hi rend="italic">Agnum ecce Prologue Zuit</hi>.") I know nothing of the prisoner, I never saw him to my knowledge before this—I know of nothing with reference to the name of Amherst—I do not know to</p>

I received this letter and the paper from Lord Cecil on Monday, 19th February—on Tuesday, 20th, about 10 minutes to 7, I went to the High Street Station of the Metropolitan District Railway, and there saw the prisoner waiting in front of the booking-offices—I kept him under observation for some time; he had in his right hand a piece of white paper—I went up to him and said "Is your name George Amherst?" he said "No, are you from Lord Eustace Cecil?" I said "Yes"—he said "Oh, about the letter?" I said "Yes, I have come about the letter"—he said "I wrote it and I sent it, but it is not for me, it is for some one else; that some one else I have the greatest confidence in, I believe in him, and I shall be mute"—I said "Do you know Lord Cecil?" he said "No, I do not"—I said "I must make some inquiry into this, you will have to go to the police-station with me"—I took him to the station, and he was detained there—I showed him the letter; he said "Yes, that is it, I shall be mute"—I asked him to give an account of it or of himself; he declined—I then went to Lord Cecil, and the prisoner was subsequently charged—he then gave his name as George B. Calvert; he refused his address then, but gave it to the Magistrate in the morning, and I found he had been lodging there for 10 days or more—he was searched, but nothing was found on him but the piece of paper which corresponds with the piece contained in the letter.</p>

I live at 48, Great Wild Street, and am a labourer—the prisoner and his wife lodged there—they occupied the third floor front—the youngest child lived with them, the other girl was in service—as long as I have known the prisoner he has been working at the same labouring business as myself—on 29th December, about 6 o'clock in the evening, I was down in the passage by the street door—the prisoner came down stairs and said he had cut his wife's throat—I did not believe it—I said "What do you mean?"—he said "I have done it, look at my hands"—there were stains of blood on them—he said "You go up, I will stop here till you come back"—I went up and found the woman lying with her legs in Holman's room and her head in the passage—a handkerchief was over her face; I lifted it up and found she was all over blood—she could not speak; her breath was coming through the windpipe—Dr. Mills came first, and then Dr. Griffin, and he sewed up the windpipe—I stopped till the inspector came, and then went down<lb/>stairs; the prisoner was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and live with my father, who is a builder and contractor, at 97, Mortimer Road, Kingsland—on 24th February, about half-past 6 in the evening, I was in Mortimer Road alone—I was coming from home and had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver in a bag—I was in the habit of carrying money every Saturday—on this occasion I was attacked by two men on my right side; one passed behind me to the left and held me by my collar with his right hand, and knocked me about the forehead and side of the head with has left—the one on my right struck me six or seven times, and passing to the front he put his hand on my bag and said "I know you, I want this"—I said "You won't have it," and I struck him in the face—a third party came up and struck me in the face, then passed behind me and I felt a kick behind—I was thrown down and they rolled me over and over till they took the bag from me—the prisoners are the two men that did this—Parsey came up last—Wilmot came up first with one not in custody, I did not see that man's face—it was Wilmot that I struck—I struck him in the mouth, and the blow took off the kid from the knuckles of my glove, as if it struck against his teeth—I got up and followed them as far as I could, but I became exhausted and was obliged to stop—I saw a doctor, he is attending me now—I was very much bruised about the face and head—besides the bag I lost a gold neck chain and locket—the same evening I gave a description to the police of the three men as well as I was able—on 5th March I went to the police-station, and there saw Parsey among a number of others, I think eight besides him—I looked round and said "That is the man," I picked him out—they asked me to touch him, and I touched his arm—I afterwards went to the police-station at Clerkenwell and there saw Wilmot with six or seven prisoners—they asked me if I saw any one there I knew, and I said "Yes, that one," and I pointed him out—I have not the slightest doubt that the prisoners are the two that took part in this assault—the money was my father's, the jewellery was my own.</p>

                  </hi>. I trade at 31, Milk Street, as John Terry and Co., woollen merchants—the prisoner was a clerk in my service up to 8th February—he had been with me about four years, but only a short time as clerk—I was absent from business on that day—he gave no notice of leaving—his duty was to receive cash brought by customers and enter it into his cash-book and on to the paying-in slips for the bank, and pay it into the bank—he would be checked by the pass-book, the counterfoil, and the cash-book—he left the books in a very unsettled state—the result of casting-up one with another was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—I know his handwriting very well—I caused inquiries to be made in respect of sums received by him—I produce two receipts in his hand<lb/>writing, one for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Coverdale, and one for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Le Sage, both on 26th January—these paying-in slips, from 22nd January to 9th</p>

               <p>February, are in prisoner's handwriting, except the last one, which is on the day after he went away—I have examined them; there is no record on them of those two sums, and there is no entry in the cash-book or pass-book of them—Mr. Coverdale's was brought to my knowledge on 26th February, the day before the prisoner was apprehended—information was given to the police and a warrant issued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was no regular day for the prisoner to pay money into the bank—he kept the books from July, 1882—until this I had no complaint against him—he was always very punctual in the discharge of his duties and regular in attendance—he stutters very badly—he used to balance his books monthly—he did so on 31st December; they were then quite correct—I never gave him blank cheques to fill up in case he wanted cash for the cash-box; nobody with my authority ever gave him a blank cheque—I do not know whether he used to advance money to his fellow-servants—I have never seen any memorandum book; I have had notice to produce it; I don't know whether such a book was kept, I never heard of one—I suppose they borrow from their fellow<lb/>servants—I don't know if Buswell is here—he is a salesman in my employ—my son takes charge of the business when I am away—Buswell has authority, but not to dismiss any servants—I saw him at the ware-house when I came away—I believe he was present at the Mansion House, and has been subpoenaed to attend here—I did not say the prisoner was dismissed—I Know from the letter you have there that Buswell told him to go—I did not inquire of Buswell whether it was true—I did not communicate with the prisoner the day after he left—I don't know if anybody did on my behalf on the day after 8th February, requesting him to return—I was not there the day he left or the day after—I believe a telegram was sent by some one, I don't know who sent it; it was not charged for in the petty cash—I believe it was to ask if he was ill—I returned to business on the Friday, I think; the 8th was a Monday—during that interval I don't know what took place at the office—the room where the prisoner sat was in the warehouse, enclosed by a partition—he had a desk and cash-box—no one else had a right to be there—people could get there if they wished—another clerk, Thomas, used to sit on the other side of the counting-house, no one else—the office was open to other of my servants—I accused the prisoner at one time of being 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short, because when I examined the books I saw a good deal of money short, but I had not particulars, and I wrote to his mother, whom I have known for some time, to that effect—this is the letter—I mentioned in it "Meeking and Co., 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I did not find anything about that—the prisoner never paid Buswell's wages—I have paid Buswell by cheque ever since he has been with me—I do not know that Buswell used to borrow from the prisoner—I did not know that Buswell had dismissed the prisoner; he had no authority to do such a thing—the statement by the prisoner was called to my attention; I made no inquiries in consequence of it—the prisoner said in the letter that Buswell told him he had better go home, as he was no use there—Buswell is not here—he is in my employment still—the prisoner had left a fortnight when he wrote this letter—I received it on the 20th—I thought it was an improper letter to write to me—I did not see this memorandum on the desk—Thomas is here—I looked in the prisoner's desk three or four days after he left—there were papers there—there was money in the cash-box</p>

               <p>—he left the key of it behind him—it was locked when I went to it—I have a key of it myself; I think my son had the prisoner's key; there was no other key—I said at the Mansion House he absconded—he went away without my knowledge; he left the key on the desk; my son or Thomas told me—I did not allow salaries to be paid before due, but it has been done—I paid the salaries—I compared the cash-box with the counterfoils and receipts, and found a deficiency of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd.</p>

Merrick, Williams, and Co.—I know the prisoner's handwriting—I should think these letters "K," "M," and "N," and the draft, and the letters signed Paul are all in his writing—I know Langridge's writing—I should say this letter "O" is in his writing—I don't know when Mr. Williams died; the last time I saw him at the office was a month or six weeks or two months before Christmas—the prisoner was there every day till Williams died, and after that he came occasionally for a short time—he ceased going to the office before Christmas—I have seen Langridge go in and out occasionally.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> From my observation at their second visit I thought Williams was the principal—the rent was sometimes paid by cash; I never had any other cheque but Langridge's—they never gave me notice to leave, but after I received the last rent I agreed to take a month's rent in lieu of notice—I think I told Paul that, and I called on Langridge—I looked to Langridge for payment—the reference was given by Williams to Langridge—while the firm carried on business I looked on Paul as a clerk or assistant.</p>

Gilbert"—we paid it to Penton and Son, leather merchants—my father sent upstairs for change, and a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and two shillings were brought down and given to the prisoner—he then handed a half-sovereign, and said "You have not taken for the gaiters."</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in partnership with the last witness for about a year and nine months, and have attended the shop at times at Ludgate Circus—before February I had noticed the defendant in the shop—for some time he had a shillings worth of threepenny cigars and two four-penny ones—he got five threepenny cigars for a shilling—we never let him have cigars on trust, or sold him 20 at a time—I did not know his name—he nearly always called about 11.45, but sometimes about 10.20—there are trains leaving Ludgate Circus at about 12.20—I had not the slightest reason to suspect the prisoner till Butler made a communica<lb/>tion to me—after that I counted the cigars myself—I was out on the evening when Potts's father was in the shop and the prisoner called—I was there on the Monday before he was taken into custody—I had counted and marked 40 cigars in a box-there was another full box of the same kind—he came in and bought a shillings worth and paid for them—I supplied him—he picked them out himself—they were put in paper—after he had left I counted the cigars again—there were only 33—he had</p>

               <p>paid for live, and there had been 40 in the box—Taylor, the detective, was employed the next day, the 20th—on that day the prisoner came about 11.45—he stood where he usually did to take the cigars, at the side of the counter—50 cigars had been counted that night in one box, and there was a full box on the top of that—he seldom asked for anything, he was so accustomed to taking the cigars—the prisoner said "Have you got any cigars a little rougher than these?"—I said "Yes," and I went up the steps to set them—when up there I could not see him—I brought a box down—I don't know that they were rougher; they were lighter in colour—he said "These are too light; these will do," picking five three<lb/>penny cigars out of the full box on the top—he then handed me a two-shilling piece and gave me four cigars to wrap up—I gave him the four wrapped up and one shilling change—up to that time he had not spoken of buying any other cigars—I had given him the change before the officer came in—the officer said "You have been suspected of stealing cigars here; you have some in your pocket. I saw you put some in your pocket"—the prisoner said "I know I have; I have got 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth; I am going to pay for them"—the officer took the 19 from his overcoat pocket on the right-hand side—they were not wrapped in anything, but all loose in his pocket—I counted the cigars in the box after the officer came in—there were 35 in one box—15 had been taken out of one box, the box he usually took them from, and four out of another—I had marked the 15 by putting half an inch of esparto grass down them—I can swear they were marked—the other four were not marked—the 15 made up the exact number in accordance with my counting that box—the other box was not counted—those cigars taken out of his overcoat pocket were a distinct cigar from those in paper—I don't know if he had a cigar on him—I saw one afterwards—when the cigars were taken out of his pocket the constable said "I shall have to take you in custody"—I went round to the station afterwards and signed the charge sheet—I was not told to do so—the prisoner said to me at the station "You won't press this charge against me; think of my wife and children. Surely, Mr. Potts, you won't press this charge against me; think of my wife"—I said "It is too late; I can't help it"—he said "If you think you have lost money since I have been a customer, if you think that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will pay for it, I will pay for it"—he wanted to call me on one side to speak to me privately, but I would not listen to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had not been on more friendly terms with him than I had with dozens of customers—I knew him very well as a customer—I was at Lowden's for five years—I don't remember him there as a customer; he might have been—I had not the slightest idea that he was the managing clerk to a firm of solicitors, or that he was plaintiff in an action coming on the next morning at the Royal Courts of Justice—I had no curiosity to go and hear the trial—I had given him a cigar at Christmas and a copy of a piece of music, which is an advertisement for a cigarette—I was present when he was searched—8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and some odd pence were found on him, and a couple of cheques—I know nothing about his having a banking account and owning house and other property at Peckham—I am sure I had given him change at the time the officer arrested him—he was on the turn away from the counter—I am nearly sure I only wrapped up four cigars—when the officer came in he said "I am a detective police officer," and the prisoner said "I know you are"—he appeared to know him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi> 19). I am station sergeant at the Bridewell station—I was there when the charge was entered against the prisoner—he said to Mr. Sharp "Surely, Mr. Sharp, you are not going to charge me with stealing these cigars?"—Mr. Sharp replied "I am, it is not the first time"—he then said "But think of my position, think of my wife and family, I have been a customer of yours for a long time"—Mr. Sharp said "You have, too good a customer"—he then said, "Mr. Sharp, you say I have stolen some before this, will 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pay you?"—Mr. Sharpe said "I will not enter into that at all"—he repeated a number of times "Think of my position, surely you will not charge me"—certain articles were handed over to a friend of his next day by his direction—the whole of his personal property was given up—there was a cigar case with two cigars in it—Taylor opened it—I can't say how many it would hold—as Taylor went on searching him the prisoner handed five cigars to Taylor, and as he did so, a piece of paper dropped from his hand—I believe they were originally in the paper—I booked the five and the two as seven, and Taylor asked if they had anything to do with the charge, and Sharp said "Nothing at all, he has paid for them"—all I kept were the 19 alleged to have been stolen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I watched this shop of Sharp and Potts by direction on the evening of 20th February—I saw the prisoner go in about 10 minutes to 12—I was on the opposite side of the street—I saw him go in, and I crossed over—the prisoner was standing near the counter, and I saw him place one or two boxes on the top of other boxes—Mr. Sharp was in the shop behind the counter—he put his hand into the box, and looking at Mr. Sharp, he took a handful and put them in his pocket—he did that three times—I saw him place a coin on the counter and pick up the change, and then I went in; he was about taking a packet of cigars wrapped in paper, and turning, when I said "I am a detective officer"—he said "Yes, I know you are"—I said "You have been suspected for a long time of stealing cigars here; how many have you in your right-hand pocket?"—he said "Oh, I have three shillings' worth; I was going to pay for them," at the same time placing his fingers in his pocket, as if to take some money—I saw no money but that taken from the counter in his hand—that was before the cigars were taken from his pocket—he took the cigars from his pocket, laid them on the counter, and I counted them—I said "19 here. That is more than three shillings' worth"—I had said before that, "Do you know the num<lb/>ber you have?" and he said "Three shillings' worth"—I counted them—there were 19—he said "I am going to pay for them"—I took him into custody, and he was conveyed to the station at Bridewell Place—Mr. Sharp came there to sign the charge sheet—the prisoner said to him "I hope you will not prosecute me, on account of my wife and family"—Mr. Sharp said "It is not the first time you have taken them"—the prisoner said "If you say I have been robbing you, will 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. repay you for your loss?"—Mr. Sharp said "It has gone too far now, it must go on"—there were 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and two cheques, and a cigar case</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I waited at the window a few minutes after the prisoner went in before I went in—young Mr. Potts was outside with me about 10 or 15 minutes before the prisoner came—he followed me into the shop, came in behind me to the best of my recollection—I really would not be sure whether he went in before me. I believe he followed me in—I first spoke to the prisoner—young Mr. Potts was in the shop then—I said "I am a detective officer"—no one had been in the shop from the time the prisoner went in till I walked up to him, that I am sure of—I did not say "You know me, don't you?"—I have seen him in Fleet Street waiting about the Courts—I was employed in reference to a pin which he lost—I have been to his office about it, but have never spoken to him about it—he was not in—I swear he did not say when I went into the shop, "I never stole anything in my life"—he was at the counter when I went in—he had got his change—he was not actually receiving the shilling as I went in—he was receiving a shilling as I was entering the door, and then he took the packet of cigars, and was turning round—he had not turned—old Mr. Potts, the father of one of the prosecutors, was there that night along with me at the shop window—I do not know that the prisoner was plaintiff in an action to be tried the following morning at the Royal Courts—I did not go to the Courts during the remand, and was not present at the trial of Manning v.

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the London and St. Katherine's Docks—about half-past 5 o'clock on Thursday, 22nd Feb., I was in the docks, near shed No. 21, and saw Cowderoy coming from underneath the platform, which is about three feet from the ground—he was stooping under the platform, when he got up I saw something underneath his jacket; he went round to the urinal—after four or five minutes he came out with Martin, and together they went towards the Central Buffet—when they had stayed there three or four minutes the dock bell rang for the train, and they went to the station—I went to them and said to Cowderoy "Have you got anything about you that you cannot give a satisfactory account of? I am about to search you, and it would be much better if either of you two have anything about you to show me or tell me"—Cowderoy said he had nothing, and then I searched Martin, and Martin pulled up his guernsey, and between his guernsey and trowsers was this tile of copper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it weighs about 56 lb.—I then told them I should take both of them into custody and charge them with being concerned in stealing a tile of copper—Cowderoy asked me what for—I told him that he would be charged as I saw him come out of No. 21 shed from under the platform—I told them to sit down and take it quiet, and I sent for assistance—Martin looked through the window, and finding the constable had gone for assistance, he said to Cowderoy, "Now is our time to clear"—Martin took hold of me by the right hand; Cowderoy came, and I took hold of him, and we had a severe struggle—I sang out for help, when the dock officials came to my assistance—the two men were then detained, taken to Plaistow Station, and charged—on the way to the station Cowderoy asked me the value of the copper—I said I thought from 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Martin said "I suppose I shall know the value before it is done"—he said that Cowderoy was not with him—he said in the presence of Hamilton that he had left his pay-box at 5 o'clock and walked with his foreman to the Buffet Hotel and had some beer there with his foreman—I had not seen Martin until he came out of the urinal—I looked under the platform the next morning and saw there an indentation in the ground as if made by that heavy thing resting there—I have known Cowderoy for four or five years, and Martin probably about two, employed at Mr. West's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When taking them to the station Martin said "I had the copper; Cowderoy knew nothing about it;" and "I was not in the urinal; I went to the Central Buffet with my foreman, and we had some beer together"—that was said in the presence of Hamilton—his fore<lb/>man is Hammond—I was about 30 yards from this shed—it was 5.30 when I apprehended them—I made a mistake when before the Magis<lb/>trate if I said "I saw Cowderoy come from the shed at 5.30"—I stopped him at 5.30—the men knock off work at 5 o'clock—the business of the dock closes at 4 o'clock, Mr. West's stevedores knock off at 5 o'clock—he has about 60—there were no other persons near, no one between me and the shed—I saw Cowderoy go to the urinal—I did not see Martin go in, they came out together—I was about 60 yards from the urinal—I did not follow them into the Central Buffet, I stayed where I was and kept observation on them for 8 to 10 minutes—I did not see any other</p>

                  </hi>. I am wharf clerk at the Coal Co-operative Company's branch premises at Deptford—on Saturday morning, 3rd March, about 6.45, I went to the wharf and saw both the prisoners there—King was foreman of the gang—Warren has been a customer for six years—Warren was about leaving with his van loaded with coal—I went up to him and said "How much this morning, Mr. Warren?"—he said "One ton and a quarter"—I inquired for King—before I could speak to him he came up and said "A ton and a half"—I said "Warren says a ton and a quarter, and you have given a ton and a half. I will have them weighed out," and I ordered them to be weighed out—in the interval Warren took the opportunity of driving off—I had considerable trouble in fetching him back—he bad got about from 50 to 60 yards—I followed him, and with difficulty I brought him back, and I had the coals weighed out at our regular weighing place, where it was King's duty to weigh the coal—the weight was exactly 18 sacks, 11cwt. more than I should be paid for, and 6cwt. more than King accounted for—I did not see the slate—I had not used the slate that morning—the coal was loose in the van, with the exception of 4cwt. in two sacks, which he usually takes in the tail of the van—I have a son who has been employed under me for the last three</p>

               <p>years—Warren used to call every day in the week except Mondays and Wednesdays as a rule; on Saturday he came twice—he might come occasionally on other occasions, but very seldom—after this I discharged King and gave information to Mr. Foster, the secretary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> King was the person responsible to me for the weight of the coals—he told me at once, before I asked him, that it was a ton and a half—King keeps the tally in my absence—it is kept on a slate, and the tickets are issued by me, and my son when present—he issues a ticket to the dealer to take to King—my son sometimes keeps the tally—it was King's duty to keep it, he is always there—the tally is checked in the evening—he enters it at the time the coals are weighed, as soon as they are gone, I suppose, if he has the slate, but he had not the slate that morning, because neither I nor my son had arrived—he would have to trust to his, memory in the individual case of Warren just for a few minutes—there were no other coal dealers there that morning—very rarely any come so early except Warren—I get there at 8, the gates are open at 6—as to the coal sold between 6 and 8, King would have to trust to his memory—it never happens that he does not get the slate till the evening—he gets it at breakfast, when the office is open—if I am not there, my son is—there was not another cart loading when I got there; that I am quite sure about—I Was an acting inspector of police for the latter part of my 24 years' service—at the police-station two other men were discharged—I am not under notice to go; I was, three weeks pre<lb/>vious to this occurrence—since I made the charge against the four men that notice has been withdrawn; it was pending a few days before that—it had nothing to do with this case—there was some delay in finding a person to succeed me, and it was under consideration whether I should be retained or not—I was to be sent away because I did not keep suffi<lb/>cient superintendence of the wharf, unfortunately trusting to King—since this charge against the prisoners I have been reinstated—Warren is a dealer—he comes to us for coals, and goes his round in the morning—there are many other coal wharves in Deptford besides ours to which dealers go.</p>

I was in the employ of this Company on this occasion—on the morning of 3rd March, about 10 minutes past 6, I was watching by the Globe public-house, in Evelyn Street, Deptford, about a quarter of a mile from the wharf—I was watching for Warren coming, to see whether his van was empty—I saw him driving in a covered van—I could see inside it from where I stood, the tail-board was down—I saw</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about a dozen yards from the van when it passed me—my father had told me to watch whether Warren's van was empty—the van is about four feet nine inches high—I did not measure it—I did not go to the wharf when the van was unloaded—I generally get to the wharf about 8 in the morning—I go there before my father—I have to copy from the slate all the dealers that have been, and enter them in a book—King brings the slate to the wharf—I take it to him in the morn<lb/>ing—my father gets to the wharf about half an hour after me.</p>

I asked him again and he said a ton and a half. I said "All right," and we loaded 15 sacks. Mr. Marsh came down and asked Warren how many he had got. He said "A ton and a quarter." Mr. Marsh said "No," and said to me "Warren has a ton and a quarter this morn<lb/>ing"—I said "No, a ton and a half." Mr. Marsh said "Stop; he is going to rob me of my coals." He ordered him to be brought back, and the coal was weighed. I cannot give any account of the six sacks because I do not know what he had in his van.</p>

I keep all the Bell Hotel, Lower Sydenham, in the parish of Lewisham—I know all the prisoners well—Wynn worked for me for a fortnight about four months ago—on Saturday, 10th February, Buckley came in about half-past 5 in the morning and waited there till about 7 smoking a short pipe—he seemed to me to be watching my movements—he was in the further bar, a public bar, near the fireplace, not the one that was broken into afterwards—I have a bar parlour that looks on to a garden—on the Saturday night when I went to bed there were bottles of brandy, whisky, gin, and rum on the counter in the bar, which they could get into through the parlour—there were 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper on the cheffonier and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver on the mantelpiece in the bar parlour—there was also a desk there and some bottles of rum underneath the bar—Bennett was about the house nearly all day—I went to bed nearly at 1 o'clock on Sunday morning; before doing so I saw the house was safely fastened up—I was so particular about it that I made my daughter pull up the blind to see that the window was properly fastened—about 8 o'clock in the morning I came down and found that the parlour window had been opened—the desk and workbox had been taken out of the parlour into the garden—the desk had been broken open and the inkstand and everything had some loose money belonging to my daughter had been taken out—I missed three bottles of gin, one of brandy, and one of whisky, and a box of cigars, and 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I live at Lower Sydenham—on Saturday, 10th Feb<lb/>ruary, I went to the Bell Hotel about 11 o'clock—all five of the prisoners were there; I know them well—about half-past 11 I heard Wynn say he meant breaking in that night—he turned round and said, "Don't let that b—<hi rend="italic">copper</hi> know nothing," meaning me; he did not see me first till he turned round—I have not been a policeman—in consequence of that I thought it was my duty to keep an eye on them—I saw them leave the house at closing time separately—I walked away and went round the square—they were all together afterwards when they came round—I hid myself in the back garden of an empty house adjoining the Bell—I could see the back window of the parlour of the Bell from where I was stationed—I saw Wynn, and Buckley, and Bennett come inside the garden of the Bell; Paulton and Benson were outside—Buckley lifted the window up;</p>

I live at 4, Wateley Road, East Dulwich, and am a greengrocer—on the 26th February, between 7 and 8 p.m., Kemp came into my shop for a bottle of ginger-beer and tendered me a shilling in payment—I found it was a bad one, and I took it into the back parlour and put it on the mantelpiece by itself—I gave Kemp 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he drank his beer and walked out, and went across to the beershop opposite—I followed him across with the shilling, and I went inside and said, "Young man, this shilling is no good to me"—he said "Why?"—I said, "Because it is not"—he said, "What, is it a bad one?"—I said, "Never mind, it is not any good to me," and he said, "If it is a bad one I know where I got it," and he pulled four or five shillings out of his pocket and gave me a good one for it—I made pretence to go into my shop—when he passed the shop I followed him—at the top of the street I saw two constables, and I communicated with them—I was subsequently fetched to the Crystal Palace Tavern, where I identified Kemp as the man who had passed the counterfeit shilling; I am positive he is the man.</p>

               <p>Mills was laid up with rheumatic gout—he said once that young Mr. Mills said that his father was in such pain he did not like to ask him, but if we wrote to him he would send on a cheque—I told the prisoner to write several letters to Mr. Hotson, but I never got any reply—he said that Mr. Hotson was out of the way—he was going into that neighbourhood, and I asked him to call on Mr. Hotson late in November or early in December—he told me next morning that he had been to Mr. Hotson's, and took a chair and sat down to wait till he saw him, but the managing clerk said that he would have a very long wait, as Mr. Hotson had gone for a holiday, and would not be back till after Christmas, and on 13th January the prisoner absconded—I said to him in January "I have received a letter from Mr. Conford, saying that he hoped I received the cheque all right; there is an account due of Mr. Conford's; he never settled the last account; see what it is, and send it on to him," and he did so—I never got any answer, and told the prisoner to write again, but I did not see him post it—I received no answer—two of these receipts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the prisoner's writing—the other seems to be his, and I can swear to the "h," but it is in a forced hand—it is a different "h" from the other, but still it is like; here is some of his writing (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the endorsements on these cheques for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. are not in my writing, and I believe this one is the prisoner's—the money re<lb/>ceived by my brother for manure had also to be entered by the prisoner—the leather business is carried on at Bow Road, and all letters relating to it would be addressed there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a beer merchant, and at this time lived at 37, Radnor Street, Commercial Road, Peckham—in November, 1881, I had an office at Great St. Helens, where I was agent to a Cyprus house,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188303190081"/>
               <p>dealers in colonial produce—on 23rd November, 1881, I saw an adver<lb/>tisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, which I have not got, and a copy has been obtained from the British Museum—I answered it, and a few days afterwards the prisoner called at my office and said I wanted about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be employed in my business, which is that of agent to Green and Sons, brewers—I said "I have not that amount, but I think I can find 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—we talked matters over, but nothing was done that day—he said that he should do a large business, and that Messrs. Green were well known people, and Mr. Green was M. P.—about a week afterwards I went to his office and asked him as to security; after a good deal of conversation, he gave me his stock as security, which he said was already paid for, but I found it was not—he never gave Messrs. Green actually as a reference, but he was constantly mentioning them; he said he did not wish me to write to them because it would prejudice him in their eyes—I told him on Lord Mayor's Day that I could only find 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said that he would take that, as he should be getting another sum of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from a publican—he arranged to give me as security 30 barrels of ale, which he said were paid for—the arrangement was reduced to writing—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only on that day—this is his receipt, but the date is torn. (<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">at 5 per cent, interest, on the security of</hi> 30 <hi rend="italic">barrels of ale, six months' notice to be given of withdrawal of capital</hi>.) I handed over all the money within a fortnight, and entered his service the same day at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week wages, and at the end of the month found out that his stock was not paid for—a little business was done, but very little legitimate business—the greater part of the beer went to the Cock public-house, Knightsbridge, by some arrangement between him and his brother—up to some time in 1882 the business steadily increased, and then it fell away nearly altogether—Messrs. Green afterwards stopped hit credit, and he was not to have goods except for cash—Mr. Thomas and I spoke to him in June, and said "How do you intend to carry on business? You put so much to your own private account, and have used so little of the money you have had from us in the business, that we wish to know what you intend to do to repay us, and how you intend to carry on your business;" he said "I am in temporary embarrassment, but matters will be all right by-and-by, as I shall get some more capital into the business"—dishonoured bills and cheques were con<lb/>tinually coming in—I had an interview with him in July, and as there was no money he said "The best thing will be for me to pay you out as well as I am able; I will give you bills; I cannot keep both Thomas and you"—I took his bills for 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for what they were worth, and they were dishonoured—I have not received a farthing—he tore the receipt up at that interview, but I picked up the pieces and put them together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not now Messrs. Green till the prisoner intro-duced me to them—I am now doing business with them—I picked up some of their business—I had 19 days to make inquiries, but I did not make them—I took him to say that he was doing a large business, and would do more in future—before I paid him a sixpence he asked me not to write to Green's, but I had written the day before I paid him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I believe I paid it without waiting for the answer—I paid it on the morning of the 16th, and then received this letter, and in spite of that I paid him 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—I kept the books and conducted the correspondence—about March, April, and May business to the amount of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was</p>

               <p>done weekly, but afterwards it did not average more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know that it was a young business from looking at the books, and it was want of capital which caused all this, and not using the capital in his business—I did not see his banking book; he kept it locked up; but I know that cheques were dishonoured—certain sums were put to his account in his own ledger, which he let me see—I do not know whose writing the signature to this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is—I may once have seen his brother's writing, the landlord of the Cock—the prisoner gave me 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down to become his nominee at the Cock Tavern—he did not take it him-self because he did not want Messrs. Green to know—I consented after a good deal of persuasion—he did not want me to enter, but the transfer was attempted—I believe that since these proceedings the prisoner is not the licence holder; he is really the owner—I parted with my 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because, by paying that, he took me in as clerk and traveller, and because he said that he was Green's agent—I know that after a time he was made Green's agent for bottled beer, but not at first—I am not now an agent for Green for bottled beer—at the present moment, in consequence of these proceedings, they only employ me on commission—I did not put these proceedings in motion at the police-court—I know Leech and Gryce, distillers—I believe they supplied the Cook Tavern—I knew that the prisoner had an interest in the Cook Tavern because it was entered in the books—I began to keep the books immediately I entered on my duties, and I found out that the beer was not paid for—I did not then say that the security was waste-paper, but something to that effect—I have seen cards like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but not cards of Green's other agents—I do not know that these cards are only printed by the firm—I swear that Mr. Warren had them done himself.</p>

I could not keep the appointment, and we had further correspondence, and on 31st January he came to my house, and said that he was in possession of a valuable brewery agency business, and wanted fresh capital to entend it and go into the bottling trade, because his friend Mr. Green the M.P. was anxious to see his beer bottled, and on the London market—he asked how soon I could get the money ready—I said it would</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188303190083"/>
               <p>be some considerable time—he said that he had so many applications he hoped I should make as much haste about it as I could—he referred me to Leech and Co., the great distillers—he wanted 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that I could only find 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and any business I put money into I should want to come into—he said that I could be his traveller and collector, but he could not give me more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and that his business was worth 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year net, and he sold about 100 barrels a month, represent<lb/>ing about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—nothing was decided at that interview, and next day I received these two letters making appointments—I saw him on Saturday, the 11th, and he took me to Leech's about the reference—he cashed a cheque for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the way at the City Bank—he said that he did not owe any money, and even the stock was paid for—when we got to Leech's he said "You will see by the way I go in upon what very good terms I am on with these people"—he went in first, and I was to wait in the sample<lb/>room; in about 10 minutes I was called in—Mr. Leech was walking about the room, and his partner sat at a table—the prisoner said to Mr. Leech "This is the gentleman I have been talking to you about"—I told Leech I was thinking of investing a sum of money in Warren's business, and should be glad to know what he could say about his respectability and honesty—Leech said "I have very great pleasure in speaking well for Mr. Warren; I have known him a consider<lb/>able time, and I know he is in possession of a very valuable beer agency, and Mr. Green, M. P., is the head of the firm which he re<lb/>presents"—on March 1st I gave the prisoner a cheque for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he gave me this receipt: "Received of J.

When I gave him the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believed he was in possession of a valuable brewery agency, and simply wanted capital to extend his business and go into bottling, and that his stock was paid for, and he did not owe any money—I would not have let him have it if he bad told me that he was in embarrassed circumstances and wanted money—Mr. Leech was actually charged with him before the Magistrate—I was to have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month for the first three months and then 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—i entered the service on March 1st and found Card there—the first cheque for my salary was handed to me some days alter it was due, and the subsequent cheques were returned by the bank unpaid—I commu<lb/>nicated with Mr. Card, and found that the bank account was getting very low—when I first went there the prisoner may have done 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of business a week, but it diminished, and in June the credit with Green and Son was stopped; he owed them a large sum—Card and I spoke to the prisoner in June, and pointed out to him how things appeared to be going, that money appeared very short, and things ordered from Green's did not come in, and we asked him what he was going to do to carry on; he said that it was only some slight temporary embarrassment—I soon afterwards saw Leech and Gwyer about it—I did get paid, but only by persistently sticking to him, and getting it in driblets—in October I went to the seaside and left Mr. Longford in charge of my books—I left at the end of November; there were then three men in possession, and one of them was from Mr. Leech—I have had none of my 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back, no interest, and he owes me two months' salary—I kept a lodging-house before this.</p>

               <p>never allowed to do so—he opened a book and rattled through the leaves before me, but did not give it into my possession—I did not ask him to allow me to examine it—I did not know that he was London agent for Messrs. Ferner, of Yarmouth; I know he had their beer—the advertise<lb/>ment said "Every investigation allowed," and I answered it a month before I paid the money—I made inquiries of Leech's; they have an office in Charterhouse Square—the money was my own through my wife—I had to consult her trustees before investing it—I had no knowledge of the beer business—I was a clerk in a bank once—the whole business may have averaged 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; he sold all sorts of beer—Card kept the books, but I saw them and had some writing to do in them.</p>

                  </hi>. On 4th August, 1882, I lived at 32, Fayer Street, Manchester Square, and saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>: "Partnership 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a lucrative brewery business, with good remuneration for services.—Beta, North Street, Sloane Street." I answered it the same day, and received an answer on the 5th from the prisoner, and another letter on the 9th, which is lost, asking me to call the next day before 1 o'clock—on 11th August I saw Warren at his office in Rowley Place, and told him I had come about the advertisement—he said that he had been up to my mother the night before, and had an interview with her, that he wanted the money to extend his business, by taking up some public-houses, of which he had bought the leases—he said "I am Green's agent, of Bury St. Edmunds"—three or four show cards of Green's were on the walls—he said "I don't want a partner, I am shortly expecting one," and that the profits of his business were from 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; that he liked my letter, and he thought we should get on together—150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year was mentioned for my services, which was to include interest on the loan—I saw him one evening at my father's house, and he asked me about a reversion, which I had told him I was selling, and said that he knew some one who very likely would be able to buy it—I saw him next day at Howley Place, and said that I had seen my solicitor, who said that I must not advance any money till I knew what security I was going to get—he seemed rather to hesitate, and said that his bookkeeper, Mr. Thomas, had come without security, and he did not see why I should not, but he could give security if I wanted it, and referred me to Leech and Co.—I went with him to various places, and among others to the Garibaldi public-house, Blackfriars, where he said he did 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—we went to Leech's about 14th August—he went in first for a minute or two, and then took me in and intro<lb/>duced me to Mr. Leech, at whose suggestion "Warren went out of the room—he had told me on the Saturday that the Cock Tavern was his, that he had got the lease of it for 10 years—on the 15th. I went again with him to my solicitor's, Mr. Biali's, where he said that he was the owner of the Cock, and was going to give it me as security—nothing was said about the licence—this agreement was drawn up, and it was executed the next day (<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of the deposit of</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">with the prisoner for</hi> 18 <hi rend="italic">months on a mortgage of the Cock Tavern, to be repaid at a month's notice, the witness to enter the prisoner's service at</hi> 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year, payable monthly</hi>)—I entered his service the following Monday, and gave him six bills for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and one for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which have all been met except two of the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ones, which by my solicitor's advice I have not met—I have been sued on them by Leech—I subsequently let the prisoner have</p>

               <p>13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—when I paid him the last bill I gave him 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because he said he was not sure he should have enough—I parted with the bills because I thought he would give me the Cock according to the agreement, and that he had the power to do so—I believed about the large and lucrative business, and that he would be able to pay me my salary—he did not tell me he owed Green and Sons 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or that he was not trusted by them and could only get beer for cash; that made a great difference—on 29th September he told me he could put me in the way of earning 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I would lend a third party 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I let the prisoner have it after he showed me that the third party had deposited the deeds—in October Thomas went away to the seaside, and I kept the books in his absence—I had then received 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary—after one of Green's partner's came, who seemed altogether dissatisfied with Warren, I said to Warren, "Here is a man named Marwick owes us 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think we might as well send his account in"—he said, "That is all settled up, he is a man who did some building for me"—I found out after that Mar<lb/>wick was his stepfather—when Thomas returned we both spoke to him—I said there were nothing but bad debts, and I found a drawer full of unpaid bills, that a summons came which I had sent him, that all the salary that I had had from him was 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and business could not go on like that—he said that he had not taken up those houses yet, when he had matters would improve—he used to stay out all day; he said "I have important business, those houses make a man run off his legs"—I had an interview with him with ray solicitor, when he said he was going to get rid of me and Thomas and carry on the business economically—he let drop accidentally that he had only about three months' interest to run in the Cock—he never executed any mortgage of the Cock—he said once that it had eighteen months to run but he should renew it in three weeks—my solicitor did not inquire what the security was—none of my money has been repaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Before I lent the money I consulted my solicitor, Mr. Biale—I did not consult Mr. Peed—"agent for Messrs.

Green and Company, but I went to them after I left Warren—the documents of title were to be deposited at the end of the month—Warren showed me a parchment, but I did not examine it, and he put it in his pocket—I have never been in business before—I did not consult my father—I acted on my own judgment, but I consulted a solicitor, as an agreement had to be drawn up—I instructed my solicitor to write for the title deeds of the Cock, or to inquire into the title—that was after I paid the bills—I never got the mortgage—some of the bills were renewed—I heard that Leech and Company had put a man in possession for the two bills which I would not pay.</p>
