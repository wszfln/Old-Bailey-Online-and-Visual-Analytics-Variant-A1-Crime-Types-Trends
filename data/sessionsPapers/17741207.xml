As we were walking from Ball's Pond turnpike towards Kingsland turnpike, at about a quarter before nine o'clock, the prisoner Rogers came to me and demanded my life or my money; I jumped off the causeway into the road and told him I did not know what he meant, I had no money, and I called the watch; he told me if I called the watch any more he would knock my brains out: I told him if he would not hurt me I would give him all my money; he said he would not; I gave him some halfpence, he said this is not all, I told him if he would have patience I would give him all; he said he would take it out if my pocket himself, I said he should not do that, but I would give him all; I took out 4 or 5 s. he said he would feel whether I had not more, then another man came up and stood at my side or held me, I can't be sure which, while Rogers felt in my pocket, but he found no more; then he shook hands with me, said it was necessity had drove him to it, and wished me a good night. There were three men in all. Mr. Gill was a few yards from me at the time. I think I know all the prisoners, but I can't be positive to any but Rogers; I knew Rogers again as soon as I saw him, he was dressed in a darkish, reddish great coat with a velvet collar; he wore his hat cocked up on each side and flapped before.</p>

I am servant to Mr. Skuse On the 27th of October, the prisoner came to my master's shop, and asked if my master was at home, I said yes, he said he had had a misfortune with his shoe, he lifted up his foot and shewed me the upper leather of his shoe was burst; I told him to sit down, and I would sit him with a pair, he said he had another misfortune, he had no money about him, I told him my master would not trust any body, he said he lived in good credit and his name was Collins, and desired me to go and ask my master, who at last, told me to let him have a pair of shoes, the first pair I fitted on he did not like, I fetched another pair, tried them, and said they would do very well, I put the other shoes on his feet, and he bid me good night and went out; as soon as he was gone out, a young man came in, and told me he looked through the window and saw the prisoner take two pair of shoes; I went after him, he was then stooping and taking off the new shoes and putting on his old ones, I brought him back and charged him with having shoes about him that did not belong to him, he then pulled them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070005"/> out of his pocket. (The shoes were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

            . I was coming along the Strand, at the corner of Essex-street, I saw the prisoner and some people about him, I asked what was the matter; they said, he had been in several shops, and they thought he wanted to defraud somebody, I followed him through Temple Bar, I saw him go into the prosecutors shop, I looked through the window, the last witness went into the parlour, while he was gone I saw the prisoner take a pair of shoes off the shelf and put them in his pocket, the man returned and then the prisoner went into the parlour; when he returned I saw the shop-man sitting on a pair of shoes; they would not do; while he was reaching another pair, I saw the prisoner take another pair of shoes and put under his coat, when he came out I went in and informed them of it.</p>

               <p>- Jacobs. I bought a ring of Mr. Warree, which I sold to Mr. Polock.</p>
               <p>Polock. I sold the ring to Mr. Plank.</p>
               <p>Plank. I broke the ring up, I returned the diamond and the setting to Mr. Polock.</p>
               <p>- Polock. I have got the diamond so returned, and the setting is in the hand of Henderson.</p>
               <p>Henderson produced the setting and Diamonds.</p>
               <p>Green. I can swear to the setting and diamonds, the setting is made in a very particular fashion, according to my own fancy.</p>
               <p>- Henderson. I originally set the ring, it is a very particular one, such as I never had before nor since, I am positive this is the setting I made for Mr. Green.</p>

On the 24th of October the prisoner, Stewart and two other men, the other men I cannot speak positively to; as to the the prisoner Jones, I have some notion he is one, but I cannot be positive to him, but I am positive to Stewart; they came into my shop between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; Stewart asked to look at some shirt buckles, I took out a drawer which contained buckles and rings; he looked over the shirt buckles and shook them about. I suspected from his manner he had some other purpose than to buy: at last he agreed for a shirt buckle, then he asked to look at some silver buckles; he agreed for a pair of them, when he had done he put his hand into his pocket and said he had not money enough to pay for them, and he asked his two campanions to lend him the money; they each said they had not money enough; then he asked me to send the maid with them and his father<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070007"/> would advance the money. I sent the maid with them; when she was gone I missed a ring; I had not recollection enough of the ring that was missing to know what sort of a ring it was, but I could see plainly there was a ring missing. I recollected that while they were bargaining, the maid pulled me by the sleeve, which confirmed me in my suspicions, and I concluded the maid saw something which made her suspect them.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Rapley, I was called up stairs upon the 24th of October, by my mistress, when I found three people in the shop; the prisoner Stewart and Jones were two of them; I can swear to Jones: they were bargaining for shirt and shoe buckles; I thought I saw Stewart put his hand into his pocket, whether he had any thing in his hand or no I cannot tell, but I took notice of the circumstance; Stewart having agreed for a shirt buckle and a pair of shoe buckles, and he not having money enough nor the other money enough to lend him; he proposed I should be sent with him to his father who would advance the money, I went with them, they took me as far as New-street, and then Stewart turned into Bedford-bury and said he was going to his father for the money, and bid me go on with the other men. I did go on with them as far as the end of Bedford-street, and then the third man, that is not here, said he would go and see if he could find Stewart: so he left me alone with Jones; Jones took me to the Constitution, a public house in Bedford-street, and kept me there about half an hour, then he asked me if Stewart had got the buckles, for if he had he might probably make off with them, that he did not know much of him, he had only been at sea with him; then the third person came to the public house, and said it was to no purpose to wait any longer for Steward for he believed his father was angry with him for pretending to lay out so much money, and I might as well go home. I went home, and then I heard that a ring was missing,</p>

I told him I had some reason to think it belonged to a jeweller in St. Martin's Court, and he must stay till I could send there; he said he would stay; there were several people in the shop, therefore I did not apprehend he would run away: I stept into the back shop for something, when I came back, the prisoner, Stewart was gone out of the shop; they told me he was gone to the door to bring in the man that he said had sent him with the ring. I found Stewart near the door, with one hand upon the bridle of a horse upon which there was a man and one foot upon the stirrup as if in the act of mounting the horse; I went up to him and said he must not go, he must go with me to St. Martin's Court, upon which he disengaged himself from the horse and instantly ran away: I pursued him, and after some time overtook him and brought him back.

               <p>Barker, I do not recollect any suchthing; the prisoner said that he was the finisher of the ring.</p>
               <p>Stewart. Whether I did not tell you the man on horseback was the man that had sent me with the ring, and desired you to stop him?</p>
               <p>Barker. He did not do that.</p>

I met a man at the Lemon-tree in the Haymarket, he owed me a little money, I asked him for the money, he said he had nothing but a which if I would pledge, he would pay me; and I bid the pawn-broker step to the door with me to the man that gave it me.</p>

F. upon the plane, and that being a different mark to what he told me his name was, I suspected him.

I then went back to see what was lost from the bottom of the cupboard, from whence I missed thirteen pounds, in half crowns, and a guinea; on my return again, my wife had all the money in her apron, they kept Williams in custody, 'till I got a constable: I have got all my property again, it was all found on Williams, the grenadier found the things on Williams that he delivered to me.</p>

As Mr. Venables was coming into the room he delivered me the notes and a canvas bag; I delivered them to Mr. Venables, and he went out of the room again as soon as I delivered them, Mrs. Venables came in and said she had lost her half crowns; I put my hand to his coat pocket and felt something; then I put my hand in his pocket and took out some of the half crowns; he gave Mrs. Venables the rest. I asked him if he had any more of the landlord's property, he said he had only a few shillings of his own; I felt in his breeches pocket and found two or three shillings and a sort of a coronation medal, which I thought might be his own property, and therefore I gave him them again.</p>

Somebody told me we were robbed. I saw it was the same man I had before served with rum and water: somebody called me to take the money. The warder held his sword before Williams, Williams told me not to be afraid, he would deliver me my property: I went, and held my lap, and he put in thirteen pounds in half crowns, eight guineas, five quarter guineas, and a silver spoon, and two pounds fifteen shillings and sixpence in shillings and sixpences; I am positive to the sum, my husband had it put down every day.</p>

             coming down with a chissel in his hand; one of the warders was coming down stairs; Vaughan said, this is the thing that has done it. The warder said, done what? Vaughan said, there were some people up stairs had broke open Mr. Venables' room: I ran up stairs immediately and saw Kerrison and Williams in the room: just as I came into the room, Kerrison said, you shall not go; he seemed to want to get away; I shoved him down on a bench in the room, then came up the gentleman-warder and the prisoner delivered a silver spoon, three papers and a bag to Kerrison; after this the gentleman-warder said, search his pockets and see if there is any thing about him. I put my hand to his left hand pocket and found something weighty; Williams said, I should not take it out; Mrs. Venables came, and he delivered a great quantity of half crowns to her; when he had delivered her the half crowns I took five pick-lock keys out of his pocket, then a man, who is a servant there, desired me to follow him into the room where Coggan was. and desired me to search if there was any fire arms about him. I searched him but found nothing. This key [producing it] I found in Williams's pocket: I have had it ever since.</p>

            . On the 18th of October, between twelve and one, I was going into my own house I heard Mr. Venables call out of the window stop that man on the stairs, the grenadier stopped him. I went up stairs, I saw Coggan in a room standing by the fire place and scratching the ashes over something: I ran to him and asked him what he was hiding there? I searched, and found a chissel under the ashes. I said, you villain this is what you have been doing the robbery with: there was no body in the room but him.</p>

I was along with Clarke, Day came out of the house, he ran away, I pursued him, he made a blow at me and missed me, then he said he would surrender, I brought him back, I found Day's wife in the kitchen, Day said he was just cleared from the King's Bench, and that he did it through want, I said to Bailis, are not you an old fool to get into such a scrape as this in your old age? Bailis said, he did it by his master's direction, and we could not hurt him, Bailis was as black as a chimney-sweeper and without his coat. I saw Mr. Clarke take the key from Day which opened the cellar: Day told Mr. Clarke that this was the key of the cellar: I did not go into the cellar with Mr. Clarke at the first time; I kept Day in custody while Mr. Clarke went to see what was in the cellar, afterwards I went into the cellar and saw the instrument fixed with the halfpence and the fire.</p>

On Wednesday the 26th of November, I was waked as near as I can judge about three o'clock by Mrs. Ellicott. She asked me what noise that was? I told her, I apprehended the servants were moving the tables in the passage. She said, that could not be, for it was quite dark. She rang the bell, upon which we heard some people coming upon the stairs. The first word I heard was, come up directly. We jumped up out of bed immediately. Mrs. Ellicott, slept on the side of the bed nearest the door. When I was out I heard my daughter's room door open, which is on the same floor, (the two pair of stairs) I heard somebody in the passage say, D - n your bloods we will murder every soul in the house. Mrs. Ellicott cried out, almost immediately, Lord bless me, the door is open; it fastens with a drop-bolt. I had forgot to fasten it, it was open and somebody was coming in; she went to the door and pushed it close; I hurried as fast as I could to the door; while she was at the door, a person said, D - n you if you do not open the door, I will murder every one of you, or to that effect, which voice was the same as the prisoner's at the bar. I did not see the person.</p>
               <p>Question. How soon after did you hear the prisoner speak?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. I think it was on the Friday, this was Wednesday the 26th, (on Friday the 28th I saw the prisoner.) when I came to the door I thought I could have pushed it too; but I found there was something put to prevent our shutting it, then Merritt called out to some others to come up directly, he called out come up directly. The door then was attempted with a considerable force: (there was a hanger with a scabbard put in between the door and the door post) by a great number; how many I cannot tell; when I found that by my own force, I could keep them from coming in. Mrs. Ellicott went across the bed to reach me a pair of loaded pistols that I had at my bed side; and at the same time rang the bell again very hard. I could not tell at first what they had put into the door; I took it to be a piece of stick, and Mrs. Ellicott tried to break it: on the bell being rung, the servants who lay over our heads came down: I still kept the door fast: I found then I could get it closer than before, so as to drop the bolt down and fasten the door; as soon as I had done that, I ran and threw up the sash which looks into the lane, and called out thieves: I saw my own three servants in the street in their shirts, they asked me which way they were gone; my servants did not say any thing to me as they came down stairs, so that I did not know that they were gone down. I opened the door and went down. After they had dressed themselves, I sent them on horseback in pursuit of the robbers; then I raised some carpenters that were at work in the neighbourhood, and they also went in pursuit; and I sent information to Sir

               <p>Question. Did you find any of these things again?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. Respecting the thirty-hour alarum there was an advertisement in the news-paper some days after that such a thing had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070014"/> found in the fields near the sluice-house, a few days after. My house is remarkably well secured; the window-shutter they broke in at is a strong deal-shutter, there is a strong iron bar that goes across; when I came down, upon finding they were gone out of the house, I went to see how they came in; the rabbit of that joint of the shutter; was cut so as to get at the hinges, and the hinges were forced off; I apprehend they had bent the bar, so as to slide one part of the shutter behind the other, then there was a vacancy for them to get in; ( they are folding shutters) this let them into the back kitchen; when they had got there, the door that comes out of that kitchen into the common kitchen is very strong, it was bolted in the inside; they wrenched that bolt quite off, that let them into the common kitchen, the door out of that kitchen that leads into the body of the house was bolted as the other, and that was likewise broke open.</p>
               <p>Question. Where was the plate left?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. My orders are always, that the plate should be carried up into a place made on purpose in the room the servants lie in; but the footman negligently left them below when they went away. On my squeezing the room door so fast to keep them out, they could not get away the scabbard, but they

             the hanger out and left the scabbard behind. When the prisoner was taken, there was a hanger found without a scabbard that fits it, this is the scabbard that was left in my door; (producing it) I observed when the scabbard was between the door that Mrs. Ellicott tried to break it off; the hanger goes in just so far, if it hadgone quite to the end, she could not have bent it at all.</p>
               <p>Question. How do you know the hanger was in the scabbard at the time Mrs. Ellicott attempted to break it?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. I felt them attempt to draw it out, and after they had drawn it out, I was able to shut the door.</p>

               <p>Mr. Ellicott. Here is a piece of a small cupboard door that is broke open, it appears upon examination, that one of these chissels exactly fits the place where it is broke open; at one end there is a kind of claw which answers exactly to the marks; at the small end here is a little gap, there is even the mark of that gap upon the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ellicott's Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Question. You was waked out of your sleep?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. Yes. I heard the noise which confused me.</p>
               <p>Question. There was a great deal of noise in the house I suppose?</p>
               <p>Answer. After I got up there was.</p>
               <p>Question. There were several I believe?</p>
               <p>Answer. It is impossible for me to tell, the door was too. I am confident there were more than one; we supposed at the time there were three or four.</p>
               <p>Question. There were more voices I believe than one?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. I believe there were. I heard the man's voice that was in my daughter's room; but not distinctly.</p>
               <p>Question. Being waked in this manner, you must be somewhat flurried?</p>
               <p>Answer. Yes. I believe there is nobody here, but would, I have as much presence of mind too, I believe as most people.</p>
               <p>Question. You must be something agitated, especially at the cry of murder?</p>
               <p>Answer. I was not alarmed at that; when I got out of bed first, I was alarmed, but when I found I could keep the door, and had a brace of pistols; I cannot say I was so much alarmed then.</p>
               <p>Question. But against so many men?</p>
               <p>Answer. I had three stout fellows in the house, besides myself.</p>
               <p>Question. I should suppose there must be more voices heard than one?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. I did hear the voice in my daughter's room, and Merritt's; they were the only<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070015"/> voices I heard; I heard him say, if you don't lie still; I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Question. You heard a voice you believe to be the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Ellicott. The voice I heard at my room door, I believe to be the prisoner's.</p>

            . I am gardner to Mr. Ellicott, when the house was alarmed, I was the first person I believe that heard the noise between two and three o'clock, I made the best of my way down stairs, I heard the bell ring before, it is an alarum bell to ring for the servants, up in the garret; when I was at the last landing part of the stairs, I saw Miller with a candle in his hand, and the door in his other hand; at the hall door, he was the last person in the house, he went out at the door, and shut the door after him; I saw no other person but him.</p>
               <p>Question. Are you sure it is Miller?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Very sure.</p>
               <p>Question. What compass of time, did you see him?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. A quarter of a minute, he was dressed in a brown great coat, and his other cloaths, snuff coloured, I did not see his waistcoat; I never saw him before; I made the best of my way to the door, but they got out of the door, before I could see which way they went.</p>
               <p>Question. Was it a dark or light night?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Very moon light.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you hear a noise of more persons than one?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. I heard a very great noise; I heard Miller's voice; he said, d - m you make haste, they are upon us. I was coming down the stairs when he said that.</p>
               <p>Question. Have you seen Miller since, and heard him speak since?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. Yes; and believe it to be his voice.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you see the place they broke in at?</p>
               <p>Godfrey. First they got a ladder, and got down into the area, the ladder was left there. They broke open a gate at a carpenter's, where they got this ladder from: it is a sash window, they pulled the sash down, and pushed aside the shutter. I saw the cook maid bar the shutter, over night. They broke the bolt off that kitchen door into the best kitchen, from there they got into the body of the house: those doors were fast, I saw the footman bolt them. They broke open a great chest that was in the passage, up one pair of stairs.</p>

The sauce boats, were in a drawer in the Kitchen, the tea-chest stood in the back parlour, the tea-cannisters were in the tea-chest, the sugar basket, sauce boats, ladle, &amp;c. used to be kept above stairs; I left them below that night, and a dozen of desert spoons were left in the knife case. I fastened the kitchen doors over night. The bolts were forced off in the morning.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you see any of the people that broke the house open?</p>
               <p>Garnet. No; I followed the gardener, I was just behind him going down stairs, I did not see any one go out at the door, I heard the door shut, the coachman asked me to bring down the gun out of the garret. The people in the house said d - n your eyes come down, we will find you guns; the coachman was then upon the stairs, I was coming out of the room.</p>

I believe he was, but I cannot say punctually; Mr. Ellicott shuting the door fast, the hanger came out without the sheath. They pulled it out; it was in the sheath when it was thrust in at the door. Mr. Ellicott said, give me my gun, I will blow their brains out. We all ran down stairs, and made our escape. We went down the lane, towards some fields, we took the property out of the bag and put it in our pockets, and we left the clock and tea chest in a field, and the cane I believe.</p>

               <p>Question. Do you remember any expressions used at Mr. Ellicott's door.</p>

               <p>Question. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Answer. In Houndsditch. I have heard for a truth that he is dead and buried: there was metal we thought gold; he said it was only silver washed with gold, that they were of no service and he would throw them away.</p>
               <p>Question. What did they all sell for?</p>
               <p>Answer. About thirty-one guineas.</p>
               <p>Question. How much had you?</p>
               <p>Answer. About five guineas: Hatchman was at the receiving of the money, he gave me mine and said he would give the others theirs.</p>
               <p>Question. Had the prisoner any arms?</p>
               <p>Answer. I don't remember he had; he was a little bad in his limbs and was not able to use any.</p>
               <p>Question. What did you carry all these things away in?</p>
               <p>Answer. In a big apron, till we came to the fields, then we put them in our pockets.</p>
               <p>Question. Who carried you this apron?</p>
               <p>Answer. It belonged to Yapper and Hatchman, or

               <p>Answer. We had such a one; I cannot say whether this is it, but we had a chissel, besides a socket chissel.</p>
               <p>Question. Who did that chissel you had there belong to?</p>
               <p>Answer. All the things were brought to Fises: I was to go with them to do this ladies: they brought all the things with them.</p>

               <p>Answer. I believe that was the hanger.</p>
               <p>Question. Do you know that?</p>
               <p>Answer. I never had this in my hand, the other hanger I had.</p>
               <p>Question. Is that the hanger that was put in between the door.</p>
               <p>Answer. I cannot say that; we had every one a lash a-piece.</p>
               <p>Question. Do you remember when Merritt was taken up?</p>
               <p>Answer. Yes, I was coming out of the ship-ale-house, at the bottom of the lane; I went up the lane to go the nearest way into Goodman's-fields: Pagett stood at the door as I was walking by; he ran a-cross the way, took hold of me dragged me to the house and throwed me down; Farrell said he would knock my teeth down my throat or kill me: I said I would go quietly.</p>
               <p>Question. Was not you going into the house?</p>
               <p>Answer. No, so help me God.</p>

             and Nimmy, and Matshumet came to my house the day before Mr. Ellicott's house was broke open, they said, they were going to rob a Jew ladies at Highgate; and asked me if I was willing to go with them; I was very poorly, I had work to go to, and thought it would be best; they said, it was a Jew ladies, and she had a Jew maid. (This Yapper is a Jew,) and the Jew maid was to leave the door open for us to go in, and after the house was robbed, he was to be married to this Jew maid: I went along with him to Highgate to do the robbery; when we came there, the house was all fastened: I had much ado to walk there; when we found we could not do that house: I went a little way down Hornsey-Lane with them. I said I was not able to walk any farther; I must go home: I did, and know nothing about Mr. Ellicott's robbery, nor never had a halfpenny of the money: they went on without me; I was not able to go about any other business: I beg your Lordship would ask Miller, whether I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Miller. I believe he was on the stair-case: I cannot say, whether he was or no; to swear punctually.</p>
               <p>Question. Was he at the house?</p>

               <p>Question. All of you.</p>
               <p>Answer. All but him, I did not know which way he went, he ran away or something, I don't know how he went.</p>
               <p>Question. Was he at the house at the time you went down the area.</p>
               <p>Answer. He was at the door.</p>
               <p>Question. As you went out last did you see how many went out before you.</p>
               <p>Answer. There were four or five of us in I know.</p>
               <p>Question. Dou you recollect whether you saw him upon the stair-case or no.</p>
               <p>Answer. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Question. Did not he help to bring some of the things away.</p>
               <p>Answer. It was I and Hatchman took the property down stairs, Yapper brought them into the field, it was all in a bag, when we came into the field, we took the clock and came out and threw them away, the other things we put in our pocket.</p>
               <p>Question. Did the prisoner put nothing in his pocket.</p>

On the 1st of December, between three and four in the afternoon I saw the prisoner put his head out of a lower window of a warehouse on the wharf; there were several people working over his head: I went in and asked him, what he was doing there? he said he was doing nothing. Observing something bundled up in his frock, I asked what he had there; he said, it was sugar and he would put it in the hogshead again. There was some sugar in the two pair of stairs warehouse, but none in this place: out of one of these hogsheads a great quantity of sugar was taken.</p>

               <p>I found the sugar on the stairs; I happened in the dark to run against Mr. Jones, and he took me up, and said I had stole this sugar; the sugar was lying scattered on the stairs.</p>
               <p>Jones. It was wrapped up in his frock before him.</p>

            . I am a watchman in the port of London, employed under the commissioners of the customs. On the 6th of November, about three at noon, I had the charge of an India hoy loaded with tea; there was near it a lighter, which was very close to this hoy, that hoy was loaded with sugar. I had received information that sugar was taken out of it. I went on board, and I saw the prisoner filling a handkerchief out of one of the hogsheads: before I went on board I called on one Chinner who was upon the key, and likewise upon a watchman; this prisoner was secured, and the handkerchief was found there, containing this quantity of sugar, amounting to seventy pound.</p>

Mr. Scott and I took up the tarpaulin and hatch-way, and we saw the prisoner; he was then at work, filling the handkerchief out of the cask; upon this we went down different ways, in order to prevent his escape that way; the other went the other way, at last he did come up: we secured him, and carried him on shore. Within about twenty yards after we got him on shore, he made his escape; he was rescued after that, it was three weeks before he was taken, he had been in our custody about ten minutes before he was rescued; and I am certain the prisoner is the man I saw under the hatches in that lighter, and no other person was in the lighter.</p>

               <p>Question. What sort of a light was it where you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Dicker. It was between one and two, I had no light, but the light of the lamps.</p>

               <p>Dicker. Yes.</p>

               <p>Question. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Dicker. Much as he is now, but he had a remarkable large black hat on.</p>

               <p>Dicker. I was no more in liquor that any person that had been spending an evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you a little in liquor?</p>
               <p>Dicker. No, I was not, I was equally as sober as I am at this instant, and as capable of judging of any thing that passed.</p>
               <p>Question. And you do take upon you to swear that is the man?</p>
               <p>Dicker. Yes.</p>

            . I have watered the horses for the coachmen, at Charles-street, Covent-garden fifteen years. Mr. Dicker got into a coach, the corner of the street in Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Question. What day are you speaking of?</p>
               <p>Pope. Friday night, about half after one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Question. Was that the 5th of November?</p>
               <p>Pope. Yes.</p>
               <p>Question. Do you know Mr. Dicker?</p>
               <p>Pope. This is the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Question. What is Mr. Dicker?</p>
               <p>Pope. I don't know, the boy that drove the coach came back in about three minutes; he stopped at the Bunch of Grapes in Charles-street, Covent-garden, and knocked at the door. I told the gentleman that they were all gone to bed. From there he ordered him to drive to the Fountain Tavern, Catherine-street; when they came there, one with a link, called Raggy, and another, one Murphy: they heard the orders: they jumped up upon the box, and ran away with the boy's coach, and did not bring it till four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Question. What boy is it; is that the coachman?</p>
               <p>Pope. A very little boy.</p>
               <p>Question. Do you know the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pope. Yes, he was not there that night; after the play broke up, when they came back, they gave him two shillings, and said they had been with a gentleman to Chelsea. When this prosecutor apprehended this man; I was not come to work. I told Raggy of it on Saturday night, and Murphy: Murphy is gone out of the way ever since: Raggy is now in Tottlefields Bridewell for breaking the windows of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070025"/> the gentleman's house that Colby was hanged for breaking open; and that they are the men that robbed the gentleman, I will assure you.</p>
               <p>Question. That you cannot know?</p>
               <p>Pope. They drove the coach away.</p>
               <p>Question. You say, a gentleman took the coach?</p>
               <p>Pope. Yes, it was between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Question. Where did Raggy and Murphy get upon the coach?</p>
               <p>Pope. At the Fountain Tavern; they drove away the coach, and left the boy behind, with the gentleman in the coach.</p>
               <p>Question to Mr. Dicker. Were there two persons that drove you to Chelsea?</p>
               <p>Dicker. I saw but one.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you go to the different places the witness speakes of; first, to the Bunch of Grapes, then to the

               <p>Dicker. I went to no place but home, and they drove me exceeding fast.</p>
               <p>Question. From what house did you go?</p>
               <p>Dicker. I took it in York-street.</p>
               <p>Question. What house had you been at?</p>
               <p>Dicker. At the Chequers, at Charing-Cross.</p>
               <p>Question. How came you to go to Covent-garden to go to Chelsea?</p>
               <p>Dicker. Because I was sure of a coach there and did not chuse to walk home; that was my only reason.</p>
               <p>Question. You did not stop at the Bunch of Grapes?</p>
               <p>Dicker. No, nor any other house.</p>

            . I am the brother of this unfortunate man. I went to this gentleman's, Mr. Dicker's house, on Monday: the servant maid told me, he was not at home: I asked her in regard to the affair. She said, that her master came home between two and three in the morning very much in liquor, and all over dirt; that he had lost his wig. I went again next morning, a quarter before nine to him: I said, I find you have swore absolutely to my brother: he said no, he had sworn no otherwise than to the best of his knowledge, nor would swear any more at the Old Bailey. I said, I hope, as you are so resolute upon this, you will take it into consideration, and be sure before you do pretend to swear. Says he, I have not swore certain; nor I will only swear to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Question to Dicker. Did any such conversation pass between you and that man?</p>
               <p>Dicker. I heard, by my servant, that this man had been there before; and very well she might tell him I was dirty; I was knocked down, and of course must be very dirty, and lost my wig: it was brought home by my neighbour next morning: I lost it on the spot I was knocked down upon. This man came to me at the time my barber was shaving me: I said, sit down, I will speak to you presently. What is your business? said he, I came on account of an unfortunate brother of mine: I hope you will be as favourable as possible. Said I, I certainly shall be: I just told him the state<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070026"/> of the case. Now, said I, what could you do? That was what passed between us.</p>
               <p>Question. Did you ever say you was doubtful of the Person of the man?</p>
               <p>Dicker. No, not in the least; I was always certain to him, though I did not positively swear to him before Sir

               <p>Q. Is your house a part of the hall, or separate and detached from it?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. There is no part separate, I have the whole dwelling, there is no one resides in it but myself. On the first of November, when we were going to breakfast about nine o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070027"/> we missed the milk pot; the maid servant then went into the back room, and missed most of the things mentioned in the indictment; upon which I went up into my office, and found the drawers in which I keep my money broke open, with a chissel, in a rough and clumsey manner. I took all the money out of it a day or two before, except three shillings in halfpence, which was gone. I missed a shirt out of a drawer, that is always left open for the washerwoman; and two silk handkerchiefs that I said the night before upon the desk in the store room; out of which the plate was taken. I saw the mark of a dirty foot upon the table: there is a square window to that room, but the steps go up by it, by which it is reduced to but half a window, that window was shut down, but it is never fastened; it appeared plainly that somebody had entered in at this window, and shut it down again; the window looks upon the steps in the main street, that goes up to the hall. I concluded from the circumstances of the robbery, the drawer being broke where I kept my money, and no other, and a pair of candlesticks being left, which were not silver, but plated, that the prisoner Pritchard who had lived with me four months, and had the care of my plate, and knew the drawers where I kept my money, must be concerned in this business. Pritchard left me on the 10th of September last, and he perfectly knew the situation of the plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. I never found any of them, the witnesses will give you an account of a chissel that was found?</p>

            . That half window in the store-room was shut down over-night, I was the last person in the room, the plate was taken from a closet in that room; while Pritchard was our servant, he always brought the plate out of the closet, and carried it in. Most of the plate, mentioned in the indictment, was in the closet, the pint mug was on the table under the window, six large table spoons, and six desert spoons were in the store-room on a table; I lost a satin cloak and a child's frock, which hung up in, the store-room; I missed fifteen spoons from the case in the dining-room, which were under the tea table, they were always kept covered with a gauze he has seen me cover them.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Cruttenden. Did not the contents of the other drawers appear to be tumbled, or attempted to be opened?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. None other but that where the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you changed any other of your servants within a few months of this time?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. I believe not, a maid servant had gone, but no other man servant but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this your own plate?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. Yes. I found the window shut, the street door the servant found ajarr, which I shut the night before.</p>

Parker said, don't let us all go together, the people will stare so, as we go along the street. I said I did not want to go; it was no business of mine; we would go to another publick house, and wait for them; we went accordingly to the Crown and Horse-shoe, the corner of Bartlet's Buildings, in Holborn, and waited for them till five o'clock.</p>

Pritchard said, no, no, my lads, here is the money, and pulled out a guinea and a half, and some silver, and Thane pulled out the same, and said, I think my half guinea looks light; Pritchard said, I think mine does too, we will have them both weighed; accordingly they went to the bar, and had them weighed; they came back, and said, they were both rather too good weight; we sat down, and Pritchard asked us if we would have any supper; we made answer, it was rather lateish, we would have a pot of beer, or so. No, says he, we will have something to eat: and he sent Thane for some pork: he brought both roast and boiled; we ate it together, and had two or three pots of beer; and about ten o'clock we went from the house, because Thane was in a hurry; he was going to lie with a girl he knew: he said, he was in a hurry, he could not stay any longer: we parted with Thane at the door.

We went to Piccadilly and lay at an inn all night; I don't know the inn.

We staid there about an hour, then Grigg went to buy a pair of shoes with the money Pritchard gave him, and Thane went with him; because he had lent him a pair of buckles, that he wanted to give to a girl: then we went to an ale-house in Holborn, and sat there a great while: Shields said, he would go and seek after Thane; he went after him, but could not find him. Shields desired us to go to the eating house, by Newgate, and said, he would bring Thane to us.

            ; they were all there before I came in: they were drinking some beer together. They were talking that they had committed a robbery at Surgeon's Hall. I said, what fools they were to talk of it there; as there were so many people about, they might be taken up directly. They were pretty much in liquor. We went out of the house, and went down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was talking of having done the robbery?</p>
               <p>Shields. Thane was the first that spoke of it. We went out and came back again into the house to have some more beer; when we came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070030"/> out of the house they went away; and Wade and I went away, and lay at a house together. We were to meet them next morning: we did accordingly meet them at a house by Temple-Bar: I don't know the sign, it is up a little court, just through the Bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Chequers?</p>
               <p>Shields. I believe that is the sign. Pritchard was there by himself; Thane came in, after we had been there a little while: we had some herrings, and some beer: and in about an hour, or an hour and half after Parker came in, and a young woman with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you all stay there till Parker came in?</p>
               <p>Shields. Yes; then we had some beefsteakes and onions for dinner, and a pot of beer, and then we went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said, while they staid there?</p>
               <p>Shields. They were talking about going for some money they had sold the plate for</p>
               <p>Q. Who were talking about that?</p>
               <p>Shields. Parker, Thane, and Pritchard: then we all five went to the Crown and Horse-shoe on Holborn-hill: we drank some beer; then they said, they were going to the place were they were to get the money: they came back, and said, they could not get it till five o'clock at night; and they desired. Wade and I to meet them at the same house, at nine o'clock. At nine o'clock the three prisoners came together: Thane went out to a cook's shop, and bought a piece of pork for supper. Before they began to eat, they disputed about two half guineas, and had them weighed; then the landlord got acquainted with Pritchard, they said, they had been neighbours together, and they had a pot of hot. Parker went away with them, but did not return to that house where they eat the supper: there was none but Thane and Pritchard came into that house; then we walked up Holborn: as we were walking along, Pritchard said, he had ventured his life with them, which one in a thousand would not have done: he said, they got in at the window; and the first thing they put their foot on, were some bottles, or glasses, he did not know which: and then he said, he went to look for the plate, and saw a pair of candlesticks, which they did not take. because he knew them to be French plate. He said; he went to the drawers where the money was kept; and got a bowl of half pence; that there was a cup they were looking for, but they could not find it; and he said that there was a kettle, or sauce-pan that had some mark upon it; they did not like to take it; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this talk?</p>
               <p>Shields. A going along from the house where we supped. We went that night as far as the Crown, in Broad St. Giles's; there I left Thane, Pritchard, and Ward, together. Parker said, he had bought a great whitish coat with a red cape, a green coat and a red scarlet waistcoat, and a hat, and buckles. He said, that at the Chequers. Pritchard said, he took a coat and some things out of pawn, and bought a pair of second-hand breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What dress did you see Parker in before this?</p>
               <p>Shields. All three of them had very ragged cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you often meet with Parker before?</p>
               <p>Shields. No, I never saw him but once or twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Thane dressed at the Chequers?</p>
               <p>Shields. He had a brown coat, and a brown waistcoat, the same he has on now, and a brown great coat over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Prichard and the other man any pistol?</p>
               <p>Shields. Yes, they had a pair of pistols; Thane bought them, and brought them into the Chequers, and they carried them along with them to St. Giles's: there they gave me the pistols to load: and I took them and carried them away: the next morning, Pritchard came to me, and gave me six or eight shillings for them again.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Pritchard say, and how did he behave, as he went up Holborn?</p>
               <p>Shields. He seemed glad, and talked about going to commit another robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he was apprehensive of being taken up, or what would become of him?</p>
               <p>Shields. I did not hear him say so.</p>
               <p>Parker. These men have been with the thief-catchers, and they have fed them up, and said, if they would not swear against me in particular - I beg your lordship will ask. Shields, whether he has not been maintained by the thief-catchers.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070031"/>Shields. No, I have been in goal ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wade. Have you been in goal?</p>
               <p>Wade. Yes, three weeks; then I was bailed out: I have been at my father's house ever since.</p>

            . The last hanging-day but one, Vince came to my house, and said, some people, that were concerned in robbing Mr. Cruttenden's house, were going to Tyburn in a coach; and mentioned the prisoners at the bar. I and Jenkens, and Jealous, went to the bottom of Wells-street, and took a coach to meet these people: when we came to the turnpike, as we stopped to pay, a coach came up, which Vince informed us was the coach; they were in that coach.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive the information?</p>
               <p>Evans. The same morning. I went to one door and opened it, and desired Mr. Jenkins to jump into the coach at the other door: we found Pritchard and Thane in the coach: Pritchard put his hand inside his coat, and took out a handkerchief; I snatched it out of his hand, and said, if I saw him put his hand there again, I would blow his brains out: then I told them, I insisted upon every man in the coach putting his hands on his knees, and the first that refused I would make a couple of eyelet holes in his body: they did put their hands on their knees, and I brought them to Justice Welch's office. I searched Pritchard, and found this pistol (producing it) upon him was loaded, and he had powder and balls; in his coat pocket I found this chissel, (producing it) he had another pistol; but by some means they handed it from one to another, and it is gone. These buckles, (producing a pair of shoe and a pair of knee buckles) I took out of Thane's shoes and knees; they are new: I was informed they were bought with part of the money received for the plate, stole from Mr. Cruttenden: there were only Pritchard and Thane in the coach. Parker was afterwards taken at the gallows, by

            . On Monday morning, the 17th of November, I received an information, by Vince, that Surgeon's Hall had been broke open; and he told me he knew something of the people concerned in it, and if we would go with him, he thought we might take them.</p>
               <p>We took a coach, about nine o'clock, and went as far as Tyburn turnpike; and when the coach, with the prisoners came up, we got in and took them. The pistol and chissel were found on Pritchard, and the buckles on Thane.</p>
               <p>Q. to Evans. What was in the handkerchief you took from Pritchard?</p>
               <p>Evans. Nothing.</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I found this knife (producing a large clasp knife) upon Thane; two or three days after I went to Surgeon's Hall, Mr. Cruttenden took me up stairs, and shewed me the drawers that was broke open. I brought the chissel with me, and by the marks made, in breaking the drawer open, I believe that is the chissel it was broke open with: it was the uppermost drawer on the right hand that was broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. Give your reason, why you suppose it to be the instrument this drawer was broke open with?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. I tried it to the marks, and it seemed to fit the marks pretty near.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cruttenden. It did not match so particularly as to be very decisive; I can have the drawer here in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you such a cup as has been spoke of?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. There is a cup, that is only used by the surgeons; Pritchard has seen it; it was only used one day in August: it is a silver cup.</p>

               <p>Pritchard. He came to Bridewell, and opened my bosom; I had only a rag of a handkerchief on; he took from me the duplicate of a handkerchief, I was obliged to pawn.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you mentioned any thing about the cup before that?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you two plated candlesticks?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. Yes, I believe they are tutenage.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever mentioned having these candlesticks, and their being left?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. No.</p>
               <p>From the Jury. Had you a saucepan, that had a mark in the inside?</p>
               <p>Cruttenden. I have; it is called an urn, it has my arms upon it, it is plated, and looks like silver.</p>
               <p>Pritchard's Defence.</p>
               <p>If I had been guilty of it, should I have mentioned it to any body I did not know? I am in the same distress now, respecting cloaths, that I was before, I had an acquaintance, that lent me thirty-five shillings, I bought some stockings and shoes, and took a shirt out of pawn: the gentleman who is the prosecutor, is the last person I should think of robbing. I never saw a gilt cup in the house; if I had had this money, I must have had more cloaths to my back, or some more property upon me. I hope you will take it into consideration, not to take an innocent person's life away, without proof. I have no witness. The prosecutor is the last person I lived with; he is the only person I had to call, the last time. I never saw

               <p>The thing laid to my charge, I am quite innocent of; I never was concerned in the robbery at all; as to the money I bought my buckles with, I had about five shillings; I tossed up, and won about a guinea and half, and borrowed a guinea and half of one Mr. Mares, in Bishopsgate-street. I have not been from my master above six weeks. I was <rs id="t17741207-36-deflabel167" type="occupation">shop-man</rs>

               <p>Parker's Defence.</p>
               <p>I know nothing at all about the affair; neither do I know the prisoners at the bar. I never saw Pritchard till I was in trouble; I never saw Thane, till I was before the Justice: the witnesses, are men of very bad characters: Vince was tried here, for robbing his master, two or three sessions ago, and I was a witness against him. I never saw Thane till we were before the Justice. Jealous came up to me and shook his fist at me, and said, he should do for me now. I have no friends in the world only God and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jealous. Was there any ill blood between you and him before?</p>
               <p>Jealous. No. I took him once, and got him to be admitted an evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that Vince gave you the information on Monday morning?</p>

The next morning, there were six missing: he traced a man in the snow, and the sheep up a lane, that leads to Wood-Green, a bye-way to London, and in a place called Tottenham-Freehold, he found three of them; after that he traced the man, and sheep up to the turnpike, and from thence quite up to Islington; and at last found two sheep, in one Mr. Hardy's, a salesman's penn, in Smithfield: they were marked DD, my own name, my man sent down to me: I came to town, and I saw the sheep in Mr. Hardy's yard: I knew them again, they had been marked on both sides before at sheep-shearing time, and the marks were not worn out.</p>

We went to Taylor's, he said, he had bought none; the prisoner said, he had, and that he had took it over the way and weighed it; and told him it weighed forty-one pound, bag and all. We asked Taylor where it was; then he said, it was gone out, but he believed he could get it presently: we insisted upon it being got, that I might see it: then the prisoner said, he took it to Brigg's lodgings, and said, he had got a prize, and did not know where to sell it, and Briggs shewed him Taylor's shop, where he might sell it; the tallow was brought to Young's house, where I was; the tallow looks like the same, the bag I am positive to.</p>

Graham brought up a candle, and I immediately secured her, and insisted she should shew me the person that had brought me into the room.

On Thursday either the 26th or 27th of October, I took up the prisoner in Hogg-Lane, with this copper (producing it) which he was offering to sale; he first of all, said it was his own, afterwards he said he had been employed by another man (who was with him at the time, and who ran away) to sell this copper.</p>
               <p>Taylor. This is my copper, the prisoner must have seen it scores of times; he used to go up at times and fetch corn out of it.</p>

            , Esq; I am Comptroller of the bye-nights; the prisoner at the bar was an officer in my department; his business was on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, in an evening, with other junior sorters, to sort the letters that come out of the country, and which were to go into the country again, and on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, it was his business to attend in the morning after they are sorted, these letters are to be carried over to the respective roads, to be dispatched that night. The letters that don't go that night, are put over to the respective roads, to go on Tuesday night; on Monday the 26th of September, the prisoner was upon duty, as usual in sorting letters; he had been ill from the 11th of April to the 18th; but from that time down to the 26th of September, he attended as a sorter of letters; a letter from Lewis in Sussex, to Lymington, might therefore probably go into his hands; there are six or seven persons in all employed in that business; a letter of Saturday the 24th of September, coming from Lewis reaches the office in town on the 26th, about eight or nine o'clock, it must come to our Office in London to go to Lymington, because there is no cross post from that place, and they set out from our office about two o'clock on Tuesday night, or Wednesday morning, and itwill arrive at Lymington in the usual course late on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any appointment in writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Balton, The mode of appointing this office is in the book; he was appointed a junior facier, upon the death of one Dixon, but after that, they gradually rise without any new appointment, and become a sorter: there is no appointment in writing after the first. I am the person that appoints them: and now we have a great many more officers than formerly we had upon the bye nights, as there are a great many more letters: we used to have not above three, now we have six or seven sorters.</p>

               <p>Court. Who is Bedford?</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolton. He was in my department, he died about three weeks ago; he poisoned himself. Bedford visited me while I was in Newgate, and promised to surrender himself up to justice, if any harm happened to me, and begged for God's sake, I would not betray him.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>- Walsh. Curiosity led me to see the prisoner in Newgate: a young fellow of the post-office came to see him; while I was with him in the tap-room, there were two or three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177412070043"/> young fellows with him from the post-office; one he called Bedford: I asked him, if he was an officer of the post-office, he told me they were in the same department as himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Walsh. In George Street.</p>

            . The prisoner came into my shop and asked to see some camlets; we differed about the price, and he did not buy any. I was at first much engaged with some customers, and afterwards removed to the back part of the shop, where the prisoner was, and then the prisoner was in the act of taking up his wrapper, which he had laid on the Compter, and was about to put it under his arm; I thought I saw something concealed under the wrapper; I jumped over the Compter, and said, what are you going to do with these things? He answered, Lord bless me, Sir, what things? I missed some sattins off the compter that I had shewn to a lady that afternoon: he said, he had nothing belonging to me; I opened his wrapper and found these sattins (producing them) in it and a coat.</p>

               <p>To the PUBLIC.</p>
               <p>THE Editor of this WORK, before it is ushered into the World, takes none of the usual methods, of awakening curiosity or biassing the judgment. To a man sincerely interested in the welfare of Society and of his country, it must be particularly agreeable to be informed of the most remote transactions, which often stamp a national character, with the ruling passion of Individuals; and the unbiassed reader will be able to judge from our performance, by what means we are become Umpires of the East. As the following sheets are not undertaken upon a malevolent principle, nor a particular enmity to any person: I flatter myself, they will not only be seasonable but usefull, more especially as they contain facts and observations equally interesting to human nature. In my impartial pursuit, therefore, I shall particularly point out by what means the distinguishing lineaments of a people famed for their moderation, benevolence, faith, honour, and humanity have been effaced, upon the Ganges, by giving too much power in an individual's hands. If force, oppression, fraud and rapine, injustice and cruelty, have been the cause of these violations? It is not to be wondered at, that the British Legislature in its great wisdom, has ordered a strict enquiry to be made into the conduct of these petty tyrants, who openly violate the laws of nature and nations for their private emoluments. A late decision in a solemn court of Judicature against a man whom wealth, connections, and power could not screen from justice amongst his Peers, is a recent example of the inflexible integrity of a great Judge, who has nobly vindicated the cause of innocence and national honour. The history of Lord Clive, may be justly termed an Epitome of the two last wars in India and of the political transactions of that country, as his system has changed the face of affairs in the Mogul Empire and still operates in the intrigues and jealousies of the people in alliance or enmity with us.</p>
               <p>It cannot be a matter of indifference to a commercial nation, to know this immense tract of country which comprehends the vast Peninsula of India, proper, superior in wealth, fertility, extent and inhabitants to most kingdoms in Europe: and how the whole trade from the Indies; to the Ganges, has been monopolized by a company of Merchants, the rivals of sovereigns in arms and arts. I am not biassed in my pursuit by party invectives, and my design is not to attack the persons and private characters of men, by mean and contemptible artifices, but to give a candid impartial detail of truths.</p>
               <p>In the execution of this design I shall endeavour to observe, order and perspicuity. If the general plan be good, and the outlines and chief figures sketched with judgment the candour of the public, its hoped, will excuse the imperfections, of a Work, which, with all its defects, may be found generally entertaining and useful.</p>
               <p>For the conveniency of the generality of Readers, this Publication is issued out in Weekly Numbers, as they will be able to purchase at an easy rate the most important occurrences of India, comprehended in one view, without the trouble and expence attending the perusal of divers voluminous performances.</p>
               <p>CONDITIONS.</p>
               <p>I. THAT this Work, shall be published in Weekly Numbers, every Saturday, price only sixpence, and will be comprized in Forty-eight Numbers, each containing three Sheets of Letter press.</p>
               <p>II. In the first Number will be ven a good likeness of Lord Clive. exceed the proposed quantity, the Publisher will give a promissory note with the first Number, if it should exceed the forty-eight Numbers, to deliver the overplus gratis.</p>
