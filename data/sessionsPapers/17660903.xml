On the 21st of August I had been backward into the yard; when I returned, I perceived the prisoner going out at the street door; I seeing both my parlour doors stood open, I missed my tea-chest; I looked out at the street door, and saw the prisoner running cross the way; I called to a man that was by her, to stop her; he did; she told him she had only been quarrelling, and he let her go; she ran down a place where was no thoroughfare; I went to her; I took my two gowns out of her apron, which she had taken from my back room; I took the tea-chest from her, with the canisters, spoons, and strainer in it. She owned to the taking the things, and swore in a very bad manner, and said she would have taken every thing she could lay her hands on, had she had time.</p>

            . I am a constable; on the 14th of August, about three in the afternoon, I saw Cockelwell and Aston in the Poultry, they had something on their shoulders with a blue coat over it; I followed them to the middle of Lombard-street; I took the flap of the coat up, and saw it was lead; I let them go a little farther, then I said where are you going to carry this lead; they said to Aldgate; I said, be sure you carry it there, for if you do not take it to the right place, I shall take you to the Compter, and shewed them my short staff; then they said they had been at work at Mr. Wicks's at Broken-wharf, and they had found it, and it would not come to a pint of beer a man. I desired them to carry it back, they seemed not to be willing; then I said, I shall carry you to the Mansion-house; I got assistance, and put them both in the Compter, and went to Mr. Wicks's the bricklayer, and told him of it; he said he would acquaint the gentleman of it where they were at work; the next morning Mr. Reynolds sent a young man (I suppose his clerk) he desired to have the lead, that he might see if it belonged to him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030007"/> I carried it, it appeared to belong to a pump on his premisses; upon our examining it the two men were taken before Sir

            , there one of them confessed that it was Church's coat they had to cover it; Sir William desired Mr. Reynolds and me to go back and bring Church; we saw him facing the Mansion-house, we took and carried him in; I believe Sir William would have admitted one an evidence, but they quarrelled; one said to the other, you did it; the other said, no, you did.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Newbery, I was planted behind the door, and saw the prisoner take three guineas and a 36 s. piece out of my master's till; then he went into the fore-shop, I immediately followed him, and told my master that was the person that had taken the money; upon which the prisoner threw down the money, and said, that was the first time he had been guilty of a thing of that sort.</p>

I went; the prisoner and sugar were delivered into my care; I carried him to a public-house, he said it was sweepings; there are nine pounds of it (produced in court) some he said was given him by a mate of a ship that lay near London-bridge; I went and haled the ship, the mate came on shore, he declared he gave no such person any sugar; I looked into the handkerchief, and found it all to be very good Barbadoes sugar.</p>

            . I live in Whitechapel; the prisoner came on one Sunday morning to the King's arms by the ditch-side, and said, will you buy a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030009"/> silver spoon? I said, let me look at it; he desired me to go into a house.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Woolf. I am a pencil maker; he pulled the silver spoon out of a hairy knapsack, and gave it into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you go into?</p>
               <p>Woolf. We went into the Hamburgh arms; I asked what he asked for it; he said either 12 or 14 shillings, I don't know which; I said, how can you ask so much; it is no: worth it; said he, give me what you please for it; I said, that is not the thing; I said, I'll wait for you here an hour or two; bring the proper owner of the spoon, and you shall have the value of it; he up with his fist and struck me on the pit of my stomach; I had the bowl of it in my left hand; he took hold of the handle to twist it out of my hand, but I kept it; I kept him and the spoon; he first of all said it was his wife's spoon; and on the Monday following, when he was before Justice Hodgson, he said he found it between Stratford and Ilford; it is a road which I often travel; I happened to be that way some time after, and asked at a public-house for any body that marked their spoons with M. W. I was directed to the Rising Sun; I went there and called for three pennyworth of brandy and water. Mrs. Winks brought it; I asked her whether she had a loss lately; she said she had lost a silver spoon; I asked her what letters were on it; she said, M. W. I said, go to the bottom of the Butcher-row, in East Smithfield, there you will hear of your spoon, at Mr. Wilford's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilford. I had this spoon of Israel Woolf on the 6th of July; (produced in court) I have had it in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Woolf. This is the same spoon.</p>

             and I are partners, we live in Panton-street; about the 6th of Aug. I had weighed a parcel of cuttings of silver for the caster, which I delivered to another person to melt over again, not having enough for the caster; I laid it by till after dinner; I thought it not proper to leave it all in the scale; I found it weighed sixty ounces: I took the weights out of the scale, as if I had not weighed it; when I came to it again, I put in about 12 ounces. When I came back the prisoner was alone in the shop; then I weighed it, and found but sixty-six ounces: I had given the prisoner a cover of a coffee-pot to solder a button upon it; I sent him down to do it; I ran up stairs, and felt in his coat pocket; not finding any thing, I looked under the board where he worked, there I found a parcel of silver cuttings, which I thought were about the same quantity as were taken out of the scale; I put them into the place again where I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030011"/> found them, and enquired about for a constable to have one at hand; I told Mr. Curry of it: I went and looked under the board again, when it was grown dark, they were gone: I let the prisoner go out; when he was gone about two or three doors from ours, I called him back; I told him there were some cuttings stole, and it was necessary to search all the workmen; the constable was not come, and during that time I imagine he slipped them out of his pocket into the sink, seeing him shuffling his right hand in his pocket; we went and found he had put them into the grinding-stone trough; I took them out; then he confessed the taking them, and said, it was the first time he had done it, and desired to be let go; I insisted on his being taken to the Round-house, while I got a search warrant to search his lodgings; in searching his lodgings the next morning, we found nine ounces; he has since owned he stole it, and owned he had stole silver before, and cast it into medals, and so disposed of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they weigh that were found in the trough of the grinding-stone?</p>
               <p>Ansell. They weighed about nine ounces.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he worked with you?</p>
               <p>Ansell. He has worked with me about five years; we found this mould in his room; (produced in court) it is for a large medal of King

The robbery was committed on the Sunday, and he was to have gone away on the Tuesday following. On that Sunday morning the servant maid came to me about seven o'clock, and told me my house had been robbed. The prisoner went through my room to his bed; it appeared he had been up that morning an hour sooner than usual, which gave us a suspicion of him. My wife was called up, and they went and searched about. I can only say the things are my property, and being before Justice Wegg, heard the prisoner confess she taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he apprehended?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cook. At my house. As soon as my wife had given me an account of what things were stolen, I went to Justice Fielding's, and gave his clerk an account of what was gone, and desired him to advertise the things. When I came back, my wife had taken the prisoner up, from such circumstances that she was clear he was the person. I did not see him till the Monday morning; he was brought by the headborough; they said he wanted to speak to me; he begged mercy; I said but little to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his words he made use of?</p>
               <p>Mr. Cook. He said he hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. I am wife to the prosecutor. When the alarm was, I got up and went and examined, and missed the things mentioned in the indictment, (naming them) some were taken out of the pantry, and some out of the scullery.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the pantry door locked over night?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. It was, but the key was in the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner then in the house?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. He was, and went about with us in the searching.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then any suspicion of him?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What gave you a suspicion.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. There was a light of the window taken out; the window was in a passage that led to the pantry. The casement was not opened; the leaden bands that go round the bars were untwisted, and a bar cut in two. I was certain it was not done on the outside; I put the light up again, and twisted the bands to try if I could untwist them on the outside, and found that impossible. There was never a pane of glass cracked.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the bands twisted close before?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. I believe they were; they were found and all whole; this confirmed my supposition; and after Mr. Cook was gone to Sir

            , I sent the prisoner out for some walnuts, to get him out of the way while we searched for the things lost. The maid and I searched several places, and in going into the stable, we found the silver candlestick and part of the china in the manger, under some hay. Then I went for a constable and other people to assist; and when the prisoner came back, I took him into the room where they were, and delivered him into their custody, and said, I believed it was he that had robbed the house: he denied it at first, but at last when he found I had found part of the things, he cried, and said he would show me where he had concealed the rest. The officer went with us; he took us to a hole in the ceiling in the brewhouse; there we found the nine tea-spoons, three tablespoons, the cream-pot, and the rest of the china; he then offered to pay for the things rather than lose his character, and confessed he did do it in the morning after he got up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was by when he confessed this?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. Before me and others; two of the witnesses are here; he owned he took the light down, and did the whole fact. There grows some flowers, and is a little edging of box, which were not broke down in the least. We asked him how long he had thought of doing it? He said, he did not think of doing it till he was up in the morning; he was carried to goal on the Monday, after that, he said I was going away, and he did it to serve me; but for that had no foundation. (The goods produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>

            . I was the first man that came into Mr. Cook's house when Mrs. Cook sent for assistance. Mrs. Cook said she had a very great suspicion of the prisoner, having found some of the things; she charged him when he came in with it; he at first denied it; a little while after he began to cry, and said he had rather pay for the things than have any more to do about it, and went and shewed us where the rest of the things were.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>It was by my mistress's order that I took the things away: she came to me one morning, and asked me if I could keep a secret; I said yes, if she desired it. She said my master was very cross to me and her, and she had a design to go away once before but did not, but she would now go away; she bid me take the plate out of the pantry, and break the bureau open, and take what money there was, and we were both to g o away together. The next Sunday morning I got up, and did not think any thing of doing it; she cut the bar herself over night; she asked me about it three times, and I was not willing. On the Sunday morning after it was done, the maid went and told my master; he went out to advertise it; then I began to be frightened, and said, I would bring the plate again at night; she said if I did, she would be revenged on me as sure as I was born; so she sent me out. I had told her where I had laid some part of it; while I was gone she sent for the constable, but I had not told her where I had laid the other parcel; she would have poisoned my master if I would have given consent to it. She gave me some poison, and desired me to beat it; she said it was to poison the rats; I beat it; she had got some boiled milk, and crumbs of bread and sugar; I asked what she did it for; she said it was for the rats, but she thought it was too good for the rats, she could freely give it my master. I said, I will have ho hand in it. I come from Buckingham, and have no body here to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any time fixed for the doing this, was it agreed upon over night?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Cook. You hear what the prisoner has been saying, what do you say to it?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. All he has been saying is false; he was so despiseable a fellow in the house, we could not bear with him; he was to go away on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Young. Mrs. Cook said she knew where the things, or part of the things were; we went there, and she said she had told Mr. Cook, that she should find them before he came back; and when we went before Mr. Wegg, Mr. and Mrs. Cook were for laying the indictment only to transport the prisoner: then Mr. Wegg desired us to go to Sir

            , as he understood it better than he; we set out, Mr. and Mrs. Cook in their post-chaise, and we and the prisoner in a little cart. When we came to the White-horse at Shepherd's-bush, Mr. and Mrs. Cook got out, and went into a parlour backwards; Mrs. Cook came to the street-door, and desired me to let the prisoner come to her; she said she had a particular question to ask him, that none could resolve but he; she said she would see he should be forth-coming to me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he tied?</p>
               <p>Young. No, he was not; I suffered him to go to her; he went into the garden with her; the headborough came to me, and said, he saw the prisoner jump over the hedge into the road; he was gone in two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Mrs. Cook behave upon that?</p>
               <p>Young. I went to her; she said she had let him go, she would not have him hanged upon any account; I said, I thought it was a very bad action; we went into the room to Mr. Cook, and told him, and he was angry that she should do so, and declared to me it was wholly unknown to him. After we had eaten our dinners at the White horse we returned home, and found he had been at home, and taken some money, a shirt, and other things; we heard no more of him till the next day; then Mr. Cook sent for me to take him into custody: he was taken, as we were informed, at Aylesbury, and brought back; then we took him before Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030014"/> Wegg, and he committed him to Newgate; this was on the Wednesday; then was the first time that he said it was by his mistress's order that he had done what he had; he had given some slight hints before, but did not tell us this till then.</p>
               <p>Q. to Coombs. Did you hear the prisoner charge this on his mistress?</p>
               <p>Coombs. He told me on the Wednesday that his mistress had ordered him to do the thing, and that they were to go away together; this was before we went to Mr. Wegg, after he was taken the second time; and he said she told him, these were not half the things he should have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go over the hedge?</p>
               <p>Coombs. I saw him when he was over, running.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it you did not pursue?</p>
               <p>Coombs. It was a thick hedge, and I went to enquire, and said, I believed Mrs. Cook had let him go. We had no warrant, and he was out of sight in a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. to Douse. Did the prisoner come back to Mr. Cook's house?</p>
               <p>J. Douse He did, and said his mistress gave him an order for me to pay him 8 s. for his wages; and if I had not the money, he said Miss was to go over the way and borrow it; he said his mistress ordered him to ask me for a ruffled shirt of his master's that was slit down the back, which was in a white basket. I let him have the 8 s. that being my own if it was lost; but the other not being my own, I refused to give it him; he went up and took it, and some odd bits of silk of little value.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the shirt rightly?</p>
               <p>J. Douse. He did; he might know of that by rummaging about; it was in a basket in his own room. I asked him how he came to come back? he said his mistress had been so kind to let him go, and he should be bound to pray for her as long as he lived; then he set off directly and went away.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Cook. It is very necessary you should explain what has come out from those witnesses.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. After we went to Mr. Wegg's, he said it would hang the prisoner: it frightened me a good deal; I was very sorry, he being a young fellow, I was sorry for his friends; and I made that excuse in order to let him get away. I did not order him to go and receive the 8 s. nor shirt; when I got him into the garden I said, John, you will surely be hanged; now make your escape, and never be seen in this part of the country: he said, God Almighty bless you, Madam; I shall be bound to pray for you as long as I live; as to the shirt, I did not know that shirt was in the room; it was in the room where he lay; after he was retaken, we examined the bundle which he had; there was a piece of silk and a piece of an old shirt our property.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Cook. You see your compassion has thrown a great cloud over this affair: this man's life is at stake; I must ask you a few questions. Did you, directly or indirectly, give him any order or encouragement to take away these things?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. Not the least in the world; I knew no more of it than your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut the bar?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, before you sent him out for the walnuts, tell you where he had put any of the things?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever threaten to be revenged on him?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. No, I never did; he did not suspect that I had found the things; for he said afterwards, if he had thought I suspected him, he would never have come back again, when I sent him for the walnu's.</p>
               <p>Coombs. I said, after he had owned it, it was a wonder you did not make off, and not comeback; his answer was, Who would have thought of any such thing, that Mrs. Cook should have got them there to take him; he had no suspicion of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cook. The prisoner used to have the key of the stable, and I telling my wife of that before I went out, made my wife suspect the things might be in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to this? you have heard what has been said.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cook. I am satisfied, thoroughly satisfied, there is not a word of truth in all this; I am certain her design in letting the prisoner get away, was real mercy and compassion in her; I know we had not had any word in quarrelling all the time the prisoner was with me, we lived on good terms. I cannot say but I was angry at her letting the prisoner get away.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cook. Mr. Cook said, when I came in out of the garden, You have saved a thief from the gallows, and he will cut your throat.</p>

In the morning he was taken before Justice Kynaston in the Strand; as I was going to take the oath, he made a spring away down the street, he ran very well; he was pursued, and taken coming up towards Covent garden; he was brought back to the Justice's; the Justice said, now you have done for yourself, this is a confirmation of your guilt. The prisoner said, as soon as I get my liberty I'll be revenged of you all, and particularly the constable.</p>

               <p>Court. Here are three persons of some credit, by their appearance, every one whom have acted quite wrong; I wish there was more caution used in carrying on the trade. If a person puts a few clean cloaths on, they can easily impose on these persons: you will oblige the legislator to put an end to your trade, in not using more caution; such do more mischief to society, than the thieves themselves do: it certainly is their duty to stop the goods, where there is any suspicion.</p>

               <p>I never saw the gentleman in my life; I was coming down Holbourn betwixt six and seven on Monday morning, a gentleman met me, a well dressed man; he asked me to drink a glass of wine with him; I refused it; he asked me a second time; we went to the Two Blue Posts in Holbourn, he called for a pint of wine; he asked me to go home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030018"/> with me; I told him I could not take him home at that time of the morning, it was too early; he said he had not cash enough about him, but said, I have got my watch, if you will be so good as to take my watch and pawn it, I'll make you satisfaction; leave it for three or four guineas; I said, I do not think they will take it of me; he said, I'll go with you to the door: I went to a gentleman in Holbourn, he would not take it of me; I came out and told him; then we went to the other gentleman; he would not take it of me; I went and told the gentleman, he went in and pledged it, I never saw him since: I never saw the snuff-box.</p>

I am under beadle of the ward; about 20 minutes after three on the 1st of August, three men came up to the place where we had a centry stood; I heard a noise; Macdaniel called to me to come to him; I went to him; Merryjohn had thrown down the sugar; I ordered a watchman to take it up, and I laid hold of Merryjohn to carry him to the watch-house; one ran quite off, the other attempted to run but was soon taken, and we took them to the watch-house.</p>

I was drinking in a public-house on Salt-petre bank on the 15th of August, about eight or nine o'clock, and drank three or four pots of beer with some of my shipmates; this was at the sign of the Black-boy. The prisoner came into the house, and forced herself into company without being asked: she asked me to go home to her lodgings with her. I did: she asked me to go to bed with her; we agreed, and went to bed together. After we had been to bed some time, she hawled my breeches from under my head softly, and in her getting up, I catched fast hold of her hand and said, where are you going; she gave me a very rude answer: another woman came up stairs; they went both down together; I found my breeches were gone; I went to the head of the stairs and called for a light; they brought up one; I found my breeches in the middle of the bed, and my money was gone; four guineas and a half and some silver.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been in bed?</p>
               <p>Gifford. About an hour and a half; I went in pursuit of her, and found her at the sign of the King of Prussia, and desired some people there to assist me in taking her up; they did: I found her in company with two soldiers. When she went to bed with me, the woman wanted money of her; she turned her pocket, and had no more than twopence halfpenny about her; and she paid the reckoning for treating the two soldiers, which came to 8 s. and 9 d. she was carried to the watch-house. The constable searched her, but no money was found upon her; she abused me very much going along; she took all the money I had in the world from me.</p>

I knew he was a terrible fellow; I was obliged to go to bed with him whether I would or not. I had not been long in bed before a woman came, and said a person wanted me; when I returned, he was disputing with a woman; I went to hear what it was about; the woman ran away, and he vowed revenge against me.</p>

            . On the 15th of July I went to see one Mr. Jackson, in Curzon-street, May-fair; after I had been there about an hour, I was sitting in a window, and Mr. Maloye came by; a person with me called him Maloye; I said, what is it that Maloye that belonged to the Irish Carabineers in Germany? the gentleman said yes. I said I should be glad to speak with him, I had not seen him for four years, since the peace was made. He came in, we shook hands, he sat down; I was glad to see him; we had a shilling's worth of rum and water; after that we might have two or three or more. He being going my way home, we agreed to go together; coming down Half-moon-street, Piccadilly, he asked me if I would go and drink a glass of wine with him at <placeName id="t17660903-37-crimeloc200">the White-horse cellar, Piccadilly</placeName>

Lee! why you are drunk; said I, I am not very sober; I believe; said he, will you have a post-chaise and go home? I said no, but I must have something. I believe I got up from my chair, and put my hand to my pocket, and found my watch was gone. I said, Maloye, I have lost my watch. Lost your watch! No, Sir, said he; said I, I have, and since I came into this room; and out of the room you shall not go, before I know what is become of it; upon that he rose up immediately, and wanted to go out of the room; I went to the door and said he should not, for if the watch was fifty degrees under ground I would know what was become of it: then he was for fighting me, and wanted to go out; I still persisted he should not go out; thus we continued a good while; then a constable was sent for: when he came, he asked me if I charged the man with any thing; I said with stealing my watch; I said I had it when I went into the room, and I had lost it since, and nobody has been here but him. The constable said to him, have you got the gentleman's watch; he said no, and out he pulled his own, and said, I have no other watch but this. A coach was sent for, and we went in it to Sir J. Fielding; the constable, the landlord of the house, and I believe another man went with us. When we came there, I related the whole story as now. The Justice asked if he had been searched: I said, not to my knowledge; he ordered the constable to search him, and he took my watch out of the prisoner's right hand coat pocket; the glass was broke, and the minute hand off; I had told the prisoner I would give him six guineas for it, if he would deliver it to me, before the constable came, but he would not. The Justice asked him how he could think of robbing his friend; his answer was, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030024"/> took it in point of honour. The Justice said, it was a very odd sort of a point of honour.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been often in the prisoner's company before?</p>

               <p>Lee. I had been about three times in his company in Germany; I looked upon him to be a very polite and a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you not very fuddled?</p>
               <p>Lee. I was so sober as to know what I was doing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your watch out at Mr. Jackson's?</p>
               <p>Lee. I had, and the prisoner took it out of my hand there, and said, your's is a very pretty watch, and I looked at his watch-chain, I had none to mine; I asked him what he gave for his; he said 18 d. I said I should be glad of such a one; then we put our watches in our pockets again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him your watch to get a chain to it?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, I did not; I would not have parted with it for ten times the value of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober when you took out your watch?</p>
               <p>Lee. I was, we had not drank a shilling's worth of liquor at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it after you came out of Mr. Jackson's house?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to sleep?</p>
               <p>Lee. I did; he gave me a knock on my shoulder, and gave me a jostle; and if I may be allowed to speak plain, I believe he took my watch at that time; I will not pretend to say it was so. While I was in a confusion with him, there came a fellow and gave me a knock on the side of my head, and knocked me down, and the prisoner got out, and got into another room, and the constable followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Lee. I believe he was not quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come in the room while you were together drinking?</p>
               <p>Lee. No, none but the waiter.</p>

            . I am constable. I was sent for on this occasion on the 15th of July; when I came there, there were a great number of people on the outside and in the inside the house; Mr. Lee was in the kitchen; he said, are you a constable? I said, I am; he said he had been robbed of his watch; he pointed to the prisoner, who sat upon a chair with his elbow upon the table, seemingly asleep. I went to him, and asked him if he had the gentleman's watch; he said no. I said, you must go before a magistrate and clear this thing up; a coach was called for; there was a great concourse of people; he was unwilling to go in at first; when we got there, Mr. Lee was examined; Sir John asked whether the prisoner had been searched; somebody said no; I was ordered to search him, and in his right hand coat pocket I found this watch: (produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember it was asked him how he came to rob his friend?</p>
               <p>Trouton. I do; he said something that he did it out of a point of honour.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the White-horse cellar; I remember the prosecutor and prisoner coming to our house; they both appeared to be in liquor at coming in; they called for a bottle of wine, I carried it in; after that another; they drank pretty freely; Mr. Lee was drowsy; he laid his arm down upon the table and went to sleep; he turned sick and cast his stomach: Mr. Maloye said he would have a post chaise; I went and ordered it, he got into it: the ostler said, Sir, please to pay for the chaise now, it is customary so to do; he refused it, so the ostler did not chuse to let him have the chaise; then he came out, and the chaise went back; when he came into the room, Mr. Lee was still drowsy; Mr. Maloye had his cane in his hand; he struck him gently, and said, Lee, get up. Mr. Lee stood up and looked about him, and said, I'll have something to go home in. I said, Sir, we have never a chaise at home: said he, I will have a post-chaise, and if you will not go for one I will; he would have one if it cost him a guinea a mile; he went out to see for one; he spoke to the post-boy; the boy said there was none at home; Mr. Lee put his hand to his pocket in the street and said, by G - d I have lost my watch, to the post-boy; he came directly into the room and said, I charge Maloye with stealing my watch; he rang the bell and went into the room, and charged Maloye with taking it, and said he should not go out of the room till he had it; Mr. Maloye denied having it: I wanted to go out upon business:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030025"/> I went out, but he still kept Maloye; there was a scuffle between them; Maloye was rather the weakest; my mistress was sent for into the room; Maloye said to her, Madam, will you let Mr. Lee lie down upon a bed, he is very sick; Maloye lodged one night in the house, he was to have laid there a fortnight; she said he might lie down where he had laid, but she would not have her beds spoiled so.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Maloye order the chaise to?</p>
               <p>Billing. To Twickenham, he lived servant with my Lord Kerry: my mistress seeing this scuffle, desired the company to get Maloye from Mr. Lee, and he was brought into the kitchen, and put into a chair; Mr. Lee said to him, Maloye, give me my watch, for you have it, and I will have it; give it me, I'll give you five or six guineas if you are distressed: Maloye denied having it, and pulled out his own watch, and said it was all he had; Mr. Lee said that was not his watch. The constable was charged with Maloye, and they went before Sir

               <p>Thomas Street. I have known the prisoner about two years and four months; he lived with my Lord Kerry, I believe he was his footman; I never heard any thing bad of him before; I always looked upon him to be a well-behaved man. I was coming by the White-horse inn, and saw him and Mr. Lee sitting together, with about half a bottle of wine. Maloye said he had met with an acquaintance that he had known in Germany; they were very joyous together; I recommended Maloye to go to bed, that he might be clear of liquor; he insisted on my drinking a glass. Mr. Lee got hold of me, and desired I would sit down, saying he would make much of any friend of Maloye's.</p>

             one Sunday morning. I stripped her, and had some water ready to wash her: she was not willing to pull her shift off, her excuse was that it was cold. I said she had not been half washed all the week; I took and stripped her shift over her head, and saw it was in a deplorable condition; it stood alone with nastiness, green, blue, yellow, and all colours. I said, my dear, you have not got botches or biles about you. She said, no, nurse, I all nothing. Mr. Walker rang the bell, he was impatient to have the child down; I dressed her, and let her go down, and flung her cloaths carelessly into the closet. Mrs. Walker was ill in the room in bed, and insensible of any thing then; I was her nurse to attend her; I could not help looking at the shift: I said to Mrs. Walker, are you awake; she said, I am. I said, here is such a shift of Phillis's, that I never saw the like, and shewed it her. After that, Mrs. Walker's sister-in-law came, named Askew; I told her all about it; I told her, I nursed a gentlewoman in Wells's-Row that had the foul disease, and this appears like it. She said she would go and tell her brother; she went down directly; he sent the child up, and followed her; I laid her down on the bed and looked at her; I never saw such a sight in my life; her womb was open as wide as mine, who have had nine children. I then thought she had been abused by a man; there was a deal of nastiness like thick milk and cream, that ran quite down to her ancles. I shewed Mr. Walker her shift; (he is a very passionate man) he said, O you b - h, you are poxed! Hussey, who has meddled with you. Nobody indeed, said she: he said, I insist upon knowing. She said, nobody indeed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030026"/> again. I kept her above stairs; he came up again after dinner, she still stood it out that nobody had meddled with her; he asked her how she got it; she said she got it that day she bought some cherries, when he kicked her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he beat her then?</p>
               <p>S. Arey. No, he did not, I took her from him; she kept it to herself all day, and lived all that day upon nothing but bread and water; she had lived upon nothing but bread and water before for almost a month, only I gave her something some-times by stealth; she had done something that she should not have done; she had given a shilling away one day, and three shillings another day. On the next morning, which was on a Monday. Mr. Bull the apothecary came, he attended my mistress; Mr. Walker acquainted him with it; he came up stairs and said, Phillis, what is the matter with you; she said, nothing, Sir. Mr. Bull said, bring her down, is there no privater room than this. Then I carried her down into the club-room, and laid her down on her back on the bed, and took up her cloaths; he looked at her and said, O my God! she is poxed! who has meddled with you, child? Nobody, said she; he said, don't tell me so, for I know somebody has as well as if I was between you both; he could not persuade her to tell: he said to me. Nurse, do not you know surgeon Pott? I will speak to the beadle of the hospital, and he is a severe man, I will have her cut to pieces; (this was to affright her, to make her tell;) he went down, and clapped the door too as if he was angry; the child was still obstinate; then the child and I went up to dinner; then I said, tell me, for you hear what he says, you will be cut to pieces; then she said it was Ned, (I only knew the prisoner by that name Ned;) I said, do not say so, I do not believe you; she said, yes indeed it was; I said, you mean Jem; (that is one James, another waiter, that was then bad) she said, no, indeed, it was Ned; I said, where was it; she said, in the cellar; I said, how came you to go into the cellar; she said her uncle (meaning Mr. Walker) sent her into the cellar to draw a pint of beer for Mr. Griffiths, and Ned was there, stirring the beer with a stick, and he came and put his hands under her cloaths, and put his finger into her private parts, and took her up and carried into the other cellar, which goes a great way under ground, where she might have been killed, and we not heard; that he put what he had in her, and hurt her terribly, and he could not get it in the first time; and he put his hand upon her mouth, and told her, if she told any body she would be killed and hanged. I said, did he meddle with you any more; she said, yes, nurse, two times more; once she said she was going to carry her uncle's wig into the club-room, and he was putting up the press-bed; that he took her up and laid her on the bed, and stopped her mouth that she could not cry; then he hurted her terribly, and when it was in a good way then it was easier to her after; and told her the same again, that if she told any body, her uncle would kill her, and she would be hanged; and yet all the time he used to be more angry with the girl than any body else. I asked her when was the next time; she said, on the free masons day (there is a club of free masons at the house) she said her uncle sent her up, and the prisoner was cleaning the glasses; that he took her up and flung her on the bed, and did the same again, and she felt it very warm within her, but it did not hurt her so much then as it had done before; and then he told her as he had before. I asked her what she felt warm within her; she said she did not know; at last she told me it was his cock; I went down immediately and told them below; then Mr. Bull, Mr. Walker, and others came up; then I went down and heard no more. As he was coming down stairs to go before the magistrate, I said to the prisoner, O Ned! how could you do this affair; he said, O nurse! the devil was in me, and I was devoid of my senses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the magistrate?</p>
               <p>S. Arey. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing?</p>
               <p>S. Arey. He talked a deal of nonsense, and said he should be glad to be heard. When I came down stairs from Mr. Bull and Mr. Walker, the prisoner said, nurse, what, is there any thing the matter with my mistress; I said, no, but something is the matter with Phillis, and you will hear presently; he looked as white as death.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Walker use to kick the child?</p>
               <p>S. Arey. He used to kick her backside; he never kicked her over that part.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What time did this girl tell you the manner that I did this action, was it the day that I was taken into custody, I mean the transaction in the cellar?</p>
               <p>S. Arey. This was directly after Mr. Bull went down from examining her on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child kept in her business for that month, you say she lived on bread and water?</p>
               <p>S. Arey. No, her uncle would not let her come near the bar; she used to be in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Who kept the bar at that time?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030027"/>S. Arey. It was kept by several, Betty and others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the girl say in common that her uncle had kicked her?</p>
               <p>S. Arey. She always said her uncle had kicked her, till she said it was done by Ned.</p>

             I am an apothecary, and live at Islington; I attended Mrs. Walker; I called there on the 23d of June, and was asked to examine the child, there was something the matter with her that they could not find out; she had informed them it was a kick; the nurse let me see the shift; I said it was something worse, which I was very sorry to see; I said I should be very glad to examine her; I did, and said I apprehended it was the venereal disease, and a very bad one; I examined the part and the linen, and said, I was very sure it proceeded from no kick; I asked her how she came to be so, who had meddled with her; she would not tell; I then threatened her, and mentioned Mr. Pott at the hospital, and said she should go there, and called for ink and paper, pretending to write a note that she should go under his care, and be cut and slashed as he thought proper; she still insisted no body had meddled with her; but at last she said she would tell the truth, if I would be favourable to her; I said I would; she said, one of the waiters, mentioning a name, had been concerned with her: upon which, the prisoner was called up; when he came first into the room, he looked a good deal confounded. I said to Mr. Walker, I am afraid this man is guilty of what the girl accuses him with; he looked at me, and said he was not; I said, my friend, your countenance betrays you; what makes you look so white; his answer was, I really am not guilty.</p>

               <p>Bull. She said the man had been concerned with her, mentioning the name Brophy; upon which I asked her where; she said in the cellar; she told me the day, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention the day of the month?</p>
               <p>Bull. No, she mentioned the day of the week; upon her acknowledging that, I asked her why she made use of no means in order to alarm any of the family; she said, she was prevented by the man putting his hand to her mouth. She acknowledged he had been concerned with her two times after the first time, up stairs, on the bed in the club-room. When the prisoner came up, I asked him if he knew any thing of that girl being injured; he denied it; this he did twice over, when I told him his countenance betrayed him; I said, you had better tell the truth, for it lies in my power to be a friend to you; he did not then acknowledge it; then I was advised to take him into another room, and examine if he was foul. I did, and plainly saw he was not a sound man, he had the venereal disease upon him. I then desired him to tell the truth, as it was in my power to be of service to him, and said I wou'd do all in my power. He told me he had had that disease upon him in the month of August was twelve months: I asked him if he ever applied for relief to any apothecary; he said he never did; he said he had a circumstance to tell me, that was, about nine days before he was concerned with the girl, there was a person that wanted to lie with a person that was at his master's house; (I believe a lodger) he wanted to have to do with her himself; he pulled her by the gown, and told her he believed the man was not a sound man; and upon that he himself was concerned with her, and a little after that he found a running; and about a week or nine days after, he owned he was concerned with the girl Phillis. I asked him how often he was concerned with the girl; he said he was concerned with her once; I said, have you been concerned with her no more; he said no, he had not; I said, the girl tells me you have been concerned with her three times. I asked the girl very particular questions, if she was hurt, and found any great pain the first time; she said she did; I asked her if she was hurt the second time; she said she was hurt a good deal, but not so bad as the first; and the last time no pain at all, or very little.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion now, as to the disorder the child had?</p>
               <p>Bull. I am now of opinion, that the child's disorder was venereal, and not proceeding from a kick; it is my opinion she had been laid with by a man; I gave her some physic, just to keep the disorder from getting a head; she was sent to St. Bartholomew's hospital, under the care of Mr. Pott.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words you made use of before the prisoner confessed?</p>
               <p>Bull. I told him it was in my power to be of service to him, and I would do him all the service in my power.</p>

               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I had the foul disease, or whether it was a gleet or running?</p>
               <p>Bull. I asked him how long he had had it; he said, since August was twelve months, and he never had applied to any person whatsoever to get redress.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether an apothecary may not be deceived, and not know a strain from the foul disease?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030028"/>Bull. I think there can be no infection given to another person from a strain.</p>
               <p>Court. The question is of a different tendency: the question is, whether a strain would not occasion the same appearance at first sight as the venereal disease?</p>
               <p>Bull. I think not, this strain was quite of a different colour: the running that I found upon his linen had a quite different appearance to me than that of a strain, both upon his linen and the girl's.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not tell me it was the only means of saving my life to own it?</p>
               <p>Bull. No, I said it might be in my power to be of service to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. When did the girl tell you the thing?</p>
               <p>Bull. She told me it the very day you was taken before Mr. Alderman Peers.</p>

               <p>P. Holmes. The first time was, I went down into the cellar to draw a pint of twopenny for Mr. Griffiths; Ned, the man that stands there, followed me down; he put his hands up my cloaths, and carried me to the farthest part of the cellar, and stopped my mouth, and pulled out what he had, and put it into my private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever do so again?</p>
               <p>P. Holmes. The next time I went into the cellar for a quart of beer for two carpenters, and he did the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever do so after that?</p>
               <p>P. Holmes. Yes, he did so in the club-room.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's examination before Mr. Alderman Crosby and Mr. Alderman Peers; the second examination before Mr. Alderman Crosby was very extraordinary: (this was in Mr. Walker's house) I desired Mr. Bull to search if the prisoner was foul; he said he was foul: then the prisoner confessed the fact, and kneeled down on his knees, and said to Mr. Walker, what service will my life be to you. Mr. Alderman Crosby asked him if he had been concerned with the child once, twice, or three times; he answered three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of concern?</p>
               <p>Harding. I imagine by lying with her; he was examined about that fact; he was examined first by Mr. Alderman Peers, and twice after that by Mr. Alderman Crosby; he asked the child how her breath was stopped; she said, by the prisoner's finger.</p>
               <p>Samuel Hall. I was present when the prisoner acknowledged the fact in his master's room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Daniel. I heard the prisoner confess at the same time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bullock produced a copy of the register of the birth of the child, which she brought up out of the conntry, but as she could not read, could not say it was a true copy, any farther than hear say; she deposed she put down the day of its birth in her Common Prayer book, which was July 20, 1756.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walker. I left this woman in the year 1756, in the country, she was then about six months gone with child: since I have been in London, I have had it more in my power to do for the child; I sent for it up to keep it as my own, as I thought it my duty so to do. I was by when Mr. Alderman Crosby examined the prisoner; there was but little said the first time, by reason we had not got the age of the child: then I wrote into the country for a copy of the register. On the second examination<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030029"/> the prisoner equivocated, and said he should be glad to hear his first examination; then he did not deny the thing, he confessed he had had in some measure to do with the child; but as I am the prosecutor, I did not think I should be examined as an evidence; I came by the knowledge of it, by the nurse bringing the shift down to me in the bar, and said, O Lord, Sir, Phillis is ruined! she has either been concerned with a man, or you have given her some blow, her shift is as bad as if she had had the foul disease seven years; I was convinced upon seeing it, she had had to do with a man.</p>

No, he was not; he said he could not tell the name of the man, but it was facing the Leather Breeches; I went there and saw Mr. Ashby, and said, my master desires to speak with you; after we came from the Mansion-house, we got a search warrant and went to Ashby's house, there the buckram, pocketting, and glazed linen were delivered to us, twelve yards of it; there I saw Mr. and Mrs. Ashby.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He said nothing, his wife spoke for him.</p>

               <p>Johnson. She had been at our house while we were gone to the Mansion-house; she said she spoke to her Billy about it, and desired my master to be as favourable as he could about it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030031"/> she told my master they had it of Rushton, and that Rushton told them he came out of Holbourn; we asked Rushton how often he had been at Ashby's he said he had been there five times; the woman owned she saw him there twice; I was before Sir

            , when Ashby and Rushton were there; Rushton there owned to his being at Ashby's house five times; Ashby said he never saw him but about three times, and that he bought of him the three times for 8 s. and 2 s. and 5 s. 6 d.

               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Ashby?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He is a piece-broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been sent to buy of piece-brokers for your master?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you bought of them?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I have bought pieces of cloth for seating of breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did Rushton say he sold these pieces?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He said Mr. Ashby was shutting up shop, and he went in and pulled them out of his pockets, and I think no honest person will buy of such a one that brought them so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you Mrs. Ashby bought the things, and that he was busy at the time with his birds?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No, he said Mrs. Ashby measured the pieces, and she came and asked what she must give; and he said, m y dear, you must give 8 d. a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Ashby say, he thought Rushton came honestly by them?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He did; he said he thought the lad came honestly by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Ashby insist upon it he bought them in his shop.</p>
               <p>Johnson. He did; he said he came one night with some things, and said he was going into the country, and was willing to dispose of them, that was the first time; Ashby said that was the usual price, but he did not give to the rate of that, but I do not think it is usual to sell remnants of buckram to piece-brokers.</p>
               <p>Eldrington Wood. I live in Poor-jury-lane; I was at the examination of the two prisoners; the boy made an open confession before the Alderman of the goods that he had sold to Ashby; he said he had sold 11 yards in the whole, that is, buckram, pocketting, and glazed linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say where he had them from?</p>
               <p>Wood. He owned he took them from Mr. Dobbins's house, and other quantities at separate times, and had sold them to Mr. Ashby for 22 shillings, and that he had been there in the whole 5 times; and that Mr. Ashby told him the last time, there were 12 yards odd measure, and said if he had any more of these things to come to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Ashby say to it?</p>
               <p>Wood. He denied it, and said Rushton had been there but three times; he owned he bought the buckram, pocketting, and glazed linen the night before, which was the 13th of August; I went there with the search warrant; the goods were taken down from a shelf by Mrs. Ashby, and delivered to us; she said, gentlemen, never such a thing happened before, here are the goods that I bought of the young man, and said her husband was shutting up the shutters, and she called to him to know what she must give for them, he said 8 d. a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Wood. I am Mr. Dobbins's foreman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see buckram disposed of to piece-brokers?</p>
               <p>Wood. No, never in my life, not in remnants; they buy it in the piece, and sell it out as it is wanted; Ashby said he asked Rushton where he came from, and he answered he lived in Holbourn, and had a little trade of his own, and he bought the things for his own use; but being a little distressed for want of money, he having some things to send into the country, was obliged to dispose of these, but he denied his ever desiring him to bring more when he had it.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never bought of piece-brokers?</p>
               <p>Wood. I have bought remnants of cloth to seat breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing of a suspicion he had that they were not honestly come by?</p>
               <p>Wood. He said, after the prisoner was gone the last time, he had a suspicion they were not honestly come by, after he came to look at them; and that if ever he came there again, he would stop him.</p>

            . About three weeks ago I was at the Compter; I was acquainted with Mr. Ashby some time; I asked him concerning the nature of buying these goods; he told me he had seen the boy once before he bought the quantity he was taken up for.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you understand the piece-broking business?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030032"/>Hazard. I do very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the court what you think a piece-broker can fairly and honestly afford to give for these goods?</p>
               <p>Hazard. ( He takes the goods in his hand) I believe upon my oath, no man, in justice to the trade, could give more than what he has done, that is, 8 d. a yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he always insist upon it, that he bought them not knowing them to have been stolen?</p>
               <p>Hazard. He always did.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for master taylors to buy of piece-brokers?</p>
               <p>Hazard. I believe there is not one master taylor in London but what buy of piece-brokers; they are under a necessity of buying of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Mr. Ashby?</p>
               <p>Hazard. I have known him about 11 years; I have had dealings with him several times, and believe there is not an honester man under the canopy of heaven than he is, I am sure of it.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Hazard. I was brought up a woollen-draper and salesman, and was afterwards in the stop business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in pieces and remnants of buckram?</p>
               <p>Hazard. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it an uncommon thing for master taylors to sell remnants of buckram?</p>

            . I am a master taylor: I cannot buy such buckram (holding it in his hand) so cheap by 3 d. a yard now, nor no man in the trade; it is not usual for piece-brokers to buy such pieces, except they are stolen, that is fact; neither is it usual for taylors to sell pieces of buckram; the prime cost of this buckram was 10, or 11, or 11 d. halfpenny per yard at the best hand, by the piece; I never bought it so cheap in my life as this, though I have bought 40 pieces at a time, when it was cheaper than it is now: the piece-broker's trade is a very iniquitous trade, we have groaned under it for more than 100 years: some journeymen, whatever they can save, they will run away to the piece-brokers with it, even if it will fetch no more than a halfpenny-worth of snuff; I declare upon oath, I never sold or bought little pieces of buckram in my life.</p>

When he brought it, I asked him where he lived; he said in Gray's-inn-lane; I mentioned that to Sir John, and I was told he was taken at the Queen's-head, very near Gray's-inn-lane.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>This watch I bought of a man at the Castle in Castle-yard, Holbourn, on Sunday evening between six and seven o'clock, the 6th of July; he said he was an ostler, and his father or mother was sick, and he was going down into the country, and must dispose of it for want of money; there was an acquaintance of mine in the room, he looked at it, and asked what the man asked for it; he said three guineas and an half; I had two guineas and an half of my own, and a guinea I borrowed of a friend; he wanting his guinea, I pawned it on the Monday morning for two guineas, in order to pay him again; I have my father's maid here, to prove I was in bed in my own house, I keep a house at the back of Baldwin's-gardens.</p>

I am his mother's servant, she lives in Church-entry, Harp alley, by Fleet-ditch; I carried a bundle of linen to his house on Sunday the sixth of July, at near eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in bed; I waited for his going with me; he went with me to his father's betwixt one and two, so that I saw him that day from eleven o'clock till after one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Burch. What day was the prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Burch. He was taken up the 9th of July.</p>
               <p>Q. to Green. When did you hear of his being taken up?</p>
               <p>M. Green. I heard of his being taken up on the Thursday; I saw his mother in great grief before, and she would not tell me what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sent for to Justice Girdler's?</p>
               <p>M. Green. I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Justice that you saw him in bed the Sunday before at eleven o'clock?</p>

               <p>Q. Was you ever at his house?</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you lived with the prisoner's mother?</p>
               <p>M. Green. About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did you go to the prisoner's house?</p>

               <p>M. Green. We washed the prisoner's cloaths, by reason the washerwoman was taken sick.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a married man?</p>

               <p>Court. Now you can answer these two or three last questions, the jury cannot but take notice of your behaviour on some former questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner dine that Sunday at his father's?</p>
               <p>M. Green. He did; I don't know but he drank tea, for I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me again whether you know Justice Girdler?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - I cannot say whether I rightly know the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do, or do you not know him?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - I can't say I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever sent for to go to him?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - His mother did not send for me till she could not help it.</p>

               <p>M. Green. I never did. - I went before a parcel of gentlemen, but I don't know whether it was Justice Girdler.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>M. Green. - It was on Thursday.</p>

I am a writer to Mr. Parkinson, for attornies; I was in company with the prisoner that Sunday evening, I believe it was between seven and eight o'clock; I met him in Holbourn, and we went to drink together at the Castle in Castle-yard; we had been some time in the house, and there came in a young-fellow and sat down in the same box; after some time, he told us he had spent some money that he ought not to have done; he shewed me a letter, he was going to his father in the country, his father was sick; he shewed us a watch, and Mr. Angess looked at it, the young man offered it to sell; Mr. Angess asked him what the watch cost him; he said it cost five guineas, but he would sell it for four: Mr. Angess bid him three and a half; he put his hand in his pocket, and had but two guineas and a half; he asked me to lend him a guinea; I said I could, but I should want it again; I lent it him: he said there was some money owing him, and he would pay me the guinea on the Monday morning. I called upon him on the Monday morning, I believe about seven or eight o'clock; he was then in bed; he told me to call in about a couple of hours, and he would let me have the guinea; I called again about nine, or between nine and ten, and he gave me the guinea; he said he had pawned the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. What name did he pawn it in?</p>
               <p>Burch. He pawned it in the name of

               <p>Q. Was you before Justice Girdler when the prisoner was there?</p>
               <p>Burch. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say there?</p>
               <p>Burch. He denied his ever pledging the watch to me; he denied knowing any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing mentioned there about his being at the Castle?</p>
               <p>Burch. No, not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any mention made about his being in bed on the Sunday at eleven o'clock, or at his father's at the time the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Burch. No, nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor mention his being robbed of this watch in St. James's Park there, in the hearing of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Burch. He did the same as he has now.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the prisoner heard the charge?</p>
               <p>Burch. He did, and gave no answer to it. The Justice asked him what he had to say for himself; he strictly denied pawning the watch, or knowing any thing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Was he sober when he brought the watch to you?</p>
               <p>Burch. He was very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ross. Was you at Justice Girdler's?</p>
               <p>Ross. I was; the prosecutor told the same to Justice Girdler as he has here; the prisoner denied knowing any thing of the watch, he said nothing about being at the Castle, or being a bed, or at his father's, at the time of the robbery.</p>

               <p>Parkinson. He does.</p>

               <p>Parkinson. I have known him going on two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in your service about the 6th of July last?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was he in a situation in life to lend a sum of money?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. I have no reason to believe he was; he might have money other ways for what I know; I allowed him a shilling a day, or four or five shillings on a Saturday night; that was a dead time of the year, when he was not in full employ; of ten or a dozen men, some I pay weekly, those that were economists; those that were not, had their money by the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you use to pay Mr. Murry?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. He used to spend his money; it struck me in that light to allow him his by the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any knowledge of his connections?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. I am totally unacquainted with his connections.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any substantial relations or friends?</p>
               <p>Parkinson. I can't recollect ever hearing him say he has any.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Dartmouth-street; I saw the prisoner coming with a basket full of linen, on Thursday the 21st of August, between one and two in the morning; he had a handkerchief in his hand, I believe it was this (producing a silk handkerchief.)</p>
               <p>M. Tisdale. This is my handkerchief; this was missing with the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Pugh. When the prisoner came up to me, he said, good-morrow to you, watchman; do you know such a place as Stretton-ground, Westminster; I said, very well; said he, do you know Justice Manley; I said, very well, he said he should be much obliged to me if I would direct him his way, for that linen he had got belonged to him, and the laundress was in trouble, and she employed him to carry the linen home. I said, you are heavy loaded; I said, it is a strange thing, as you are a soldier, you do not know Westminster better; said he, I am a young soldier, and affected a country dialct; I had a suspicion of him, but thought I could not secure both him and the goods, so I directed him by the Broadway, and I went the other, intending to get another watchman to assist me: I hastened down Dartmouth-street, and asked a watchman, named Gregory, if he saw such a man go by; he said he did, and he asked the way to Stretton-ground; I said, let us go as far as Justice Manley's; he could not go, so I went by myself, but the prisoner was housed before I got there. I came back, and in an hour's time who should come by but the prisoner; he said, a good-morrow to you, watchman, I found it out very well; did you see Justice Manley, said I; no, said he, I did not, but I took a little watchman to go along with me that was at the chapel; I knew that to be a lye, for that watchman went part of the way in pursuit of him; then I was determined to take him; I said I would take a walk along with him to my brother watchman's stand, and get a bit of tobacco, for it was cold; he said he would give me part of a pint of beer if any house was open; I said I know a house open, meaning the watch-house; we went on, and just by my comrade's watch-box I seized him, and said, you are my prisoner; he went directly on his knees, and said, pray let me go; the other watchman took hold of him, and we carried him to the watch-house; then he said, here is a shilling for you to let me go, that will do you more service than to take me up, and forced it into my hand; I said I should keep him; then he said he would have his shilling again; I said so he should, but I should make use of it as evidence against him first; he made two struggles to get from us; they did not care to take charge of him at the watch-house, because I did not bring the goods as well as the prisoner; I said, there is a handkerchief in his pocket; he took it out and threw it on the table, and confessed the things were stolen, but said they were not stolen by him, but by another person; the next morning he was carried before a magistrate, and committed to the Gatehouse.</p>

               <p>On the Wednesday night I was drinking at the Black-horse between twelve and one; coming by Somerset-house, I met Goldsbury and another accomplice, they were pretty much in a fluster; he said to me, where are you going: I said, home to bed; said he, I will give you a shilling if you will take these things up to my house; said I, how did you come by them; said he, they are things my wife had to do something to; they were covered over: I took them up, with a handkerchief full of things, and carried them to his house; he was at home before me; I asked for a shirt of my washerwoman; she let me have one of her own, and bid me wear it till I came again; I never was in such a hobble in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a pistol?</p>
               <p>D. Bourne. I did not, it sounded like a fowling-piece or a pistol; I ordered the maid to get me some tea, I was afraid I should have had a fit; my husband observing me to shake terribly, said he was afraid I was very bad; immediately I saw a fire flounce by me; I was greatly affrighted; it was eight weeks before I was capable of doing any thing after this; there were marks on the wall within-side; the very house-shook on this second firing; I was carried out of the room very bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to believe any of these discharges were intended to hurt you?</p>
               <p>D. Bourne. Yes, I have, from his always saying he would be revenged of me, and he would be the ruin of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to fire his pistol before that time?</p>
               <p>D. Bourne. I never heard the report of a pistol there before that; he only came out of his door, and put out his pistol; it is right to my window.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he reach your window with his hand?</p>
               <p>D. Bourne. He could not, was he to stand upon a stool.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see you in the room from his yard?</p>
               <p>D. Bourne. He could, from one part of it; my husband said to him, on his first firing, Mr. Murrey, you have murdered my wife, and upon your peril fire another if you dare; he let off several after that, but I cannot say how many.</p>

This might be about four in the afternoon; I found my mistress was sadly affrighted; she ordered me to put the tea-kettle on; I was on the stairs, when another firing went off; she took a cup, and then in came another firing like that; she flew from her chair, and fell down, and screamed out, and went into a fit; I held her, and she bit at me like a mad dog; I was not myself for several days after this; this was on the Friday, and on the Saturday I saw little marks like shot-holes in the room over-right the window; I saw a pistol in the prisoner's hand after the second firing; as soon as my mistress was coming to her senses, my master went out, and said, pray, Mr. Murrey, do not fire, for my wife is sadly affrighted.</p>
               <p>Q. How many firings did you hear?</p>
               <p>M. Waley. I heard five in all; I was sent into the club-room to see where the firing came from; I saw him point in at the window; I spoke to him; he said he would blow my brains out; he fired all but one into the kitchen, the other he fired at me; and when he saw my mistress in fits, he stood and made game at her.</p>

            . On the 4th of June I came into the lane to buy goods to carry into the country; Mr. Murrey came up to me with a small pistol in his hand, this was betwixt one and two o'clock; he pronounced many bad words; he went away, and came again in about a quarter of an hour, and said, he had been and bought a pound of powder and half a pound of shot, and I will go now and execute the b - h. In less than a minute I heard the report of a pistol go off; presently after that another; then I heard the most dismal shrieks I ever heard in my life; to the best of my knowledge I heard three of four firings.</p>

            ; after the prisoner had fired two or three times, I said he had taken my wife's life away, he had no occasion to fire any more; I was drinking tea with her up one pair of stairs; he fired at the window; I said, forbear, pray; I cannot say where I was when I heard the first firing; my window was open; I saw him one of the times pull out the pistol, and point it towards my window, and my wife was about a yard from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see who was in the room?</p>
               <p>J. Bourne. No, I believe he could not; when he fired it that time, my wife fell back; after I had desired him not to fire no more, and told him what he had done in affrighting my wife, he fired again, as my wife was screaming and crying; the smoak and fire, and whatever there was, came into the room.</p>

            . I live in the passage going out of Butcherhall-lane into Little Britain. On the 27th of June in the morning, I went up into my shop and missed several tools; some time afterwards there was an advertisement of these tools being at a broker's shop in St. Giles's; I went and found them to be my property; the broker said he knew the person of whom he bought them; we went before Justice Welch, and he granted a warrant to take up the prisoner: I never saw the prisoner before he was taken.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in St. Giles's; I also keep a pawnbroker's shop; the prisoner came to my house the Thursday before the 27th of June; he asked me if I would buy some carpenters tools; I said I would, if I could get any thing by them; (I am a bricklayer by trade) he said his wife was dead, and his uncle had sent for him into the country; he brought two bags full, and six saws, on the 27th, (three saws produced in court) these are three of them; he asked 11 s. for four, I did not chuse to buy them; he went out of the shop, and left his bag in the shop; he told me he could sell them for more money than I would give for them, where he worked; he went out; I followed him unknown to him in the street; I attacked him by Berkley square, and said, I am afraid you do not come honestly by these things; he took me to his own father in Mount-street; his father said the saws were the prisoner's own; I said, I'll take the four saws and go to the shop you mentioned in Tyburn-road, and if they know any thing of them, I'll buy them; he was to follow me, but I could find no such carpenter's shop there, as he had mentioned to me; then I went to Justice Welch, and had the things advertised, and on the Monday morning Mr. Duck came and owned them; here is his name upon them; after that, the prisoner was taken in Smithfield by the description I gave of him; I believe there is a gang of them: (the other tools produced and deposed to by the respective owners.)</p>

            . I was coming from my work that night down Holbourn-hill; I met the prosecutor, the prisoner was by his side; I saw his hand in the prosecutor's pocket; I passed by them, and upon hearing him call out, good man give me my handkerchief, I turned round, and they were collaring each other; there was another man with the prisoner; they dropped a blue and white spotted one; I took it up and gave it to the Black, (that is the prosecutor) he would not own it; I saw the prisoner's companion going over the way, I did not go after him.</p>

No, I never did; they came to me at Esquire Walker's, where my wife is now, to make it up, and I said I would not make it up, till I know what footing I was upon; I have attended here these four days, and his friends almost tore me to pieces in the Sessions-house yard; I was forced to confine myself in the alehouse.</p>

On the 20th of July the prisoner asked me to lend him a pair of silver buckles; he had come with his master to lodge in the house but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030043"/> on the Friday, and it was the Sunday after he wanted to borrow my buckles; I was busy below, and could not get up stairs for my buckles, which were in a box, so I gave him the key to go and fetch them, and about two o'clock I missed a crown piece out of the box; I did not tell any body of it till he came home, which was about nine; I called him into his master's room, and said, George, did you take a crown piece out of the box; no, said he; I said, if you have done it out of a joke, let me know and I will not tell any body; he said he did not take it; I said, if you will not tell, I'll let your master know; he said, so I might: on the Monday morning I told one of our men, and he told my master of it; my master called the prisoner into a room and asked him after it; he still denied it, till within about a quarter of an hour before his master came in, which was at half an hour after eleven; then he told my master he had taken it, and begged forgiveness; he said he had changed it at the other end of the town, and he would go and fetch it back: on the Tuesday about one o'clock, he asked me to get my master to lend him 5 s. to fetch it back; my master said if he wanted any money, to come and ask for it himself; he went and asked my master, and he lent him 5 s. he went out to fetch my crown piece, and did not come home again till the Thursday after; then he came and staid at the Mansion-house; a man stood there with him, and another man came with a letter to my master; the letter he said came from his mistress, for some shirts and things that were at our house; my master said, nothing shall go out of the house till the prisoner came himself; he did not come; a woman that washes for us saw him, she directed me; I went, and saw him and another man standing by the corner of the Mansion-house; he seeing me, ran away. On the Tuesday he sent a letter by two boys again; one of them said, we had better tell where he is; my master sent for a constable, and kept the biggest in the house, while the other went with the constable to St. Paul's Church-yard; they brought him to the Compter; he confessed to the taking my money, and he was taken the next day before Mr. Alderman Alsop, before whom he confessed the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gaul. The prosecutor is my servant. On the Monday one of my men said, he did not like this black boy, the prisoner; for that Davidson had missed a crown piece out of his box, and he was crying; I asked him the reason of it; he said he had lost a crown piece, and he was afraid of acquainting me with it; he said it was left him at his mother's death, and all she could leave him, and he had a particular regard for it; then I called down the black boy from his master's room; my boy challenged him with taking it; the Black said, do you talk so to me, how dare you; I said, if you have done it in a joke, return it; he answered, he had it not, and he that took it ought to be hanged; he was to learn to dress his master's hair of me, but he was very negligent; he stood it out till was it pretty late; I threatened to send him to the Compter; then he said, Mr. Gaul, I did take it, and changed it at Hyde-park-corner, and if you will forgive me, and not tell my master, I'll get it back tomorrow; the next morning he asked his master for some money, his master happened to have no change; then he asked my boy to ask me to lend him a crown to get it again; then he came himself; I said I could not trust him; he said, if I would believe him, as he was a Christian, I will bring the crown piece back; I lent him 5 s. he went away, and I did not see him for a week or nine days after; he kept sending false letters for me to deliver up his cloaths; after he found his master was gone to Scotland, he sent two boys; I threatened to send for a constable, then they told where he was; we took him in St. Paul's Churchyard; he was taken before Mr. Alderman Alsop, there he confessed the fact, and I was bound over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On a Sunday morning I asked the boy to lend me his buckles; he gave me the key; I took the buckles that lay in one corner; I never moved any thing; I brought him down the key and went out, and when I came home at night, he challenged me with a crown piece; he told his master, and his master told me of it; I said I knew nothing of it; his master said he would confine me; he charged the watch with me, and put me in bodily fear.</p>

In about a fortnight after, that young man met him in Newgate-street, and brought him to me; I said, you are the young man that have got my mug; he said I am he, and for God's sake have mercy on me. I asked him what he did for his living; he said he was a barber, and he had been out of business, and poverty had induced him to do the thing. I asked him where my mug was; if you'll let me have my mug, I'll make it as easy as I can; he told me he had sold it to Mr. Popard in Smock-alley; I said I would go there and hear what he said; I went there, and said to Mr. Popard, was there not such a sort of a young man came and sold you a silver mug: he said he did not know, he might for what he knew; I told him I had the man in hold; that he had changed a bad one for it at-my house; I desired him to let me have my mug, and I would make it as easy as I could; he said his shop was his market, and he did not know but that he had bought it; he seemed to give himself no trouble about it: then I came back, and told the prisoner what he said; in the mean time the prisoner's mother went to Mr. Popard, but she came away as she went: the prisoner was committed to the Compter; the mother promised she would send the mug, which she did by the prisoner's brother-in-law, I was in bed when it came; (two mugs produced in court, one silver, the other French plate, both of one pattern; she takes up that of French plate) this is the mug the prisoner left at my house, as to the other, it may be that which was taken away of mine; but if it is, the name is taken out.</p>

            . I was leaning over a kit of salmon, being desired to give an eye to these for the prosecutor, I saw the prisoner take one of his kits and walk round the corner with it to Dark-house-lane; he went down the lane as far as the Green Man; then he turned back again, and went down Thames-street with it; I went and took hold of him, near the stationer's shop; I brought the kit back to its place, and took him before a magistrate, and he was committed.</p>

Some little time after my wife told me she saw him put a pair of silk stockings in his pocket; I asked him if he had not some of my stockings in his pocket; he denied having any: I searched, and found two pair of silk stockings upon him, (produced in court.) Here is my private mark upon one pair, and I am sure to the other; he said he hoped I would forgive him; he then confessed he had stole several other pair, some silk, some worsted.

I live with Mr. Miles, I lost a petticoat and two linen aprons; one of the aprons and petticoat were found at the pawnbroker's, (produced in court and deposed to;) the prisoner told me she had sent them there. I lost them some time in May last, and found them the 12th of August; we lost many things five months ago; the prisoner owned she had taken a good many things, but could not tell the number of them; the other things belong to people that are out of their minds under my master's care.</p>

            ; then Mr. Marsden, the clerk, told me there was a prosecutor for them, who had been to have them advertised; (the plate produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Some of these things I have had a great while, they are all my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>On Friday the 18th in the morning, I was going to Whitechapel to see my father and mother in Three-un alley; I met with a man, who said he had some old silver to dispose of; I said I knew a young fellow a Jew, I would ask him if he knew any body that would buy it; I went and spoke to him, and he went and got this Markas Garrick; he told him to go to a public-house; then Alexander came and said Garrick was at the top of the street, and he desired me to take the plate, because Garrick would not buy it of any body but me; I never had it about me till that minute; it was delivered to me in the open street; then Garrick took me to a public-house and hand-cuffed me; Garrick and Alexander came to me when I was in the Gatehouse, and said, for 3 or 4 l. they would get the bill thrown out.</p>
               <p>Garrick. I went into the Gatehouse to a Jew that was there; when I was talking to the Jew, the prisoner came and said, when you have done with him, I should be glad to speak with you. Then I went to him; he took me into a little room, and said, it will be a discredit to my parents, and to throw my money away on counsel is doing nothing, it will be better to put it in your pocket to get the bill thrown out; I did say yes, fearing I should have a knife run through me; he mentioned three, four, or six guineas, and said, I have got a brother can advance it; but I never went near him since.</p>

               <p>E. Clark. I could, my window is up one pair of stairs; they had a light in the room, and their windows are all broke to pieces; I stood there till four in the morning; it is as wicked a house as any in the kingdom; the prisoner had been away from that woman five or six weeks; he had come home that night, and she would not let him come in but beat him away; she desired the watchman to get the prosecutor out of the house. Man, get up, said the watchman, and go about your business; you may be very proud you go off with your cloaths, what have you lost, the man said he had lost his watch; with great persuasions he got him up to go along with him, and they went away to the sign of the Swan about four o'clock.</p>

            . I live in New Gravel-lane; I have known the prisoner two years, I never knew him to do any harm in my life; he works to bring bread home to his family.</p>
               <p>Q. What family has he?</p>
               <p>M. Parnell. He has got a wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What a young woman?</p>
               <p>M. Parnell. No, an elderly woman; I never saw any harm either-by one or the other; he is a very honest man, I have known him to be called up by the watchman, to go to work on board a ship when my husband was called up.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you hear him called up in Parrot-alley, when your husband was called up in New Gravel-lane?</p>
               <p>M. Parnell. No, I could not; but I did live next door to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a house does he keep?</p>
               <p>M. Parnell. Sometimes she will have sixpence for a bed for a man and his wife, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you may know some of these wives, do you not?</p>
               <p>M. Parnell. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. How many husbands have you known any one of them to have?</p>
               <p>M. Parnell. I don't know nothing about that indeed.</p>

I am waterman to that ship; Mr. Wordie sent me to the Horse-shoe and Magpie, to enquire if any skins were there; I went and asked the landlady for a candle, and told her I had information there were some skins there, concealed in the cellar; she went down with me; I looked round and found the bag; I untied it, and sold 17 skins; it was a biscuit bag; I carried it on board the ship; Gargrave said nothing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Yes, I do, he went by the name of Old Bob; he lived on the back of Black-friars church; I sold him the 6 gold rings and 3 silver table spoons, he gave me 35 s. for them; I think he gave us 6 d.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030052"/> more, but am not certain, out of which I spent 1 s. he gets his bread by buying stolen goods; Griffiths and Emery went with me; I have seen him many a time at the Globe on Saffron-hill, buying stolen handkerchiefs; when he was taken up he popped a handkerchief into my hand, which he was going to buy of a young fellow. The prisoner's wife keeps a little chandler's shop; I sold the things in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I told him how I had miss'd them; he asked me where; I said, in Cow-cross.</p>
               <p>Q. to Emery. Did you hear this discourse between them?</p>
               <p>Emery. The prisoner gave me a bottle to fetch half a pint of rum, this discourse might be then, for I did not hear it.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of five guineas being offered for the taking of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Carrol. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that you sold the things to?</p>
               <p>Carrol. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you upon the trial of Murphy to mention nothing of Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Carrol. The prisoner went by the name of Old Bob, and I mentioned Old Bob.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to mention Griffiths and Emery being with you?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Because I was not asked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply to Emery to come now?</p>
               <p>Carrol. Justice Girdler ordered him to come.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What were the things worth?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The spoons were worth about 32 s. 6 d. as to the gold rings, some of them weighed 28 or 29 shillings, they were very large old fashioned rings; I found one gold ring on the prisoner's wife's finger, which I believe to be one of the six.</p>

On Thursday last, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into our house and called for three pennyworth of brandy and water, which I served her with; there was a child's silver spoon in it; my husband came in soon after; I gave him a caution that the liquor was not paid for, but I said nothing of the spoon; after I had been above stairs about an hour, I recollected the spoon; I went down; the prisoner had paid for the liquor, but was not gone; I asked her for the spoon; she said she knew nothing of it; she said, I brought it into the room, but did not know who took it away; I was very cautious of accusing her with it; after some time I went and argued with her, and told her what would be the consequence if I found it upon her; she threatened me in case I searched her and did not find it; I sent for a constable; she was taken to the Compter, and a man searched her as far as decency, but could not find it. The next witness can give you a further account.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Dorrington. This is the spoon I lost; the prisoner said she did not value being transported, she seemed desirous to go abroad.</p>

               <p>Briant Borough. I am one of Mr. Akerman's servants at Newgate; the prisoner called at our lodge one day last week, either on the Wednesday or Thursday evening; she said to me, I beg your pardon, I want to ask you a question; I said, I'll resolve you if I can; she called for a pint of wine, then she asked me how she could be transported, she wanted to be transported; I laughed at her, thinking she came to make game; after I had drank a glass with her she called me aside, and said, I'll tell you the reason of it; I have a husband that is to be transported from Maidstone, and I want to know how I can go along with him: I told her if she had any money, she had better go and contract; she said she insisted upon going if she knew how, and wanted to know how she could; I believe somebody, out of a joke said, if you step over to the goldsmith's shop, you may soon know the way to be transported.</p>

On the 6th of June, the Friday following, the prisoner sent me the key again in the forenoon by his boy; I was not very well, having been in a terrible fright from what had passed; my husband came in at dinner; I said, I thought I could eat some gooseberries; when he was gone to his business, I went and bought some; when I came back, the prisoner stood in the shop, the passage door stood open: he then acknowledged his fault, and said he was sorry for what he had done on the Wednesday, and followed me down into the kitchen, I thought he would not then behave rudely; I had the gooseberries in my apron; he came and clapped his hand upon my knee, and began to be exceeding rude; I sat in a chair; he could not get his will on me there, but there was a large chair in the kitchen, which he took and put in the corner of the kitchen, from the window; he took and put me in the chair; he wanted me to go up stairs to a bed, but I said I would not; when in the chair he put down his breeches, and wanted to put his private parts in me; he put his tongue into my mouth, his breath was exceedingly nauseous; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030054"/> struggled with him as long as I had strength; he kept his tongue in my mouth that I could not cry out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever get his tongue beyond your teeth?</p>

            . I am a surgeon; I was sent for to attend Mrs. Worsley, but do not recollect the day of the month; she complained of a pain in her back and the bottom of her belly, and private parts; the woman where she did lodge had acquainted me the cause of her illness was from the ill treatment she had received from a man who had ravished her, and Mrs. Worsley told me the same; and as she told me she thought she was with child, I thought proper to call in a man midwife; we consulted together, and prescribed for her.</p>

            . I live at Newport Pagnel in the county of Bucks, I have known the prisoner from about a week old; I know his father, and all the family; his father is a dealer in lace, the prisoner was brought up in the lace way; he was with his father all his life time, only when at the boarding school; he came to town about his father's business; he comes once a fortnight. I have known him trusted with two thousand pounds worth of lace at a time. I am in the lace trade.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual in your way to carry arms?</p>
               <p>Payter. It is; I never go a journey without arms, when I am making up money in my circuit, sometimes one pistol, sometimes two; there are very few in the lace business but what carry arms, because our stock lies in a little compass, and is very valuable.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner's character?</p>
               <p>Payter. He is a very sober steady lad, I never heard one misbehaviour of him before this in all my life; this was not for the want of money; he might have had 500 l. had he asked it; I would let him have 500 l. had I it, upon his own note; he was in great business and had great credit; he did not stand in need of thirty-six score such pieces; I heard of this at St. Alban's, and came to town but last night.</p>

            . I keep the Bear and Ragged-staff in Smithfield; I have known the prisoner between two and three years, he is a lace-man; his father and he deal very largely; he did business for his father, latterly he has done it for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a man of property?</p>
               <p>Worlings. His father is for what I heard, a man that can have money upon his own credit at any time. I would have lent the prisoner any thing that was in my power upon his own note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sharpling. I am a clockmaker, and live in Duck-lane; I have been acquainted with the prisoner about two or three years; last Thursday was with him between four and five o'clock, he was very much in liquor, this was at the Bear and Ragged staff; I was looking over the newspaper, he insisted on my drinking a glass of wine with him; I said, you had better go and lie down; he said to me you shall drink a glass, and then you and I will go and take a ride for six or seven miles.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his circumstances?</p>
               <p>Sharpling. Yes, his father is in good circumstances; I never heard of the prisoner's being short of money; had he wanted 20 l. at any time I would let him have it; I never heard the least blemish of his character in my life.</p>

            ; I do business in White-friars and in Milford lane; on the 27th of March the prisoner came to me, and said he was recommended to me to serve him with coals; I asked him who recommended him, because I would gladly know my friends; he made some hesitation, and at last could not tell me: he told me he had some business in the Strand, and said he would call again in an hour; he did not return: the next day he called upon me again; he desired me to go to his house, and see his situation; he told me he was going to sell coals: I went with him to his house the corner of Stone-cutter-street, Shoe-lane; he shewed me the lower part of the house, he asked me if it would do for a shop; I told him I thought it would do very well; he shewed me down in his cellar, where he thought to lay in a quantity of coals: then he took me up stairs to see his dining-room, which was very elegantly furnished with all new furniture, and stocked with a great many different tradesmen's goods besides; it was a kind of warehouse; then he took me up into the garret; he said he was a watchmaker, and was going to set five or six men to work; it being a corner house, and had a very good light, I thought it was quite suitably adapted to the purpose; there was a room empty, he said he was going to lett that to a single gentleman; he said he had been at a very great expence in furnishing this house, that he had paid ready money for all, and particularly he mentioned he had paid upwards of 40 l. to Mr. Faulkner, a broker, at the corner of Harp-alley, Shoe-lane, for part of the goods in that room; the whole to be sure came to a great many forty pounds: he pretended to show me the bills and receipts by taking out his pocket-book, but could not find them, pretending they were in his drawer in his desk; nevertheless he said he should soon he possessed of some money, by a bill that he was to receive. Some more conversation passed, then we came down stairs; then he asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176609030058"/> the prices of coals; I told him; he said he did not want some immediately to come home, but he wanted some to go out, and gave me orders to send them; accordingly I took his order where to send them out, and they were sent by my people, and he had some home to his house in two or three days after; he agreed to pay ready money for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you should have trusted him, if he had not assured you he had paid upwards of 40 l. to Mr. Faulkner for part of the furniture?</p>
               <p>Turtle. No, I should not a single penny, if I had not seen the situation of his house, and what expence he had been at; I know Mr. Faulkner to be a very industrious man, and one that is careful in his way of dealing, this gave me a good opinion of the prisoner's substance; he mentioned no other person's name but Mr. Faulkner's, but he mentioned the buying divers other goods. The 40 l. was the principal object that I took under consideration.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing no mention had been made of having had goods and paid for them to Mr. Faulkner, should you have trusted him?</p>
               <p>Turtle. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the goods worth you saw in the house?</p>
               <p>Turtle. I suppose they were worth 150 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the circumstance of paying Mr. Faulkner weighed more than all the rest? Can you so far depend upon what would have been your conduct from this representation, as you had seen this 150 l. worth of goods, should you have trusted him? *</p>
               <p>* The principal false pretence laid in the indictment was for obtaining money by pretending he had bought goods to the amount of 40 l. and upwards, of Mr.

            , &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Turtle. It struck me at once, as I knew Mr. Faulkner was a very honest and a very cautious man, and one that could not afford to trust for a large quantity of goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing a name had been made use of which you did not know the person, but you had still seen all the goods in the house, would you have trusted him?</p>
               <p>Turtle. No, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. What satisfaction was that to you, that they were bought of Mr. Faulkner or any other man?</p>
               <p>Turtle. He lived but a little way from the prisoner, therefore I thought he must know the abilities of the man. A few days after I enquired after the prisoner, and he was not at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find him at home?</p>
               <p>Turtle. Never but once; I saw his wife, as they called her.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you go to his house?</p>
               <p>Turtle. I went about three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever receive any money?</p>
               <p>Turtle. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he continue in the house after he had the coals in?</p>
               <p>Turtle. About ten or twelve days he and all the goods were entirely gone, within fourteen days after he had the coals of me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see him afterwards?</p>
               <p>Turtle. The first time I had the pleasure of seeing him afterwards, was at the bar, when he was tried for the felony in stealing the man's cloaths and money; he made large pretensions to me when he came to me, that he should be a very good customer.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>The latter end of March last, I took a house at the corner of Stone-cutter-street, Shoe-lane; I went to Mr. Faulkner by the recommendation of a gentleman that went with me; Mr. Faulkner desired I would come and look out such goods as I wanted; after he sent them in, he came and brought his bill in a day or two, and desired I would help him to half the money. I told him I had not any money, but if he would stay a week I would help him to the whole; then I went to Mess. Phipps and Turtle, Phipps I never saw but once before. I told Turtle I had taken a coal shed at the corner of Stone-cutter-street; I asked him if it was worth his while to serve me; we had a gill of wine at a house of call; I said I never dealt in this way before, put me in the best way you can; he said he would: I told him I had some in the house that were the man's that kept it before; I told him I believed I should deal very largely; he said, so much the better: I asked him if he would be pleased to send me any in, he said yes; then he asked me who I would have them sent to: I desired him to send 28 sacks to one place, 12 to Mr. Coventry, the gentleman that recommended me to Mr. Turtle, and a chaldron to a barber on Saffron-hill, and others, to the amount of 136 sacks; this was on the 29th or 30th of March; but upon the 10th of April, coming down the street, I met Mess. Phipps and Turtle; they asked me how I did; said I, shall we go to breakfast together; we went to a coffee-house in Fleet-street, there we breakfasted together; said Mr. Turtle, I have brought you my bill, saying, his custom is 60 days credit; I said, you shall have your money every month.</p>
               <p>Turtle. No such thing was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I have not any money, but on the morrow I believe I shall be ready for you; he said, do you want any more coals; I said, yes, you may send five chaldron to Mr. Myers, a colour-maker in Golden-lane, and five chaldron to the Duke's-head facing the pound, Islington: this was on the Thursday or Friday. I went down to Norwich to receive some money, and while I was gone, Mess. Phipps and Turtle took a writ out against me; they found they could not arrest me, as I was gone into the country, then they indicted me for a fraud; when I came back, there was my house shut up, my shop shut up, my coals taken away by Mr. Turtle's servant, and the goods I bought of Mr. Faulkner taken away; I had been in the house not above ten days; the creditors stripped me of every thing, I had not a shilling left; they broke my dining-room door, and took out my bureau and a little nest of drawers, money and papers, all went; they sent me my nest of drawers back, two coats, and a pair of breeches; they shut my doors up, and gave the key to my landlord; I have been very cruelly used; I have no other evidence but Mr. Phipp's bill and Mr. Faulkner's bill.</p>
