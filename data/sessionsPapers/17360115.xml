There were Nutmegs, Tea, Sugar, Cloves, Mace, Chocolate, Starch, Blue, Fig-blue, Powder-blue: The Bundle was as thick as a little Child: As for the Quantities, I can say nothing of them.</p>

            . The Prisoner gave me the Bundle of Things; I took them, not thinking any Thing of their being stoln. I knew where she lived, but was so silly, that I asked her no Questions about them. I did say afterwards how did you come by these Things? and she told me - some at one Time, and some at another, but she never owned to me, they were Mr. Cromwell's Goods.</p>

               <p>Thomas Grant. I had just received 3 Shirts, 4 Stocks, and two Night-caps, ty'd up in a Linnen Handkerchief, as this Man came begging to the Door. They lay at a little Distance from the Door on the Counter; I was engaged in Business with my Back to the Linnen, and the Man was advanced almost within the Door: I was busy, and not very watchful. I told the Prisoner there was nothing for him, but I was mistaken as it happen'd. He went away; about 4 or 5 Minutes afterwards, I mist it, but thought the Servants might have taken it away. Upon enquiry, I found it was gone, and imagined that this Man must take it. On the Monday following he came again, and I seized him with one of the Shirts on his Back, which he resign'd, and then asked me to forgive him.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner own'd his taking the Goods, and said by way of Excuse, that he wanted a Shirt, therefore he took them: That he was in Liquor and had forgot the Door, else he would not have came there again, and that he gave this Shirt back to the Prosecutor with a very good Will, and in a very good natur'd Manner. <rs id="t17360115-3-verdict17" type="verdictDescription">

I can't say which of the two laid them down, but White pretended most Claim to them. Collard said nothing about them. I asked the Reason of the Marks being taken out? and I think it was White that said there was only 3 Letters upon them, but I cannot be positive. I said I would stop them, and I think it was White said, she would send the right Owner for them: The Prisoners were taken in Moor-lane.</p>

               <p>White. I was just come from Market, when I heard Collard's Husband wanted to speak with me. I went to him, and he told me he had a Friend's Spoons and Forks to borrow Money upon; I asked him what he came to me for, I did not know what to do with them; I won't pretend to borrow any thing upon them, till I know the Value of them. Nan, says he to his Wife, go along with her, and see what they are worth: She was not willing to go, but he threatned to kick her if she did not; so we went to this Gentlemans in Barbican, and desired to have them valued, because there was Money to be lent upon them: He was not at home, but his Wife was. Very well Dame says she, taking up the Things, and carrying them into the Kitchen backwards. Madam, says Nan, won't you please to weigh 'em? She told us, she wanted a two Ounce Weight, and we must stay 'till her Husband came, for she had sent for him: When he came, they went into the Kitchen and talked together; and when they came out, she told me they must stop the Things, and bid us go home and fetch the Man we had them of.

               <p>Richard Baker, Senr. We have a Ware-house which belongs to me and my Son; we make Lines and Twine in that Place, and these Iron Crows, we stick into the Ground to fasten our Lines to. All I have to say is, on the 23d. of last Month at Night, or the 24th. in the Morning, I know not which, we were robb'd. The Iron Crows I can swear to, the Lines I cannot, tho' I believe I might swear to them. I could have been very willing the Grand Jury should have found the Bill against the Persons where we took the Goods. We miss'd our Goods the next Morning, but could not find them, 'till some Days afterwards.</p>

I knocked my Mother up, and staid half an Hour with her; then I went in the back Yard, dug a Hole, and buried one Bottom of Line in the Yard; the other Bottom, in single Lines as I could spare Time.</p>

Whom we believed to be concerned, and we agreed to have a Penn'orth of Gin together, whereof we turned up to Bigg's again, and there we desired Biggs to stop the Man that brought those Lines; he said he had no Business with it, the Man that brought them should have them. I left one of my Mates there, while I stept down to Justice Philips; and while I was there, word was brought down that the Man that brought the Lines was in Bigg's Shop; he (Charnock) was brought down, and there he told us, the Bolts we should find at Webb's, a Smith's, against Spittle-fields Church, and that some of the Lines were at his Mother's; we went, but the Hole in the Yard was dug up, and the Lines were gone; whereof we searching farther found a Ball of Line buried at their Vault-door, and the Line was my Master's; we found Part of the Hemp in the Cellar, and the best had been spun up.</p>

I taxed her with it, and she denied it: So I troubled my Head no more about it; 'till I accidentally heard Mrs. Bowen had got it. I went to her House, and she shewed me the Handkerchief: I told her it was mine; she said she had it 12 Years, and I must prove it to be mine. or I should suffer for it. I got a Warrant for her, and Jordan, and Bowen produced a different Handkerchief, from what I saw first. Jordan own'd she took it, and sold it Bowen, for 2s. 6d. in exchange for a Gown, and was to give her 1s. 8d. in Money.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you miss it while Jordan liv'd with you?</p>
               <p>Sparkes. Yes, and charg'd her with it.</p>
               <p>Council. How long was it, from the time you lost it, to the time you saw it again?</p>
               <p>Sparkes. I saw it no more, 'till the Morning I took out the Warrant for them.</p>
               <p>Mary Barret: I went with Mrs. Sparkes, to enquire about her Handkerchief: Mrs. Bowen shewed her the right, at first; but when we went again, she produced another. Jordan owned, she was to give Bowen the Handkerchief, and 1 s. 6 d. for a Gown.</p>

I went on, and he followed me, and struck at me with a Club; I turned and got hold of the Club, but he wrenched it out of my Hands, and struck me twice; then I tumbled down; he asked me what Wig I had got: I told him it cost me 18d. tho' the Wig cost me 3l. He took it, and said he must strip me; then he hit me down again, and stripped me naked; he left me nothing on, but my Stockings and Garters, and I had 3 Fields to go over in this Condition. I got to the House I was going to and gave an Account of my being robbed. I met no one but an Oyster-man, who sprung with Surprize from me: I can swear to the Prisoner, because I walked over some Fields with him. He had my Breeches on when he was before the Justice, they were Grey Breeches, and had been seated; my Knee Buckels were in them, they were two odd Mettal Buckels, they are here in Court, and are the same he took from me. I was robbed on Thursday, and on the Tuesday following he was taken, and carried before Justice Farmer. I had this Pipe-picker in my Breeches Pocket, this we found in the Breeches upon him, and it is the same that I lost with my Breeches; the Things have been in the Custody of the Constable ever since.</p>

On New-Year's-Day at Night he went out; he had on when he went out a new pair of Trowsers, which he rolled up about his Knees, and tied up with a piece of Rope; he had a Handkerchief about his Neck, which he took off, and tied about his Wast pretty tight; then he lifted up his Hat, and tucked his Hair under it. As he was going out, I said, Tom, where are you going? he answer'd, G - d D - n his Blood, this very Night either to win the Saddle, or lose it. He came in again about 9 o'Clock, with a new Hat, a white Wig, a Bird's-Ey'd Handkerchief about his Neck; a white Coat with open Sleeves, a black flowered Wast-Coat, a pair of Grey Breeches, with Knee Buckels in them. I took Notice enough of the Breeches and Knee Buckels to swear to them again: (Then they were produced.) Yes, I will swear to these Breeches, and to these Buckels; he had a pair of new Shoes, and a white Shirt, pieced in the fore Flap. when he came in he sat down by the Fire, and Tom, says I, where did you get these Cloaths?

There were two Men talking at Torkington's Door, and as I turned the Corner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173601150009"/> I saw one of them run to the other Corner to get there before me. When I came to the Posts, the Prisoner asked me the Way to White-Chappel: I am a Stranger, says he, so I put him in the readiest Way. I want to go to Ragg-Fair, says he: I told him I was going that Way. As we went on, he told me he came from Portsmouth, and had been at Stepney: He kept a little behind me, and, on a sudden, gave me two Blows with his Stick; the second Blow brought me down; then holding his Stick a cross my Head, he demanded my Money. I told him, I was a poor labouring Fellow, and had none. I had two Silver Buckles in my Pocket, and thought to have dropped them; but he laid hold of them, and took 8 d. from me in Money. Then he bid me get up, and I saw two of them; they pulled off my Cloth Coat, with a Boot sleeve, and my Waistcoat: the other Man said to the Prisoner, let us leave him his Waistcoat; but he cried, D - n me, I should not have it, and made me pull off my Breeches. then he bid me pull off my Shirt. I told him it was good for nothing; but they insisted on having it, and my Shoes too, or they would shoot me thro' the Head. I begged they would not leave me naked, and they gave me a Knock or two over the Shoulders, and said, If I offered to run after them, they would turn again, and shoot me thro' the Head; so I went back to my Mother's. I can swear to the Prisoner, for I have known him from a Child, and went to School with him. I knew him as soon as he had knocked me down, and should have known him before. had not his Hat been flapped over his Face, which I did not see till he knocked me down. I went to see him in Newgate, and he would not know me; but while we were drinking in the Tap house, he called me by a Nick-Name (Joaney) I go by, and owned he had called me to mind now.</p>

So Jemmy Baily, and I, and Dodds, and the two young Women, went to a Distiller's and had half a Pint; we paid Three-halfpence,and scor'd the other Three-half pence. We stayed there till 8 or 9 o'Clock; one of the young Women would stay no longer; so Dodds, and Baily, and I, and the other Woman, went to see her Home into Hogg-yard. As we were going to this Place, Jemmy Baily dropped us, and went to the Shovel, and Dodds and I stayed at his Aunt's Door; we talked there about a Quarter of an Hour, and up comes Jemmy Baily; Who's here, says he? I am here, and

So Baily, and Dodds, and I went down, they - a little before me, and stop-ped at Mr. Jackson's Door. It was a Quarter of an Hour before the Gentlemen came by; they turned up between Nightingal-lane and Ragg Fair. Jemmy Baily followed, and gave the Man in the Red Rug-Coat a Blow; the Man turned and struck at him with his Cane, but the other Man had got Dodd's Hammer from him, and broke his Head with it in two Places. Baily got off with a Hatt, but which of the Gentlemen it belonged to I can't tell, Dodds lost his Hatt and Cap in the Fray. I was afraid Dodds was taken, and went to look for him, I found him all over Gore-Blood, and Hatt, Cap, and Hammer were gone. Jemmy Baily came to us again, and said, If you have lost your Hatt, we have a better in the Room of it. Next Morning Dodds came to me to the Glass-house to desire me to get 2 s. upon the Hatt; we had 2 s. and half a Pint of Gin upon it of Mr. Reynolds; and next Day, Dodds order me to go to Mr. Reynolds and bid him sell the Hatt, and send the rest of the Money. The Hatt was sent by

               <p>He was a 2d Time indicted on the Coroner's Inquest for the said Murder.</p>
               <p>Justice De Veil. On the 23d of December, the Prisoner was brought before me for throwing the Deceased from a Ladder: Mr. Matthews informed me there was no Possibility of removing the Deceased; therefore I went to the House and took the Deceased's Information under his own Hand; he was then perfectly in his Senses, but as I thought, had but a few Hours to live. I presented the Prisoner at the Bar to him; asked him if he knew him, and he said it was

            . I was in the Garret when the Accident happened, and Word was brought me that the Deceased's Brains were knocked out: I went down to see him, and next Morning he told me he believed it was Davison threw him off the Ladder. The Morning before he got the Hurt, he was very much in Liquor; I cannot tell how he was in the Afternoon, but I know they were sociable, and quiet, and drank Beer together that very Afternoon: I saw them together, and they behaved as well as two Fellow-servants could do: The Prisoner had lent the Deceased a Crown, and he would have pawned his waistcoat, to have paid the Prisoner, and he would not let him.</p>

            . I was at Work in the Shed, erected for priming Cloath for Painters. We go up and down by a Ladder with Bevill-Steps, 14 Foot high. I heard the Prisoner and the Deceased, about two Minutes before the Accident happened, talking in a very Friendly Manner, about a Pot of Beer. The Deceased's Business was in the Shop, not in the Yard, but he was coming to speak with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the Ladder stand?</p>
               <p>Macmullan. It bore against the Bracimer of the Building, and stood aslant.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not the Deceased speak to you without going up the Ladder?</p>
               <p>Macmullan. Yes, unless he had private Business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it necessary to go up that Ladder, if he would be on a Level with you?</p>
               <p>Macmullan. Yes he could not say any Thing in private, without coming up the Ladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the Accident happened?</p>
               <p>Macmullan. Yes he fell before the Ladder fell.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Occasion of the Ladder's falling?</p>
               <p>Macmullan. The Prisoner's coming to assist the Deceased, I take to be the Occasion of the Ladder's falling. - The Saturday before the Accident, I know he lent the Deceased a Crown, and the Day the Misfortune happened the Deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173601150013"/> would have pawned his Waistcoat to have paid him; but the Prisoner would not suffer him to do it. I am sensible they were very good Friends. When the Deceased had lost his Business, the Prisoner got my Master to employ him, and sent me to his House to fetch him to my Master Keaton. I visited him several times in his illness, and I never heard him charge the Prisoner, till that Night Mr. Deveil was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say then?</p>
               <p>Macmullan. What has been read from Mr. Deveil. When the Ladder fell, I called for a round Ladder to come down, and found the Deceased on the Ground, with his Head between the Prisoner's Hands: O! says he, I believe my poor Boy has killed himself, and desired me to go immediately for Mr. Coldham. I have known them both 14 Years; the Deceased was about 24 or 26 Years old.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the Prisoner behave when Mr. Coldham came?</p>
               <p>Macmullan. He held him in his Arms, and assisted at the first and third Dressing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him, whether the Ladder was standing, or whether it had not slip'd away from its Footing.</p>
               <p>Macmullan. As I am on my Oath, I am sensible it slip'd from its Footing: it bore on a White Lead Barrel 3 Foot high, after it fell; one Part was on the Ground, and one Part on the Barrel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there not a large Grinding-stone on the Barrel-head; and did not the Ladder fall upon that?</p>
               <p>Macmullan. Yes; and we all apprehended the Deceased fell on that Stone.</p>

            . I sat up with the Deceased two Nights before he died; and he told me James Davison threw him off of the Ladder; he was going up to Macmullan; and disputing about a Pot of Beer, they had but few Words before he was flung off; but whether it was done designedly or not, he could not tell.</p>
               <p>Wm. Williams. The Ladder from whence the Deceased fell, was a large Ladder, every Step about 6 Inches and half wide: I heard the Deceased say, the Prisoner did it willfully.</p>
               <p>Q. They have not all declared so.</p>
               <p>Williams. I heard him declare so to Mr. Deveil.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This, Gentleman, was the Constable's Assistant and when they took me, he said, I should be carried from thence to New-gate, and from Newgate to Tyburn, if my Master did not pay the Charges upon Duke Ford's Account.</p>
               <p>Williams. I did tell him, I would not quit him till I had got him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Sutherland Ford (the Deceased's Brother.) I have nothing to say, but only when I called to see my Brother, and asked him about Davison, he would rap out an Oath, and say, Don't talk to me about him.</p>

I had it about 5 Minutes before she left me, for I had felt for it. When I found it was gone, I looked for it upon the Bed, but there was no Watch.

            . I am a Silk Dyer, and lost this Gown off the Pole the Saturday before Christmas; about 6 o'Clock in the Evening, we dy'd it with two Breadths of Burdett, an Olive Colour, the Burdett was marked in the Sleeve with a (D).</p>
               <p>Q. Was it made up?</p>
               <p>Robins. It had been a Gown, but was in pieces, sewed together for the Conveniency of Dying. There was about 10 Yards of it in all, when we had sewed it together.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you should have indicted him for stealing 10 Yards of Silk.</p>
               <p>Robins. We always call such Things Gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in the general Course of your Business called Gowns?</p>
               <p>Robins. Yes, never any Thing else; 'tis a common Term, it had been a Gown, and was to be a Gown again: It was unfinished, and could not be used till it had been to the Waterers; therefore I sent Notice to the Trade to have such Things stopp'd if they should come to their Hands. Word was sent me by this Gentlewoman that she had watered such Goods and delivered them to a young Man. I went to her, and the young Man was sent for, and she swore to him.</p>

            . I live in Widegate-Alley. Bishops-gate-street, the Things were brought to be watered one Evening when I was out; when they were done, they lay a Day or two before the Prisoner called for them; I delivered them to him myself. I heard no more, till about (I think) a Fortnight ago, when the Prosecutor sent this Notice and Description of the Goods: I remember the Mark (D) in the Sleeve: This I think was either on Saturday or Monday Night. I don't swear these were the Things the Prosecutor lost, but they answered his Description.</p>
               <p>Q. By common Course of your Business can you water any Thing, so as to be fit to be delivered in four or five Hours?</p>
               <p>Bryan. Yes, if Necessity requires it, and we have Work in the House to do it with</p>
               <p>Q. How long had it been done before the Prisoner called for it?</p>
               <p>Bryan. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the Prisoner came and fetched it away, that the Prosecutor sent his Servant with this Notice?</p>
               <p>Bryan. I think it was Monday was Se'nnight; but if the Prosecutor lost them on Saturday, we could not have got them done.</p>

I wanted to change one of them; the rest I tyed up and layed down upon an Oak Table in my forward Room: I was making a Shirt, and I covered the Purse with a Corner of the Linnen. I was going to the Washer-womans for some Cloaths, so I bid my Brother, who was in the back Room, and expected he should be arrested, to lock the Door after me: I stood on the Stair-head, till he had locked the Door, and then went down Stairs. When I came back, this Man (the Prisoner) and two or three more, with a Woman, was at the top of the Stairs. What do you do there, says I? What's that to you, said he, and set his Shoulder to the Door - away flew the Lock into the middle of the Room. I seeing the Door fly open, was so astonished - I was frighted out of my Wits - he layed his Hands on my Brothers, and shoving over to where the Table stood, he spy'd the Purse, and being nearer the Table than I, he snatched it up. Well says I, if you come to arrest the Man, do not rob me.</p>
               <p>Q. But how came he to see the Purse; you said it was covered.</p>
               <p>Callan. He had shoved the Linnen off, and then he saw it; and when he had taken it, the rest of the Fellows gathered close about him. I cryed out, I was robbed! - I was robbed! You Bitch, says he, say a Word, and I'll cut your Throat, and out he pulled a long Knife - Woman! Woman! says my Brother, hold your Tongue, or we shall all be murdered! I dropped back on a Chair, and had not power to speak a Word more - My Money lost, my Life in danger - Then away he hurried down Stairs, and they with him, and took my Brother with them. In 5 or 6 Minutes I came to my self, ran down Stairs, and said to the Folks below, I am robbed, which way are the Fellows gone? They directed me, and away I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173601150017"/> came to the Prisoner's House. He had locked up my Brother, and I saw no body but him in the Parlour - Give me my Money, says I. Tell me of any such thing and I will kill you, says he - but be easy, and I will make up Matters with you. I found I could not get my Money, so away I came to get a Warrant for him immediately, thinking to take my Purse upon him; but all the Justices were at Hicks's Hall; so I could not get a Warrant 'till Night, and then he was not to be found; he is a Prisoner in the Fleet, though he has a House of his own. On Saturday last he was taken; the Fact was committed on December 12.</p>
               <p>Kirk. Ask her whether I did not stay 'till she had taken a Shirt out of her Lap; and 'till he had put it on?</p>
               <p>C. Callan. He put a Shirt on, to be sure -</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Shirt he put on, part of the Linnen in your Apron, or of that which lay on the Table?</p>
               <p>C. Callan. The Shirt he put on was in the Room before; there were Shirts in the Trunk, whether it was one of them in the Apron, or one taken out of the Trunk, I cannot well tell.</p>
               <p>Kirk. Ask her if she did not give him one, and he refused it, because it had not a ruffled Bosom?</p>
               <p>C. Callan. I cannot tell; I don't know whether I gave him a Shirt or not</p>
               <p>Kirk. Ask her, if her Brother did not ask her for 5 s. before I brought him out of the House?</p>
               <p>C. Callan. Yes, but it was before I fainted away; and I told him that you had got all my Money: I had but 2s. out of the Guinea I had changed:</p>
               <p>Kirk. Ask her if she did not say, she had 3s. and that she had pawned a Shirt for that?</p>
               <p>C. Callan. I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Kirk. Ask her whether her Brother's Sister was not at my House, when she came there?</p>
               <p>C. Callan. I did not see her.</p>

            . On the Sunday before this happened, I told 50 Guineas, and put them in a Green Silk Purse, and left them with my Wife. I went to the Prince of Wales's at Ken-Green to work, and was away all the Week, and came home the Saturday following. I went up Stairs, and found a Padlock on the Door - What is the Fancy, said I to my Landlady, that my Door is padlock'd? Your Door, said she was broke open yesterday, and you have been robbed by Bailiffs that came after the young Fellow that lodges with you. Your Wife cried out, she was robbed, and is gone after the Men; she had a Warrant for them yesterday, and she did not lye in the Room last Night. I went to Long-Acre, found my Wife, and she told me what had happened.</p>
               <p>Kirk. What Business are you?</p>
               <p>P. Callan. I am a Slater; well known in Town and Country. I have been a Master, am now a Journeyman, and have 12 s. a Week now, according as the Season is favourable, I can earn more.</p>
               <p>Kirk. Ask, whether he can work in wet Weather?</p>
               <p>P. Callan. Yes, wet and dry; in Slate, Wet does no great hurt.</p>

               <p>P. Callan. No; I have been not 2 Years in England; I can safely say I brought 40 Guineas from Dublin, where I kept a Publick-house.</p>

            . December 12, about 10 o'clock in the Morning, I was very unwell, and was in Bed, and my Sister came and told me she was going to the Washer-woman's, and had taken out a Guinea to change. I being afraid of Bailiffs, got up and locked the Door: I was aware of this Gentleman to arrest me, tho' he is a Prisoner in the Fleet. A Woman came first to the Door, and I let her in; it was the Plaintiff's Sister: I hope, says I, you don't come to set me? No, not I, said she, but presently 2 or 3 Men came to the Door, and, upon my refusing to open the Door, Kirk and all his Men burst open the Door, and the Lock flew off. Kirk entered first, and laying hold of me, the Linnen on the Table was whipped off, and Kirk put the green Silk Purse that lay there into his Coat Pocket. - I saw him do it, as plain as I see your Worship this Moment. My Sister pushed in with them, and seeing him take the Purse, she cry'd out, - I am robbed, and catched hold of the Skirt of his Coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he arrested you before he took the Purse?</p>
               <p>Obryan. He laid his Hand on me first; and said to her, You Whore, if you say a Word, I'll cut your Throat, and drew out a long Knife. Hold your Tongue, says I, or we shall be murdered. There were three or four with him, and they had great Clubs as thick as my Leg. Then they dragged me to Kirk's House, by the Seven-Dials, and my Sister followed. Upon this, Kirk comes to me, and desired me to make my Sister easy, - if I did, he told me I should be discharged. You have robbed her, said I, and if I can't pay the Debt, I must go to Gaol, Moreover,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173601150018"/> my Lord, my Sister went for a Warrant, and he run out of the Way for a Month, and was not to be taken at any seasonable Time.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I would ask him, whether I did not stay till she had given him a Shirt; and till he put it on?</p>
               <p>Obryan. Yes.</p>
               <p>Kirk. I would ask whether he did refuse one Shirt, because it had not a Ruffled Bosom?</p>
               <p>Obryan. They were both ruffled; one was broke in the Wristbands. I put on the best.</p>
               <p>Kirk. Ask him, whether he made any Outcry either in the Room, or in the Street?</p>
               <p>Obryan. No; there were 6 or 7 Fellows with you.</p>
               <p>Kirk. Did not the Plaintiff's Wife's Sister come in with me?</p>
               <p>Obryan. No; she was in the Room before.</p>

B - h, you have set me. I will kill you, I went down Stairs and told Ann Casey, that I heard his Voice in the Room, so she came up with me and one Mrs Mitchell; Ann Casey knocked at the Door, and bid her Sister Bridget open the Door. Obryan fell upon the Woman within, and made her cry out, Murder; the Plaintiff's Wife then opened the Door, and I went in and arrested him. He begged I would stay; his Sister, he said, was gone for a Shirt, and I stayed a Quarter of an Hour before Mrs Callan came in. When she came in, he told her he was arrested; then you must go to Goal, said she. Hold your Tongue, you B - h, says he, and gave her 3 or 4 Kicks. - He said he had been robbed in Fleet street last Night, when he was drunk; had fell in the Kennel, and must have a clean Shirt: she gave him one, and he did not like it; so she gave him another.

            . The Prisoner was not my Wife, but my Servant. she lived with me a Year and a Quarter at Mile-end Green. I had a good Trade, yet I run out; I entrusted her with every thing, and she embezzled my Goods: She went from me last June at which time I could prove nothing upon her. When I had had her before the Justice, she confessed taking the Goods mentioned; but there was no Confession taken in Writing, and these things were taken without my Knowledge-that's all.</p>
               <p>Councel. Aye - you are willing to be gone -  Pray, how came you first together? In what Manner did you live with her?</p>
               <p>Brome. She was recommended to me by Mr. Coombes, who had lived with her in a criminal way.</p>
               <p>Councel. And how did you live with her?</p>
               <p>Brome. As a Servant I paid her 6 l. - a Year</p>
               <p>Councel. Was not Part of the Goods in your House marked with her Name and yours?</p>
               <p>Brome. Yes.</p>
               <p>Councel. And how come you to mark your Goods with your Servant's Name?</p>
               <p>Brome. I was afraid of an Execution; so thought to make over some of my Goods to her.</p>
               <p>Councel. And had you no other Reason to mark your Goods so? Pray, how came you to sign this Paper?</p>
               <p>Brome. It was a voluntary Act of my own. The Case was this; - At that Time I was not capable of proving she had taken any thing from me.</p>
               <p>Councel. Why, this is a general Release.</p>
               <p>Brome. The Reason was this: Mr. Coombes, who kept her Company, and does so now, - she was with Child when she came to me, - He gave me Money to take her. - Some time after - about October last, there was some Discourse among them, and he took me into an Arbour, and asked me the Reason we could not agree; if we could not agree he said I must turn her away. Upon this -</p>
               <p>Coun. I fancy you was not so kind to her as you used to be?</p>
               <p>Brome. No, Sir, all Familiarity between us was then broke off, - and says I, What Mr. Coombes, have you been thereabouts since? Do you want me to father another Kid for you? -</p>
               <p>Councel. But why did you give her a general Release?</p>
               <p>Brome. I suspecting the Thing, taxed him with it, - I one Day discovered - don't dash one so! - there's no Occasion for it - she wanted to come to Bed to me; I would not suffer it, but thrust her down Stairs and hurt her shoulder. - I turned her away for this Reason, - I came into the Kitchen one Day, and saw something a Boiling, which I believe was to cause an Abortion. So, says I, - then you shall stay no longer here - No Murder in my House!</p>
               <p>Councel. How came you to know she was with Child?</p>
               <p>Brome, Mr. Coombes partly confessed it. - The Release was my own Act, and I did it because I wanted one from her. And now, Gentlemen, you have the Middle and both Ends on't.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173601150020"/>Prisoner. Pray ask Mr. Brome if he agreed with me to be his Servant?</p>
               <p>Brome. I did agree to take her, and in that Condition: I believe the Bargain was made at Temple-Mills, - I had 23l. 10s. with her.</p>
               <p>Council. What was you to have 23l. 10s. to take her as a Servant? Was not you to father ther the Bastard?</p>
               <p>Brome. Yes.</p>
