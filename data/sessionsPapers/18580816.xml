                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Churton Street, Pimlico, and am a teacher. In the year 1842 I knew the prisoner—he was paying his addresses to my sister for three or four months; I was in the habit of seeing him constantly. On 30th October, 1842, I was present at the pariah church of Upper Chelsea, Middlesex, when he was married to my sister, Mary Ann Sadler—after the marriage, my sister and he lived together. I was fre<lb/>quently in the habit of seeing them—he removed from our place for about a week, and took apartments, and then he removed back to my mother's house and lived with us. I was in the habit of seeing him for about four years after the marriage—I have no doubt whatever about the prisoner being the man that was married to my sister; he ceased to live with her about 1846.</p>

I am the wife of George Mills, and reside at Cathron, in Surrey—I was at the church in 1842, when my sister Mary Ann was married—the prisoner is the person to whom she was married—I had seen him three or four months previously to the marriage, and I saw him for about four years after the marriage—I have not the least doubt he is the person.</p>

Q.</hi> When did your sister see me last? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think you called three years after you left her—you left her about 1846, and it was three years after that that you called, but she never spoke to you; she only saw you for a few moments—I saw you on that occasion; you called to see her, but she would not see you—I have never seen you since—you are the man that married my sister in 1842—I went to the church with you—it was Trinity Church, Upper Chelsea. I cannot say exactly what age you appeared to be at that time; I should imagine 19 or 20, or perhaps more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at my father's house at Sheffield—I became acquainted with the prisoner in 1847 at Preston, where I was on a visit to some friends. In November that year I accompanied him to Gretna Green—he had previously made a proposal of marriage to me. I had not the least idea that he was a married man—we were married at Gretna hall by the Rev. Mr. Linton, by special licence—the marriage ceremony was read by the Rev. Mr. Linton, as it is in a church,—the prisoner declared himself a single man—I don't remember distinctly what was said on the occasion, but we were legally married—we declared ourselves single persons, and Mr. Linton declared us to be husband and wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any question asked of either of you, as to whether you wished to be married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he asked if we were willing to be married.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he ask each of you if you were willing to be married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and we answered, yes—we agreed to be husband and wife, and the ceremony was then gone through; and after the ceremony was gone through, Mr. Linton declared us to be man and wife. We were legally</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160003"/>
               <p>married according to the laws of Scotland, which laws are recognised by the laws of England. When Mr. Linton asked us if we were willing to be married, we consented—I said, "I take you to be my husband," and the prisoner consented to take me to be his wife—he said so distinctly—we afterwards lived together as man and wife, and continued to do so till 1851. I had one little girl by that marriage; she is about 9 years of age. In 1851, the prisoner deserted me in Liverpool—I never saw him since, until he was in custody. At the time he married me, he passed by the name of Marco Emile de St. Hiliare. I have my marriage certificate here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the prisoner's signature, "Marco Emile de St. Hiliare,"—I saw him sign this—this, "Anna Maria Froggatt," is my writing—this was signed by him at Gretna hall. The Rev. Mr. Linton gave me this certificate—(<hi rend="italic"> Read:</hi> "Kingdom of Scotland, county of Dumfries, parish of Gretna. These are to certify, to all to whom these presents may come, that Marco Emile de St. Hiliare, of the parish of Montmorenci, in the county or department of the Seine, France, and Anna Maria Froggatt, of the parish of St. Philip, Sheffield, Yorkshire, being now here present, and having declared themselves single persons, were this day married, agreeable to the law of Scotland; as witness our hands at Gretna hall, this 15th day of November, 1847, Marco Emile de St. Hiliare, Anna Maria Froggatt; wit<lb/>nessed by John Young, John Linton, and Jane Linton.") There was also a notice of the marriage in the newspapers.</p>

I knew you about six weeks before our marriage—the last time I saw you was on 18th November, 1851. I made enquiries as to the legality of the marriage—I enquired of several parties; I cannot tell of whom, a long time has expired—I have letters that I received from Mr. Linton, assuring me that it was a legal marriage. Mr. Linton and his sister were present at the marriage—I did not know Mr. Linton before.</p>

               <p>hesitation in saying that that would constitute a valid marriage in Scotland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it not depend upon whether the intention of the parties went with the words that were spoken and the acts that were done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the intention of the parties is material certainly; they must intend that what is said and done should issue in a marriage, and that they should be man and wife in consequence of it; they must really deliberately intend and consent to take each other as man and wife. I should mention that this constitutes what is called an irregular marriage—a regular marriage is, as it is here, by the publication of banns—but this is a perfectly good marriage with regard to all the rights of the parties—the substance of a contract in marriage, as in everything else, is the intention of the parties; it does not depend upon the intention of the man—if the prisoner and Miss Froggatt went through a form of marriage, the meaning of which was that they took each other as man and wife, and if there was good faith on the part of Miss Froggatt, and she intended to take him for her husband, and he went through a form supporting her in that intention and belief, and the facts were such as she has spoken to, that would be, although an irregular, a perfectly valid marriage. I do not think his in<lb/>tention is so material, under the circumstances of the case; it has been decided in Scotland that where there is what is called a <hi rend="italic">mid impediment</hi>—that is, where the man has refrained from acknowledging the woman, and, in the meantime, married another person in the regular way, and then the second wife died, and he afterwards married the person with whom he con<lb/>tracted the irregular connexion, her good faith alone had the effect of legitimizing the offspring.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a very long defence, entered into the circumstances of a previous prosecution for an offence of which he was convicted, and asserted that that, case, as well as the present, was the result of a conspiracy against him on the part of Mr. Baxter Langley, and other members of an Italian confede<lb/>ration, whose enmity he had, aroused by denouncing their schemes of assassination. He denied that he was the party that married Miss Sadler, and stated that he was in Paris at the time, which he could have proved if time had been allowed him—he also denied that he had ever seen Miss Froggatt before he saw her at Bow Street.</hi>)</p>

I saw him stoop as though he was placing something on the ground; I could not see what he was doing—I was about twelve or fourteen yards from him—there was a van in front of the door at the same time. I saw a female standing in Queenhithe, about twelve yards from the warehouse door—it was the prisoner's daughter—I afterwards took her into custody about 200 yards off, and found about 6lbs. of flour in her possession, tied up in a bag, and an old handkerchief or duster—the prisoner remained on the wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Augustus Drew Harding, of Bell Wharf, Wharfinger. The prisoner was employed as a watchman on the Sunday—he had no right whatever to be in the warehouse—the keys are kept hanging up in the counting-house—the prisoner could get access to them by opening the window, and getting in—there was flour stored in this particular warehouse—I have examined the flour produced; I believe it formed a portion of the flour in our stock, by the appearance of it—I could not swear to it. I have examined and weighed some of the sacks in the warehouse, and found 3 sacks out of 10 in one consignment deficient to the extent of 9lbs., 7lbs., and 61bs. I saw that the warehouse was locked on the Saturday night, and the keys hung on the usual nail.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an outfitter, and live at Leeds. On Thursday night, 8th July, I was at the Crown Tavern, in Cranbourn Passage about half past 10 o'clock—I was rather affected by drink. I lost a gold watch—I don't know how I lost it—I am certain I had it when I went into the public house—I saw it about ten minutes before I missed it; it was in my waistcoat pocket—it had an Albert chain attached to the watch, and the chain was, through the button-hole of the waistcoat—when I missed the watch, the chain was gone with it, and my waistcoat was open. On the following morning, I went to the same tavern, and spoke to the landlord about it—there were several parties in the room—I offered the publican a reward of a sovereign first, and there were persons present who could hear me. I believe I saw the prisoner there—he came in while I was speaking about the watch—he sat down for a short time when he came in—the landlord spoke to him; he told him about the affair altogether, he said, "This fellow lost a watch here last night, do you think it can be got back again?"—the prisoner said he would go out and see for it—the landlord asked him how much he thought it could be got back for—the prisoner went out to look for it; he came back when he had been absent about ten minutes; he said it could be got back for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I said, "That is too much money, you must say 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." I at last agreed to give 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I went out with the prisoner to Mr. Walker's, in St. Martin's Lane—I there got change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and gave the prisoner 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—when I gave him the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he said, "The watch will be at Massey's in about ten minutes"—he did not say how it was to come back, nor who was to bring it. I went to the house about 2 o'clock, the barmaid made a communication to me. I received from her this parcel, containing my watch—this is my watch which I lost. I saw the prisoner about ten minutes after I had the parcel delivered to me. I showed him the watch, and said, "It is come back again,"—he said, "I told you it would come back in a short time"—the chain was not with the watch; I had got the chain from a friend who was with me, and who seized the man who stole the watch.</p>

I changed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note at Mr. Walker's—no one was present when I gave the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner; I gave it him in St. Martin's Court.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder; the prosecutor is a friend of mine. On the 8th of July I was with him at the Crown public house—he was very much intoxicated—he seemed to be asleep. I saw a man in the room go up to him and stand over him—I saw that man had a guard in his hand, and I said, "You are robbing the man." I laid hold of him, and took the guard from him and gave it to Mr. Massey—I collared the man, and others interfered, and he got away; but I took the guard out of his hand.</p>

I won't swear that I saw the man drawing the watch away—I saw the guard in his hand, and I took it from him. I should think seven or eight persons were present—this was at Mr. Massey's in Cranbourn Alley—the prosecutor was on the floor at the further side of the room. I was charged with stealing the watch by several persons in the room—when the prosecutor heard of it he gave me in custody. I woke him up, and several parties said to me, "You have robbed your friend yourself"—I told the prosecutor what I had seen, and yet he insisted on giving me in charge. I was taken to the station by my own wish as well.</p>

I saw him hand the watch to a lad in the company—I detained the prisoner.</p>

On the evening of 21st July, about half-past 8, I was passing along Aldersgate Street, and saw the two prisoners at the corner of Mr. Woolmer's shop—a man was with them—Groom and the man were standing by the side of a pile of goods, forming a sort of corner—Williams was behind them. I saw her put her hand from behind them and take a piece of goods—Groom and the man then walked arm-in-arm a short distance down Aldersgate Street, Williams followed them. I spoke to Hancock, the policeman, and saw him take the women into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 58, York Road, Lambeth—I was foreman to Mr. Lyons, a tailor, of 101, Fleet Street, till Thursday evening last—I have known the prisoner for some years; he had been in the same employment with me. On Wednesday, 28th July, about 12 or 1 o'clock in the day, I saw him in Bride Lane—I told the boy to run across and tell him I wanted to speak to him; he came—we had some conversation, and went round the corner to the Red Lion; I had about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money about me; it was loose in a small cash pocket in my trousers—these are the trousers I had on at the time, this is the pocket; there is a flap over it and a button: in order to get at the money I have to unbutton the flap—we had two glasses of ale a-piece at the Red Lion—the prisoner paid for it. I should say we were there about a quarter of an hour—we then went back to the shop together—we stayed there about half an hour. I was perfectly sober at the time I went to the Red Lion, I had had nothing to drink that morning previously to that; after being about half an hour at the shop we went to the Bell, in Fleet Street; we stayed there about a quarter of an hour—I had either one or two glasses of ale, and a glass of gin and bitten—I paid for it. I took the money to pay for it out of this pocket—I took out sixpence—I did not take out the money loose—I only paid for the last we had, the prisoner paid for some—at the time I paid the sixpence I am sure that my money was safe in my pocket—while we there we ordered dinner for two, to be ready at 2 o'clock; we then left—as we were coming down the passage he said to me, "Will you have a pinch of snuff?" I took a pinch, and we both went across the street to the shop door; and at the shop door he left me—he offered me the snuff out of a piece of paper—I took the pinch and was taking it as we were coming across the road—he left me directly we got to the shop door—as soon as I got to the shop door I lost all consciousness; the last thing I remember was being at the shop door—I do not remember anything more until I was woke up—I do not remember how I got into the counting-house—I found myself there when I recovered, lying on the floor—Leech the errand-boy, and a man named Grady were there then—I found my waistcoat all unbuttoned and my pocket turned inside out where I had had my money; the money was all gone, except three halfpence that was on the floor. I saw nothing more of the prisoner until he was in custody on the Friday morning—I went to the address he had given me, but I found no such person there. The counting-house</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PEARCE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between four and five years—we were not exactly fellow shopmen—we worked for the same master, but at different shops. I never heard anything very first-rate of his character—since he has left Mr. Lyons I have heard a good deal: he has a bad character for honesty, being con<lb/>nected with thieves and receivers of stolen goods—I am not aware that he was ever charged—the stolen goods I refer to are watches; it was Mr. Lyons, my employer, who gave me that information—he is not here—he has given me that information several times within the last eleven months—I did not pay much attention to it. I sent the boy over to fetch him because I had known the man so long that I took an interest in him, as he had been out of work so long, and he told me he was going into partnership with a man named Brett—I wanted to know how he was getting on as regards the partnership—I had heard of it some time before, from himself, at the shop. He was not frequently in the habit of coming to the shop. He was about four years in Mr. Henry Lyons' employ—he then left, and went to Mr. Simeon Lyons' in the Borough—I know of the prisoner having brought an action against Simeon Lyons, which was tried in July; he told me that he had recovered 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. damages, but I have since been told that he only recovered 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he told me he had received the money—I expect it was with that money he was going into partnership with Mr. Brett—Mr. Brett's shop is in Fleet Street, nearer Temple Bar than Mr. Lyons'. I live in the York Road—I am a householder; I swear that—I rent the house—I am married; I have been married about five years; I was married at Waterloo Church—I let lodgings to such lodgers as I can get; not to ladies that come there for short periods—some<lb/>times I have had ladies there—I have rented the house twelve months—before that I lived at 110, Fleet Street—I have three rooms; one is let to Mr. Franklin, the steward of the Oriental Club, and the other to Mr. Clifton, a commercial traveller—they were there last night. Mr. Lyons' shop is about half a dozen doors from the police station. I did not give any infor<lb/>mation of this robbery to any policeman till the next morning, but information had been previously given by Mr. Lyons—I myself gave information to a policeman on the Thursday morning, at Fleet Street station; that was not to the policeman who took the prisoner into custody—I gave the information to Shelford. It was about 12 o'clock in the day that the prisoner first came over to the shop—it was about ten minutes or a quarter past 2 when I re<lb/>covered my consciousness. I did not remain at the shop a minute afterwards—I did up my things and ran over to the Bell to ask if he was there at dinner; after that I went home—I had not got a penny about, me with the exception of the three halfpence. I had two pair of old trowsers and a waistcoat at the shon, and I sold them to a Jew, and took a cab and drove over to my sisters—I sold the things to pay for the cab, and went over to my brother-in-law's house in the Waterloo Road—he is a carman. I then went home. I stopped at my brother-in-law's all the afternoon—it was night before I went home—next morning I gave information at Fleet Street station. I do not know how long the prisoner has lived at Apollo Buildings, Walworth—he tells me he is married and has five children—I never visited him but once, and that was when he was at the New Cut, at Mr. Lyons' other shop—I knew him then to be a married man, with a family. The first public house we went into was the Red Lion, in Poppin's Court, Fleet Street—our shop is next door but one to Poppin's Court, and the Red Lion is the</p>

               <p>first house in Poppin's Court. I do not know Mr. Wilding, a butcher. There was no person there drinking with me—I swear that—there were several persons in front of the bar—there was no one drinking with me at the Bell. I do not know Mr. Booth. I do not remember as we were coming out of the Bell the prisoner speaking to a person who was going in—I recollect when the glass of gin and bitters was called for, the prisoner going out at the back door and coming in again in about two minutes; that was the only time he left me—I did not see him speak to anybody as he came out. On the previous night, Tuesday, I was at the Bell after business, to smoke a pipe, as I often did—we usually shut up at 9 o'clock—I did not tell the prisoner that I was out the greater part of the previous night—I might have said, "I was over here last night." Our shop is now closed; there was not sufficient business to keep it on—it is a ready made and bespoke shop—we keep an order book and a small cash book, that is here—I paid over to my matter the money I received, either on Saturday night or Monday morning—I had received 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that week. It is not an unfrequent occurrence for me to be a little intoxicated—I have been so, but always have been able to take care of myself. I am not a snuff-taker—my master has spoken to me several times about being intoxicated—sometimes I have had a little drop too much at the Bell, and sometimes at the Red Lion—I have never been intoxicated in the counting house before that I reoollect—I have been asleep there, not from stupefaction; I have been asleep in the counting house from the effects of drink, in the daytime. It was the barmaid at the Red Lion who served me, and Mr. Hadland the landlord; and at the Bell it was Mrs. Jervis the landlady—I had no money in my waistcoat pocket—I did not ask the landlady to give me credit, nothing of the sort, I swear that; nor did I ask anybody to give me credit—the person who served me did not say, "You had better go home, and do not drink any more till you have had something to eat"—no observation was made at either public house about my being drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I was errand-boy to Mr. Lyons in Fleet Street when this matter occurred—I had been employed there ten months. On Wed<lb/>nesday, July 28th, Mr. Peers told me to go across the road and call the prisoner—I did so—at that time Peers was perfectly sobers—he and the prisoner went over to the public house—afterwards I saw them crossing the street together, coming home. I saw Peers take some snuff—I did not see who gave it him, and I saw him come up to the door—the prisoner was with him—when he got to the door he left him—directly Peers got into the doorway, he became senseless—he went as far as the counter; I helped him from the counter into the counting-house, and there he laid down on the ground, and appeared to be asleep. In about half an hour the prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160013"/>
               <p>came in and asked for Mr. Peers—I said he was not at home (he was, in fact at that time, in the counting-house); he went away, and returned in less than five minutes, and said he wanted to see Mr. Peers about the dinner—I then went into the counting-house to see if I could wake him, and the prisoner went with me; he went into the counting-house—Peers was still on the ground in the same state; I shook him and tried to wake him; the prisoner said it was no use, and I was to let him sleep and go and mind the door—I did not do so—the prisoner stood leaning against the door-post—a man came into the shop and wished to see Mr. Lyons, and I went into the shop to him: I was in the shop talking to him less than five minutes; during that time the prisoner was in the counting-house with Peers—I could not see into the counting-house, while I was talking to the person in the shop—when that person went away, the witness Grady came in with a coat; he put it on the counter and asked me where Mr. Peers was—I said he was in the counting-house with Mr. Shire—Grady went towards the counting-house, and the prisoner came out almost directly: he said as Mr. Peers could not have his dinner, he would go over to the Bell and pay for it, and send it over to me and Grady; he said, "I suppose you will have it?" we said "Yes," and he went out. When Peers came into the shop, his waistcoat was buttoned at usual—I and Grady together roused him up; that was after the prisoner had gone—when I went to rouse him up, his waistcoat was unbuttoned and his pocket turned inside out: I mean the cash pocket (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—I succeeded in raising him then; I did not leave the premises at all while the prisoner was there, No one besides the prisoner, Grady, and myself went into the counting-house while Peers was there, no one came into the shop—no one could have gone in without my having seen, them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you leave Mr. Lyons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have not left him: I have gone to the other shop—there was no one in the shop at Fleet Street but Peers and I—I did not sell goods: it was very seldom that people came in while Peers was away; if they did, I tried to serve them—I have not sold goods in Peers' absence above once—I saw a coat sold that week—I was not with Peers all the week, because we were without a boy At the other shop, and I had to be backward and forward from one shop to the other. I was there part of the Tuesday—it was on the Monday that I saw the coat sold, that was sold for £1—we had no cash-box or till; Peers kept the money by him—I knew Shire first by being shopman to Mr. Lyons in the New Cut; I do not know how long he was there—I have seen him at the shop in Fleet Street occasionally—I had not seen him there for two months before this Wednesday. It was about 12 o'clock when Peers told me to call the prisoner over, and it was about half-past I that he was in an unconscious state; I am quite sure of that—I have never seen Peers in a state like he was then; not so bad, not like he was then—I have not known him to be asleep in the counting-house, for hours together; I never knew him to be asleep there—he has not been drunk above once or twice; he had never been asleep in the counting-house before—I have seen him there drunk once or twice—I saw him and the prisoner come over from the Bell; I did not see the prisoner go back to the Bell after he came and asked for Peers; I did not see where he went to—I heard Peers tell him that he expected Mr. Lyons there; that was soon after he came over to speak to him, before they went to Poppin's Court—when the prisoner came first to the shop after Peers was in the counting-house, he asked if Peers was at home, and I told him "No;" that was an untruth—Peers did</p>

               <p>not tell me to say that he was not at home, I swear that—I had not before that been into the counting-house and shaken Peers; I did not go in till afterwards—I could see as Peers came across the road that his waistcoat was not unbuttoned: I looked at his dress, if it had been unbuttoned, I should have noticed it—we used not to have any particular dinner hour; we used to get it when we could—Peers used to have his dinner about twelve o'clock; I used to fetch his dinner, and he had it in the shop—I did not tell the prisoner the last time he called that I had been trying to get Peers up, or that I had been pulling him about: nothing of the kind—Grady did not say anything to that effect.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 19, Dean Street. I am a tailor, and work for Mr. Lyons. On Wednesday afternoon, 28th July, I went to Mr. Lyons' shop with a coat that I had made up—I did not find Peers in the shop; he was in the counting-house—I went to the door of the counting-house—there is a board running across before the door—I met the boy Leech inside the shop door, and asked him where Peers was—he said he was in the counting-house along with Shire—I went to the door and looked in over the counter, and I saw Peers lying on the floor and the prisoner leaning over him, nearly kneeling—I turned back from the door and laid my coat down on the counter—I then saw the prisoner standing at the door of the counting-house—I spoke to him, and he did not seem to answer me—I said "Good day," or something of that kind to him—then I went to speak to Leech, who was standing at the door, and the prisoner came up to us, and said he was going across the way to have his dinner—he said there were two dinners ordered, and if Mr. Peers could not have his, would I and the boy have what was left—we said "Yes"—he said he would order it, and went away; the dinner never came—after the prisoner was gone, Leech and I went to the counting-house to get Peers up—Leech shook him, and he woke up directly; before he shook him, I observed the state of his dress: his waistcoat was unbuttoned and open, and his pocket turned out—when he woke up, I asked him for the price of the coat I had made—he went to put his hand in his pocket, and he could not do it, because it was turned out—I had never seen him drunk before—he did not look like a drunken man usually does—there was blood from his nose when he woke up—he did not look like a man sober, but he did not look like a man drunk: he looked like a man half drunk and half sober; it was a stupid look.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long had you worked for Mr. Lyons at that shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a year and a half—I have been in the habit of going there frequently, sometimes three or four times a-day—I had not been there before that day—I was there the day before, to get the coat that I brought home on the Wednesday: Peers was there then, and Leech also. You cannot see quite into the counting-house from the shop, only a part of it—Peers was lying down inside the door, you could see his feet—I think</p>

               <p>the door of the counting-house opens into the counting-house—the door was quite open—Peers' feet were about a yard from the door. I was to have 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for making the coat—I was not always paid when I took the article home, except I wanted the money; I told Leech I wanted the money, and he went into the counting-house—he was not gone half a minute—it was after that that I went in with him and observed Peers' pocket turned out. I followed Leech to the counting-house—that was the same time; we went in together; I only went in once—I only looked in the first time, when I saw the prisoner there. I have known the prisoner a long time. I afterwards went over to the Bell to see if he was there, or if he had had his dinner; that was about an hour afterwards—Peers went over first, and when he returned I went over—I did not see Peers sell any clothes—I only saw one pocket open. I was not paid for the coat then—I was paid by Mr. Lyons in the Cut on the Saturday following.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 36, Wellington Street, Clerkenwell. On the night of 18th July last, about half-past 10, I was going along Victoria Street with my father and sister—my father is a very elderly man, turned 50—my sister and I each had hold of his arm—an elderly man and woman came up to us, the woman poked her head in my father's face, and said something to him; I did not hear what exactly—she said she knew him—I told her she was mistaken, that he was my father, and we were going home—I was immediately attacked by three persons, the prisoners are two of them; the female prisoner commenced beating me very violently about the head—I had my shawl across my arm, and she began to drag at it—she beat me very dreadfully indeed for some time; I could not see what the others were doing, for the two women were beating me at once—I saw the male prisoner knock my father down and kick him—the female prisoner tore my bonnet off my head, and completely destroyed it. I held my shawl until I was beat insensible, and then it was taken from me; when I recovered my senses, my shawl was gone—I saw it again in the policeman's hands on Monday morning; it was worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

My father is not here—he was not examined before the Magistrate; he was very ill on the Monday, and was not called up—I was perfectly sober, and so was my sister—my father had been out all day, and had had a glass or two of liquor—I am not aware that the male prisoner ever lodged with a cousin of mine. This beating and fighting lasted about half-an-hour, as near as I can recollect—it was all on one side, for I had no power to give a blow back, nor had my sister or my father—I do not know whether the prisoners were drunk, they did not appear so—no policeman came up for half-an hour; the fire engine had gone along a little while before that, and that had attracted the policemen's attention, and the street was very lonely—directly I screamed, a policeman came to my assistance. The elderly man and woman came up first; they did not commence the row, they merely spoke, and then we were attacked by these people. The shawl was afterwards found in the ruins. I am quite sure I never heard of these people before—I have no cousin who keeps a lodging house.</p>

On the night of 18th July, about half-past 10 o'clock, I was going along Victoria Street, with my father and sister—an old woman came up and spoke to my father; I did not hear what she said. I asked if she knew my father, and she began to use foul language—the two prisoners and some others came up—the female prisoner struck me, and threw me into the road; I screamed for help, and the witness Mr. Chamberlain came to my assistance—I saw the male prisoner strike my father and kick him—I saw my sister struck by a woman not in custody, and also by the female</p>

               <p>prisoner—after she had struck me she dragged my mantle off, and when Mr. Chamberlain came up she threw it at my feet—I saw her and another woman dragging at my sister's shawl, which she had on her arm—I did not see them take it—I went and assisted in lifting my father up.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On 18th July, about half-past 10, or a little later, I was coming up Victoria-street, and noticed a disturbance on the opposite side of the way—I went across, and saw the female prisoner strike the last witness off the kerb into the road—I caught her, put her back, and went further into the crowd; and the two prisoners were knocking and beating the father and sister about—the father went down, and the male prisoner kicked him. In the scuffle there was a shawl lost, but who took it I know not. I called the police; No. 223, I believe, first came up, he took the female prisoner away; and No. 224 found the scarf.</p>

One of them, I can't say which, asked me for something to drink—I took them across to the Sussex Tavern, and gave them some ale. Directly after we came out, I felt a jerk at my watch chain—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket, with two guards attached to it—I immediately missed my watch, and called out to a policeman on the opposite side—the women had not time to get away—the policeman was directly opposite, and he came and seized them. I heard the prisoner throw the watch down an area grating, where it was after<lb/>wards found—I heard it go down; I did not see it go. I gave both the women in charge.

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Callaghan, who keeps the Duke of Sussex at Haggerstone Bridge. On 20th July, Johnson came about 9 o'clock in the evening—I served him with a pint of porter—I saw him take it to the door—he paid me with a shilling—I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and put the shilling in the till—there was some small money there, but no other shilling at the time. Johnson left, and in about 2 minutes my master went to the till—no one had been to the till in the meantime—he drew my attention to the only shilling in the till; I looked, and found it was bad—while he was talking to me about it, the two prisoners came in at another door, at the other end of the bar—I went to serve them, and Piers asked for half a quartern of gin—the price was 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling, I looked at it, tried it with my teeth, and found it was bad. I called out to my master, "Here is another bad shilling." Mr. Callaghan came to me—I put the shilling in his hand, and told him there was another bad shilling—I pointed to Piers, and said, "That is the person who gave it me." Mr. Callagan asked the prisoners if they knew it was bad, and</p>

I want to the bar where the last witness was serving—I went to the till and found a bad shilling in it, and no other shilling in the till—I spoke to the last witness about it, and that shilling I took care of. Just after that the two prisoners came in, and the last witness called me, and said, "Here is another bad shilling." The two prisoners were there, and he said in their presence that he took it of Piers—both the prisoners turned round and ran out of the house. I took that shilling up, and put the two shillings together in my waistcoat pocket—I ran after the prisoners—I afterwards gave them to the policeman. I had no other coin in that pocket.</p>

In about a minute, I saw them about ten yards from the house, running away—I followed them, and assisted the constable in taking them.</p>

I saw the two prisoners in company together about 150 yards from the Duke of Sussex—Charlotte Cooper, the last prisoner who was tried, was with them. After that, about 9 o'clock, I was near Haggeretone Bridge, and Mr. Callaghan came to me and pointed out the two prisoners, who were running down Haggerstone Lane, towards the church—I followed them—I took Piers in Kingsland Road. In coming back, accompanied by Smith, I found Johnson—I took them both hack to the Duke of Sussex. I received these two shillings from Mr. Callaghan. Johnson said he had never been in the house before—Piers said he was running away because his mate had passed a bad shilling, and he was not going to be locked up for it.</p>

I gave it him, and he went away. There was another person with him, but the prisoner gave me the shilling. It was about 10 o'clock in the evening.</p>

I received information, and about half-past 12 o'clock I went to a lodging house—I found the prisoner sitting on the step outside with another man—the other man was accusing the prisoner of having enticed him down to Brentford, saying there was plenty of work, and he was passing bad money—I asked where he had passed bad money, and he pointed to the Red Liou, and said, "He has passed three there,"—I said, "Where has he passed any more 9"—he said, "He has passed one in the public house on the other side, the new building;" that is the Feathers kept by Mr. Piper. I asked if he had passed any more—he said, "Yes, at a corner house up the lane," which might have been the Royal Oak. The prisoner said nothing—I took him in custody, and took him to the Red Lion; and the landlady gave me a bad shilling, and gave the prisoner in custody. He struck the other man who had informed against him, and I went to part them and he got my finger in his mouth and bit it—I took him to the station. This is the shilling I got from Mrs. Loader, and this one from Mrs. Piper. I found on him three good sixpences and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. all in copper—I found no bad money on him. The other man told me he kept bad money in the dog-kennel at the lodging house—I went there, and found this bent shilling there; that was at the house where I had found him sitting.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live in Bennett's Court Drury Lane. On Wednesday, 28th July, I went to a public house in Holborn with a friend—we had something to drink. While there the prisoner came in; she drank with us—she had a basket with her; this is it. After that I went with her to No. 11, George Street, St. Giles'—I undreseed and went to bed—she was partly undressed. I was not sober; I had been drinking. About 4 o'clock in the morning there was an alarm, when the prisoner was getting over the landing. The man of the house went out for the policeman himself. When I heard the alarm, I ran and looked at my trousers, and I missed from them 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. The prisoner was gone from the room. I had given her a shilling. I went down stairs—a constable came, and I wished the prisoner to give me the money and I would have nothing to do with her—she said all the money she had was half a crown and a few halfpence in her hand—I said I would give her in charge, and I did so. I over-slept myself the next morning, and I did not appear against her. I did not see what was in the basket on the night before when I was in the room—but she showed me a shilling and one of these moulds—that was in the room—I am not sure whether the mould was in the basket or not—the shilling was in her hand—she showed it to me; I looked and saw it was a shilling—I could not say whether it was good or bad—she said, "Look at this."</p>

I did not know the prisoner before. I am in no one's employ—I was in the Land Fencibles in the Crimea for a short time—I and my mother keep a room in Bennett's Court. I was in liquor; I can't say whether the prisoner was—if I were sober myself I should know the difference between a person being drunk and sober—I knew what I was about—the prisoner could not be very drunk; she might be in liquor, but I could not swear it. I paid for what we had. She showed me the mould; I could not say where she took it from; I saw it in her hand—I examined the shilling and gave it her back again—I dare say she put it in the basket—I never took particular notice. I mentioned about this at the Court House. I heard part of my examination read over—I did not hear it read about her showing me the shilling and the mould—I signed my examination—the words I said were read over to the Magistrate, not to me—I told the Magistrate about her having shown me the mould.</p>

Both the prisoner and the witness were in liquor when the charge was given. I said to the prisoner, "Do you know what you are charged with?—stealing 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of Reilly's pocket—she said, "All the money I have is this half crown, and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in coppers; and this half crown he gave me."

               <p>we came out of the house, she said, "Will you let me go? if you do, I will feel much obliged to you"—I said, "I can't do that"—she kept the basket in her hand—all through I demanded it of her in going to the station, and she refused to give it me—she said she would not. I took her into the station, and the charge was pressed against her by the prosecutor, stating he had lost the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner denied all the way through that she had any more money than the half-crown and 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I called Mrs. Reed, the female searcher, and demanded the basket again of the prisoner—she laid she would give it to Mrs. Reed, not to me. After they had retired, I went to her lodging to see if she had thrown any money away—I searched up and down with the lamp, but I could not find any—Mrs. Reed and the prisoner came in again, and Mrs. Reed placed this basket on the desk—she said she could not open it—I opened it, and found in it these four moulds and some old fragments of moulds which had been broken, and six half-crowns and seven shillings, all in this piece of paper.</p>

I made the search where the prisoner lodges—she gave her address; I went and found the address correct. She denied altogether that the basket belonged to her—she told the Magistrate that she did not know how the moulds came there—she said she met some young man who gave her something to drink, and who put the things in the basket she did not know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid at Exeter-hall Hotel in the Strand.

I put the shilling in the till—there was no other shilling there, I am quite sure—just as he went out, Mr. Hall came in and spoke to me, in consequence of which I looked at the shilling. I found it was bad—I gave it to Mr. Hall—he bent it, and left the house with it. I saw Butler again the same day; I am sure he is the man—I did not have the shilling lack—I did not see Godfrey.</p>

I afterwards went out at a qurter before 3 o'clock—I went through the Strand, and saw Godfrey again standing in front of the Adelphi Theatre. While he was standing there Butler joined him, and they walked as far as the Exeter-hall Hotel—Butler went in there, and Godfrey went up Exeter-street—I went into the hotel and asked some questions—when I came out I saw Godfrey standing at the corner of Burleigh-street, waiting there—I then returned to the hotel, and the last witness gave me this shilling from the till—I bit it, and took it out and gave it to the policeman—I then went after the prisoner—I saw Butler join Godfrey at the corner of Burleigh-street—they walked up to Exeter-street. I met a policeman, and made a communication to him—I gave the prisoners in custody for passing bad money—Butler's conduct was very riotous, he tried to throw the policeman—Godfrey was very quiet indeed; we left him—he might have walked away.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep an eating house in St. Pancras Road. On 17th July, the prisoner came and bought a penny pie; he gave me a half-crown—I laid it on the counter—my servant gave him two smooth shillings; one was of George the Third, the other was William the Fourth, or George the Fourth; they were worn shillings. I put them down, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers—the moment the prisoner saw it, he said, "I have got a penny, I thought it was a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pie—I would rather have the money back, and not change." I took up the penny which he gave me, and I gave him back the half-crown; he put down the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—the moment I took up the two shillings, I saw that one was bad—I took them up, and followed him; he had hastened out of the shop. I am able to say that one of those shillings was not one</p>

               <p>which I had given him—I did not give him the Victoria shilling which I bent. I did not see him take up the two shillings to my knowledge—I had stooped to pick up the penny which he had thrown over the counter; the two shillings were right before me—when I got up, I gave him the half<lb/>crown, and began to take up the two shillings, and I found one was bad—he left the moment I gave him the half-crown—I followed him twenty or thirty yards from my shop, he was eating his pie, and walking rather fast—I said to him, "Here is a bad shilling, I will thank you to change it"—he said, "I never gave it you." I collared him, and took him back to the shop—he said he had no other money. A constable was sent for—I gave him, the prisoner, into custody, and gave him the bad shilling.</p>

I did not see you with any one before I took you—I touched you and said, "I beg your pardon, this is a bad shilling."—I afterwards took you by the collar, and brought you baok; you did not run away. I can't say how long you waited before the policeman came. I did not hold you while you was waiting; I stood by the door, that you did not go out—the chair was standing opposite the counter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter carriers at the Gene<lb/>ral Post Office—in consequence of directions I received on 28th July, I made up a letter and enclosed in it a sovereign, a sixpence, and six postage stamps—I marked them all, and put them in a card which I put with the letter in an envelope—I did not direct it myself—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some frag<lb/>ments of papery</hi>), I recognise these as parts of the letter and envetope—the letter was directed to Mr. George Fielding, Nottingham-mews, High-street, Marylebone, London—that was a fictitious address—here are portions of the cards—I put two stamps on the envelope; I put them a little apart and in a slanting direction—I put the letter into the letter box at the chief office, between 1 and 2 in the day—I afterwards went inside the office and saw the letter taken out of the letter box—I kept it in my pos<lb/>session until about 10 minutes before 6 next morning—I then gave it to Green with certain instructions—the letters are sorted into districts in the Inland office; they are then sent upstairs to another office to the letter carriers' seats or districts—they are sent up by a machine in trays—about 10 minutes after 6 I went up and saw the prisoner at the tray in the letter carriers' office—he was a letter carrier for the Hyde-park-square walk—it would be his duty to be at the tray where I saw him, to collect the letters to clear them away—I saw him bring the letters for his own walk, and also another bundle of letters in his hand—he took them from the sorting box to his own seat—I saw him take one bundle of letters and run through them; he came to a letter with two stamps on it, which I imme<lb/>diately recognised as the one I had made up—he felt it in his fingers and shook it—he appeared to satisfy himself that it contained coin, and he put it amongst his other letters—it had been in the other bundle which belonged to Shuter, the letter carrier of the Nottingham Place district—he then put that bundle of letters on Shuter's seat, returned to his own seat, took his own letters down again, and selected the one I had seen him take from</p>

               <p>Shuter's bundle, feel it, and then put it amongst his own letters—he had no business at all with Shuter's letters he left the Post Office about 7 o'clock to deliver his letters—Shuter left about the same time—I stopped Shuter, and looked over his letters—in the ordinary course the letter in question would have been with Shuter's letters—I did not find it there—I after<lb/>wards went to Hyde-park-square, accompanied by the police constables, Bingham and Smee—I saw the prisoner go to the receiving house in Sussex-place; I was in a cab waiting near—it would be his duty to go to that receiving house after he had finished his delivery, to get a card signed of the time he had finished—that is done with every letter-carrier—another letter-carrier passed close by us and went into the receiving house—I then saw the prisoner come out and run across the road very fast, and round the corner—I went into the Victoria public house and there I found him—I had not seen him go in—I spoke to the potman, and I saw the prisoner coming from the water-closet, he was about ten or twelve yards from it—I told him I wanted him—I went out and saw Bingham, and desired him to search the closet, and he shortly afterwards brought me these papers.</p>

Whilst he was there Mr. Clare came in: he asked me some question, which I answered—soon after that, the prisoner came out of the closet, and met Mr. Clare at the street door—I had fastened the door leading to the water-closet at half-past 12 the night before, after the house was closed.</p>

In the ordinary course, this letter would have been amongst those which Tilson had to deliver—Tilson went out with his letters about 10 minutes after 7—I stopped him and searched his bundle, but found no such letter there—shortly after the letter-carriers had left, I sent Green after the prisoner, and he was brought back to my office—I asked him if he had seen a letter addressed to Fink-row, John's-row, St. Luke's—he said "I don't deliver Pink Row, but I have a letter for it," and he pulled this letter out of his coat pocket, and said, "Is this it?"—it was still sealed, but the address had been erased, and it was re-directed to Gee-street—the prisoner does deliver in Gee Street—I asked him how far he had delivered his letters when he was fetched back by Green—he said he had delivered Gee-street, Willow-street or Willow-row, and Noble-street—I am quite sure he said Gee-street—I asked him who re-directed the letter—he said, "I do not know, it came to me the last thing."—I have a memorandum here of the words that passed, which I made at the time; the prisoner saw me write it—what he said was, "I do not deliver Pink-row, but I have a letter for it—it is re-directed—I do not know who re-directed it—I had finished Gee-street, Willow-row, and Noble-street, before Mr. Green told me I was wanted." I then gave him into custody—he was searched—a letter was found on him that did not belong to him; it belonged to the Aldersgate-street walk.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This letter directed to Pink-row I suppose had a fictitious address? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prisoner has been in the Post-office upwards of 2 years, and bis father for nearly 30 years. I have not charged him with stealing any letters but this, but there was another found in his pocket which did not belong to him, and that contained a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note when it was delivered—I have not preferred any charge against him in respect to that letter; it is a rule if a letter-carrier discovers that he has in error taken out a letter belonging to another district, that he should go with it to the proper address immediately after he has finished his own delivery—supposing this letter, re-directed to Gee-street, came into his delivery for Pink-row, it would be his duty to deliver it in Gee-street—I am not aware that there is such a person as Mrs. Johnson at 15, Gee-street—if he ascertained there was no such person, it would be his duty to put it in his pocket and bring it back to the Post-office. He told me he did not deliver Gee-street, but it came to him the last thing—that means as they were just going out—sometimes when the letter-carriers are going out letters keep coming to them up to the very last minute, after they have got their main bundle; they are perhaps letters that have been overlooked in the sorting—the prisoner did not tell me that he had been to 15, and found no such person there—he did not tell me that there was a letter-box at 15, and that he was in the habit, when he delivered there, of putting the letters through the letter-box in the inner door—I don't remember his saying so in my presence—it might have been said in my presence, but I don't remember its being said in answer to any question that I put.</p>

At that time there was no erasure on the envelope; there was no "Gee-street" on it—in consequence of Mr. Clare's instructions, I put that letter into the tray containing the letters for the Bartholomew-square district. I saw the tray placed on the machine, and drawn up into the letter-carrier's office—I immediately went up into the letter-carrier's office,</p>

               <p>and gave some instructions to Mr. Roberts, who was the inspector on duty there; that was about 3 or 4 minutes past 6—a little before 8, in consequence of directions, I went after the prisoner—I found him in his district—his ordinary course was to go to Gee-street first, then to Willow-row, Pear-tree-street, and so on. I found him in Pear-tree-street; I brought him back to Mr. Clare; I saw him take this letter from his coat pocket—I then saw the address had been altered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers—on the morning of 12th July, shortly before 6, a communication was made to me by Mr. Green; I was at that time in the letter-carriers' office. In consequence of that communication, I paid particular attention to the prisoner's movements; after a short time, I observed him go to Tilaon's seat, and divide the letters into three parts; the letters were lying on Tilson's seat—I had seen the letters placed there by a letter-carrier named Jones, when they came up by the machine—it was the prisoner's duty to divide them. Tilson not being there—I saw him divide them into three bundles. I had previously been shown this letter—whilst the prisoner was dividing the letters I saw this letter; I saw the prisoner place it amongst his own letters, instead of placing it amongst Tilson's—before that, I saw him, as he had got it in his hand, turn it over and feel it—no one was assisting him in dividing the letters; he was occupied at it for about a quarter of an hour—he then took the letters belonging to his own walk to his own seat, this letter being amongst them—I then saw him writing; I could not see what he wrote; he was writing long enough to have re-directed two or three letters; he then tied up the letters, and went out for delivery. I was in the solicitor's room, when he was brought back; I believe I asked him if he had delivered letters at 15, Gee-street; he said he had, he thought three; he delivered them by knocking at the door, and placing them in a box, in an inner door—he saw no one. I saw Tilson come in and go to his seat before the prisoner went out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from where the prisoner was sorting the letters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five yards. I was in a gallery where you have a good view of all the letter-carriers—I had a perfect view of all that was going on—I did not keep my eye upon him wholly—there is a passage underneath where the letters are occasionally sorted, and he went there to fetch some; with that exception, I had my eye upon him the whole time—I have mentioned before to-day, that I saw him feel the letter and turn it over—I mentioned it to the solicitor; I did not mention it before the magistrate—this was a test letter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Haydon. I was in his shop on the evening of the 21st of July—I saw the female Loveday there; she put a shilling in Mrs. Haydon's hands—when she left the shop, my mistress told me to follow her—when I got out Bide the shop, I saw her going across the road, when King came up and met her—they went across the road again, and went down Whitecross-street together a little way and came up again, and, as they were coming up, I saw the man pass a shilling into the woman's hand—they then both went on together till they came near Mr. Ellis's, a greengrocer—the man went ahead, and the woman stopped at Mr. Ellis's and asked for a halfpenny worth of goose<lb/>berries—she gave the boy at the shop a shilling—he gave it to his mistress, who bounced it on the counter, and put it in her pocket—then I went in—the woman had change given to her—when the woman came out of Mrs. Ellis's she went along with the man till they came close by Arbour-square—before they got there, the man gave the woman a shilling—they then went across the road to Mr. Howlett's, the doctor's, at the corner of Arbour-square—the woman went in, and the man remained outside, nearly opposite—I stood outside the shop—when she came out, she went along on the same side about two yards, and then crossed the road again—I then went into the doctor's shop, and made a statement—when I came out again, the two prisoners were both together on the other aide of the way—I went across the road, and followed them right close up—just by the George they stopped; there was a post the female prisoner was passing by—the male prisoner put a shilling by the post, and, after she had passed, he trod upon it—the male prisoner picked up the shilling again, and swallowed it—the prisoners then crossed the road, and opposite the George they stopped by the German Chapel—they then went on again pretty near up to Cannon-street, when they separated—before they did so, he said to her, "You go across the road." I walked on a bit till I came up to a policeman, when I gave the woman in charge—before they separated, I saw the man drop something into her hand—he had a silk pocket-handkerchief; he let down the corner of it, and I saw some silver—he took some shillings out—he wrapped it up, and put it into his side pocket—when I met the constable I told him what I had seen, and he took the woman into custody—I heard the sound as of a shilling dropped on to the pavement—there was a crowd,</p>

I did not give you into custody at the same time as the woman, because the policeman only caught hold of her. I said it was a black handkerchief—I did not say it was silk. I told the policeman I could swear to you by your clothes; I said you had a black coat on—I said nothing about a jacket—I described your dress when I went into the station—after the woman was given in charge I said the man had black corded trowsers on, a black coat, and a cap—I said I could swear to you by your corded trowsers and black cap—it was about half-past 8 to 9 o'clock when I first saw you at Mr. Ellis's shop. I was right behind you when I saw you give the woman a shilling—I could tell it was a shilling—I saw you put it into her hand.</p>

I took her to Mrs. Haydon's shop, when she identified her, and I then took her to the station-house.

                  <hi rend="italic">King's Defence.</hi> On the 21st July, Wednesday evening, I left my house between 6 and 7 o'clock to go to Mr. Middleton's, in Chambers-street, Minories, to inquire for Louisa Judge, a woman I had been keeping company with; I stopped there from 7 in the evening until 10 o'clock at night, and then left her—I then went to 11, Wilson-place—I pulled off my corderoy jacket and gave it to the woman to mind, and I put this jacket on with the intention to go down to Limehouse-causeway—as I was passing Arbour-street station I found a quantity of people collected; I was not there more than five minutes when the boy ran right up against me and cried, "Why do you not get out of the way"—he went on, and then came back and took hold of my collar, and said, "This is one of them which was along with the woman;" with that the policeman inside the door came and took me—the boy says he can swear to me; that I had a pair of corded trowsers and a black cap—I asked him whether it was a black jacket; he said, "No;" he said "I can swear to you, you had a pair of corded trowsers and a black cap—the inspector said, "Have you not seen this woman?" I said, "No;" he then said, "Do you not live with her at 9, Commercial-road?" I said, "No, I live in Wilton-street, Spitalfields"—I was in an agitated state of mind at the time, not knowing what I was charged with—if he had let me alone I should have given him the right number; I after<lb/>wards told the policeman I did not live at 9, I lived at 11, and that is correct—I can prove by two or three witnesses that the boy is under a mistake; I was never out in the road at that time of night; I am utterly ignorant of the woman, who knows I am not the man that was with her—I call James Middleton, Louisa Judge, and Mary Ann Middleton. [<hi rend="italic">They were called but did not answer.</hi>] They understood I was to be tried yesterday.</p>

I am barmaid at the Royal Oak public-house, Poplar—on the evening of 12th July last, at about half-past 7, I was serving in the bar; the prisoners Potterton and Cave came in, and I served them with half a quartern of gin and peppermint—Potterton gave me half-a-crown: it was a good one—I gave him in change a florin and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of coppers—I put the half-crown in the till—Potterton asked for a small glass; I got him a smaller glass, when he said he would make the first one do, and I put the other back again—they drank the gin and peppermint—Potterton then said, would I give him smaller change for the florin? and he put the florin in my hand; I gave him in change two 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces—I put the florin in the till—he gave one of the shillings to Cave—they then went away—I did not see Ward—there were about ten people in front of the bar at the time—almost immediately after they had gone, a person of the name of King came in and spoke to me—I then looked into the till—no one had been to it in the meantime—I took out the florin and found it was a bad one; it was on the top of the other silver—I did not examine the rest of the money in the till—there was another florin at the bottom of the other silver: there was about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of silver—I am quite certain from the position of the other florin it was not the one I had put in the till, or that Potterton gave me—I gave the bad florin to King, who shortly afterwards returned with a person named Winter, bringing in Potterton and Cave in custody—King gave me the bad florin again—a constable was sent, and they were given into custody.</p>

               <p>into her mouth and bit it, and then said it was a bad one—my mate Winter was with me at the time—we left the Royal Oak, and followed them right away down Millwall, to a little beer-shop called the "Times Brewery Tap."—Potterton and Cave went into the Times Brewery Tap; Ward was walking about on the other side of the way—they remained in the beer-shop a very short time; when they came out, they went down the road again, and the other one joined them—I went on ahead of them to find a policeman, and left my mate to watch them—they went to the Islanders public-house—I and Winter went in and told them they must consider themselves in our custody—Ward had walked away towards Mill wall—they wanted to know what I took them in custody for; I said, "For passing bad money"—they said they knew nothing about it. I brought them directly up to the Royal Oak, and handed them over to a police constable—it was half an hour after I saw them at the Royal Oak, that I took them into custody at the Islanders—when I took the two prisoners back to the Royal Oak, I gave the florin back to the barmaid; I kept it in my pocket by itself, while it was in my possession—I afterwards took Ward into custody on the canal-bridge, Blackwall, in about two hours.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 1, Cavendish-square, and am principal manager of Sir Claude Scott's bank; the firm consists of Samuel Scott and another—the prisoner was in their employment as city collecting clerk, and had been for about two years—his duty was to collect the sundries east, the city articles, the bills and drafts lying in the east part of London, in the city—by the word "article," I mean a cheque, bill, or draft, or anything of that kind.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> According to the practice of the bank, how would be account for those amounts which had not been paid him at the banks where he had been collecting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He enters them in his walk-book as "returns," and then hands the draft itself, or an article or a ticket representing that draft, to the keeper of the sundries east, or undues—the draft is supposed to be left for acceptance at the bank; it may be an article that is only a day's date—if he retains the draft, he hands it to the keeper of the sundries; if he leaves it behind him, he hands in a ticket representing it—these tickets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in the prisoner's writing—this is "C. A., Jones, for acceptance, Hall, West, &amp; Co." means a bill of Hall, West, &amp; Co. of Brighton, on Jones, Loyd; this represents it: the date is 9th June, 1858; that means the date upon which the article is left for acceptance; but it is wrong in this instance—the "C. A." means "Cash Article"—the other ticket is "C. A., Hankey; Harvey &amp; Co. 295<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 9th July, 1858"—that was for acceptance also. On Saturday morning, 10th July, in conse<lb/>quence of matters which had occurred, the prisoner was called into Mr. Scott's private room—Mr. Scott, Mr. Tyson, the prisoner, and myself were present—these two tickets were lying on the table before Mr. Scott; Mr. Scott handed them to the prisoner and said, "Can you account for these articles, Mr. Jervis?"—the prisoner replied, "They are drafts left for acceptance"—Mr. Tyson said, "No, they are not; I have ascertained this morning that that is not so"—the prisoner then hung down his head, and said, "I can't say"—Mr. Scott said, "Well, but that is very singular, Mr. Jervis; you must give us some explanation"—he replied, "All I can say is, that all the moneys I have received I have brought home"—Mr. Scott said, "But how about this particular sum (referring to Hankey's tioket); we have ascertained that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160050"/>
               <p>they paid you that amount, being the amount of their charge: do you mean to say that that has not been paid you?"—the prisoner held down his head and said nothing—after waiting a few minutes, he was again asked if he could afford any explanation respecting the tickets, and he then repeated what he bad said before, "I can say nothing, but that all the moneys I have collected I have brought home"—Mr. Scott was then called out of the room for a moment—I then told the prisoner that we had found out all about it, and could not he explain it at once, and save us further trouble—he shrug<lb/>ged his shoulders and said nothing—I then asked him if he could give us the money for those tickets—he said no, he could not, the money was gone—he was given into custody immediately afterwards.</p>

I believe he said, "No, I cannot; the money is gone"—I wrote down what he said afterwards—he had said 2 or 3 minutes before to Mr. Scott that all the money he had received he had paid in—I don't remember his saying, "My books will explain all that I have done; "he might have said so, but I do not remember that he did—the pocket walk-book was not produced, but the walk-book east was—Glyn's charge on 5th July was not received by the prisoner; it is not in this book at all—the whole of Glyn's charge on 5th July is in Gliddon's handwriting, for Gliddon collected it—there are a great number of entries, amounting to 2,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—Gliddon is one of our assisting-clerks—all the work with Glyn's that day was transacted by Gliddon, and this book shows it—the prisoner had to collect money on drafts, and to go to the Bank of England—he had occasionally to go to the India-house—he never received dividends there—these items probably represent East India stock paid into the Bank of England—he very seldom had business there—he had to go to our brokers in Lothbury, and to do business there—he had messages given to him from myself, Mr. Scott, and others, almost every day; it was his duty to attend to those—he occasionally delivered letters when wanted, and had to bring back the results of his messages and inquiries, that was what he was sent for—he had rents to collect at times, and payments to make; he paid for our stock purchases; he had to make those payments, in smaller or larger sums, at a great many different places, and to give an account when he returned of all that he had done—he had to present bills for acceptance at the houses within his beat—anything out of the way was given to a notary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he complained repeatedly of having too much work on his beat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have heard him make such a complaint, but I thought it unjust—on the day in question we sent in Gliddon to assist him; that was not particularly on account of his complaint—he did not complain to Mr. Scott, nor was Gliddon sent in consequence—he had complained several months before—Mr. Scott is not here—when I thought it necessary, we were in the habit of sending Gliddon to assist the prisoner, not when I thought it unusually heavy; Gliddon had other business to transact, and when he went into the city he assisted the city clerk—I do not remember such a thing occurring as assistance being sent in consequence of his complaints—I have been the manager for 6 or 8 months; Mr. Tyson was my pre<lb/>decessor—the prisoner was given into custody and taken before the magistrate the same day, upon these very charges that are now being inquired into—inquiry was made before the magistrate whether the notes received on these articles were paid in, and evidence was taken from the different bankers' clerks; we said that they were not paid in; we charged him with embezz✗</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160051"/>
               <p>ment—I believe the clerk took the depositions—after it was said that the notes were not paid in, the book containing the entries of the notes was called for, the book in which the numbers and dates of the notes were entered; that is, the cash article waste-book—it is impossible for me to answer whether on that book being produced it turned out that the very notes received from the bankers on these articles were paid in—I can't say that I produced from my pocket one of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes that was paid on these very articles; a 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that he had received was produced in court, I can't say who produced it; I think I produced it; it was one of the notes that the prisoner brought home the day preceding; I think it was the note he had received from Hankey's charge which he said was not paid him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the magistrate upon that refuse to proceed upon that charge, and did you then take other cases? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was unassisted by a solicitor, and Mr. Long said the evidence was not complete—we had a remand on that day—when Mr. Mullens came he reserved that charge for future attention—I can't say that he formally abandoned that charge before the magistrate, I have no knowledge of it—I cannot say whether the depositions were gone on with that day; I should think it very unlikely—I believe Mr. Mullens said he should not offer any evidence as to that charge, but he should proceed to others; he did proceed to others—The walk-book is not made up over-nights to a great extent—I should think the drafts of the 9th are not entered on the 8th, the practice that obtains in our house is upon any very heavy day, say the 4th of the month, to detain the clerks to enter over-night the articles that they have got to collect in the morning, but that is an unusual occurrence; I should say on the day in question it was not done; they are entered in the morning before he goes out—it is not our practice to enter them by anticipation; it might have been so on that occasion—he goes out at 10 o'clock—he comes to the bank at 10 minutes to 9, he is generally early—before he goes out he has to make these entries; he has also to stamp the drafts and sort them; there are very few drafts come in in the morning, it applies chiefly to the amounts coming in the day preceding—the line drawn in the middle of the page does net indicate morning drafts, they may be taken from the undues of the day preceding; these are the bills—bills and cash articles are kept separate; we call them sundries and morning drafts; the sundries are taken from the undue sundries of the day preced<lb/>ing, and the morning drafts are added to them—there may be four or six, I should say six was the outside—I am speaking of morning drafts or un<lb/>dues, for which a ticket or something has been given—I do not know that those on the other side of the line that is drawn, are made up on the over<lb/>night—the bills are entered in the morning generally, very seldom at night, they are occasionally—his duty is to make every entry before he goes out; they are all entered in anticipation of collection—the pocket walk-book is his private memorandum, he makes that up as he goes on, whilst on his walk—as soon as each of those books is concluded or posted up it becomes to a certain extent waste-paper; it is not kept—it is the property of the bank; it is found by the bank; they are put away with our other books—he renders them to us, but we are not strict on the point—I do not mean to say that we have all these books of two years ago, we are not bound to keep them; the clerk should return them after they are completed; it is not the practice to destroy them for a year or two; they ought to be kept for three or four years and then be destroyed—we have all the prisoner's walk-books, and I should say we have a great many others; we keep them in regular methodical order—there is no clerk to whom they are given, they</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160052"/>
               <p>are put in a certain place, sometimes under the desk in a place reserved for them, and sometimes in a desk; but it is an extraordinary thing that the prisoner is almost the only clerk that has regularly kept them; we are not particular about their being kept; they are not made up totally with the walk-book, but merely with the private book—they were all in his desk—we broke open the desk; I believe he gave up the key without knowing that we had done so; I think he gave it to me the next morning when we charged him with it—I can't say whether or not we told him that we had broken open his desk—I don't remember whether I asked him for the key or whether he gave it up to me; he might have seen that it was broken open when he came to business in the morning, and no doubt he did—when articles are stated not to be due they should be asked for—the clerks do not check every item each evening—there is no clerk to whom he would make his return, hand over the sundries, and go over the account—he makes up his walk-book on his return, with the assistance of the articles that he brings home—everything he collects he brings home, and the rest he must account for in bank-notes or payments—when he comes home the walk-book is handed to him and he makes the entries against each item, whether they are paid or not—supposing he said an article was not due, we should expect him to bring it home; he ought to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What does "not due" mean? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For instance, to-day is the 19th, we will suppose that he has an article due on the 25th, and he presents that inadvertently; he ought not to take it out with him, and the banker does not pay it, saying, "It is not due till the 25th"—the inadvertence is in the walk-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The item of cash articles 12,138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 9th July, would include such as those of Hankey's, Jones', and so on. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if they are not specified by name underneath in the morning drafts—any one of the drafts or bills that he has returned as not due, may be entered in the walk-book, either under the head of cash articles in a lump, or in detail as a morning draft—this is a mass of bills, drafts, and cheques, taken from the sundries east-walk-book—those are what he has to collect that day, and the labour would be too great if he had to enter them all seriatim—these bills are to be received besides—the lump is the total of the drafts sent in to us for collection the day preceding and some of the drafts entered underneath that had only come in for collection that morning—the specified articles are the morning drafts and undues; undues is a short term which we use signifying sundries undue—drafts that remain in our house for several days being undue, are entered each day as undue, until they come to maturity, and they are then given him to collect with the morning drafts—the bills do not go into the balance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the reason why you keep the bills distinct from the cash articles? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The cash articles form our balance of cash every day, the bills do not, and it is to meet that balance every day that the prisoner has been obliged to make these particular entries, otherwise it would have been discovered directly—it is to meet the balance, which is struck every day in every banking-house, that he has been obliged to do this—we strike a balance every day of all the amounts received and paid—these drafts are treated as cash, and called cash articles—the bills are entered distinctly; they do not come into the cash balance, they are entered seriatim in this book, which is kept by another clerk, and this pocket walk-book ought to contain a list of them—the pocket walk-book of 9th July contains the total amount; that is taken from the sundries east, which contains each article</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160053"/>
               <p>seriatim; you will find the figures tally—the prisoner could always see that book—he takes the amount from it, and he takes the instruments themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The other book you speak of is kept by another clerk, who furnishes the account to the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The prisoner himself takes it from the book—it is generally done by himself, he trusts to his own work—I do not think we treat our cash articles differently from other banks—if a customer pays in a country cheque, we sometimes treat it as cash and sometimes not; sometimes it is entered as a bill, and sometimes as a cash article, as the case may be—a country cheque takes four or five days to clear—If it is a large amount we enter it as a bill, because it gives a fictitious cash balance; if it is a small amount, it may, or may not, be entered as a cash article—drafts not yet due we sometimes enter as cash articles, and sometimes not; if it has only a day or two to run, it is put in as cash, to the credit of the customer when received—that is not at all an unusual practice with banks; every bank in London does so—it is not the constant practice for what has been put in as a cash article to be returned as not due; it is so occasionally—here is one on 9th July of 46<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and one on the 7th—If he does not bring back the article, he is required to give a ticket—he ought to bring in the article itself next day—this mark is not meant for ditto, it may mean <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> for acceptance or anything—in the case of the 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which was returned as not due, the article itself was given in—it was not given in to me, I merely speak from the book—there is no reference made to it here—in the case of the 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Glyn's, the article was not asked for, because there was no occasion to ask for it—I am not the party to whom he gave in the walk, therefore I cannot say, I only tell you what is written here, "not due"—generally speaking, if an article is returned as not due the article itself ought to be insisted upon and not a ticket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I understood you to say just now that if there is simply an entry "not due," and the bill is not left for acceptance, the instrument itself ought to be brought back? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if it is left for acceptance we have one of these tickets instead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the result of the transaction of the 5th July would be that the two articles 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. with Glyu's, and 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with Jones, Loyd. would be represented as left with them because they were not due, and tickets brought to represent them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then those tickets would be taken up by him when the money was paid in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were charged out on the 9th, and two fresh tickets paid in—if the money was paid on the 9th, the tickets given in on the 5th would be given up to the prisoner, and he would destroy them; they would be given to him instead of the others, just as any other voucher.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That would not enable him to check them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not till he comes back—he is told that there is a gross sum, which is the amount of the yesterday's cash articles, and the instruments are given to him to collect upon; that is all he knows at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then what is the object of the pocket walk-book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he should take them all down seriatim, and, when he comes back, the total casting of this book ought to agree with the total casting of the other; it is a sort of private memorandum-book, to enable him to account for his day's transactions—in the account he has given of that day, the 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. are deducted from the total; the private walk-book shows that—it mentions the amount with reference to the London and County Bank, and, at the end of the day, Glyn also—I did not say that the deduction of 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. appeared without any explanation, it has "Glyn" to it; there is no explanation beyond that—there is also a deduction of the 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of Jones, Loyd—those two items are deducted from what he renders an account of on 5th July—according to the practice of the bank he would have to collect that 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as a demand still due upon Glyn's upon subsequent days, until the time arrived when it would be payable—on the 9th, Glyn and Jones are entered as a part of the charge that he had to collect on that day; he here accounts for the receipt five days before, of that 499<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and then he reports them as not being paid on the 9th—he makes deductions represented by those two tickets, he makes the former two paid, and he deducts these two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are they put as not due, or for acceptance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> For acceptance—these tickets being marked "for acceptance," we should not ask for the documents themselves, we never do when they are for acceptance—those two amounts are deducted from the total receipts of the 9th—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that has</p>

               <p>been spoken of I produced as a not received, as I understood, by the prisoner from Hankey's, on the 9th; it was paid in by him on the 9th—I can speak of that 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note because I inquired of Hankers myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not repeatedly said to the prisoner, when there has been some difficulty in ascertaining where a particular error arose, "We cannot stop here all night, just give a ticket and set it right in the morning"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect having done so; I will not swear I have not, because sometimes we are 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. wrong, and a ticket for that amount is not objectionable, but for a large amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I should not say so—those tickets would say, "City walk, short so much"; they would not state that a particular article was not paid in—if we left a charge behind</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160057"/>
               <p>for examination we should have to go and get it—I do not recollect having told him to give tickets when the amount has been small, I may have done so when it has been a few pence—signed tickets are given at present—I say it is not customary to give unsigned tickets—I believe they were given previous to this prosecution, but I can only speak from 1st July—I did not give them at all when I took the walk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you told the prisoner that the walk was too heavy for him, that there was too much business for one man to do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At times; at times we are very busy and it required two, and I have stated so—I always sympathised with him when he had too much to do, and did my best to get him assistance—we were very busy in July, it is a busy month.</p>

I am a widow, and keep the White Swan public-house in Keate-street, Spitalfields—on Tuesday morning, 6th July, between 1 and 2, the deceased, Eliza Simpson, was in front of my bar—she had three half-pints of porter—she left when I closed the house; she was then quite well and hearty—she had the old relics of a black eye, that had happened five weeks ago: with that exception, she had not the least mark on her face—I saw the prisoner at my house that morning—he came about a quarter-past 1—he stopped until 2, when I closed the house—towards 4 o'clock that morning, I heard a cry of murder, and I saw the prisoner come out of 5, Keate-street, followed by Simpson—she said, "You vagabond, I will stick to you; I will give charge of you"—he replied, making use of a bad word, "If you don't leave off, I will pay you again"—she followed him to the end of the court, and held hold of him—he was in his shirt sleeves, for he had left his coat and boots at my house; likewise his fiddle—I looked out of a side window and said to him, "Leave off, don't injure the woman; what have you been up to?"—he went round in front of the house (it is a corner house) she still followed him, to give charge of him, continuing to lay hold of his shirt, and he said, "If you don't leave go, I will pay you again"—when they got in front of the house, he hit her—she had got hold of his hair—she fell; he was on the top of her, and he hit her twice and kicked her on the left side of the head with his wooden leg; she remained on the ground after he had kicked her, between 5 and 10 minutes, with her arm on her head, quite insensible—I went to the back window to see if I could see a policeman: I saw one in the Commercial-road, but not within call—in the meantime, the prisoner stood over at the opposite side, ap<lb/>parently in a very great rage: he was jumping about, and his brother went and knocked at the door for him to be let in—he lodged nearly opposite—the woman was taken in to 7, and I went in to bed—when I got up in the morning, I went to see how she was; I found her in a very bad state, dreadfully bruised and beaten—she complained dreadfully of her head—she had a bruise on her jaw and a serious black eye, and she said she could not see out of it—that was the left eye: it was the right eye that had the re<lb/>mains of the black on it—I saw her every day during the week, and three or four times a day—she continued to complain dreadfully of her head, and said she should go mad with it; she had it bound up, and had a lotion to foment it with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was she in the habit of coming to your house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; for the last four years—the prisoner was seldom in my house—he was a fiddler—he and the deceased were not drinking together that evening—she was not a woman of loose character—they were friendly: they were on the greatest terms of friendship, I mean, as to speaking merely: there was no animosity—on the 11th, the night before she died, she came to my house, and brought some things to leave, as she had no money; she had one half-quartern of rum; she said she thought it would lull her pain—she came herself, and her husband took her upstairs; it was as late as 11 o'clock—while she was in front of the bar, on the morning of the 6th, there was another woman there who struck her, but she was not hurt: it was not a fight—the back part of her head came against the partition, but it was not hurt in the least—I would not have minded having two or three such knocks—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160063"/>
               <p>she? did not complain of it—the woman struck her with her fist—it might have been two blows: they had been quarrelling a little before—I was not examined at the inquest—I was subpœnaed here—the prisoner's brother was there as a witness—he is here</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was this altercation between the women? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between 1 and 2—it was in front of the bar—I was present the whole time and I forbid it—this was before she was struck by the prisoner—I closed my house at 2, and went to bed, and it was about half-past 3, as near as I can tell, when I saw the deceased again—she remained in the house half an hour after the altercation was over—during that time, she did not complain of any injury that she had received from the other woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live at 3, Keate-street—about 4 o'clock on the morning of 6th July I was in bed, and heard screams of murder—it was a woman's voice, it came from 5, which is pretty well opposite 3—there are no windows in the casement—I can see the landing of 5 from my room—I saw the prisoner and the deceased on the landing—he had got hold of her by the hair pf her head, and he punched her three times in the face and knocked her down, and after he had knocked her down, he kicked her—she still kept screaming out, "Oh, you have murdered me!"—I told him to leave off abusing her, or I should go and fetch a policeman; he said, "If you come down, I will serve you the same," and made use of bad language—he then came down stairs, and she followed him, saying she would give him in charge—they came down the street, and I shut my window, and saw no more of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at 2, Spital-square—on Monday morning, 12th July, very early, I was called by the police to go to 5, Keate-street, to see the body of Eliza Simpson—I found her lying on the bed undressed, and quite dead, but warm—I made a superficial examination of her head and face—there were three principal bruises over the head and face, one over the left temple and eye, that was the most severe; there was a large one on the lower jaw, on the left side, and one on the right upper lip—there were also slight bruises about the body, nothing of any importance, nor were there any broken bones—I examined the body to see, but could discover none—forty hours afterwards, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the viscera generally were perfectly healthy—I opened the head; on raising the scalp I found the flesh beneath the discolouration on the left temple, bruised down to the bone, and infiltrated with blood—I removed the skull cap in the usual way; I found it remarkably thin, I don't think I ever saw one so thin—the membranes of the brain were somewhat congested, but there was nothing remarkable about them—the substance of the brain was perfectly healthy throughout, but lying on it and compressing it, was a large coagulum of blood, corresponding to the bruised temple—the skull was not fractured anywhere—the effusion of blood on the brain might be caused by a blow or blows from a wooden leg—there was also a large quantity of fluid blood effused beneath the membranes of the brain, floating over the left side of the brain—blows from a wooden leg would produce those results and appearances—blows on other parts of the head might possibly conduce to those appearances without manifesting any external injury; but I should think that not at all likely, for this reason, that where this blood was found there is a small artery that supplies the membranes of the brain with blood, that artery enters the brain at its base, behind the eye, and runs up in a groove through the bone in such a way that it is sometimes lacerated or ruptured by the springing of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160064"/>
               <p>skull, without a blow, and therefore that might take place from a blow on any part of the hemisphere—I do not expect that was the case here, I think it was the blow on the temple—the coagulum I saw corresponded with the blow on the temple, and this vessel is beneath where the coagulum was—I examined the back part very carefully, but saw no trace of any blow or any injury whatever—I certainly did not examine the scalp at the back particularly; I did not dissect it, but there was nothing there of any importance—I ascribed the death to the injury which produced the dis<lb/>colouration on the left temple, there was nothing else observable in any other part of the body to account for death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Seeing the external bruise and seeing the coagulum of blood inside, you conjecture that the blow inflicted externally, produced the blood, and consequently death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a head falling against a piece of wood might have produced the external injury, or falling down stairs, or falling upon any hard substance—I do not think a blow from a woman's hand in fighting would do it—it is difficult to say how long before death the injury might be inflicted, and the coagulum formed; it might be three or four, or two days, or possibly a couple of weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother, and live in Lower Keate-street, next to the White Swan public-house—on Monday night, 5th July, I went to bed about 9 o'clock, quite sober, with the hopes of going to work next morning at 6—I was called up about 1 o'clock, and I went and had part of some beer with my brother, a man named Butcher, and other parties at the White Swan—Eliza Simpson was there; she was in a state of drunkenness in front of the bar, smoking a pipe; she pulled me about sundry times—I left about 3 o'clock, or thereabouts—before I left I saw a woman take Simpson by the hair of the head with her right hand, and with her left knock her head continually against the front of the wainscoating of the bar-parlour—I could not say how many times she did it, but they were repeated blows in the face and head—Simpson struggled with her till she got free—I had known her for a long time, she was continually given to liquor, in fact, she has scarcely ever been free from black eyes since I have known her—she had the remains of one then—I saw that done, by a man who lives with the landlady of the house, and a man named Butcher, knocking her about in front of the bar; she had caught hold of the man by the hair of his head—she was in the habit of pulling people about in that manner when she was drunk, and the men were both striking her—When I left the White Swan, I went home to bed—I was called up again by my wife about 4 o'clock—I then saw my brother and the deceased at the corner of Keate-street, she had hold of him by the left arm of his shirt and the hair of his head, in a stooping position; and he made a blow at her; before that he said to her, "If you dont leave go of me, I shall strike you;" she would not, and he struck her, I believe in the mouth—I did not see him strike her any more—he made an attempted blow, but I don't believe he struck her—he then recovered himself, pulled some half<lb/>pence out of his pocket, and said they wanted to rob him—I said to him, "Now I think you have been in that company long enough, get away out of it"—I had seen her the week previously—3 or 4 in the morning was her time to go to bed.</p>

                  </hi>.

On 19th July, I went to Union-court, Holborn-hill, about 9 o'clock in the evening—I found the prisoner at the Union public-house with two other persons—I went to him and said, "I want you for picking a woman's pocket in Fleet-street, last night"—he said, "I don't know anything at all about it"—I asked him where his rough jacket was—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I told him he must go with me to the station—he said, no, he should not—I took him by the collar, and told him he was in my custody—they commenced fighting and kicking, and one of his companions got both my arms behind me, and they dragged the prisoner away; he made his escape—I saw him again on Saturday night, 7th August, in Upper White<lb/>cross-street; I followed him—he went into a public-house—I went to him, and said, "I suppose you know what I want with you?"—he said, "Yes, master, I do; I was coming on Monday to give myself up"—I have known the prisoner about two years—I know this coat (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>), I have seen the prisoner wear it, I might say some hundreds of times—I saw him on 18th July, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and he had this coat on—I saw him again on Monday morning, the 19th, without any coat at all; then it was between 9 and 10 o'clock, before I had received information of this robbery—when I took him in the evening, he had a smooth cloth coat—I have not the least doubt that this rough coat is the coat the prisoner wore—I know it by the colour of it, the cut, and a button off the collar.</p>

               <p>apartments, for which she received but a very small remuneration, and whilst she was doing so, having no inducement to remain at home, I was given to the practice of spending at a public-house more than she could possibly earn in the meanwhile. At last, I began to see the inutility of this, and one Saturday night I went home rather the worse for liquor, and resolved that this should continue no longer; I told my wife that she should not go out to work that night; she said she would, and seemed determined to go; this led to a serious altercation between us, during which my step-daughter caught hold of the poker and was going to strike me with it, but I prevented her doing so by seizing hold of it, she then rushed out of the room, but immediately returned; my wife then seized the leg of a table, with which she laid my head open, and from loss of blood I fell to the ground; my step-daughter applied her apron to my head to try to stop the blood, and exclaimed, 'Oh mother! you have killed father;' my wife replied, 'And a very good job too.' My wife then went down stairs, and I followed her; a policeman was called, and she wished to give me in charge, but, seeing the marks of violence and blood upon me, he would not take it. After this she went to work as usual and came home at the usual time. On the next morning (Sunday), she complained of a pain in the side, and not being any better on Monday I advised her to go to the hospital, which she did: she would not remain there, and returned home again that day. On Tuesday she went washing, but on Wednesday she again complained, and made up her mind to go in the hospital. On the Saturday-week following, my step-daughter, as usual, went to see her, and brought word back that she was better, and that she expressed a desire to leave the hospital. I then said, 'If your mother wishes to be fetched away she shall be,' and I then procured a cab and did so. On the Sunday, she told me that her bowels had not been properly acted upon for some days, whereupon I fetched a doctor to see her, who sent her some medicine which relieved her. He called again on the Monday, and ordered the medicine to be continued, but she refused to take it, and did not have any more; and she remained in the same state until Tuesday, when she unexpectedly expired. As is usual in such cases, a medical certificate was procured, and my wife was buried on the Thursday following. The funeral would not have taken place so soon, but that the undertaker stated that it would be improper to keep the corpse any longer. After this, I was persuaded to dispose of my furniture, and unfortunately took to drinking, which, for the time, rendered me quite unconscious of what I was doing, and by some means or other I got down to Sydenham where I was taken into custody and brought to the Worship-street police-court, when I was much surprised to hear the police<lb/>man read a long confession, which he stated I had made to him, and which he had taken down at the time, but of which, or how or when or where it was made, I have not the slightest recollection, and upon which evidence I was committed to take my trial. I now beg to throw myself on the mercy of the court."</p>

I said, "For that assault round the corner;" I did not know what was the matter at the time—as soon as I had said that I was kicked off my legs by both of them, but I had got secure hold of them, and in the scuffle I got on my feet again—I then let Houghton go, as he was in my right hand, and I knocked Hisley down with my fist—I found they were too much for me, and I was afraid of losing both—I then fell upon Hisley, and sprang my rattle and called out, and shortly afterwards Houghton was brought back by another constable; it might have been five minutes—I was struggling with Hisley very violently on the ground—I have not the least doubt that Houghton is the one that escaped from me—they were both under a lamp when I took hold of them—they were taken to the station—about that time I saw Mr. Brown with another constable; he was sober, he might have had a glass of ale, but there was nothing visible in him—I looked at his throat, it was inflamed all underneath as if it had been recently done—I did not see the bruises on his face till the morning—his neckerchief was undone and his clothes were very dirty and dusty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot-clicker, and live at 64, Sun-street, Bishopsgate—on the morning of the 27th July, about 2 o'clock, I was at the Swan public-house in Long-alley—the prisoner was there singing—I invited him to take a glass of ale, which he accepted, and then I sung; then he sung again—at about half-past 2, I left the house with him and his wife, and we went to another public-house to have some spirits—I was never in that house before; the prisoner suggested our going there—I paid for some spirits—I drank some, and the prisoner and his wife had the rest between them—we did not remain there long, we all three came out together—at the top of Long-alley I put out my left hand to shake hands with the prisoner, and with his other hand he took my ring off my finger; it was on the little finger of my left hand—I grasped him by the collar and said, "You vagabond, you have my ring, give it me back; I do not wish to hurt you"—he struck me several times on the head with his fist—I bled very much from the nose—I still had hold of him, and I called out "Police" as loud as I could—he knocked me down—I struggled with him, and he hit me again several times—I kept calling out "Police," and one came to my assistance—the blood was flowing very much from my nose, and I could not give the prisoner into custody in the way I ought to have done, and he ran away—I did give him in charge to the policeman, but he would not take the charge—I said, "I give this man in charge for robbing me of my gold ring, and for an assault"—he said that he did not clearly understand me, and he would not take the prisoner into custody—I had been drinking a little, but I was sober; I knew what took place—I went to four police-stations before I could find out the right one that the street belonged to—I think it was 5 o'clock when I finished the last one—The next afternoon, I went into the public-house where I had first met with the prisoner, and he came in and I gave him in charge—he said he knew nothing about it—I afterwards went with the officer to 39, Primrose-street, and received my ring</p>

Mrs. Hatton lives 400 or 500 yards from the pawnbroker's—went and saw Mrs. Hatton, I did not see the ring there, I got it from her husband—I did not drink with him after<lb/>wards—he called for some ale—I did not pay for it—I told him if he restored my property I would not prosecute him, and would assist him all I could; that was before he gave me the ring—I might have been with the prisoner altogether, an hour and a half, but I am not positive.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am the wife of George Hatton, a boot-closer, of 39, Primrose-street—on Wednesday, 28th July, between 11 and 12 in the morning, the prisoner came to our house and asked for my husband—he was called down stairs, and he produced a ring and offered it for sale to my husband—that was not exactly in my presence, I was at work; the pri<lb/>soner was standing, whistling and singing, at the door, and that attracted my attention—he handed the ring to my husband, and my husband came in directly from the door and told me that the prisoner wanted to sell it him—the prisoner was not near enough to hear that—my husband after<lb/>wards brought me the ring, and I kept it in my possession—I did not show it to any one until I went to Mr. Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's, to know the value of it—that might have been about half an hour afterwards—he told me it was worth a sovereign or 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I brought it back and gave it to my husband—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Thomas Lowe, 39, Queen-terrace, Haverstock-hill, in the parish of St. Pancras—on Sunday morning, 17th July, at a little before 6 o'clock, I was alarmed by a noise at the window—I thought it was a cat, and did not take any notice for some time—when I looked round, I saw a man's head, as I thought it was, under the blind; his hand was on the chair, and, hearing me, he got back and his cap fell into the chair—I hallooed out, and he got away—the policeman took him—I had to ring the bell, and a man came into my room—I saw my mistress take up the cap—I heard the window opened, but I can't tell whether it was close down the night before—I heard the prisoner afterwards own the cap, he said in the room, "Give me my cap:" they did not give it him.</p>

               <p>month I was with the vessel fishing off the coast of Holland, upon the high seas—the prisoner was an apprentice on board—he was my watch-mate—the captain had gone off to spend the day with some more captains, and I had charge of the vessel—when we came on deck after breakfast the prisoner said, "Charley, we have not got anything to do this watch"—I said "Yes, you have"—he said, "We have always something to do in our watch," and seemed very much displeased at it—I said whether he was displeased or not, it must be done—I told him to go up and send three blocks down—he did that after some time—I sent him up again to hitch them: he was up then some time—it was a simple job to do; he could have done it if he liked, but he would not, and I went and did it myself—I said, "George, a great fellow like you ought to be ashamed of himself, not to do a simple job like that"—he made me very vexed, and I told him if he did not leave off his <hi rend="italic">sauce</hi>, I would give him a punch on the head—he said, "That is more than you dare do: if you did, it would be a bad job for you"—about 5 minutes after that, he made me very vexed—we were about three yards apart, and I went to him and hit him—it was not a very hard blow—he returned it directly—we had a scuffle for a little while—he began to get very violent—I asked him if he was going to leave off—he Baid, no: be wanted to keep on fighting—I then threw him on the deck, and held him there till his passion was over—he tried to bite me two or three times—I hit him twice for that—after I had held him there some time, I let him get up and walked away from him round to the other side of the vessel—he came round to the side which I was on, and said, "D—you, I will have my revenge: I will go and cut your shifting up (that is, my clothes) because you have torn my shirt"—he had his knife in his hand—he went down to my bed cabin and brought my bag up on deck—I said, "George, it is poor spite to want to cut my shifting up, for I have only torn your shirt"—the cabin-boy was standing on deck, and I said to him, "Chuck my bag below; he shall not cut my shifting up"—the boy threw it down into the fore-part of the vessel—the prisoner directly went down the hatchway after it, with his knife open in his hand—I was rather louth to follow him, because I had seen him use weapons before; but I saw him cut the string of my bag in halves, and I went down to take my bag away—as soon as I entered the forecastle, he ran at me with all his force, and said, "D—your eyes, I will kill you," and he ground his teeth—he ran the knife as hard as he could into my left side—he only gave me one blow; it was about three inches below my arm—I said to him, "Oh George, you have stabbed me"—I got up the hatch-way as well as I could, and fell down upon the deck, the blood pouring out of me—a signal of distress was hoisted, and I was taken into harbour, where I was under the charge of a medical man for four days—I have suffered a good deal from the injury—the doctor said if it had been two inches lower down I should have been dead directly—I feel it now at times, but the place has healed up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Hale-street, Deptford, and work at an iron-foundry—the prisoner was my lodger—he occupied the front room up-stairs—I slept in the front room down stairs—on Tuesday, 3d August, the prisoner and his wife came home together: they were tipsy—nothing had passed between us, but his wife had used disgusting language in the street, and I gave them notice to quit—on the next day, Wednesday, the prisoner and his wife came to my room at nearly 11 o'clock at night—I was in bed—</p>

I was on duty near Wickham-ter<lb/>race, New-cross, on the night of 30th June—I saw the two prisoners walk<lb/>ing together towards London, about half-past 11 o'clock—they were stopped by two constables—I asked them where they were going—they said to New-cross, and they had come from Woolwich—I let them pass, and about a quarter past 1 o'clock the next morning, 1st July, I saw the prisoner Burkett in the enclosed shrubbery, nearly opposite the prosecutor's house—he saw me, and ran away towards Peckham—at about a quarter past 2 o'clock, I found the front door of the prosecutor's house open, and on the steps outside was this silk umbrella—I knocked at the door, and the prose<lb/>cutor</p>

I am cook in the service of Mr. Samuel Mason—on the night of 30th June, I fastened the back kitchen window between 9 and 10 o'clock, and all was then right—I was afterwards disturbed, after the man was found on the table—I looked at the back kitchen window; it was a little way open, and the shutters were half open—I had a black mantle hanging up in the kitchen; that is quite lost, I have not seen that since—this umbrella and other things are my master's.</p>

I said, "If you come outside, I will tell you,"—he came outside, and I asked, in the presence of Chambers and Smith, whether he was one of the men that she received the child's shoes from, and also a pair of women's boots—Chambers said he was one of the marines who gave them to her that morning—I found the women's boots between the sacking of a bed, at the cottage of a relative of Smith's—Chambers has absconded after giving her evidence before the magistrate—Feeney said he had neither had any boots nor seen any boots, and he did not know a marine of the name of Feeney—I told him I should take him into custody for being concerned in stealing a quantity of boots and shoes from Mr. Weavell's shop on Parson's-hill—at the station, the prisoners were confronted, and they denied all knowledge of each other.</p>

I am a watchmaker, residing at Greens-end, Woolwich—on Tuesday night, 29th June, I shut up the shop myself at a quarter past 9 o'clock—I saw the shutters and bar safe at 12, when I went to bed—the police-constable, Wells, called me down stairs at a quarter to 3 in the morning—on going outside the window, I found the iron bar forced away, and two of the shutters taken down from the front: the bar was forced out in the centre, and turned round in the joint; the end was twisted a little, and it had torn the wood away at the further end.</p>

I live at William-street, Woolwich—on the morn<lb/>ing of 30th June, between 2 and 3 o'clock, I had occasion to pass the corner of Greens-end three or four times; when I first passed I saw two young men, and as I approached towards the corner of the opposite side of the way, I saw them walking as it were from the window of the last witness's house to the next house—I had no suspicion that anything was wrong at that time—I will not swear that the prisoners are the men I first saw—I had occasion to turn back again in the course of a very little time, and I still found them by Dix's store—I went away and returned again, when they were still there—when I came back the last time, I heard a foot coming as hard as it could run—I thought it was rather strange, and, as soon as I got round the bow, a young man pulled up all of a titter and walked by very quick; and as soon as he had got by me, he started off like a shot—as soon as I turned round again I heard another foot; he acted much on the same principle—by the time I arrived at the house I saw the officer—I told him two men had gone a-head, and I told him the direction—the prisoners are the men who passed me; I am sure of it because we came face to face—after a little looking at them at the station-house, I was perfectly satisfied they were the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant at 57, Coleman-street, City—I have been investigating the accounts of the Commercial Dock Company—I went down to the Dock-office to make some inquiry about the receipt of the rent in respect of premises occupied by the last witness, and I had an inter<lb/>view with the prisoner—I spoke to him of the non-entry in the ledger of the Company—I told him there appeared to be five years' rent not received by the Company in respect of those premises, and asked him for an explanation—he said he had been in the habit of receiving the rent from Mr. Goodhew—I asked him if there was a rent-book in which the entries ought to have been made; he said, "Yes,"and he produced it—I produce the book now—in this book I find three years' rent accounted for as paid over by the prisoner to Mr. Smithers—I did not find the rent for December, 1856, or the following year entered in this book at all—as near as I can recollect, I asked if the rent had been received for the years 1856 and 1857, and to the best of my knowledge he said, "Yes, I have received those two years' rents, but owing to something to be settled about the income-tax I have not accounted for</p>

               <p>them, but the amounts are in my desk"—I am uot quite clear what he said about income-tax, but there was something to be settled about income-tax—Idon't think it was "dispute"—I was present during the whole of that day—at a subsequent period of the day, Mr. Cox having accounted in the interim for the balance of his cash-book, he was asked for these rents, when I understood him to say he had not got the money.</p>

I live at 32, Joiner-street, Westminster-road—at about half-past 9 o'clock on Sunday evening, the 8th instant, I went into Watch<lb/>orn's public-house, Marsh-gate, Lambeth, for a pint of beer—I saw the prisoners there—the male prisoner came outside the house with me and asked which way I was going, I told him to Joiner-street—he said, "I am coming that way"—we walked along the Westminster-road, when I said, "I think I am going too for beyond my crossing;" "No," says he, "there is the Catholic church,"—then he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my watch—I said, "Do not take that," and put up my hand to save it—with that he made a pull at the chain, gave the watch a sudden drag, and broke the guard—I got hold of him, clung to him, and cried out "Police,"—he had the watch in his hand, and I saw him reach it to the female prisoner—I had seen her in the public-house before; she was called Mary Ann—a man came to my assist<lb/>ance,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer—at the time of this robbery, I kept the Bricklayers' Arms in Manor-street, Chelsea—on the 13th July I was at the Admiral Keppel public-house, in Brompton-road; I arrived there from 1 to 2 o'clock in the day—I saw Diggory and Howden there—I had known Diggory for 2 years—I treated them, and in a few minutes Brown and a man named Cole introduced themselves to me—Brown asked me for a job, seeing me in the dress of a bricklayer; I said, "I think I have seen you before, but I have nothing for you to do"—I then observed Brown and Cole making motions to Diggory and Howden—the gestures pointed to me—inconsequence of that, I proposed to Diggory to take her a drive—it was to get away from the company—before I left, I paid for some liquor in presence of Diggory and Howden; in doing that, I produced my purse—I had 2 sovereigns in my porte monnaie—I did not change either of them at that house—I had some silver—I called a cab and got in with Diggory, and she said, "Allow my friend to accompany me"—Howden then got in, and she said, "Allow my friend (that was Lewis) to come in the cab with us; we shall then be four in the cab, a nice party"—she said he was a nice civil fellow—I assented to that, and we all got in and drove on to Battersea-bridge</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160116"/>
               <p>—when I arrived, I saw Brown and Cole on the bridge—I discharged the cab, and I asked Brown and Cole why they were following me—Cole said, "I am not following you"—I then walked on with Diggory, Howden, and Lewis over the bridge, and we went into a beer-house—Brown and Cole followed us in—I did not stay there 5 minutes—I then went to the Prince Albert in the new park—Brown and Cole followed us there—I ordered a pot of porter and half-a-quartern of gin—I put down a half-crown to pay for it—I changed a sovereign, but I can't say where; it was on the Battersea side, I believe—when I put down the half-crown to pay for the liquor I ordered, the change was produced, and I believe Howden took it up, but I was out of the house round the corner—when I came back I de<lb/>manded the money, and the landlord told me in presence of the prisoner who had got it—he said, "She has got it," pointing to Howden—I then demanded the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from her—she would not give it up—she refused it for some time—Cole said to her, "Give it him, and we will have the d—d lot"—after some difficulty, Howden gave the change up to me. I think I remained in the Prince Albert a quarter of an hour—I still endeavoured to get out of their way—I slipped away and went into the park, endeavour<lb/>ing to get out of their company—before entering the park, I sat down on a seat facing the river opposite to the public-house—Cole came to me and asked me to drink—I told him I wanted nothing to do with his company, I would not drink with him—I went away into the park directly—I did not see whether any of the prisoners followed me—I proceeded on about 200 yards, and the first thing I saw was Cole in front of me—he prevented my walking on the path—I said, "What is it you want of me?"—I was about to force myself by; and while I was endeavouring to pass him, Brown came behind me and pinioned my arms, put his knee to my back and threw me on the ground—Cole fell on me directly—there was Brown on my chest, and Cole on my groin—Cole tore all the front of my trousers up, while Brown held my head and shoulders on the gravel—during the scuffle I had put my hand in my pocket to make sure of my porte monnaie and what little money I had, and I still grasped it in my left hand—while this was going on, I had an opportunity of seeing Diggory and Howden—they were so close to me, that I could not tell who touched me and who did not—while I had my purse in my grasp, Brown made use of the expression "D—n his eyes, he has got it in his fist"—Cole directly grasped my hand, while the other was ill-using me—Brown held on me with his knees, and Brown took my arm, and Cole took the money out of my hand—the two women were close to me, and I called to Diggory for assistance, as she was the only one I knew in all the company—she put her hand on my body, and during the time I believe she robbed me of my silk handkerchief—my handker<lb/>chief was gone—by pressing her hand upon me she assisted in holding me down—Howden was close to me; Lewis stood at a little distance—on a sudden they all left me, seeing the park constable running towards me—before the constable came up, I saw Diggory was concealing my handker<lb/>chief under her dress, and I said to her, "Give me that if I have lost my money"—she was standing close by, she did not run away—the park con<lb/>stable was running towards us—Howden said to her, "D—n him, give him his <hi rend="italic">wipe"</hi>—the men had made their exit when they saw the constable—Brownand Cole ran up the park, and Lewis went back to the public-house—I ran what distance I could; but I was so much hurt, I could not run a great distance—the park constable never lost sight of Cole and Brown till he brought them back—the effects of the pressure I feel now in my</p>

               <p>ribs and loins and in my groin, which I never expect to get rid of—when the constable brought Cole and Brown back, I gave Diggory and Howden in custody; I had not lost sight of them—I came back with the constable and the prisoners to the Prince Albert, and there I found Lewis and I gave him in custody—I had about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse—Lewis made his escape during the journey to the station.</p>
