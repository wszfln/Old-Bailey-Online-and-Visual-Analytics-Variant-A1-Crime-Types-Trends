In two days after she came, I missed the counterpane and the eleven yards of bed lace. On the 17th of July, my wife informed me that she missed five table-cloths and a sheet, and that she suspected the prisoner. I went to her lodgings to enquire about her: the people gave her a very bad character. When I came home, I missed these window curtains and a bed-tick. I went again in search for her. I found her near her lodging sitting in a room. I asked her how she came to leave my service; she said, I find you missed things, and I was afraid you should suspect me. I said, I suppose the plain truth is, you have robbed me; she said, yes, she had. She confessed to taking the goods; I then charged her with the counterpane, the tea-chest, and the curtains; she acknowledged she had stolen them. She told me she had pawned the counterpane at Mr. Rochford's in Bishopsgate-street; the window curtains at Mr. Davidson's at London Wall; and the tea-chest in Houndsditch. The next day I missed a great many more things; then I took her up, and she confessed stealing them.</p>

I went down a little way; she wanted me to go lower down; I told her I would not: I began to feel about her for my watch; she said, what do you want to rob me? I said, no; I only want my watch again. Just as I spoke them words the two other prisoners came up to me; they came one of each side of me, and laid hold on each side my collar; there was another man came with them; they clapped something to my breast, which I believe were pistols.</p>

               <p>Wright. Both. I told them the girl had taken my watch, and I begged they would not use me ill; they bid me go a little farther along with them; I begged for my liberty; they pulled me farther down, and began to feel all about me; one of them put his hand into my fob, and took out my money; the other put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out a shilling, which was all I had in that pocket; I had four guineas in my fob; then they laid me down upon my back, and they clapped something to my breast again; I begged they would spare my life and take all I had; they stript off my coat and waistcoat and took off my hat; then they said, Run for your life, or I will blow your brains out. I immediately ran, and I run against a post and knocked myself backwards; I got up again and ran a little way, and called the watch, and went back again to the place, but they were all gone; somebody looked out at the: window and said they knew the people.</p>

               <p>Wright. She stood by; and begged they would take my life before they parted with me; as I lay upon my back I took particular notice of them. I went home to my lodgings, and in the morning I went to Sir

               <p>Q. How did you describe them?</p>
               <p>Wright. That one of them was about five foot and six or seven inches; the other a short man, with a long nose and black curled hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell the dress they were in?</p>
               <p>Wright. I told Sir John, that I believed they had both of them blue jackets on, but I could not be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What account did you give of the woman?</p>
               <p>Wright. That she was a stout, bold, large featured woman, and had a manly look.</p>
               <p>(Note, the prisoners answered this description.)</p>
               <p>Q. What account did you give of the third man?</p>
               <p>Wright. That he was quite a young fellow.</p>
               <p>Q. He did nothing to you, did he?</p>
               <p>Wright. He gave me a push on the back as they were driving me away.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken?</p>
               <p>Wright. The woman was taken the day after the robbery; I was not present at taking her; I saw her at the prison at White-Chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. When were the men taken?</p>
               <p>Wright. The day following; and I saw them before the bench of Justices at the Rotation at White-Chapel, on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes; very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your things again?</p>
               <p>Wright. No nothing at all. Josephs said before the Justice that if I could swear to him he would turn King's evidence. Simpson was taken first; I swore to him: when I had sworn to him, he asked the Justices to admit him an evidence; and said then he would help me to all my things again.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120007"/>Q. Where had you been that night?</p>
               <p>Wright. I had been that day to a club-feast, at the Vine in the Minories. I was there from twelve o'clock to nine at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking pretty freely?</p>
               <p>Wright. No; very trifling.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you after nine o'clock?</p>
               <p>Wright. Several of us went to a dancing in Spitalfields. I staid there some time; and as I was going back to the club, to call for two or three acquaintances, I met a young woman at Rosemary-lane, who told me she was afraid to go through Rosemary-lane by herself, and begged I would go with her; I walked with her to the top of Rosemary-lane; she leaned upon my arm; in coming back again I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Wright. I was not perfectly sober, but I was very sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Wright. There were several lamps just by where I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there light enough to distinguish a person's face?</p>
               <p>Wright. There was sufficient light for that.</p>

               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider here are three people's lives at stake upon your single testimony. - It was dark - a late hour of the night - you had been drinking. - Now are you able to recollect the persons of these people with so much certainty as to be able to swear positively to the persons of the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Wright. I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you challenge them immediately when you first saw them?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes, I did. I never had a doubt.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking in that house a great while, was you not disguised?</p>
               <p>Wright. I take care never to disguise myself with liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. The woman that leaned upon your arm was not the prisoner, was she?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you going any where with that woman?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did she not ask you to go to a house with her?</p>
               <p>Wright. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you greatly surprized?</p>
               <p>Wright. Greatly so.</p>
               <p>Q. And would not that surprize take away your recollection?</p>
               <p>Wright. I was not surprized by the woman, when I lay upon my back my surprize was more over.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in no house after you left the club but the place you danced at, with no woman nor man?</p>
               <p>Wright. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you told by a man that looked out at the window, for the first time, who were the people that had robbed you before you had any apprehension of them?</p>
               <p>Wright. Upon my oath I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. from Simpson. Did not you say before the Justice that you was much disordered in liquor?</p>
               <p>Wright. I did not.</p>

               <p>Paget. I don't know but she has done something wrong since. I believe she secretes herself for fear of being taken. I have endeavoured to find her, but I can't meet with her.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Kent. I heard some-body in the house. I called out, who is there; I then heard a person walk a-cross the house. He opened the door to come out; when he saw me he returned back again. I told him not to resist, for I would take him; he surrendered. I went into the house, and found sixteen chimney tiles lying upon the ground, and an old broken knife.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What excuse did he make for being there?</p>
               <p>Sayer. He said he was let in by two men with leather aprons on. He was willing to go with me; he said he was overcome with liquor, and was put in there by two men to sleep; and he did not know how long he had been there.</p>

               <p>I was much in liquor. I intended to go to work. I was with two brother labourers. I fell down by a wind-mill. Two men put me into this place, and told me I might lie down to sleep, and rest myself. One of these men waked me about six o'clock. The man said he had something against me. I said, I was sorry for that. I said I would go with them where they pleased.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you mean by your property?</p>
               <p>Creighton. I meant my wife. Soon after the prisoner called out watch three times. I said I would keep watch till the watchman came.

               <p>Q. Did you tell him what kind of property?</p>
               <p>Creighton. Yes; my wife, I asked the prisoner three times to open the door; at last he said, if you attempt to come in here I will blow your brain out. I took hold of the door, to open it, and the door flew open in my face. I had my hand upon the knocker; there are two steps to the house, and the door opens into the street. I stept up the first step, and the prisoner clapt a pistol to my forehead, and snap'd it; the watchman jumpt up and told him if he did not lay the pistol down, he would knock him down; then he laid it down upon the table. When he snap'd the pistol at my forehead, he struck me with it, that the blood ran down my face. I have the fear of it now. The prisoner bid me look if my wife was there or not. The watchman went about the room with his lanthorn; he told me she was behind the bed-stead. I bid her come home. I charged the watch with him, and he charged them with me, so we were both taken to the watch-house. After we had been sometime at the watch-house, the constable discharged us; he ran home directly. I went to drink a pint of purl, then I went to go home, my wife was along side of me then. I was obliged to go by the prisoner's house to go home. I saw the prisoner at his door, with a pistol in his hand; this was about an hour after he left the watch-house. I went on, he snap'd the pistol; he cock'd it again, and snap'd it the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120011"/> second time; it missed fire again; the passage is not above two yards wide; his house is opposite the end of the passage; when I got within about thirteen or fourteen yards of him, he directed it at me again, and then it went off. I heard the whistling of the ball or slug go by my ear.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell when a ball passes you?</p>

            . I am a milliner, and live in Bridges-street, Covent-Garden. The prisoner called upon me several times and offered me a great many different sorts of goods, modes, persians, sarsenets and the like. In May he brought several things to shew me. I picked out three yards of gauze and a dozen yards of this ribbon; here is the bill of parcels he made me in his own name. I have sold some of the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more of the same ribbon in the house?</p>

               <p>Mr. Noble. I can swear to the ribbon; they are made by us in a particular manner. I cannot swear to the gauze; he confessed before the Alderman that it was our property.</p>

               <p>I never robbed my master of any thing in my life. I have had fifteen hundred or two thousand pounds of my master's in my hands, and I never wronged him of any thing in my life. Mr. Clay told me he would not hurt me. I sold them on their account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Noble. Mr. Clay told him, that if he made an ample confession of what he had robbed us of, he would be so favourable as not to touch his life, but that he would certainly transport him; he has robbed us of one hundred and seventy pounds worth of goods. We never had any dealing with this lady.</p>

I returned again about a quarter before eight, and found my servant was gone out. I waited about half an hour in the square. When the prisoner came to the door, I took the key from her to let myself in, and found the lock was only catched. After I had been at home some little time, I missed the things mentioned in the indictment; then I sent for several men as witnesses, and examined the house. There were no signs of any person having got in over the garden-wall; and the stairs, which were fresh cleaned, had not the marks of a foot upon them. When we came to the garret, we found two-chairs that had stood in the maid's room standing in the passage, under the trap-door, which was wide open, with two of the maid's boxes upon them. Two or three men went out at the trap-door, and there were no signs of any person's having been out there. I then accused the prisoner, who all along denied it. I have never seen any of the things since.</p>

I met a girl by the Foundling hospital with one of my gowns on: I asked her how she came by it; she told me she had it of her brother. I asked her to go home with me, which she did, and sent for her brother; who said he had it of the prisoner. The next morning he took up the prisoner. By enquiring of the pawnbrokers in the neighbourhood, I found many of my things.</p>

            . I live at Chigwell. Upon the 11th of July, in the morning. I went to the King's Head, at Chigwell, for a pint of beer; whilst I was there the prisoner and another man came down stairs; they had laid there all night; they began drinking milk punch. The prisoner said he had a dark bay horse to sell; he said he had trotted him about to shew him to a neighbour of mine, but that he did not buy him. I ask'd the price; he bid me look at him; he brought him out, and rid him backwards and forwards. He ask'd four guineas for him. I said I could not run so much money; he said, will you bid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120015"/> nothing for the horse? I told him I would give two guineas and a half for him. We agreed for that money. I went home and fetch'd the money, and paid for him. About three hours afterwards I heard Mr. Horsenayle had lost his horse. I went next morning to him, to know if this horse was his property; when I found it was I sent it home.</p>

I found the prosecutor's handkerchief wrapped round Millson's head for a night cap; these three skins lay by Millson's bedside; we found a dozen knives and forks in the next room; some had been used; we found the spurs in a drawer, ( producing the different articles.) Millson told us this suit of cloaths were his (producing a brown suit ) As the prosecutor had said they were both in dark coloured clothes, I brought them away that he might see them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear to some of these skins; they are mark'd as I advertised them; they are cut down the middle, but they have not cut the marks out; I can swear to the spurs, they have two odd buckles to them, and one wants a rowel; and the handkerchief has two or three holes in it which I described; I bought the linen and had it printed by an acquaintance.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mrs. Thorn. The prisoner came into our house on the 8th of August, and called for a pint of beer. I was drinking in the same room. I saw the tankard standing upon the table just by him. The prisoner went out of the room before he had drank his beer or paid for it; and we immediately missed the tankard. About an hour and a half afterwards, Pointer and I went to the Half-Moon. As soon as he saw me, he made towards the door. We took him into another room, and charged him with the robbery. He said, though he had been guilty of one bad fact, yet that was no rule he should always be guilty.</p>

I told her I would have nothing so do with her; so I went from the door up the street in order to get rid of her. In turning down the street again about ten yards from the door, she came and took hold of the tail of my coat; the men came out and bid me give them four-pence, or they would knock me down; so I gave them four-pence and went into the house again and called for a pint of beer. The woman came again into the house, and set herself in the box opposite me; she took up my pint of beer and drunk; upon that Eastman came up, took me by the collar and struck me. The landlord came up and took him away, and told him, he should not abuse any body in his house, and desired I would get out of their company. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120024"/> went to another box and called for a pint of beer to myself.

The other two men each of them held one of my legs; one of them took the buckles out of my shoes, and my hat off my head; one kicked me on my left side and made me lame. A woman looked out at a window, and asked them if they were going to murder me. Freckleton replied, No, d - n you, you b - h; this is my husband, and I can't get him home.</p>

               <p>I was drinking in company with six or seven people at this house. The prosecutor beckoned me out. He asked me if I was willing to go with him. I went with him to a tenter-ground. He lay with me there. Whilst he was lying with me, there came a man with blue clothes, with a pipe in his mouth. He said, Well my friend, keep at it, don't get up. I said, for shame get up. After he had got up, he said, What do I pay my money for nothing? and lay down again. As we were going out there were three or four men came out of skitlle-ground, and asked him if he would not pay socket-money. The prosecutor put his hand into his pocket and took out a shilling; I bid him give it me, and I would give them a some money. I took the shilling, and gave them a pot of beer. I said let us go out another way. We went and had a glass of gin a-piece. I gave him his change, and never saw him afterwards.</p>

               <p>I came home about nine at night. I went into Mr. Price's house for a pint of beer. I was going to get a pipe; as I went by, the prosecutor kicked me on the shin. I asked him what that was for; he said, he would give me another. I laid hold of him; Mr. Price came and showed me away. I went out of the house, and went home to bed. The next night they took me up. The prosecutor told Justice Fielding he was very much in liquor; and that a watchman found him drunk in the road asleep.</p>

             the evidence to be concerned; I search'd after him; he came to my house; he said that he heard I suspected him, and he came to clear himself. I told him I did suspect him: he said then he would go to Justice Girdler immediately, and turn evidence; he went and surrendered himself, and was admitted an evidence. I went to see Dixon in the Compter, who was taken up on suspicion of another robbery; he had a pair of my silk stocking breeches on, one of my shirts, a pair of stockings, and a linen apron. I went to get an order from an alderman, to take Dixon before Justice Girdler; when I went back again to the Compter, he had changed my cloaths, by the direction of the accomplice Herbert. We searched Burrell's house in Coleman's Alley, Bunhill-row; he gave me the key of his box; there I found two shirts, two pillow cases, a piece of sattin cloak, and a single stocking. Burrell and Barton lived together as man and wife; they were both present. I search'd Mary Johnson's lodgings in Henry-street, Old-street, on Friday; she was there at the time; I found there two dimity petticoats, and the scissars, with the brass hook; we found them in a cupboard with a great many lumbering things upon them.</p>

               <p>Wood. Burrell said that Dixon gave them to him. Barton said before the Justice that Harry gave them to her. The Justice asked her who Harry was; she said she should know him if she saw him; there were 20 or 30 people in the room; she was bid to point him out, which she did.</p>

             down; he had been down but a little while before he put his back against the area, and his feet against the window, and broke the bar; I stood very near, and heard it; then they shut the window shutters to, and pulled down the sash, and we waited<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120027"/> about watching the watchmen till two o'clock. When the watchman went by, we struck a light at the corner of Normond-street, and went in. I had the flint and steel, and one of them carried the tinder. I can't say which. Dixon and Wood went in. They put up the goods, and then they blowed the candle out, and came out. Wood and I took a bundle a-piece, and Dixon carried the tea-chest, which, before we had got far, we threw away. We took the bundles to Mary Johnson's lodgings. I pushed open the door; the lock was very slight, and in a little time we awaked her; and when we awaked her, she was frightned. The street-door is left open, and her's is the first room. She desired we would take the things away. We told her, we would not go till five o'clock in the morning. She went to work between five and six next morning. We left the things in the room till dark; then we went and fetched them away. Two petticoats dropt out; I kicked them under the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. This story may be true. - I desire you will tell me the truth, the whole truth. You are not to say any thing that is false to screen any body; it will be dangerous for you to tell me any thing that is false. You say she went out between five and six to work?</p>
               <p>Herbert. Yes, I left the things there and came back again at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time?</p>
               <p>Herbert. About nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she at home then?</p>
               <p>Herbert. No; she was just by the end of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to leave them?</p>
               <p>Herbert. They dropt out of a pillow-case, and I kicked them under the bed; I would not stay to pick them up. We carried two of the bundles and threw them over into Mr. Burrell's yard. I did not see any body there to receive them. I saw

               <p>Q. Did you cohabit with either of these women?</p>
               <p>Herbert. No; not at the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the way to Johnson's lodgings?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I had not been with her a good while; I had been ill in the workhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see Johnson again after the evening you took away the things?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I did not see her for a day afterwards; I believe I did not go to her lodgings after I fetched the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see her afterwards?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I saw her pass by the top of Whitecross-street once; I did not speak to her to have any conversation with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with her?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I had no conversation with her after the time I put the petticoats into the cupboard, after I carried the things away.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me just now, that you had no conversation with her after that; did you stay all night?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I fell asleep in the chair; I was in liquor. I got up about four in the morning, and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took the two dimity petticoats from under the bed?</p>
               <p>Herbert. Yes; and threw them into the cupboard among the foul things.</p>
               <p>Q. And she saw nothing of the matter?</p>
               <p>Herbert. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Give the jury a reason why you put these petticoats into the cupboard.</p>
               <p>Herbert. With intent to fetch them away. I was afraid of Dixon's turning evidence, and I went to the prosecutor; I told him that I had these petticoats.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you put them there?</p>
               <p>Herbert. I did not do that. I told him I had them under my own care. We went to the Crow and had a pot of beer directly, and he gave me the four shillings and six pence; that was Tuesday. We parted then, and I saw them no more till taken. Wood was with them at the same time.</p>

               <p>I had two of this accomplice's companions taken up about two years ago; he came to me, and said, what makes you do such a blackguard action as that? and he said he would make me suffer for it. Last Tuesday se'ennight he said, do you intend to appear against these two chaps? he swore I should not, and punched my face; I lick'd him well; he swore he would have my life, and he had me taken up; I had the same things upon me then as I have now, excepting the apron, and that they took from me one night when I was asleep. I had none of his things on at all.</p>
               <p>Burrell's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to Kingston, to fetch Elizabeth Barton; we came back about eight or nine at night; I went to bed about half after ten, and she too: she got up first in the morning, which is uncommon, and went into the yard; the yard is common to other people as well as me. She called out and said, here are some dirty things in the yard; I bid her bring them in; I did not know what they were, they were so dirty; there were these two shirts; the stocking was clean, the pillow cases were dirty, they were dirty with street mud; she wash'd them next day; these two shirts were dry first; I put them by, and said if any body owns them, they shall have them; they hung upon the line; when the prosecutor came on Thursday, I said he had the most right to them, and I made no objection to their taking them.</p>

               <p>- Franklin. I keep the White House at Hammersmith. The prosecutor and the prisoner came into my house a little after four in the afternoon; the prisoner wanted a dram, but he said he had no money, and the prosecutor treated him; when he went to bed, I ordered my girl to go and put him to bed, but the prisoner was very officious, and said, he would; he staid some time with him; when he came down stairs, he said to me, call up the old pensioner early, he wants to go on his journey; he said he was obliged to be at Chelsea by nine that night, or he should get ill will. I saw him the next morning about six o'clock, very much in liquor; his face was bruised; I thought he had fell down. When the prosecutor came down in the morning, he said, have you seen any thing of the man that was with me last night? I said, I had; he told me that he had picked his pocket; a man gave us information where the prisoner was, and we took him at the Rose and Crown about nine in the morning; the constable search'd him, and found a quarter of a guinea, and silver, and half pence, to the amount of 16 shillings and two-pence farthing; the prisoner said before the Justice, that he had the money sent him from Yorkshire, and afterwards, that it was sent him from Carlisle.</p>
               <p>- Meredith. Upon the application of Mr. Franklin to me, I told him it would be proper to make an enquiry where the prisoner lay that night; we found that he lay at one Mrs. Waites, a mantua maker, along with one Barnard, an old fellow soldier. I had this purse from Mrs. Barnard, (producing a green worsted purse.)</p>

We met him upon the road at Hammersmith, about half an hour after five in the afternoon; we had a shillings worth of rum and water, and two shillings worth of brandy and water; the prisoner paid for it; he paid a shilling for the first, and changed two 5 s. 3 d. to pay for the last two shillings worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think he was very rich?</p>
               <p>Barnard. I did not know what way he was in; he told us he had received his pension money.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor. There is no particular mark to the purse, but it is just such a one as I lost.</p>

               <p>I never robbed him. I came from Yorkshire the 29th of May. I had a family there. I was so bad I could not work; the master I work'd with sent me to Hull. I got five guineas paid me for my half year's service, then I got a passage from Hull. I was at Chelsea from the 29th of May to the 22d of June, before I got into the house; I had two guineas and eight shillings in silver when I went into the house. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177009120030"/> my comrade I would put this money by; I sewed up a guinea and a half in the waistband of my breeches, and a 5 s. 3 d.

I went there about 11 o'clock with my wife's sister; several of the neighbours were playing at cards, the prisoner was playing. They asked me to take a hand; I sat down. I think the prisoner was the most facetious man in company that I ever saw; after we had set some little time, he went out at the door. I saw him before that take the tankard from the corner of the table, and set it between him and me. I saw him put the flap of his coat carelesly over the tankard. When the cards were just dealt out, and every body were looking at their hands, he got up and went out; I saw something of a bulk in his coat; his hand was through his coat pocket; he did not come in any more; we missed the tankard soon after.</p>

I was traced from place to place; Mr. Bowker can inform your Lordship that from the time of my using his house, he never saw any thing indiscreet by me. This night that I was in the house, was a club-night; after the club was over, they set in for a game at cards; I made one of the party; as I went out to make my needs, I saw a <rs id="t17700912-71-deflabel334" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Nelson. No. I don't remember that. We drove the hogs to the pound; they lay about the field; one of us knock'd at the window; the man got up and let us in; he is a shoemaker, and keeps the key of the pound, and he bid us come again about six or seven o'clock for the money; we all went together;

Mr. Hitchen, that lives by the Red-house, happened to come out; upon that they ran away. I flew to him for protection. I went next morning to Mr. Hitchen, to know if he knew either of the men; he said, he believed he should know them again if he saw them; whilst I was in his shop, the two prisoners went by; he said he believed them to be the men. My father and I went out directly; I laid hold of Williams, and said, you villain, what have you done with my hat and wig you robbed me of last night? He said, he did not rob me of my hat and wig. I said, I insist upon carrying you before a magistrate; then he said, my comrade has it upon his head. (This is my hat, producing it.)</p>

            . On Tuesday the 31st of July, I was going from my house to the Red-house. Opposite the Red-house, I heard the most bitter imprecations imaginable. I staid some time upon the foot pavement; when I moved forwards, they disengaged themselves from him, and he ran to me, and said he was robbed; I asked him of what; he said, of his hat and wig, by these two people. I described the two prisoners at the bar, as to their size and dress; the beadle want in pursuit of them, but could not find them. I told him I could he positive to the people, when I saw them again; whilst I was describing them to the prosecutor and his father, the two prisoners came by; I said them are the two lads that robbed you last night; they followed, and took them, and brought them to my house. I told them I was sorry for them, I was afraid they would be hanged; one of them said, he did not value being hanged of a farthing.</p>

               <p>I work in King's-head court, at Mr. Wright's, a watch-case maker. I came home on Tuesday night to my mother's, at Tower-hill. My mother sent me over the water; I staid to supper; on going down Thames-street, I walked in the cart way, it was very dark; I kicked something before I pick'd it up, and it was this hat. I told my mother I found it; she said, a find is no robbery, nobody can hurt you for it. My mother longed for some fish; I went to Billingsgate to see if my cousin had bought her some. I was not afraid; I had the hat upon my head; the man stopt me, and said, he believed the hat was his; I said I found it.</p>

I was standing by the compting-house; I saw two boys just within the door of the warehouse; there was a person at that time in the compting-house about business. As he went out at the compting-house, they went out at the warehouse-door. About ten or fifteen minutes afterwards, I saw one of the boys stepping out of the door very quickly. I was afraid they were upon some bad design. I went up stairs to the servant in the kitchen, and asked her if any boys had been with any message to her. She said, No; but that she had heard a door open. Upon examining, we missed Mr. Loader's watch out of that room where it was hanging. We sent immediately to Justice Fielding and had it advertised. On the 17th of July, Underwood came to our house with Sproser the evidence, and told me, the watch was at Islington at the Angel. We searched the house, but did not find the watch.</p>

I had not seen the silver suppose some time Deaner went away from the house on the 25th of August; he was missed for some time, but he was brought back again the same day. On the 26th, which was Sunday, he went away again; I sent an advertisement to be inserted in the public papers on Monday, and he was brought home the same night. I was informed that he had bought and sold some pieces of plate; I taxed Deaner with it, and he told me if I would let him go quietly, he would shew me where he sold it; he took me to one Mr. Elliot, a silver-smith in Oxford-road, and upon enquiring of him, he said he had bought the gold suppose of Deaner. We took him on the 28th before the bench of Justices, where he owned he had taken the things mentioned in the indictment: Smith confessed that he was with Deaner when he sold the two supposes, and the ring, to Elliot, and that he received 20 l. 18 s. and that he had ten guineas of the money, and two guineas in another person's hand, which were sent for by the Justice: he said he had spent part of the money in a watch he had bought for Deaner, and in redeeming one of his own out of pawn, and that he bought a pair of silver buckles of Mr. Elliot for himself.</p>

            . On the 27th of August, between eight and nine in the morning, the two prisoners at the bar came to my shop with a silver cup. Smith said, Deaner had it a present from a Nabob, and he wanted to dispose of it: I paid Smith 2 l. 9 s. for it. Smith came again about eleven o'clock the same day, with a gold suppose, I did not then know what to call it; I bought it to melt it down; I gave Smith seventeen guineas for it. I melted it the next day.</p>
               <p>Court. I hope, Sir, you will take care how you buy things again that have been stolen. It was impossible you should believe the story told you by them wretches, when they sold you the plate. Could you think, they were in the honest possession of such nice and curious, as well as valuable things, and you see they have the appearance of gentlemen's servants? I don't know that I ever saw you before, and I hope you will never more come here. under such circumstances; if you do, I assure you, I shall take notice of you. I think you would have been much more in your place, had you been yourself arraigned at the bar with those ignorant people, than have appeared here as an evidence.</p>

She went out without her hat; she said, she had a ready furnished room. She went out about one, and was to come back in two hours. She did not come home till about eight o'clock. She made an excuse for staying; she said she had had some dispute with her mother in-law, but that they had made it up. She said she should have no more occasion to go out for her money, but that her uncle's footman would bring it, and she desired me not to say any thing about her living with us as a servant. She went up with the maid to make the bed; there was a bundle brought her when she was at supper. I went out the next day to see my mother; when I came home again, I went up stairs with the prisoner to have my bed made, as I always chuse to be present whilst my bed was making. I went into the prisoner's room. I saw a box open with a good deal of money in it; she told me the night before that she had fetched some check out of pawn; she said that she had not money enough to buy it. When I looked at the money, there was one particular shilling that I knew to be mine. I brought it down to my husband; he desired me to bring it all down, which I did. I went up with the prisoner when she went to bed; she said she had lost some money out of her trunk; she said about 23 s. and 6 d. she said she had left it open. The money I carried down to my husband, was 23 s. or 24 s. and 6 d. My husband told her he would find it out. She said her father gave her two guineas. My husband said if she could prove that, she should not be a loser; he would find out how it was gone. We asked her where her father lived, but she would not tell us. She said he traded to Ireland. I said I wondered she had so much silver; she said there was half a guinea in gold, She said she went to Peckham with her father, and that she changed gold, in order to oblige her master with some silver. I told her she had wronged me of it, but that if she would tell us where her father lived, that we might be satisfied that he had given her any money; that if she would shew us her ready furnished room, and where her uncle lived, I should give her no trouble about it. I went to Mrs. Mackmar's according to her directions, and I was surprised to find that she was her mother, as it was she that gave her a character to my place, as no relation.</p>
