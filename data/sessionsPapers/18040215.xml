            , a man followed us; he came and passed us close on my right-hand side, and demanded my money; he had a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a knife? - A. It was a middling size clasp-knife, open; he held it close to my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the knife was pointed to you? - A. The blade of the knife; I put my hand in my pocket, he bid me be quick, and not give him the trouble of searching me; I said, take that knife away, and I will give you all I have; I then gave him my purse; he asked me if that was all I had; he took my purse, there was a one pound Banknote in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other lady? - A. He demanded her money, and used the same language to her as he did to me; he presented the knife to her as he did to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this? - A. About four or five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150004"/>minutes; he then bid us to walk along; we walked along, and soon after met a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you walked on, did you take any notice of him so as to know him again? - A. Yes; as soon as we met the gentleman, we immediately turned round, and saw him run across Ball's Pond fields. I told the gentleman what had happened, and said I should be much obliged to him if he would pursue the man. I saw the man running across Ball's Pond fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the gentleman pursue him? - A. Yes, he did; I saw him pursue him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the man? - A. No; we lost sight of the man going across Ball's-Pond fields. I then went on.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, did you see your purse again? - A. Never. I never saw the prisoner again till he was brought up to Bow-street last Saturday week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his dress? - A. Yes; he was dressed in a dark-coloured coat; he had a linen apron on, very black; he had a silk handkerchief over the top part of his face, and had placed it down to the top part of his lip; he had it down when he demanded my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner; is he the man you saw at Bow-street? - A. Yes; I was struck with the lower part of his face. I think it is the man by the lower part of his face, and his figure altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A. It was not very light; it was between the hours of three and four; it was getting dark; when I was going up to Canonbury-house I noticed a man whom I believe to be the man who robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light enough for you to see him running across the fields to some distance? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I suppose you never saw this man before? - A. Never before that day.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that it was getting dusk; that he had an handkerchief which covered his nose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your only observation was from the lower part of his face; merely from his nose down to his chin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A person coming and presenting a knife to you, would much alarm you? - A. Yes, I was frightened.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had the good fortune to recover your purse, nor your note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 3d of January; the prisoner was not taken up till about ten days ago; there was a period of above twenty days; and you say you think this is the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. No other violence was used; only the knife put to your breast? - A. Only threats if we were to call out.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Were you in the field after that robbery? - A. Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the person that first met that lady? - A. No; I am a patrol of Bow-street; I had an information of another robbery, after that I heard of this robbery. I then went in pursuit of this man, and on the 31st of January I apprehended him, very near were he committed this robbery, in Canonbury-fields, at one o'clock in the day time; that is another robbery committed on the 6th of February. I saw him standing in the fields by himself. I went up to him, and said where are you going? He said to take a walk. I said where do you live? He said in Bowling-green-lane, Clerkenwell. I said take off your hat? He did; I found nothing in his hat. I told him he answered the description of some man that had robbed in that field. I searched his pocket; and in his left hand waistcoat pocket I found a knife, in his fob pocket I found four duplicates, and no money. I told him I must take him before the Magistrate, which I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I was stopped by that gentleman, he asked me where I was going. I immediately pulled out of my pocket some mallow-leaves I had been gathering. He immediately said I answered the description of a man that had committed a robbery last Monday week. He searched me; he took off my hat; he searched me about a quarter of an hour; not finding any thing, I thought he would never leave off. After taking every thing from me but the mallow-leaves, which I gathered for my legs, which are very bad, he said I must go with him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cox.) Had he some mallow-leaves in his pocket - A. He had a few dead leaves; they were quite dry; and were not gathered that day.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present at the time he received the sentence of the Court, at Clerkenwell? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in prison the time he was ordered? - A. He was.</p>

               <p>- JONES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You keep a public-house in Chiswell-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do. On the 27th of January the prisoner, and another man with him, came to my house, and called for a glass of gin. When they had drank it, they put down a bad half-crown; I told them it was a bad one; he gave me another, for which I gave him change. They went out, and I followed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you follow them? - A. I suspected they were doing something they should not. I followed them till they went into another house in Finsbury-street (Mr. Hall's), and I went in when they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a half-crown produced to you by Mr. Hall? - A. Yes; he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same half-crown the prisoner tendered to you? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the half-crown again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then? - A. Mr. Hall and I went after them; we overtook them in Little Moorfields.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to them? - A. Hall shewed him the half-crown, and told him he had given him a bad half-crown; they said they did not know it was a bad one; I said I had told him before that it was a bad one myself; they answered they did not know me, nor where I lived; the other man said that. We took them back to the White Horse (Mr. Hall's, in Finsbury-street), and sent to Worship-street for an officer</p>
               <p>Q. When the officer came, did you see him search the prisoner? - A. Yes; there was nothing but good money found upon him, and some gin in a bottle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the other man? - A. No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were they in your house? - A. About two or three minutes; while they drank their liquor.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. Q. Was there any thing particular in that half-crown? - A. Yes, there were letters on it. I marked it when Hall had it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not mark it before? - A. No; I marked it by the desire of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard of a reward? - A. I did not do it with that intent; I do not look for it; I do not know that there is, I will swear.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Jones.) Is that the half-crown that was presented to you? - A. Yes; there is a G and J, two letters that I put on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. As we were coming on, the other man was with me, we went into this house to have something to drink; I put down half a crown; the first witness said it was a bad half-crown, I said I took it for a good one, I did not suppose that man to be a judge, I had drank two or three glasses before, I did not think it a bad one when I went in, I had been working at the docks; we went into the other house to drink again, and there I offered it, thinking the other man might not be a judge, whether it was a good one or not. I really did not know it was a bad one; I took it for a good one</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any other servant? - A. Yes; a boy. I suspected her of setting fire to several parts of the house on the first of February; both the window-curtains were burnt, without the least communication with each other, up two pair of stairs, in the front room.</p>

            , a washerwoman, a boy, and the servant of the house that took Sophia Dale's place. There was a great deal of clean linen burnt, that lay on the foot of the bed ready to be put on; the bed-clothes were burnt through, but not the bed; the side-valence of the bed was burnt, which had no communication with the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to go up stairs? - A. I did not go up myself; I sent a servant who had taken Sophia's place; it was not burning then, it had the appearance then of being burnt; a gown which lay in the wardrobe was burnt, and the wardrobe door was locked with a key in it, and nothing else in that place was burnt; and a place burnt on the stairs, with some grease left, as though a candle had been placed there, opposite the bed-room door; all was safe when I came home; I had been out about three hours, and about three quarters of an hour afterwards, I had occasion to send up for something in the bed-room; my servant, who had taken Sophia's place, came down, and said the room was full of smoke; I ran up stairs, and as soon as I could recover the suffocation, I saw the clothes burnt, without the least appearance of flame or blaze.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any fire in the room? - A. No; I had not had a fire in the room for a fortnight; I called for somebody to come up, the washer-woman came up, and caught the clothes burning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the window-curtains blazing? - A. No; some parts were red, and some parts were black.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not yourself know when the prisoner went out? - A. No, I do not; when I came home she was gone; I enquired when she went out; I was told she had been out about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you discharged her? - A. No; I meant to discharge her the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any quarrel with her? - A. I had told her of running me in debt, at four or five places in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know she was to go away? - A. Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did she come home again? - A. Not till the next day, about twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she account for her absence? - A. She said that she called at a friend's house, and that she was informed of the accident, and was so alarmed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150007"/>at a fire, she could not return sooner. I was almost convinced she had done it. I was advised by the attorney to stop her wages to pay the debts; it was upwards of 5 l. she had run me in debt; her wages were not so much.</p>

             sworn. - I went to Mrs. Mordecai's place on the 31st of January, between the hours of six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Whom did you find in the house? - A. I found a washerwoman in the kitchen below, a maid servant, and a boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by maid servant? - A. The prisoner; the accident was on the first of February.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you go up on that day? - A. I went up about ten minutes past five, or thereabouts; there was no smell of fire then in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go up again? - A. About half an hour after; then I found it very smokey, and was very much alarmed. I went down to my mistress, and asked her if the chimnies were given to smoking; she said no; and told me to go up again, and smelling fire, I screamed for assistance; the best of the clothes that had been put on the bed were like tinder, and the bed-clothes were all in a moulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they blazing? - A. No; quite of a smother; the farther cornice of the window was quite of a moulder, and the window-curtain like tinder.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know at what time the prisoner went out on the day this happened? - A. About five in the evening; I could not keep her in the house; she refused to stop.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you want to keep her in the house for? - A. I wanted her to stop to dinner; she said she wanted to go to a lady, to get her in the hospital; she said she was afraid of going down Piccadilly, for fear of meeting her mistress and another lady.</p>
               <p>Q. She was gone before her mistress came home? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did her mistress come home? - A. She came home about half-past five.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether she had been up stairs that afternoon? - A. I rather think she had. She had been taking the drawing-room curtains down, and she said all was shut up stairs, and in the bed-room all was shut; she did not want the boy to go up. She did not like to go out till it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she did not like to go out till it was dark? - A. No; but she did not want any of us to know when she went out.</p>
               <p>Court. That is only your idea of it.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was in the kitchen, had she her bonnet on? - A. Yes; she said could not stay, she desired me to cut her dinner off, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was your dinner hour - A. Half-past five o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner go out that evening? - A. I saw her leave the kitchen to go out, about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you the first alarm? - A. About a quarter before six, the maid had been sent up stairs to fetch a jacket; some time after she went up stairs to fetch something else for her mistress; I heard a noise that there was a fire; I went up to see what was amiss, and found the things burning; all of a mouldering, like tinder when struck a light; all the things that were on the foot of the bed. I put the burnt things which were on the bed in my apron, and saw the window-curtains were all consumed, and the front frame of the window was burnt.</p>

On the 17th of January I went to lie down about seven or eight o'clock in the morning; I lodge in the same house and in the same room with the prisoner; I was not very well, and some time of the day the prisoner came up in the room (what time I cannot exactly tell) and went down directly; in about five minutes after that he came up again, and stopped about a minute; he then went out of the room, and took the key out of the room door where I lay; the key was inside; he went to the room facing, and unlocked the door of the landlord's bed-room with that key; after he had unlocked it he went in, and stopped about a minute; he came out, and locked that door; he took the key out of that door, and put it in the same door he took it out of; he came in the room, and staid there a little while, and then went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take off your clothes when you laid down? - A. Yes, and got into bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you see all this? - A. When he took the key out of our door, I got out of bed, and looked through the key-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you watched him all the time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not see what passed in the other room? - A. I only saw him go into the room, and stay about a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him flush of money? - A. No, I never took any notice of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never speak to him about going into that room? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not very well? - A. I was not very well.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go and peep through the key-hole? - A. To see what he was going to do.</p>
               <p>Q. When he took the key out of the door, had you any suspicion? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call to him? - A. No, I never spoke to him when he went out nor when he came in.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have very little to say; the witness has given false evidence against me: I was not there on the 17th day of the month, I stopped at my own quarters, I went to look for my corporal, and we went from there to St. George's in the East, and drew billets; the corporal is here.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood you said, to the best of your belief, he was the man? - A. He was the man that knocked me down.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember losing some watches? - A. Yes, about a quarter before six on the 19th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at that time? - A. I was in my house drinking tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the shop? - A. No, I was in the first floor, the shop is below; I heard a window break; I cried, stop thief! and ran down stairs through the passage into the street, and observed a pane of glass broke.</p>
               <p>Q. What window was that pane of glass broke in? - A. The shop-window; it rained exceeding hard; I missed several watches from off the rods.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the rods near the window? - A. The rods are close to the panes of glass in the shop-window; I looked on the pavement to see whether I could discover any of the watches missing; I discovered this (shews the watch) on the foot-path, near Suffolk-street; I put it in my pocket, and continued at the window to secure it; I ordered the boy to put the shutter up; Walter ran after the prisoner; he returned in about three minutes, and brought the prisoner at the bar in the custody of two men; he came back with them; I asked the prisoner for the other watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first question you asked him? - A. No, the first question I asked him was, what was his name, and his family, as he appeared in a midshipman's dress; he would not tell me his name; one of the men told me he had thrown some thing away that jingled on the ground; then I asked him for the other watches, but he would make no answer. On taking off his glove from his hand I found it bloody; this is the glove (shews a glove); I found nothing on him but duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the right hand or the left? - A. The right hand glove was cut through and bloody, and his hand was cut and bleeding. A gentleman came in, and said, he was a captain of a man of war, he wished to converse with him; the gentleman wished to get his name; he said his name was Scott, that he came from Greenwich; I am not sure whether he said James or Thomas; he was taken then from thence to Bow-street before Sir

               <p>Q.Could that have been? - A. No; I was very particular in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I understood, you let your warpers take a number of bobbins away to work them up at their houses; now, suppose last Wednesday she had so many bobbins, she ought to bring them back perhaps on Saturday, and perhaps they may not bring them home till Monday; they may not always bring them home at the exact time? - A. They always do, or should do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the bobbins that she had in her pocket, she might be mistaken as to the time, whether it was a fortnight, or three weeks, or two months; when you went to look at the bag, was the mouth of the bag next the scale? - A. I cannot say; Mr. Titford shook the bag before I could notice it.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether they were at the top at first, you cannot say, Mr. Titford might have shook them to the bottom; was the mouth of the bag open or shut? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much does your scale hold? - A. It will hold two hundred bobbins very well, without any danger of falling out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was any white silk delivered to the prisoner? - A. About two months before.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you deliver the silk, you weigh it out to your workwomen, and when they bring it back, you weigh it again? - Yes, but we are not particular to half an ounce, and sometimes they keep it a week; we give them another day, when they cannot finish it.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not give them two months? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are son to the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the prisoner being brought to the room where you were, did you see any white silk that was found in her pocket? - A. Yes, five bobbins of white silk.</p>
               <p>Q. You then went and examined the bag? - A. I took the bag up with both my hands, and opened the bag at the counter; I opened the bag, and said, here they are, and took out five bobbins of black and one of white silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your scale like any thing full? - A. No, the scale is a very large scale, it is totally impossible; (Mr. Titford looks at the bobbins, and identifies them); the value of the six bobbins found in the bag is about six shillings, the value of the five bobbins of white silk found in her pocket about three shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not sell any silk in that unmanufactured state? - A. Never in that state.</p>

Yes, on the 15th of November, on my returning home on visiting some patients, going up the lane near Tottenham High-cross, I observed a man with an ass with two panniers, and a woman within side of the hedge in Mr. Appleton's fields; she was taking bottles from under the hedge, and giving them to the man in the lane; on my approaching, the woman squatted down under the hedge, to prevent my seeing her. I had occasion to stop in the course of a hundred and fifty yards to see another patient, from whose chamber-window I had a full view of the premises; I observed the prisoner to come back from Mr. Appleton's premises with bottles under his arm, and he gave them to the woman; she gave them to the man with the ass; he put them in his panniers, and then she gave something in return to the prisoner, which I saw him put in his left-hand waistcoat-pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am not guilty.</p>

             sworn. - I am an apprentice to the last witness and his partner: On Tuesday, the 7th of February, about half past one o'clock I believe, I was sent to one of our men of the name of Smith, he lives in Holborn, for a gold inside<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150016"/>watch-case, called a box; I received the case from him, and put it in the inside pocket of my great coat; I then went to two or three places in Clerkenwell to others of our workmen, and from thence to Pentonville to my grandmother to dinner; it was then about half past two o'clock. When I got there, I pulled off my great coat; I am not certain whether I hung it on the hook in the passage, or threw it over the bannisters of the stairs; I felt for the watch-case before I went through the garden-gate, it was there then; I staid at my grandmother's about four or five hours; it was near eight o'clock when I went away. I went from thence to Bell-dock; I put my great coat on before I went out; I cannot recollect whether I took it from the hook in the passage, or from the bannisters, I took it down myself. I did not miss the watch-case till the next morning; then I went and pulled down my great coat, and looked for it, I found it was gone; I had not an opportunity of going to Pentonville that day, but the day after I went. I went down stairs to the servant, the prisoner lived with my grandmother, and told her I had lost a gold box, and asked her if she had seen it; I explained it to her what it was; I told her she might have found it amongst the dust, and if she had, or did, I would give her three guineas; she said she had not seen it. I got one made four days after that; I went down stairs, and shewed it her, and told her that was the pattern of the one I lost; she said she had not seen it; I never saw it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had felt it in your pocket on going into your grandmother's garden-gate? - A. Yes, I put my hand in, and felt it.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home from your grandmother's, did you never put your hand in to feel it was safe? - A. No, I had my two brothers arm in arm with me; I never told my master; then I got another made to supply its place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the gold box? - A. The original value of the gold box lost was five pounds seventeen shillings; the one I got made cost five pounds five shillings and ninepence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the weight of the one lost? - A. This one I had made was the weight of the other lost - one ounce three penny-weights; I had no conversation with the prisoner after that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. When you came down stairs to me, it was on Wednesday? - A. It was on Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Court.) He asked me whether I had such a thing as a gold box; I asked him if he had lost one; he could not tell whether he had lost one, or no.</p>

             sworn. - I live at Battle-bridge, and keep a horse and cart; I knew the prisoner about a month before Christmas, my wife has known her longer: One evening the prisoner came to our room about seven or eight o'clock; I was in bed, we have but one room, my wife was there; she asked us how we did, and said, she was going for some treacle; she said, see what a find I have had, mistress, the other night; she said she had been to town that night the snow fell with her young mistress, or her mistress, I cannot say which; she told us she found the case by the Blue Lion, coming down Gray's-inn-lane; she saw something lay by the snow, she kicked it with her foot, and heard something rattle; she stooped, and picked it up; it happened to be this case or box. She said, she shewed it to Mr. Todd, the cheesemonger, in Battle-bridge, Mr. Todd looked at it, and said, he thought it was not gold. After that, she said she shewed it to a man that keeps a potato-warehouse, he cut it with a knife, and said, he thought it was gold; she asked me if I would sell it for her, as she had no opportunity of getting out; if I would, she would satisfy me for my trouble. I asked her if it had been advertised; she said, no, it had not; I asked her if her young mistress was present when she picked it up; she said she was.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know when it was? - A. No; to the best of my knowledge it is about five weeks ago or thereabouts; it was in two pieces, it was not rivetted; I took it to the Maidenhead public-house, Battle-bridge, two days after, and asked the landlord if he had seen an advertisement of a gold watch case; he said, no, have you found one; I said, no; there was a gentleman in the house reading the newspaper, and I shewed it to him. After that, I took it home again, and kept it there for three or four days; I sold it at last to a Jew in Chancery-lane for one guinea and a half. I brought the money home to my wife; I never saw the prisoner after that till I saw her at Hatton-garden.</p>

She came three or four times to see if I had sold it; I carried the money to the potato-warehouse in Pentonville, which she told me to do; I did not carry the guinea and a half; she told me to take four shillings, I took three shillings and sixpence; she came afterwards, when she came to Mr. Todd for eggs, but she did not say any thing about the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen them that evening yourself? - A. I really cannot say, because there are so many; I am clear he took them from up stairs, because I followed him down stairs directly; I asked him what he was going to do with them; he said he wanted two or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he hold six dozen of spoons in his hand? - A. Yes; they are papered up, and tied. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Q. They are new spoons - do you know them to be your mistress's? - A. They never were used; I know they are our make.</p>

               <p>- ANDERSON sworn. - (Looks at the spoons, and identifies them.) They are worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the son of Mrs. Anderson, the widow? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You had no mark on your money or notes, that you should know them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no evidence against the prisoner; what the prisoner said, was after Smith had said he would forgive him, if he would acknowledge the fact, if he would tell the truth; after that I cannot hear of any confession that he had made; he must be acquitted.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Are you a shopman to Mr. Brooks? - A. Yes: On the 18th of January the prisoner came into the shop alone; she asked to see some muslins; it was about one o'clock; I shewed her two pieces, which she thought were too thin; I then went to another part of the shop to shew her some thicker ones; on my return I saw that the first piece of the two I had shewn her before was gone off the counter. On enquiring of her where one of those pieces was, she said she knew nothing of it; I then told her that she must have the piece of muslin, as there was no other person in the shop; she again denied it; I then sold her a quarter of a yard of muslin, to the amount of eighteen-pence halfpenny. She went out; I then told the young man at the bottom of the shop to bring her back, as I was confident that she had it; the young man brought her in immediately; I then asked her for the piece of muslin; she denied having it, or knowing any thing about it. I then told the young man to go up stairs, and tell Mr. Brooks; previous to Mr. Brooks coming, she went behind a wrapper of muslins, and stooping she dropped the muslin on the ground; then said, here it is lying on the floor.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you undertake to say whether it was not, before the young man brought her back into your shop, laying there before she came in? - A. I am sure it was not, I looked all about there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where she took it from? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to buy a piece of muslin, and four yards of white tape, I gave one shilling and seven-pence for them. I was not gone out of the shop when they called me back; they wished me to turn out my pockets; I said, gentlemen, look among the muslins; they looked there, and found it; there was a woman in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was the prisoner? - A. When he took the silver from me, I ran after him a little while, and then I was afraid to go further after him; I am sure the prisoner is the person who took it from me.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pocketbook-maker, and live at No. 44, Jewin-street. I was at work when I heard a cry of, stop thief! I did not think of going down, for I knew it was a boy's voice, till I heard him cry out, murder! then I ran down stairs, and turned to where the voice was. I saw the prisoner turn into the Crescent; I met him at the other end of the Crescent, as he was coming out, and the boy after him; the boy cried out, that man has robbed me; I made way for them; the prisoner came out first, and just as he came out there was a light, that I could see a bag in his left hand; I pursued the prisoner, and got hold of his coat just as he got to the top of Jewin-street, and the flap of his coat came off in my hand, which made me stagger. A gentleman was crossing the road; they met each other, and the gentleman and the prisoner both fell down; I did not lose sight of the prisoner. After they both got up, I met my father's man, and told him to lay hold of the prisoner, because I had only my slippers on; I walked behind them till the prisoner was taken to the Bull's Head public-house in the Crescent, Jewin-street, Mr. Atkins was sent for and a constable; when Mr. Atkins came, the prisoner was taken to the Compter. When I laid hold of the flaps of his coat, he threw the bag of silver from his left hand; a woman picked it up I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was dark at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him throw the silver away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop and pick it up, silver is worth while picking up? - A. I thought it was best to pursue him.</p>

I put the lace in the window in the morning; the square of glass had a crack in it for many years, but not nigh where the lace was put; when I was informed of it, I looked at the window, and saw the glass had been cut with something, and the old crack was remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the hole? - A. About five or six inches long, and about two inches wide; it was long enough to put the hand in, in this direction, (showing how); I and the lad pursued them, and took them; we searched them, but did not find the lace.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time did it happen? - A. On the 31st of January, near five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark? - A. Quite dark out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark enough, if you had seen me at the door, that you would have known me? - A. Certainly I should have known you, or any man, at my door at that time, or any time.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know these two boys before? - A. Yes, I had seen them playing before; when they stood at the post, they were wrangling with each other who should go and take it; the biggest said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150025"/>to the youngest, you go; and the youngest said, I will not go, you go; the biggest went forward, and put his hand in the window, and took out one card of lace, and put it under the left side of his coat; in about a minute after, while the man went round to put up the shutter, he put his hand in a second time; I did not see him take any thing then; there were three of them got together; then they ran up towards Bishopsgate-church; I am sure these are the two boys.</p>
               <p>Q. How close were you to these two boys? - A. I was close to them when they took the lace, I have seen them frequently; there are a number of them tossing up from morning to night in the Broad-place, Petticoat-lane; I have seen the prisoners with them when I have been going to dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You have told us you see a great many boys playing? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not heard there is a reward, if you convict them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you do not know that there is a forty pounds reward for the conviction of a person that breaks open a house? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never been playing with them, I dare say? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was so light, that you were able to see the boys? - A. No, not at a great distance, but I had seen them before.</p>

               <p>Q. You said your window was broke open - was it a casement or a sash? - A. It had two lights in it; one light was broke, and the other was whole, and the one broke was taken out; there was room enough for a person to get through; I missed a plumb-pudding in a dish, a bit of salted beef undressed, and a bit of bread, they were standing in the pantry adjoining.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen these things there the night before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner? - A. Yes; he was born in the neighbourhood, I believe, he has been working about there some time; I had seen him a few days before.</p>
               <p>Q. He does not lodge in your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your dish, and your other things? - A. On Sunday morning; they were brought to me, that is all I know.</p>

             sworn. - I am a labouring man: On Sunday morning, after the alarm of the house being broke open, I went and searched about, we followed him by the track of his shoes; we saw the track of his shoes first at the lower end of Vincent's garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did those footsteps lead, to or from the house? - A. They led into another great garden, were there was a ladder that he might get over the pales; we found the ladder standing there against the pales; we traced him to a barn, about half a mile off, where we found the prisoner lying, and the property in the barn, in a sack.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asleep? - A. No, he was not asleep; he said he came there by reason of the water being so high he could not get over to his own lodgings; we searched the sack, and there we found the property lost, he was lying near the sack; I asked him how the sack came there; he said he knew nothing of it; we took him back to the woman.</p>

When I received my sentence on the 13th of January, 1802, I applied to Lord Pelham to be liberated upon my departing the kingdom, which his Lordship granted; I was liberated upon condition that I should depart the kingdom; I applied to the Secretary of State's Office for a passport, not being successful, he informed me there would be no danger if I went to Paris; I went on board the King George, and arrived in France; I was summoned before the Commissary, I told him I had no passport, and that I had been an officer; he said, if I would enrol myself in the 28th brigade, then lying at Paris, I might continue there, if not, he must send me on board without a passport; I thought in my own conscience, perhaps, in a short time, I might be placed in such a situation as to fight against the British colours, which, in my own conscience, I would not do; I wrote to captain Roach, and desired him to get a pardon for me from Lord Pelham. I was summoned before the Consul, and told him I was a free man; the Consul said, I was not a free man, and that he would send me back in a transport; I was put on board, and came to London, and took a lodging, I never returned on my own account; and if I would have accepted of that infamous offer, of accepting a commission in the 28th brigade, to fight against the British colours, I might have continued there; therefore your Lordship cannot think I have misused that goodness which has been shewn me; I never should have been here could I have obtained a passport from Government.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I have seen him in my shop several times; he came to my shop under pretence of buying a lot of jewellery and plate; the last time he came was, I think, on the 1st of February, he represented himself as a person keeping a stall in the West Indies; I shewed him a lot, he staid a considerable time in looking at the articles, he staid an hour or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he purchase any? - A. We could not agree about the price; he called again, I think, on the 1st of February, he desired I would turn it over in my mind, and let him look at the articles again; I let him see them again, he examined them more minutely, it was a large lot, and came to upwards of two hundred pounds; I told him I would take two hundred pounds for the lot; he bid me one hundred and ninety-three pounds, or thereabouts; he told me to turn it in my mind, and then went away, and said he would come at the time appointed; in consequence of his not coming to the time appointed I looked over the things, and missed several of the articles, to the amount of thirty pounds, he never came to me; I found him by the means of Mr. Dobree, on Monday evening last, at Mr. Dobree's, No. 68, Oxford-street; he was taken to the office in Marlborough-street. On searching him there, an opera-glass was found on him with my private mark and number, it was in his coat-pocket, and a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of that opera-glass? - A. Half-a-guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in the articles he had been looking over? - A. Yes, I am sure; the lot I had been shewing him were not in the shop, they were my own private concern, I have them under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any other part of your property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop part of your house? - A. Yes; I and my partner live there, we occupy the house jointly.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer in Marlborough-street: on the 27th of last month I took the prisoner into custody; on searching her, Holden, the butler, perceived she had dropped something on one side, in a half-handkerchief; it had two half-guineas and a seven-shilling piece in one end, tied with a knot; there was a fourpenny piece of silver, a piece of muslin, a new sixpence, of the last coinage, and a bit of edging, in the other end; I asked the prosecutor to look at the two half-guineas and the seven-shilling piece, if she could swear to them; I asked the prisoner what she had done with the notes before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing, if she would confess? - A. No; there were two 2 l. notes and 1 l. note in the purse; she told me she found the notes in the passage; she found two 2 l. notes, and denied knowing any thing about the 1 l. note; she told me she had thrown the purse away; she had changed one of the 2 l. notes, and bought a gown-piece with it, and about two yards of cotton, besides half a yard of linen, or thereabouts; I saw a new velvet bonnet lying on the table; I asked where she bought the new velvet bonnet; she told me in Cranbourn-alley, and gave 12 s. for it; she said she paid 17 s. for taking property out of the pawnbrokers; she did not say any thing about opening the box.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Newman.) You say your money was in your purse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that purse in your box? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. By what do you swear to the four-penny piece? - A. By the hole that is in it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you had it? - A. About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you swear to the piece of muslin by? - A. By the edging; there are two sorts of edging upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150029"/>Q. Did you put it on yourself? - A. No; I did not; I have had the edging by me two or three years; I have no doubt but that it is mine. When I went to the box, I found it would not unlock as it used to do; it made me suspect that somebody had been there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe whether he had any thing with him before you called to him? - A. I observed him to have a bag of rags; there was a hole in the bag, and through that I saw the rags; he stopped at last; I asked him where he was going; he said to Aldersgate-street to sell these rags; I asked him whose they were; he said his landlady's, but he could not tell me the quantity, nor the price of them; I begged him then to return home to Mr. Conyers; he wished me to go to his landlady, but I thought I was right, that he should return home with me to my house; he did; after that he went and fetched his landlady; the rags were left in our shop; the landlady came, but he did not come with her; the landlady made a claim of these rags, and then denied it; then Mr. Conyers sent for an officer to take Grigs; I went with the officer; we took him close by his lodgings; when he was brought home to our house, he was shewn the rags and the bag; he said that he took them from the back premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you threatened him, or promised any favour? - A. No; I asked him whether he had taken any before; he said he had once; we did not take Oren, the other prisoner, till the next day; I was present when he was taken; he came to work, and enquired after the other prisoner, Griggs; he asked where he was, and why he did not come; I did not give him any answer; then the officer came and took him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you keep old rags in other warehouses? - A. Yes, but none of this sort; these are a superior sort.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How much was that bag of rags worth that he had in Finsbury-square? - A. About 30 s.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer: I apprehended Grigs on the 24th of January in the evening; when I took him I met him in the street; Mrs. Conyers and his landlady were with me; the landlady said to him, you have got me in a great deal of trouble by going to claim these rags; I asked the prisoner whose rags they were that he had when his mistress stopped him; he said they were his master's, that they were delivered to him at the warehouse, and that he had put them under some dung in the yard, till he had an opportunity of taking them away; I then took him up to his master's house, with Mrs. Conyers; I told him to look round and shew me the bag of rags his mistress had stopped him with; he then went and put his hand on the bag of rags I have got here; he said, this is the bag of rags my mistress stopped me with; Mr. Conyers then charged him with a felony; I then took him to the watch-house; I went and apprehended Oren in the morning; I took them both together into the parlour at the public-house, at the side of the office; I then asked Grigs where he got the bag of rags that his mistress stopped him with; I had them from you, he said to Oren; they were both close, face to face; Oren said nothing at all; you gave them to me for the purpose of selling them, and you told me to take them into Aldersgate-street, where you told me to take the others, where you went and shewed me; and he then said to Oren, I was to return you half the money; Grigs was agitated a great deal, and Oren very much so too: Grigs said you know it is true; Oren made no reply; after that, Grigs said, there is now a parcel of rags taken from the stack, and buried under some woollen rags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I suppose you told this man that you would get him to be King's evidence? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You could not discover what was in the bundle? - A. No; it was just dark, in the evening; I followed her to Carnaby-street; she went into Mrs. Trussles, a fur-shop; the Wednesday afterwards I did not go into the room, because she paid me the rent; when her week was up again, on Wednesday or Thursday night, I did not set sight of her; I went up, and discovered all the furniture of the bed and the bed-clothes were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find your property? - A. Some I found at Mr. Sanderland's, Vigo-lane; I took her up out of her lodgings, in Carnaby-street, on Friday; a week after I followed her with the bundle; I found nothing there but a piece of the curtains; and the other part I found at Mr. Sanderland's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I took this woman in out of charity (Mrs. Herbert), as she had a helpless infant, and was out of work; I employed her in work; my work is the army-work; I took compassion on her, as she was without a lodging; I took the blankets from my own bed and lent her; she went to Warwick-street, to that good lady; she came back and said to me, I have got a lodging, will you give me a character; I said, Mrs. Herbert, I will give you one; that very day the lady came; Mrs. Herbert was washing for me; she answered the door herself, and said Mrs. Boulton was very ill in bed, and could not be spoke with; she went out of the door, and gave herself a character, and the good lady took her for a tenant; she lodged with her about a week, when Mrs. Herbert said to me, my good lady, it is out of my power to pay so much a week; if you will only let my child set by your fire-side, I shall be very happy, and Mrs. Harrison and my landlady are witnesses of the child coming to me; the child was very bad in the hooping-cough; she has brought the child to my apartments, and perhaps in half an hour she has brought in two medicines, one to anoint the child outwardly, and the other to take inwardly; I was astonished to know how she got the money; I gave her leave to bring the child in a morning, and to have water for her breakfast; she has brought the child totally undressed in a morning, merely for the child to have the warmth of the fire; she clapped the key upon the table; she seemed to put the child's damp linen on the table, and sometimes she has brought the key in the morning, and has sat by my fire all day; it was entirely out of humanity that I gave her the liberty; I told Mr. Slade, the officer, and my landlady, where Mrs. Herbert was gone to lodge; I told them, in a three-pair of stairs front room; they did not chuse to seek her; I was in the New Prison, Tothill-fields, from Friday to the Wednesday following; on Wednesday following, this Mrs. Herbert's week was up again; during that time, my friend went to enquire where the second lodging of Mrs. Herbert was, and when she went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150031"/>there Mrs. Herbert was gone, and I have never seen nor heard of her since; I have it not in my power to have a Counsellor; there was a young person that came to my landlady, where I have been taken from, to enquire after me; my landlady told her, she had a right to detain any person that came after me, which was this woman that had robbed the lodgings; since I have been in confinement, I could not see any of my friends; when they took me to Marlborough-street, they had all my duplicates and the key of my room; and they did just as they thought proper; there were three pawnbrokers at Marlborough-street; they came forward when I was examined; they could not say I was the person; I am truly innocent; I leave it to the honourable Judge and Jury.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon the day that your house was broke open on the night, was he there all the day? - A. No; he was at work in the day; he was at my house in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he leave your house that night? - A. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the last person in your house? - A. He was the last stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure the house? - A. Yes; I was the last person up.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed? - A. I secured the house about a quarter of an hour after he left it, and then went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you find you had been robbed? - A. A little after seven in the morning, I was told by my servant, Ann Gibson, that my house was broke open; I was up when she told me; it was getting light; then I went and looked; I saw the door-post of the back door was cut through, leading into the private place at the back door of the house, leading to a privy, and the bolt broke; it is a dark place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does that dark place lead to that you have thus described? - A. It leads into a privy.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is the wash-house? - A. Adjoining the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Inside of that back door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any body get at the outside of that back door? - A. There was a wall about nine feet high they might go over; there was a brick out for a foot, near a yard and a half; and there was a paling eight feet high, and they might go over the paling, and then there is a water-buit and ladder inside, by which they got into this hole that leads into the privy, and so to the door of the wash-house; I observed in the wash-house the lid of the pickling-tub was taken off, and two legs and a loin were taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them there the day before? - A. I saw the pork the very evening before.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon that what did you do? - A. I sent for Creedland, the officer; I suspected the prisoner because he was the last man in the house, and had helped to put the pork there; and no man besides knew where it was but my own family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the officer? - A. No; I was very much alarmed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any of your pork afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the pork again, did you know it to be your pork? - A. I will swear to one leg.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. After we had found the pork, the officer and I went and searched, and found him, about 200 yards off, supplying a bricklayer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him? - A. He wanted to know what was the matter; he said he had done nothing amiss.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing him about the time the house was broke open? - A. I saw him the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - A. At the Adam and Eve.</p>
               <p>- CREEDLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an officer belonging to Queen-square? - A. Yes; I went to No. 11, in Gardner's-lane, York-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him there? - A. No, he lodged there, but he was not at home; the servant maid went, and shewed me where he lived.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was it? - A. Adjoining to Price's, the right-hand door; the door was locked; I put my hand against the door, and found it was very loose; I pushed the door, and went in, and looked round the room; I saw the bed folded up, and turned it down, and between the sacking and the bed I found the legs and the loin of pork; I then took the pork into my possession, and I have kept it ever since; as soon as I found the pork, I said to Mr. Till, shew me where the man is; I went after him, and as soon as I saw him, I took him; I said to him, my friend, what have you done with the pork; he trembled, and seemed much frightened; nor did he know that I had got it in my custody until I got him before the Magistrate, and there he denied it openly. - (The pork produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Till.) Look at that pork? - A. That is the leg, I'll swear to it; I cut that black mark out myself; there is a part of it in now, it was a bruise; I cannot swear to the other leg; I only know it was put in salt a week before the other; I believe the loin is mine.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gibson.) Look at the pork? - A. I know no more than I remarked that notch in the leg; my mistress said, take it out, and make a ham of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who made that notch in it? - A. There was a notch in it when my mistress had it out, and hung it up for a ham.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The constable told my friends my trial would come on on Monday; a lady was here then, she is not here now.</p>
               <p>Creedland. I told no person whatever; I have not seen any lady.</p>

            : On Wednesday the 8th of February, about half after six o'clock, as I was folding some things in the shop, I heard a noise; I turned round, and missed two waistcoats; I was inside of my shop, with my back to the door; they were pinned to a coat that was hung up against the partition near the shop door; I went to the door, and saw the prisoner at the bar running; I pursued and took him; I suppose he ran about four or five hundred yards or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever out of your sight? - A. Yes; he was turning round the corner, I missed sight of him; he made great resistance; he had the two waistcoats under his jacket when I took him; I told him he must come back again; I offered five shillings to any body that would assist me, but they would not; I was used very ill indeed several times; I brought him back, and sent for an officer; the officer has got the waistcoats here; I am sure they were taken from the inside of the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you, when you found her hand at your fob, not to put your hand there too? - A. A little while after I accused her of taking my watch and handkerchief; she very strongly denied it; my little brother was with me; he made answer and said, he saw her put something in her bosom; she wanted to go down; Mr. Davis had gone home; I told her she should not go down till I searched her, and she pulled her things off, to shew us she had not got the watch; she wanted to go down again; we detained her till we came to the bottom of Clerkenwell-green.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it night or day? - A. It was half past ten at night when we took her in the waggon; we gave charge of her at the watch-house in Ray-street to the officer of the night; he searched her, and could not find it the first time; my little brother said to him, she put something in her bosom; the constable then found it under her arm-pit; she had a waistcoat next her skin; I saw the constable find it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect a waggon coming by, and a woman given in charge? - A. Yes; I searched her the first time, and could not find the watch; the little boy said, I am sure she put something by her right breast, and his brother was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her whether she had it? - A. Yes; she denied it, and called me a blackguard, and every thing that was bad; I searched her again, and we felt there was a something there in her flannel waistcoat, with a kind of a pocket, as if it was made on purpose; that is my watch I'll swear, says he; I then searched for the handkerchief; the little boy said, upon the top part of the handkerchief there is a red spot, like a spot of blood; I pulled her handkerchief off, and found the prosecutor's handkerchief put twice round her neck, with a little knot tied: the man was not quite sober; after the prosecutor was gone, she said the carman persuaded her to do it; he said to her, the young man has a watch; he does not know how to wind it up; it is of no more use to him than a turnip. - (The watch and handkerchief produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifford. Q. What time of the day was it? - A. About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect how you had been drinking that afternoon? - A. I met with an acquaintance, a painter and glazier, in an empty house; he was within the empty house, and tapped at the window to me; I went in, the prisoner was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it you went into the house? - A. About one; I staid there about a quarter of an hour, and went to a public-house, and had something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. You, and the prisoner, and this other person? - A. Yes, the man is a master glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you had some purl and gin? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was not purl and gin? - A. No, I will not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much purl and gin did you drink that day? - A. I do not know how much we had.</p>
               <p>Q. From a quarter after one till four o'clock, you drank a great deal, and you were taken ill in the street as you were going home, you got so drunk? - A. No, I was not ill with drinking, I was ill before.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that? - A. A fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought purl and gin would be a good remedy - do you mean to say you were sober when you went home? - A. I do not know that I was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that when you got home, you were not satisfied with what you had at the public-house, you had more when you got home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect sending that woman to pawn the mug? - A. She took it clandestinely out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she never give you the ticket? - A. She said she left it with Mr. M'Larin.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you where it was? - A. Yes, she did; I went after her to the same house where she was with Mr. M'Larin, and told her she took the pot; she told me where she had pledged it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she pay you the money, the twenty shillings, that it was pledged for? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you saw her that evening - what is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150035"/>reason that you did not go before a Magistrate before five weeks? - A. I did not know where to find her.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not call an officer that night? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Because she had told you where it was pledged, and gave you the money, that was the reason - do you know a person of the name of Days? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever attempt to seek for this woman for five weeks? - A. I did; I spoke to Mr. Slade, the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this glazier? - A. Yes, he lives in Little St. Martin's-lane; I went to him, and he said he knew nothing about her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you when you went to Hicks's-hall to prefer this bill of indictment? - A. Nobody but the prisoner's husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner's husband give you any money? - A. No, I never received a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. You never received half-a-guinea, nor seven shillings, nor three shillings and sixpence, and never said, I'll take care when I have got this money, I'll humbug the Jury? - A. No, I never said such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the expences at Hicks's-hall, did not the woman's husband? - A. I do not know any thing about it, I never paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you happen to go with that woman's husband to Hicks's-hall? - A. He came up to me, and asked a favour.</p>
               <p>Q. And you granted a favour, if he would pay the expences at Hicks's-hall? - A. That woman's husband did not pay the expences.</p>

Yes, with my husband; I knew the prisoner at the bar for near two years; she came to my master's house when he was out of town, on Tuesday, the 2d of January, and asked me if I would let her sleep in the house a few nights; I told her I would, I could do such a thing, but I was afraid of getting anger of my mistress.</p>

               <p>Q. What silk was it? - A. A cloak, which had been laid by for mourning; I asked her whether she had touched any thing else; she said, no, she never put that there; I told her there was nobody<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150036"/>in the house to touch it but her; she then confessed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You had so good an opinion of her, that you took her to the Castle, and gave her some dinner there? - A. Yes, I gave her some victuals; I did not eat any myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a good opinion of her? - A. Yes, and so had my wife.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. And you would take her home now? - A. No, I would not do that; I don't want to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. How many seven-shilling pieces were there? - A. They were all marked - the seven-shilling pieces, the half-guineas, and the guineas; my son-in-law marked them.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they marked with? - A. With a W, and a notch under the crown.</p>
               <p>Q. When you charged her with this seven-shilling piece, what did she say? - A. She said she had it not; the constable found it on her.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am a constable of Hatton-garden: Mr. Carter told me he had been robbed by a servant girl; I went with him to the prisoner's-brother in Laystall-street, where I found her; I searched her, and found the seven-shilling piece that Mr. Carter had described to me.</p>

               <p>Q. How many seven-shilling pieces were there in this money? - A. There were ten guineas in the whole; I cannot say how many seven-shilling pieces, or how many half guineas.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Carter.) You entrusted your son-in-law to mark them? - A. Yes, and I gave her some victuals, I thought very well of doing so, before she went to prison; she did not know, poor thing, where she was going to; I do not wish to be in any trouble.</p>

I shewed her several lower then, and she seemed to be dissatisfied with them; I asked her what price she would go to; she said she did not know. The first I shewed her was three shillings and ninepence a yard; I asked her if she would go to that; she said, she would, if she could get a good one; I knew them to be good I had shewed her; I suspected her, and said, stop, I will look, I think there is one missing; she told me I must find it; I told her I intended to find it before she went out of the shop; she asked me whether I thought she had robbed the shop; I told her I would say no farther till I was perfectly satisfied. We counted the lace over again, and I found it one short; I then told her I was sure. She asked me whether I was not ashamed to accuse her; I told her, no, if she was not ashamed to steal, I was not ashamed to accuse her. She insisted upon leaving the shop; I told the young man to go to my next door neighbour, Mr. Ellis, she had cheated him out of a yard of dimity; she insisted all the time she had not got the lace; I told her the pattern and the price. I then told our young man to get a constable; the constable came, and found the lace upon her; I searched her myself, the constable was present; she had two shawls on, it was in the under shawl. During the time she was there, two persons came in, our young man is not very careful, and while he was serving them, I cast my eye now and then to look at them; in the mean time, the lace was gone; we were both behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. There were two other customers - there were five of you in the shop during the time she was there? - A. Yes, for a short time.</p>

             sworn. - On the 19th of January, about twenty minutes past seven o'clock, I perceived the prisoner at the top of the Minories, next door to the church; I saw a bundle under his arm, and waited to see which way he went; he went down Church-row; I followed him from thence to Houndsditch, and within forty yards of Gravel-lane, Houndsditch, I stopped him, and asked him what he had got; he told me, soap; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said to take it home; I asked him which he called home; he said, just down here; I asked him what use he made of it at home; he said his wife was a washerwoman; I asked him where he brought it from; he told me from Mr. Nowlan's manufactory; I asked him whether he took so much home every night; he said his master sold it him; he could get it cheaper at his master's than at a retail shop; I went to Mr. Nowlan's, and told him I had stopped a man of the name of Hughes, with 15 lb. of soap; Mr. Nowlan came with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the evening I was taken, Mr. Nowlan was sent for; he said to me, you have robbed me in a pretty manner; I can nearly swear you have been cutting the cakes of soap to-day; I said you are wrong; I have had it of you some time back; if you refer to your books, you will see that I was to pay you on Saturday night; and before the Lord Mayor, he could not identify the soap so well as he could the night before; now said I, if you had brought a sample of the soap, you would have satisfied my Lord Mayor and me both, and next day I was brought before the Lord Mayor, Mr. Nowlan brought a piece which he thought would come nigh the piece there as possible; he took a wire and cut in the two pieces; there was a difference in the two pieces when cut; he would not shew the two cakes to my Lord Mayor, and as to his saying the soap was warm, I carried it under my arm for a mile, the heat of my body might heat the soap; I appeal to Mr. Nowlan for my character.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Nowlan.) What has been his general character? - A. I have known him for these twelve months; his general character has been always honest; I placed a great confidence in him; indeed he has lived with Mr. Jones, of Shoreditch; and with Mr. Bicknell, formerly of the Maze. I wonder he has brought me forward to his character.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: on the 30th of January I met the prisoner, just by Bagnigge-Wells, about six o'clock; he had a bundle under his coat; I stopped him, and asked him what he had got there; I told him not to be alarmed, I was an officer, and insisted on knowing what he had; in the mean time, a gentleman was coming by; I asked him if he knew the prisoner; he said he did; I then asked him where he worked; he told me that he worked in Britannia-street, for one Mr. Webb; I then took him back to Battle-bridge, and left him in custody of another officer, while I went to Mr. Webb's house with the property that I had taken from him; he told me, after the gentleman came, for whom he worked; I took him, by the desire of Mr. Webb, to Bow-street; after that, I searched his cupboard, and found a great quantity of old iron, the property of Mr. Webb.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you sell them in papers with that mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have dealt in that article a considerable time; how can you tell but that you may have sold those very articles? - A. I cannot say any thing to that; but these hooks which are not in the indictment were made but a week ago, and the screws.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. There is some old iron; what are these? - A. It is nut iron; waste iron that is cut off, after working it; we pack it up to send in the country to the mills.</p>

            , coming into your shop? - A. On Saturday, the 21st of January, about one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she come for? - A. To purchase two muslin handkerchiefs; she tendered a 2 l. note, and, from its general appearance, I had a suspicion it was a forged one; I communicated my suspicions to a fellow shopman, and desired that he would take the note for inspection, his name is John Shaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform the prisoner that you should take it to the Bank? - A. I did; I told her that I had suspicion that it was a bad one, and that I should send to the Bank; she objected to that, and said, if you will give it me again, I know where I had it, and I will get it changed; I then delivered it to John Shaw, and he went to the Bank with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? - A. She said she would go along with him; she went out of the shop with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. Near eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come alone? - A. She came in company with the other prisoner, Palmer.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that note you delivered to Shaw was the note she gave you? - A. Yes; about eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150040"/>o'clock the same evening, the two prisoners came, and the prisoner Palmer said, this woman has been here to-day, and offered a 2 l. note, which you have stopped; he asked the reason why we stopped it; he said it was his note; he must either have it or the change; we said the note had been sent to the Bank, and, in consequence of that, we could not return it; he repeatedly insisted on having the note or the change, saying that it was his; in the interim I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he got the note from? - A. He did not say where he got it from; but he knew where he got it from; he said that it was a d - d piece of business that he must be at the loss of the note; they were taken into custody immediately; on going out of the door, Hudson said, you must be at the loss of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was in the morning you saw the woman that came and tendered that note? - A. It was about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. She returned in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her that you would send to the Bank? - A. I communicated my intention to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have known where to find her, if she had not come? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had refused to take it, she said to Palmer, then you must be at the loss of it? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live with Sir Thomas Week, as a servant, in the Fleet; he pays me so much a week, during the time he is there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. I have known them both about ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you become acquainted with Palmer? - A. At the Rose, in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what time in January you saw him? - A. On Thursday, the 19th of January, I saw him with a man of the name of Hughes; I am perfectly sure that Hughes, Palmer, and me, were at the public-house; Mr. Hughes came from the country, and wished to make some purchase, and wished me to go with him; Palmer said he would be of service to me, and put some money in my pocket; I went out with Palmer, and we found Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Palmer again on that day? - A. No; on Friday morning he asked what passed during the evening between me and Hughes; I told him that Hughes offered me a note that was forged; Hughes told me that it was forged, but it was as good as a real one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what Hughes wished you to do with that note? - A. I told him that Hughes had made a proposal of some forged notes; I refused it; Palmer said, you are a fool, I have got some myself; I told him Hughes said I should have half, if I would make use of them, for I was just the man that would do for it; Palmer told me that I was a fool; and shewed me a 5 l. note, a 2 l. note, and a 1 l. note; I understood they were forged notes, and that he had a quantity, which he had from Hughes; after that, I saw Hughes; he came into the Rose the same day, Friday, the 19th of January, and Palmer was there.</p>
               <p>Q. He shewed you three notes; where did he take them from? - A. He took them out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any more? - A. No; not at that time, Hughes came into the Rose the same day again, and Hughes and Palmer said I was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150041"/>coward, that I had refused the notes, and told me I was a d - d, fool, and abused me intolerably; then Hughes made a second proposal for me to take some notes, and pulled them out of his pocket, and laid them on the table; he took a good one-pound note, and laid it on the table on the side of the bad one, and compared them together, and said, d - n me, look at this, and see if you can see any difference. To all this I declined; then I was repeatedly abused by them; I begged them to let me alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Palmer tell you where he kept them? - A. The box was in a dark sitting-box at the Rose; the table is in the room where the box was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Palmer go up to the box? - A. He went up to the box, and took something out, and put something in, but what I could not plainly see, the place was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Palmer live at the Rose? - A. He slept there frequently, but not constantly, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Palmer again on Saturday - what said he to you then? - A. I don't know that any thing passed very particular then; Hughes then came in, and made another offer for me to take some notes; he again pulled out some notes, and wanted me to write my name, or any other, upon them; I asked him if he would wish me to write my own death-warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner Hudson there on Saturday? - A. Palmer sent for Hudson to make a purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hudson in the morning? - A. No, I was not near her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she, when Palmer sent for her? - A. Out, in the Old-bailey; Palmer went out, and I saw her speaking to him; I heard at a distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear all they said? - A. No, not then; Palmer came in afterwards, and said, he had sent that girl out with a two-pound note, to make a purchase of something.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when she came back? - A. No, I was not present; she sent for him out to a next house, and then he went out of the Rose; I was there when he came back; he then said, he had sent the girl out with a note, and she paid it away. There, says he, you see I have got some money, and I will not be long without some more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hudson and Palmer again on that evening? - A. I saw Hughes and Palmer that same Saturday again, and I understood that they were going to the sight, and it was repeated that they would pay some of the notes away, for he would be d - d if he had not ten pounds by that night; I saw

             together at the Blue Last, in Cock-court, Ludgate-hill, that same Saturday evening at another time.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between them there? - A. I was drinking part of a glass of rum and water; Palmer abused the girl for not bringing money enough, and he abused me too.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he abuse you for? - A. Because I would have nothing to do with them, and she cried terribly, because he abused me.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect what passed about what she had done with the notes? - A. She said, you know I have given you the change; I asked him to pay for the sixpenny-worth of rum and water; he said afterwards to her, G - d b - st you, go and get change for a note, you have plenty of money and notes about you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state any note? - A. He said she had got a two-pound note of his, and he said she had some more notes; I did not hear any more of them; he paid for the rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with the note? - A. No, she did not, they went out both together; I went out a little while before; I was alarmed by his going on in that way; I saw them both together in the court.</p>

               <p>Q. And that mostly a public-house acquaintance - where did you generally meet? - A. We met at several places; he was engaged at a public-house for the Army of Reserve.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the woman? - A. Near the same time.</p>

               <p>Q. Sometimes you had dined with him, but in general it was a more general meeting to drink a glass of beer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With a man of that character? - A. I never saw any harm of him before this transaction of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard him say any thing of Banknotes before the 19th of January? - A. No, not till that time; I was in company with him three times before he was apprehended, when he mentioned the notes.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose the servants of the house had access to it when they came to sweep the place? - - A. Certainly they must.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you went directly and told the landlord what this man said? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with him after? - A. No, I was very uncomfortable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you communicate to any individual what you have told to-day? - A. I told a party I was determined to get all the information I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate it to any individual before the prisoner was taken up? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom? - A. I did not know the prisoner was taken up; on Sunday, I communicated it to Mr. Austin.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, you did not know they were apprehended on Sunday? - A. I did not till the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell any person before Sunday evening, when you learned that they were in custody for forged notes - did you never communicate it to any one single witness? - A. I did to a person that is not present; she is a woman that lives at the other end of the town; I have known her a little while, her name is Mary Glover; she lives at No. 63, King-street, Golden-square.</p>
               <p>Q. And that before Sunday evening; when was it communicated to her? - A. On Friday evening, about ten, or half past ten, at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life has she been in? - A. A milliner and mantua-maker; she is a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q.Your master, being confined in the Fleet-prison, always dines at home? - A. Yes; he always has an old woman to attend him; I attend him always when he wants me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never have occasion to attend him at dinner? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, on Friday evening, you went up to the other end of the town - where do you lodge? - A. I have lodged at No. 63, King-street, for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mary Glover lodged there? - A. I do not know how long justly, more than a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by that expression, you had known her a little time? - A. I said I had known her some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell where these notes were concealed? - A. I told it to Mr. Austin and Sir Thomas Weeks; I told Mr. Austin on Sunday, before I knew the prisoners were apprehended; I told him the notes were concealed in a little box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any search made for the notes? - A. On Monday there was.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday then, there was searching for a box, and no box could be found - do not you know, that if you had given an earlier discovery of the notes, they would have been likely to have been found? - A. I did not know rightly how to make a search.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go and drink with this man, after he had made a proposal to you to part with these notes? - A. I have been in company with him two or three times since that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. Did you understand, or did you not, that he said, in the presence of the woman, that he had received the money for that two-pound note he had sent out? - A. He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he had sent her off again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it the conversation took place respecting that note? - A.Early in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hours after the conversation, that he said he had sent Hudson out again with another two-pound note? - A. About half an hour; I do not know whether it was received.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him say any thing of receiving any money but for the first two-pound note? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you have stated all that passed between them? - A. To the best of my knowledge; I was abused by them several times.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Is Hughes forth-coming? - A. I should like to see him in the situation of Palmer and Hudson.</p>
               <p>Q. You hope to give information against Hughes? - A. I hope so; I believe that he first seduced Palmer.</p>

             sworn. - On Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner Hudson at the Compter; the first question I asked her was, how she came by the note; she said, she received it from a gentleman in a hackney-coach; I asked her whether she would know the gentleman again; she said, she thought she might. I then asked her how she had been employed; she said, she got her livelihood by taking in needle-work of any one. I asked her nothing farther, and then I sent for Palmer. I asked him how he came to go with Hudson to Mr. Shaw's shop, on Saturday evening; he said, as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150043"/>stood at the Rose public-house door, the prisoner Hudson came by; he asked her where she was going; she said, she had been stopped with a two-pound note at Mr. Shaw's; the prisoner, he said, was an old acquaintance of his, and he went with her. I asked him whether the note he went after, with Hudson, that evening, was his property; he said, it was not.</p>
               <p>Palmer's defence. I never saw the note, before I saw it at Guildhall. Is it to be supposed, that if I knew this note to be a forged note, I would have gone with her? The woman told me that it was stopped, and that she did not like to go with the gentlemen to the Bank, as she was so dirty. I told her I would go with her; I thought the shopmen might wish to cheat her out of the note; that is the sole reason I went with her.</p>
               <p>Hudson's defence. This man never had the note at all; I never saw the man before I had this note from; I was never in his company till then; he took me in a coach from the 'Change to Charing-cross.</p>

               <p>Q. How near the office, called the Library, was the office Robson was in? - A. It is all on the same floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the care of it? - A. No; he had access to it, but not the care of it.</p>
               <p>Q. In this room you call the library, the marine accounts and log-books are usually deposited? - A. Not the marine accounts; the marine accounts are usually deposited in Robson's room. The logbooks, when they are bound, and a vast many other papers, are deposited in the library.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any occasion lately to get some papers in the library? - A. I had occasion about six weeks ago, from the present time, to go there.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of the search which you made for some papers, did you find some deficiency of the papers? - A. Yes, in the library, and after they were taken up, I found a deficiency in Robson's room.</p>
               <p>Q. How many chests did you find empty? - A. I first understood thirty-seven; I suppose there were twenty-five or twenty-six; I did not look in all these chests.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any enquiry of Robson respecting them? - A. On my missing the letters, I questioned Robson where they were; he said he did not know, but he would endeavour to find them; he said the papers in the library had been moved about by an alteration made in the opposite floor; I enquired daily for about a fortnight; he told me he did not know where they were; he told me one of the carpenters had removed them to a floor below; after a fortnight elapsed he went from the office; he was ill; I saw him about a week after that; he was requested to go into the board-room, there he was questioned whether the account of burning the letters, given by Collins, was correct.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Collins give any answer about the letters? - A. About three weeks after the papers were first missed, Collins said (he was desired by Robson to say), that he and Robson had burned several papers; I asked him what was the quantity, pointing to a bundle of letters; he said none were burnt but those that had burst in throwing down; he answered, there might be five or six of them bundles. I told him there were no bundles to be found from the year 80, down to the present time; he said they carried them out in baskets, and perhaps they might fill five or six baskets; I told him that could not account by any means for the quantity of paper lost; the next morning I was present; Robson was with Mr. Nelson, the Secretary; he was asked whether that account given by Collins was correct; he answered it was; he conceived there might be five or six baskets, and two more burnt by Collins and Newman; I asked him how many times they were employed in burning papers; he said four or five times; I asked him what time he said it was previous to ten o'clock in the morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you present any other time that either Robson or Collins was questioned upon the subject? - A. Not any other time.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were taken up, you appeared at Bow-street. Did you hear the examination at Bow-street? - A. Yes; but I do not know any thing material that was said by either, only they were criminating each other. Robson, upon his examination, offered to appear against Collins, and Collins offered to appear against Robson.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long has Robson been in the office in the present situation? - A. Thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a great part of the property lost before he came in the office? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150044"/>Q. Are they dated 93? - A. Some of the letters are dated 63 and 90, up to 93.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. Collins charged Robson with knowing nothing about it himself? - A. No; he never said he knew nothing about it himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not it in your knowledge that Collins voluntarily resigned himself up? - A. It is not in my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Were you present when this letter from Collins was given to the Board? - A. I was not; I never saw Collins's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>Q. On looking in Robson's room, have you found some papers missing? - A. A great many papers between the years 56 and 95; there were a great many papers missing and taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing belonging to Robson in any of the boxes? - A. There were in one of the boxes an American paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When was it you made your examination? - A. I did not take any particular notice of the day, it was very lately.</p>

               <p>Q. Robson came into the office in January 1803? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say, for several years before; you made no examination? - A. No, not for several years; I have had frequent recourse to those boxes, but not lately.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course, it is impossible for you to say in what state they might be in two or three years ago - now, in respect to the boxes, they were not immediately under his care? - A. Not immediately under his care; Mr. Robson had the care of that room where he was employed; it was called Robson's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Other people had access to it as well as he? - A. To be sure they had.</p>

               <p>Q. Now confine yourself to the first transaction you had at any time with them last summer - what did Robson say to you? - A. He said, as I kept a shop he had some paper to shew me; I went up into his room, and there I saw a great deal of waste paper lying on the floor; he said, if I had any use for that paper, I was welcome to it, for it was laying about, and Mr. Nelson wished it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Collins say any thing respecting the paper? - A. Yes, he came in, and heard what passed; he said, what would I give a pound; I said, two-pence or two-pence halfpenny; I had not kept shop long; I gave him two-pence halfpenny; I said, shall I bring a bag, and take it away; Collins said, he would send it me; in the course of that day Greenwood brought it me; there were fifty pounds, more or less, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at the time that Greenwood brought it, did either Robson or Collins come? - A. Yes, Collins came.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that these papers were produced in the month of June? - A. They are some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you charged with taking them? - A. I was taken up, but never accused or charged with such a thing.</p>

               <p>Collins's defence. I never did any thing but under the direction of Mr. Robson.</p>
               <p>Robson's defence. In the present situation that I am now placed in, there are matters that I am now burdened with; my mother and sister died on the present account, and my father is unacquainted with the business, and my friends have not been with me all the time; I am left alone to your mercy.</p>
               <p>Robson called one witness, who gave him a good character; Collins called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand? - A. No; he said he came there to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get into your yard? - A. He came through the passage of the house; I cannot say whether the door was shut, for we have many lodgers in the house, and they might leave it open, as they do frequently; I seized the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What tools were they? - A. Six saws and two planes were lying on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had they been? - A. They had been on the bench, I left them on the bench; I locked the shop door myself on Sunday afternoon at two o'clock, and there were no tools on the floor then; I cannot say the saws were in the chest, but the planes were; the chest was not locked.</p>
               <p>CORNELIUS BERKLEY sworn. - I am a watchman; I was called in by the last witness; Mr. Crow informed me there was a thief in the house; I went backwards, and found the prisoner in the yard; it was a little after twelve o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. You found nothing on him? - A. Only some keys; the workshop was fastened by a padlock, and the staple that was screwed in was forced out without unlocking the padlock; a little after I laid hold of him he leaned down, as if he was putting something down; I stooped, and found it was an iron hammer; the handle was iron, and at the end it was flat, something like a screw-driver; I asked Mr. Crow if the iron hammer belonged to him; he said, it did not; I looked in the workshop, and saw some saws, and something else, lie close together at the door; I conveyed him to the watch-house; I have the saws here.</p>

               <p>Q. When you were in the shop, what state did you find it in? - A. I found a man standing behind the counter in the shop, with a lighted candle in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What man was that? - A. The prisoner at the bar; I called out to my husband, and then he ran out of the shop door; my husband was very heavy asleep; I called him again, and when he got up he had a light of the watchman, and he came in to us; we looked about, the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence on the door? - A. I did not notice any.</p>
               <p>Q. Any lodgers in the house - did you leave the door open for them to come in? - A. No, I did not leave open the door for them to come in; the people that belonged to them were to open the door to let them in.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon after was he taken? - A. I cannot exactly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - A. About an hour after; he was taken by Mr. Crow, and taken to the watch-house the same night.</p>

             sworn. - I am one of the patrols; I produce a skeleton key that will open almost any door; it was found in his left-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the street door? - A. No, it is too small to open the street door.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Kennedy.) Did the street door open in the passage or in the shop? - A. In the passage, there is a door in the passage for the shop; I only saw him go out of the shop door; that door was fastened when I went to bed; the street door was fastened by a lock; there is a bolt, but I do not know whether it was bolted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Kennedy swore at the Office that the door was fastened with three bolts.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not find any of your house broke open? - A. No, only the street door was unlatched at eleven, or thereabouts; I always lock the door myself; I am certain it was latched, because I heard it.</p>
               <p>- MACARTY sworn. - I am a watchman; Mr. Cutler brought the prisoner to me; after I had secured the prisoner, I went back to the house, and there I saw those boots in a kind of a hole in a dark place in the cellar, at a distance from the copper, near the stairs; the copper was in the front kitchen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had the venereal disease very bad; I went to the doctor, and he gave me some medicine to ease me; I saw this house, and not seeing it look a very decent house, I took the liberty of going in; I went in as a man came out; the gentleman came, and took hold of me; I have not been in London above five weeks; my friends live above 107 miles from this place, I had not an opportunity of sending to them.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you give him for it? - A. I gave him a guinea and a half for this watch and an old-fashioned necklace.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - A. I have known him 20 years, and is father likewise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What day of the month was it you say you bought it of me? - A. I do not recollect exactly; I have not read the entry of the book.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you would mention the day of the week? - A. I cannot tell without I had the book with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the 3d of February; that was the last time you bought a metal watch with a necklace; it is trifling with me? - A. I cannot tell exactly; I did buy a necklace with the watch, and I gave you a guinea and a half for them.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought it on the 3d of February; I have not seen it since I have been brought here. (The watch produced.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Windsor.) Look at that watch, Mr. Windsor? - A. I am sure it is my watch; here is my private mark on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it is one of the watches that you shewed to the prisoner? - A. Yes; I have had the watch too long not to have known it.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the peppermint? - A. In the bar; one of those three took it away; I only know Butler; I do not know the others; they were in company together; Butler went out at one door, and the other men went out at the other; I asked who was to pay for the gin; the other men said, Butler was gone to fetch a penny; he immediately brought in sixpence, and I gave him three half-pence, and the other men went away; I immediately took the candle, and said, Lord, those three men have took my peppermint away; I went to the door, and saw Butler at the door; I asked him, where the other men were; I called him, and said, I must keep you while I find the other men; and brought him in doors; I sent immediately for an officer, who took him to Hatton-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your cask again? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How many persons were there in the tap-room? - A. There was not any one after I had lost it; it was there when those men came in, but it was not there when they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw two or three men come in together; it was there when they came in, and when they went out it was gone; which door did they go out at? - A. I do believe that Butler went out at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your house a public-house? - A. It is; we have a tap-room there; the peppermint was in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not any other person there, besides these men? - A. There was nobody there but two or three women.</p>
               <p>Q. A woman could smuggle any thing under her petticoats, as well as a man under his small clothes? - A. The three men stood before it so that nobody could get at it but them.</p>

             went down to the stable, I suppose between eight and nine o'clock; previous to his going down, he went down to the warehouse which is under the shop where I was; he was down in the warehouse a considerable time, about a quarter of an hour; he came up with a sack on his back, which I supposed to contain straw, which he was in the habit of taking down to the stable in a sack; he went out, and I have no doubt but he went down to the stable.</p>

               <p>Q. Why have you no doubt? - A. Because it was his usual custom to go at that hour; about nine or ten, the other servant of my father told me he wished to speak to me; in consequence of what he told me, I went down to the stable with him, and went in the hay-lost; there I saw the cheese and the hams charged in the indictment, concealed under the hay; I returned, and left them as I found them; I thought it was the best way, wishing to find the person out that had concealed it; I acquainted my father with it, and he sent me to Bow-street; I consulted with the officers there; they advised me what to do; I shewed them the situation of the place; they agreed to come at eight o'clock in the evening; the prisoner went down to the stable about two or three o'clock, which he usually did every day; on his return he never hung the key of the stable up; it was his custom to hang it up behind the street door, which made me suppose he intended to take away the goods shortly; we kept him at home all the afternoon; my father purposed to keep him at home that he should not have an opportunity of going to the stable; about half-past six we sent him out, I went out previous to his going out; I went down near the stable, that I might have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150051"/>an opportunity, if he did go there, to see him; I continued in ambush for about ten minutes, and nobody came; I returned home, and after a short time I sent our other man nearly to the same place where I had been before, while I looked after the officers; he had appointed to meet me at a place opposite our house; I could not find him there; I went down to the place where our man was, and I had not been there many minutes before the officer came; we were altogether not more than forty minutes before the prisoner, Burn, came down to the stable-door; the other prisoner, Conner, came another way, and met him at the stable-door; Conner unlocked the stable-door, and they both went in and shut the stable-door after them; they remained in for the space of five minutes, and the prisoner, Burn, came out with a load on his shoulder; they both came out together, and they both went back the same way the prisoner Conner came; we followed them a little way, though at a proper distance; when they got up a street, called Beaufort-buildings, they parted. Burn continued up these buildings, and Conner went immediately home the contrary way; I and the officer continued to follow the prisoner Burn with the load on his shoulder, till he came to No. 35, Wilmot-street, where he went in, and we close after him. The officer asked him what he had got there; he said, two hams and one cheese; he said he brought it from Beaufort-buildings for Mr. Dollond's young man; we took him in custody, and secured him in the watch-house; then we went and secured the other prisoner, he was still at our house; on searching him, there was a book in his pocket, in which was a memorandum, a cash-account, for money received, with the signature of Burn; that is the other prisoner's name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He came up with the sack that you supposed was filled with straw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go with him? - A. It is not my usual custom to go with the sack of straw to the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether he went to two or three places before he went to the stable, you cannot say? - A. There are people that can say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The other man is quite a stranger to you? - A. He is.</p>

             sworn. - I am Mr. Dollond's servant: On Thursday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, as I was hanging my master's hams up, I missed two of them; I said to Connor, there are two hams deficient, where are they; he said he did not know any thing of them, for he put them up the night before; I hung two more out in their stead; I went into the warehouse below stairs to clean some knives, as I usually do; there I saw a heap of straw, and under that heap of straw I found one large ham; I covered it up as I found it, and up in the shop I run; my master sent me out with some butter; when I came home, I went down into the warehouse, where I found the straw and the sack gone, and the ham likewise; when I came up in the shop again, my master told me to come to breakfast; the prisoner Conner told me there was some sawdust wanted; I asked him for the sack, and he told me the sack was at the stable; I took the key, and went down to the stable for the sack; I found the sack across the shafts of the chaise, empty, and some straw under the shafts, which I supposed to be the straw he had taken out of the cellar; I had some suspicion that the ham was among the straw; in searching the straw, I could not find any ham there; I went up in the hay-lost, and the very first thing I put my foot against, was a large Cheshire cheese; I lifted up a truss of hay, and there I found a large ham and a little one; I left the cheese and hams as I found them, and took the sack, and went up to my master's house, and there I saw my young master; I told him I wanted to speak to him; he and I went both down to the stable, and there he found the goods under the hay and straw, as I have related before.</p>
               <p>- TOWNSEND sworn. - I am one of the patrols: On Thursday last, I received information from young Mr. Dollond. I went into the street to watch about eight o'clock and the two prisoners at the bar came down; they both went into the stable together in the dark; after they had been both together for about five minutes, they both came out together, and went up a slight of steps leading to Beaufort-buildings, the prisoner Burn with a load on his back; they went up together about half way up Beaufort-buildings, where the prisoner Conner parted with the prisoner Burn; I followed the prisoner Burn to No. 35, Wilmot-street; he went into an old iron-shop, and I and another took him into custody, with the property on him; I asked him whose it was, and he told me he was the master of it.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps the old iron-shop? - A. Yes, he said it was his house; I asked him what he had got in the sack; he told me some ham and cheese; I asked him where he got it from; he told me in Beaufort-buildings, and that he had brought it for Mr. Dollond's young man; I then took him to the watch-house, and went to Mr. Dollond's shop, and there I took Conner in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. At the place where you saw him take it from - where was it? - A. It is the bottom of Carter-lane; he took it from the stable; on searching the prisoner, Conner, in his outside coat pocket, I found two guineas, and in his breeches pocket I found one bad shilling and a good one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He told you he got it at Beaufort-buildings? - A. I asked him where; he would not say any more than that, and then he added afterwards, that he brought it for Mr. Dollond's young man.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a flight of steps that leads up to Beaufort-buildings? -</p>
               <p>Court. There is a communication from one to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him if he had been into the stable? - A. I asked him if he had any acquaintance in town that would give any account whatever how he came by them, and he said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go and enquire of him? - A. I was informed of it before.</p>
               <p>Court. He was on the watch, and saw them part, and one went the other way.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. Half past eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>- sworn. - I am an officer of Bow-street; I know no more than has been related; I was with Townsend and Mr. Dollond's son; I assisted in taking the prisoners.</p>
               <p>(The cheese and hams produced, and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150052"/>Mr. Dollond, Sen. There is B and D, which is my mark, a circular mark; the B is inside of the D on the cheese.</p>
               <p>Q. Any mark on the ham? - A. The weight of this I can swear to; I marked it myself, and my son can own the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Any body can tell they are hams if they taste them - are you sure you have not sold these hams? - A. To be sure I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take out the marks when you sell them? - A. We do not; we sell them at a proportionate price, and let the marks remain.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The gentleman asks you this question, whether this identical ham has been sold? - A. I have sold many hams.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dollond, Jun. I cannot swear that they were never sold, but I believe the witness Dawson can.</p>
               <p>Dawson. I can swear to this ham; this is the ham I believe was in the cellar, but I cannot swear to the other.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have they your mark on them? - A. They have my master's mark on them.</p>
               <p>Conner's defence. There was a young man called upon me, and left these hams and cheese in my care, so I employed Mr. Burn, and paid him, and got him to remove them, for fear my master should suspect me if he saw them there.</p>
               <p>Burn's defence. Conner came in my place, and asked me to take a load a little distance; I agreed to have a shilling or eighteen-pence to carry it by day, but I would not go at that time of night unless I had two shillings and sixpence; he took me to Beaufort-buildings, he told me he would come the day after for them; after I returned home, I was taken by these two officers.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Burn, called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

             sworn. - I am a servant; Mr. Berleyson employed me to see the wine removed out of the cellar; I was in office there for that purpose; the prisoner asked me what I wanted there; he said, there was no occasion there for me; a little while after, he wished me to carry half a dozen baskets; I told him, I did not carry wine; presently a person came in the cellar, he made answer, there was another watchman coming; I told him I was no watchman, but I was employed by Mr. Berleyson to see the wine removed, and I should be there; soon after that, he missed coming in his turn; they came regular one after the other, and he did not come in his turn; I asked him where he had been; he said, he had not been in the cellar with me; I asked him when he come again where he had been; he said, he had been in Glasshouse-street to ease himself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take notice every time? - A. Yes, I marked every dozen that went out on the wall, and likewise every dozen on a wooden cellar-candlestick that I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. How many dozen were there? - A. Fifty-six dozen, and five bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JONES sworn. - I am a chairman: On the 26th of January, between the hours of one and two, I just left Mr. Berleyson's house, I was going home to my own dwelling-house, No. 7, Haydon-street, and saw the prisoner in Leicester-street with an empty basket of a dozen of wine; he was talking to another man, saying, he was at work for a publican below Mr. Berleyson's, about one hundred and sixty yards from Swallow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Leicester-street in the way to Glasshouse-street? - A. No, quite contrary.</p>
               <p>- SLATER sworn. - I billed the wine, and am a wine cooper; there were fifty-four dozen and five bottles drawn from the pipe; I live at No. 1, Little Berkeley-street,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150053"/>Grosvenor-square; we drawed from Swallow-street, and billed it in Sackville-street; I drew on Thursday, the 26th instant, forty-three dozen of wine, and put it on my left-hand side distinctly on the bottles; I drew one dozen, and put it to the other, that made forty-four, and then I drew ten dozen in quarts, which made fifty-four dozen and five bottles; I do not include what was drawn after that, there came twenty-two after that, but that is not included in what was taken to Sackville-street; I know nothing about the removal of the wine; in all there were fifty-two dozen moved into Sackville-street, and two dozen and two; there were fifty-four dozen and five drawn from the pipe.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Rather a short pipe? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you marked only fifty-four dozen and two, did you mark them as you put them in? - A. I scored them as they brought them in, I told Mr. Berleyson how many; he was not there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I speak before God Almighty, that I never took a bottle of wine in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when he gave you his watch to take home? - A. At nine o'clock at night, I was to take it home; it had a gold seal, with my master's coat of arms on it and a red ribbon; I put it in my left-hand breeches-pocket; then I went to a public-house, about ten o'clock, the Feathers, St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your master live? - A. No. 30, Great Maddox-street; I met with the prisoner accidentally, I had seen him once before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other person there? - A. Another Swede; I am a Swede, and the prisoner is a Swede; we sat down and drank together, I paid for all the liquor; we drank five glasses of gin and water each.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any watch about you? - A. I had my own, and my master's; my master's is a gold hunting-watch, with a gold seal; mine is a silver watch, with a metal seal.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at this public-house? - A. Till one o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out together? - A. Yes, me and the prisoner, and my friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your master's and your own watch about you? - A. I am quite certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you were very drunk? - A. I did not feel myself drunk in the house, the air took effect of me when I came out, that I could not recollect any thing but calling for a watchman in Leicester-square, and I recollect perfectly well knowing that I had both the watches in the public-house.</p>
               <p>Court Q. Who called the watchman? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect missing your watches there? - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you find yourself? A. I found myself in my own lodgings, in Upper Rathbone-place; I do not know whether I walked or rode there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you were rolling on the ground? - A. I cannot say whether I fell down, I remember having some words.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times you fell down or no, you cannot say? - A. I do not recollect that I fell down, my clothes were not dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you feel for the watches before you left the public-house? - A. I remember feeling for them, and looking at one before I went out, and I saw it was one o'clock when I went out.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am an officer of Bow-street, and apprehended the prisoner on the 8th of February, at the Red Lion public-house, Crown-court; I searched him, and found a silver watch and seal, I have got it here, and a duplicate of a gold watch and seal; he said, the prosecutor had given them him to take care of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the duplicate to get the watch? - A. No, the pawnbroker called at our Office before. (The watches produced.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q.(To Chamberry.) Look at that watch, is that your watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your seal? - A. No, that is my master's seal, it is a gold seal, with my master's coat of arms on it; I am quite sure it is my watch.</p>
               <p>- MONKESTER sworn. - Q. You are shopman to a pawnbroker living in Great St. German-street? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; on the 7th of February he pledged a gold hunting-watch for five pounds; he came to our shop with a Mr. Warren, who is here; he told me it belonged to himself. (Produces the watch.)</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the watch with a seal? - A. As it is exactly.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Chamberry.) Is that seal the seal of your watch? - A. It is the very seal.</p>
               <p>- WARREN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. Yes; I am a hairdresser, and live at No. 18, Crown-court, St. James's; the prisoner lodged with me last Tuesday week, he came into my shop, and asked me whether I thought he could get five pounds upon this watch; he wanted money, he said, he should have more money in a few days; I went with him, and shewed him the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him how he came by that watch? - A. He said that he gave sixteen pounds for it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say how long he had had it? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Will you have the goodness to look at that watch, (the watch handed to him) - is that your gold hunting-watch? - A. It is; I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150054"/>Q. Do you remember delivering it to your servant? - A. When he came down to St. James's, a gentleman came and asked me what it was o'clock; I said to my servant, I had no occasion for a watch with my sash on; I gave it him to take home.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the seal that is on that watch? - A. That is a metal seal, and the key too is metal; a gold seal was on my watch when I gave it my servant to take home.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Chamberry.) Can the prisoner speak English? - A. We always talk in Swedish; I do not know whether he can speak English, or not.</p>
               <p>Anthony. He could speak English at the Office.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a Swede, I believe? - A. Yes, I know the prisoner, and I know Chamberry, Captain Johnson's servant; I was with them this day fortnight at a public-house. We went away a little after one o'clock; we staid there about three hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all drunk? - A. Yes; these two men, when they came in the air, could not stand; I was the best of all three; they went this way and the other; Captain Johnson's servant wanted something more to drink, and then they called a watchman, and a watchman came and asked us if we wanted to go and have some drink; the watchman told us of a place, as we could not find any open; then we got down to a public-house, and that made us worse; I could not see any difference, one was as bad as the other; Chamberry said, I have lost my watch.</p>

             sworn - This woman had lived with me for about three weeks, we took her in as a lodger; I went out to work, and she owed me two or three shillings; I took her then to mind the baby; when my master had nothing to do for me, I told her to provide herself a better place; I could not afford to keep her. She went away from me, and came and slept one night in my place; she had been away four or five days; when she came back, I left her at home; when I went out, I left the sheets, a blanket, a child's frock, three night-caps, two white handkerchiefs, and one silk one that we found upon her head, on the lines; my husband's great coat was gone before; I had been out for two or three hours; I met her at the door, she had a bundle; I asked her if she had locked the door; she told me, yes; I unlocked the door, and looked at the lines where I left these things; the three handkerchiefs and frock I missed from off the lines. I went into the room, and missed the bed-clothes, and a shift of mine that lay in the room; I asked her, when I met her at the door, where she was going; she told me; I followed her, but she was not there; I went to another place, and she was not there; I found her in Holborn, near St. Andrew's church; we brought her back, and sent for a constable; she wanted to borrow a penny of me to get a drop of gin; when the constable came to search her, she had four shillings and twopence, my scissars, and my comb.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your blanket? - A. No, nothing but the handkerchiefs.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bundle large or small that you met her with at the door? - A. It was pretty large; she had it under her arm, and her cloak put over it; she had nothing of the bundle when we found her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Her husband's great coat was gone two days before I returned to her house.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 10th of February, the prosecutor brought the prisoner, and gave me charge of her; I searched her, and found a spotted silk handkerchief on her head, which the prosecutor described to me, and said it was his; there was a hole in one corner that he had burnt with a pipe; when I took it off her head, I found it was exactly so; I found a comb, an old pair of scissars, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150055"/>few shillings, and about twenty-two penny pieces, and a great many duplicates.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no duplicates of these things? - A. No; she acknowledged before the Magistrate that she had made free with the handkerchief to put it on her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever traced the property? - A. Yes; I have searched the pawnbrokers; here are a great many duplicates of seven or eight shillings value.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They are all mine.</p>
               <p>(The handkerchief produced and identified by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say, my dear sir; only, while I was washing for her, I put the handkerchief on my head; I did not think it was stealing, if I had I would not have put it on my head.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Neave.) Did you leave the woman in your room after your wife went out? - A. I left her in the room, when I went out, as I had a young family; I went out to a day's work.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker, in Warner-street; on the 29th of December last, at seven o'clock in the evening, a blue cloth coat was brought to me to pledge, upon which I lent 15 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought it? - A. The prisoner at the bar, to the best of my knowledge; I produce the coat.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the prosecutor.) Is that your coat? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I never came to your shop but once, and then I pledged a coat for 1 s. 6 d. it was a black one; I lodge in the next room to where he lives; it is an open house, where there are half a dozen people in and out in the night, and an open door continually; I never had any thing lost in the house; I have lived four months in the house; I had very bad health, and very seldom out from one month to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witness here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'GILL sworn. - I heard of the loss of a coat; some time after, in my room, I found a duplicate, rolled up, as if it had been put through the key-hole of the door; I said to my wife, you are very careless of your duplicates; I had a coat in pawn; I thought it was this coat; I threw it by and thought no more of it; my wife, a day or two afterwards, said, that duplicate is not your's; I live in the room facing the prosecutor's; I cannot see how it came there; I picked it off the floor, and this person had access to my room, the same as her own.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Pawnbroker.) Q. Are you certain that is the woman that brought the coat to you; you might mistake? - A. A mistake is what we are all subject to; it was night when she brought it, but I have no doubt in my own mind.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: on Saturday, the 14th of January, at a quarter past nine at night, I was going up Tottenham-Court road, and, by the end of Windmill-street, I met the two prisoners and three men behind them; I let them pass me, and I followed them towards Oxford-street; the women parted from the men at the end of Hosier-court; I got a man to assist me, and took the two women into custody; the three men ran away; I secured the women, and took them into a shop, and in the prisoner Turvey's apron was the property I now produce; I asked her where she had got it; she said she found it; I took them to St. Pancras watch-house, close by where the prosecutrix lived; a person came into the watch-house and gave the alarm of the robbery when I came in with the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the women before? - A. Yes, I have seen them; I knew the men very well; I apprehended two of the men afterwards, but the prosecutrix could not identify them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the Prosecutrix.) Who took them out of the drawers? - A. Davison took them out of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Davison's defence. I never stirred from the counter, nor was nigh her drawers, and when I came out at the street, facing the shop, this woman picked up the bundle.</p>
               <p>Turvey's defence. I picked up the bundle at the second turning coming from the shop; I went up as far as Tottenham-Court road, and coming along I met with

               <p>Q. Are you sure that he told you, if you would go to Blackwall he would give up the things, before the constable came? - A. He said he could not find the duplicate.</p>

On my turning back, I found the bundle where I supposed he had dropped it; I took it up, and brought it home with me; the prisoner lived in a room over my stable; I went there, and waited till he came there; I gave him into custody of the watchman about half past eleven o'clock, and he went to the watch-house. He was intrusted with locking up my warehouse, he had 17 s. 6 d. a week, my old clothes, and victuals from my house, and his wife had about ten shillings a week; he was placed in a situation far above want.</p>

               <p>Q. How many yards were there? - A. Seven yards of printed cotton; it hung over an iron; it had been cut off; this was the piece. - (Shews it to the Court.)</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you took it from him had you seen it? - A. Not five minutes; he then begged I would not expose him; he would go quietly with me; I took him to the Office in Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q.What reason had you to accuse the woman? - A. I did not accuse the woman, any more than she was at the Office, and one of the officers charged her with putting her hand as if she was taking something from her; I did not see the woman prisoner till I got to the Office; the officer asked her if she knew the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the officer's name? - A.Armstrong and Gray; she said, no, she followed merely out of curiosity; the man prisoner said, he never knew her; on being asked that, the officer searched her, but nothing was found in her possession belonging to me; the officer found a handkerchief in her pocket unhemmed, which exactly corresponded with that the prisoner had in his pocket. On pulling open her pellise, there was found a pair of scissars, which might have cut the cotton off, as there was a piece left on the iron at the door; a person in my shop had seen them together but two minutes before the cotton was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked at the cotton, did it appear whether it was cut by scissars or a knife? - A. I cannot tell any more than it was cut; I cannot say by what; the cotton I knew again when I saw it, what was left hanging on the iron; Ann Hall can speak that she saw her at the door, asking her the price of the cotton.</p>

             sworn. - I am a servant to Mr. Charlton: On the 17th of February, about half past nine in the morning, the prisoner came down the area steps; he pushed the door that goes into the servants-hall (it runs on a pulley), and came in; I was coming out of the kitchen with a tea-urn of water to take up stairs; I saw the prisoner; he asked me if Mrs. Moffat lived there; I told him, no; he said, he believed she was a fresh comer in the street; I told him there was a fresh family come to live at No. 17, but I did not know their name; he thanked me, and I thought he went out, but I did not know whether he did or no; I went up stairs with the urn; coming down stairs for the toast, I saw the prisoner come out of the housekeeper's room with this box; I cried out, holloa; he threw the box at me, and cut my face on the side of my nose; he went out; I pursued him, and took him; I have the box here; it was kept in the housekeeper's room.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            , you were tried and convicted in this Court in September Sessions, 1803, for embezzling effects belonging to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, you being an officer and servant of that Bank; and as such officer and servant you were entrusted by the said Governor and Company with certain effects belonging to the said Governor and Company. The indictment stated in the first Count, that you being an officer and servant of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, and being entrusted with certain effects, that is to say, a certain paper, partly printed and partly written, purporting to be a bill, commonly called an Exchequer. Bill; the tenor of which bill is as follows, stating it to be a bill for 500 l. No. 1835, which paper, then and there belonging to the said Governor and Company, you did secrete, embezzle, and run away with the same; and which said sum of 500 l. in paper mentioned was then and there unpaid and unsatisfied to the said Governor and Company as holders thereof. The indictment then set forth two other bills in like manner, No. 294 and No. 1094, each for 1000 l. which you then and there, being such officer and servant of the said Governor and Company aforesaid, did also then and there feloniously embezzle, secrete, and run away with the said effects, so belonging to the said Governor and Company aforesaid. You have thus been charged in the indictment with having feloniously secreted and embezzled property belonging to the said Governor and Company of the Bank of England, to the amount of 2,000,500 l. against the statute, and against the King's peace. There were other Counts in the said indictment like the former Counts, only not stating the paper to be of any value, but stating that the Governor and Company had (on the credit and security only of such pieces of paper, partly printed and partly written) advanced a large sum of money; which money was then unpaid and unsatisfied to the Governor and Company of the Bank, they being holders thereof.</p>
               <p>There were other Counts like the former, only stating these pieces of paper, securities instead of money or effects. It was argued by your Counsel, that these bills were not of any value or legal as Exchequer-bills, having been signed by a person not properly authorized by Lord Grenville, he not being duly authorised, though they had been issued as good and valid bills to the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, and paid for as such. Upon this indictment you have been lawfully convicted by a Jury of your countrymen, but judgment has been suspended till the opinion of the Twelve Judges of England was taken on this important case, in order to ascertain whether these bills or papers were effects and securities within the statute of the 15th 
               <persName id="o18040215-1-person688">Geo. II</persName>
            . Eleven out of the Twelve Judges were of opinion that some of the objections, so ably argued by your Counsel, should be sustained. Much consideration has since been given to those objections; they were very ably and very fully argued by your Counsel. The Judges have since held various conferences on it, which produced various different opinions, and it is now my duty to communicate to you the result of their mature investigation. Several points were urged in your favour, one of which, in order to make it out, supposes the offence with which you have been charged to be of such a description as to fall within the Act of the 15th 
               <persName id="o18040215-1-person689">Geo. II</persName>
            . chap. 13. sect. 11. yet it was said you could not be convicted under that Act, because that statute has been repealed by an Act passed in the reign of 
               <persName id="o18040215-1-person690">Geo. III</persName>
            . which your Counsel argued operated as a repeal of the former. Upon that point it is however unnecessary for me to enlarge, because all the Judges are clearly of a different opinion, and I am authorised by them to say, that they entertain no doubt upon the subject. They all concur in opinion, that nothing is contained in the second Act which can operate as a repeal of the first. The only and more important question which then remained for their consideration was, whether or not these bills fell within the true meaning of the statute of the 15th 
               <persName id="o18040215-1-person691">Geo. II</persName>
            . whether these bills or papers stated in the indictment do or not fall within the description of effects and securities denominated and described in that Act of Parliament. Upon this point indeed the Judges were not unanimous; but the majority are of opinion, that they are effects and securities within the true meaning of the Act. In order to make the matter more intelligible, I shall read to you that clause which is necessary, and which I particularly allude to:</p>
               <p>"And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid,</p>
               <p>"that if any officer or servant of the said Company,</p>
               <p>"being entrusted with any note, bill, dividend</p>
               <p>"warrant, bond deed, or any security, money, or</p>
               <p>"other effects, belonging to the said Company, or</p>
               <p>"having any bill, dividend warrant, bond deed, or any</p>
               <p>"security or effects of any other person or persons lodged</p>
               <p>"or deposited with the said Company, shall secrete,</p>
               <p>"embezzle, or run away with any such note, bill,</p>
               <p>"dividend warrant, bond deed, security, money, or</p>
               <p>"effects, or any part of them, every officer or servant</p>
               <p>"so offending, and being thereof convicted in due</p>
               <p>"form of law, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and</p>
               <p>"shall suffer," as the Act directs.</p>
               <p>The great object of the Legislature was to add security, and administer protection to the Bank of England. The immense national concerns with which it was and still is entrusted, called upon the Legislature for particular provisions in its favour. The principles of legislation must now be applied to the object then under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150063"/>contemplation, and the view we take of any code, laws, or particular laws, must be more comprehensive, when it embraces and so materially concerns such a large incorporated body as the Bank of England, than when it only relates to private individuals. Considering this law then in the enlarged and liberal view on which it was framed by the Legislature (at the same time that all the judges disclaim every idea of straining any part beyond its plain and natural meaning, where it is so penal, and more especially where the violation is so clearly manifested) the recollection of the enormous weight of Exchequer bills in circulation, in which the public were so deeply and so materially concerned, cannot fail to occur to every mind in the present case; that these bills had become the fair and valuable property of the Bank, for honest purposes, was allowed on all hands, but still it was argued that they are not such effects or securities as fall within the true construction of the Act of Parliament, because they are not of any positive or intrinsic value. Now, whatever the Bank had of the loan, or whatever should be deposited with them, was expressly protected from the embezzlement of their officers or servants by the words of the Act; and although the bills in question may not, upon the face of them, be of any descriptive legal value, yet they carry about them such consequence at least as makes their preservation of infinite importance to the Bank; in that view, therefore, they surely have their value, though they may not be, in the strictest expression, the effect or security stated in their signature; the very Exchequer-bills which they would be were the defects removed; yet the Government of the country is pledged to pay them, even as they are, inasmuch as they have been issued under the authority of Parliament. They were given as valid bills, and the holders of them have as strong a claim, I will not say upon the honour only, but even upon the justice and equity of Government, for the payment of them, as if they were perfectly correct in every particular and in all their parts; they are, therefore, at least, valuable papers, whatever they may be called, and the holders of them receive them as such; they are issued to them as having the stamp and property up to that value which they import to bear. They are, therefore, to be included in the true meaning of the word securities, which may be made payable to any person having the legal hold of them. Nor are they to be less deemed included under the meaning of the word effects, which is confined to no particular species of property, but may consist either of specie or any other article whatever. It was this that the Legislature had in view when it made this safe-guard round the Bank; for be they effects or securities, or both of them, they import special property or value upon the face of them.</p>
               <p>The offence of embezzling or secreting of such effects or securities, constituting part of the property of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, does not (by the Act alluded to) make larceny, which requires some value to be ascertained, but it is created a felony, which induces no necessity for any value to be ascertained; but it must be acknowledged that these bills, of themselves, are such a species of security or effects as no man could hesitate to give the value, which on the face of them they import to bear. They are such effects or securities that, if a bankrupt was in possession of them, they are certainly such property as he would be made to give up, or bound by law to account to his creditors for, as part of his just debts. If an insolvent debtor was in possession of them, the common sense of mankind would revolt at the idea of their being of no value. An executor, who found such bills in the possession of a testator, would be bound to pay a tax for them to Government, even in the state as they came into his hands; and he would be in a bad state, and liable to punishment, were he to destroy them. But it was argued, that if the word effects was to be so largely construed, without restrictions, it would lead to absurdities; that they would ascribe value to things which were in themselves perfectly nugatory, such as pieces of waste paper, the stock of a few old pens, &amp;c. the Judges, however, have not found themselves driven to such extreme length in construing the Act of Parliament which they have so minutely considered; their judgment goes to the express words of the Act, referring to such securities and effects only as are entrusted to their officers and servants in the Bank, and the bills in question fall under that description; these bills, therefore, being of such a nature that Government would be bound to rectify all deficiencies or irregularities, being the fair and honest property of the Bank, which they purchased bona fide for a valuable consideration, the majority of the Judges are of opinion, that they are really effects and securities of the Bank, falling within the construction of 15th of 
               <persName id="o18040215-1-person692">Geo. II</persName>
            . and that their embezzlement, you being an officer and servant of that Company, subjects you, in point of law, to conviction, upon the indictment on which you were found Guilty.</p>
