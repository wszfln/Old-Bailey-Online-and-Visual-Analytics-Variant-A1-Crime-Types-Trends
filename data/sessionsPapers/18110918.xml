               <p>Q. Were they repairing the London Dock - A. Yes, on the 17th of July, and Mr. Spence is the chief plumber employed for the London Dock. The prisoner was employed by Mr. Spence, I saw him at work at half past twelve on that day, he was doing plumber's work, I took the prisoner in custody, and the other officer took the lead; the lead is the property of the London Dock Company.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was called out of the dock to my master's shop to load a cart, and sent back. On my returning into the dock I went into a corner, there I saw that lead among some old stuff. I put it into my jacket, and took it out of the Dock with me.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you first see the defendant - A. About five years ago I cannot be accurate to the day, I have got my book here, it was in February the 7th 1807. He was introduced to me by a man calling himself Newcastle, he told me the prisoner was a merchant, and did a deal of business. I was not at home when the prisoner first came to my house. An order had been given in my absence, they called to see if the order had been executed; they said they should want three or four hundred poundsworth of goods to send to Russia, he told me he could not pay me ready money, he would give me a good bill; I said I should have no objection if the bill was good; I got the goods ready and left them in the hands of my clerk. I went out and returned about two o'clock, and the goods were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the goods were gone did you see them again - A. About four or five days after I saw them at Mr. Farron's, a jeweller in the Strand, they were exposed in the window for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of those goods - A. Three hundred and seventy odd pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home did your clerk shew you any bill which he got - A. Yes, the body of the bill is my clerks hand writing. I put the signature to it after I came home. It is made payable at Smith's and Company, 42, Lombard-street. I went there that afternoon but found no banker there. There was a man of the name of Smith that kept a little room there, but not no banker. I never got payment of the bill.</p>

               <p>Q. How far did the case fall from you - A. About half a yard. I stooped and picked it up that instant that they run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you stoop down with your eye intent upon your watch-case, and at the same time keep your eye upon the men running away from you - A. Yes, because it was not a yard from me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were these men a head of you at any time - A. About seven or eight yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there no crossings from where you picked up the watch case, and where you ran after him - A. No other turning at all.</p>
               <p>Q. It was in the passage by the watchhouse where they took your watch - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That is a dark passage is it not - A. No, it is a light passage.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance did you run after them from the passage by the watchhouse into Pennington-street - A. About three hundred yards. It was not more than three minutes. I never lost sight of him until he went into the building.</p>
               <p>COURT. You having never seen him before can you pretend to swear to him - A. Yes, I would swear to him out of a thousand.</p>

            . I live in Bishopsgate-street. On the 2nd of September I picked up a watch in Ratcliffe Highway, having no case; it was after twelve o'clock, I pointed out to Mr. Brown where I picked it up, it was near to Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Pennington-street - A. I do not; it was on the left hand side coming from Wellclose-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the passage by Wellclose-square - A. I did not go near the watchhouse. It was by a passage at the sign of the Coach and Horses in Ratcliffe Highway; I picked it up and put it in my bosom, and gave it to my husband, and persuaded him to sell it; he said if I pretended to sell it I should be stopped; I received it of my husband again; my husband delivered it the next day to the magistrate, and he delivered it to Mr. Brown.</p>

               <p>Q. From what part of the house was the property taken - A. From a one pair of stairs back room; he got up the water butt, and by a ladder fixed on the butt he got in the window; it was a sash window, it was up, I had left it open. I lost property to the amount of between thirty and forty pounds, the exact amount I cannot tell, in notes and cash. The money was in a drawer, locked up, I had the key in my pocket. The prisoner lodged in my house, he told me he was a lighterman, he had lodged in my house between five and six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at home that night - A. Yes, I saw him that evening at half past eleven o'clock, he was in the parlour; he went out after that, and staid out about a quarter of an hour. I saw him when he came in, I asked him where he had been.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had lost between thirty and forty pound - A. To the best of my knowledge.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of July, between nine and ten in the evening, I took him out of the tap-room into the parlour, I told him he was charged with a robbery; he said nothing, he was about half groggy; I found in a pocket inside of his jacket, that he has on now, a ten pound note, a five pound note, and a one pound note, and in his outside pocket, two dollars and six shillings, that was all; I kept him in custody. I asked him if he had received any money; he said upon the Saturday before that he received a one pound note of his master, that was all he received. On the Sunday morning I went to him; he was locked up in the office; I asked him if he knew what money I had taken from him; he said yes; I asked him where he got it; he said he took it from Mrs. Shepherd, he got into the room at the back window; I asked him how he had forced the half chest of drawers; he said, by pulling it the lock flew off; I told him there was more money lost than found; I asked him whether his wife had any part of it; he said no; she was apprehended, and she said she knew nothing about it.</p>

            . I keep Mr. Peak's house. On the 8th of August, about ten minutes before eight in the morning, I was going up with a tea-kettle of water, I saw somebody going up the two pair of stairs, I called to him, I said, oh, Billy, why do you go up in such a way; at my speaking he went up stairs so softly, it was impossible for any body to hear him; I heard him come down; I said, oh dear, how you frighten me; I did not know him. I heard something rattle in his apron; I was frightened, I thought he had been in that room to take something; I shoved open the room door, I called after him, oh, you have got the time piece.</p>
               <p>Q. From what room was the time-piece taken - A. From the one pair front. The prisoner ran down stairs, I ran to the street-door, and called for assistance; Mr. Swinton came and took the prisoner in the coal cellar; he brought him up stairs; he had not the time-piece, when brought up stairs; I had seen the time-piece not a quarter of an hour before.</p>

On the 5th of September the two prisoners came into the shop, Barrymer asked for a jacket, and while Barrymer was trying it on I turned my back to take one off the shelf, and when I turned round I perceived Johnson had stolen a jacket; I saw the sleeves hanging down under his jacket; I said he had a jacket from off the counter; he ran away and threw the jacket away. Barrymer was in the shop while I pursued Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all you have to say against Barrymer - A. Yes. Barrymer was in the shop when I came back, he had put on his jacket then, and was going away; I told him to stop, that he was a confederate with the other man; he said he did not know the man.</p>
               <p>MR. SYKES. I am a shoe-maker. I was coming along the street at the time, I heard the cry of stop thief. I saw him throw the jacket away, I pursued him and stopped him.</p>
               <p>- NOTTAGE. I produce the jacket, I received it in the shop.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Spotswood. That is the jacket that Johnson took, I had seen it not five minutes before it was stolen. It was stolen from off the counter; it cost seven shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Johnson said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Barrymer was not put on his defence.</p>

On the 26th of July, the two prisoners came to my shop about seven in the morning, my apprentice was sweeping out the shop, they wanted to look at some ribbons, and they both looked at some plain ribbons a considerable while I took out a drawer of figured ribbons, they looked at various patterns; Davis took up a piece of pink ribbon, she said buy this, it is a pretty one; Norris declined it; I took out the plain drawer again, she at last chose a piece and had a yard, and paid five pence for it, they then left my shop.</p>

No, not in the least; I put the plain drawer in its place, and in putting the figured ribbon drawer to rights; I missed the piece that Davis picked out: I desired my apprentice to go after them, he did, and brought them back; I desired them to leave the ribbon that they had stolen; Davis, after hesitating a great while, took out of her pocket a piece of buff, that was not the piece that I had missed nor did I know that they had got that. I said to my apprentice go for a constable. He immediately went out, I went and bolted the door. They offered to pay me for the ribbon, Davis said she would pay for it; I told them that was not the way I would settle it. They then said they would go out;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180009"/>I begged they would remain quiet till the constable came, upon which Davis came to the door where I was standing, and beat me over my head. I at length got hold of both her hands, and held her fast. Then Norris came and beat me, their blows were pretty heavy on me; this lasted until

               <p>Q. Did you lose any wine on the 20th of May last. - A. Mr. White had six bottles of wine of the prisoner, and he gave her linen for it, he thought it was for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live with you. - A. She did. On the 20th of July I charged her with taking six bottles of wine, she said it was not my wine, and she had disposed of it at the linen draper's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it part of the prisoner's business while living with you to sell wines. - A. No, she has carried out a bottle, but no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever look at your wines to see if there were any missing. - A. No, I did not count my wines to see if there were any missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner access to your wines. - A. Not to my knowledge, I kept the key.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITE. I am a linen draper. On the 20th of June the prisoner came and asked me if I would have any wine of her mistress, she would take it out in linen drapery. She had no wine with her when she came. I told her to tell her mistress I would. She afterwards brought four bottles of port and two of sherry, and took the linen drapery in return. The wine I drank, she said it was her mistress's wine.</p>

That and several odd shillings I have given to her, and in return the first thing she made a present to me was a bottle of wine, and then others, till it amounted to half a dozen. I was not in the habit of drinking wine. I went to the linen draper's, I asked him if he wanted any wine, I never mentioned any name, I took three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180011"/>that day and three the day after, and I had this petticoat for the money.

She told me her aunt was going to fetch an officer, she wanted me to be locked up in the cellar, I would not. I went out in the street, and stood at the end of the New Inn steps until she came out to me, and then I went to the Seven Dials. I told Mrs. Green of it; and when I returned home she told me Mr White and Mr. Lamb the constable were searching my box, and begged me to say nothing about who I had got it off.</p>

               <p>SAMUEL SHEPPARD. On the 17th of August I was in Gracechurch Street, I saw the prosecutor passing, and the prisoner in company with another was walking closely behind the prosecutor. I followed them about twenty or thirty yards. At the corner of Leadenhall Street I saw the prisoner draw this handkerchief out of the prosecutor's pocket, I saw him tuck it into his bosom I ran and caught hold of him, I called to the prosecutor, and I took the handkerchief out of the prisoner's bosom. I asked the prosecutor if he had lost his handkerchief, he put his hand into his pocket, and said he had, I shewed him the handkerchief, he said it was his. This is the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it is mine.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 15th of August, between four and five in the afternoon I observed the prisoner in Aldgate High Street. When he came to me he had a bushel basket on his shoulder covered over with an apron, and on the top of the apron was straw. In consequence of suspicion I followed him into Petticoat Lane, there I stopped him and asked him what he had got, he said lead, and he was going to dispose of it at the first rag-shop he could find, I asked him where he brought it from, he said from the Commercial Sale Rooms in Mincing Lane, I asked him if he had the priviledge to sell the lead from there, he said there were three or four in it besides him and the foreman knew of it, but he had it of the foreman's brother. I told him I must take him to the Compter, he begged and prayed I would not, and said I might have the lead, that I might call upon the foreman, he would satisfy me for my trouble. I took him to the Compter, the lead has been in my custody ever since. This is the lead, it is fifty-nine pound weight.</p>

I said I would never lose sight of him, and when I got hold of him, I would never loose him, the women that surrounded him took from his pocket three pair of stockings, they said why do you not knock the son of a bitch down, I told them it was impossible for him to do it. As soon as I got hold of his neck-handkerchief, by some means or other he got my fingers in his mouth, the women that surrounded him persuaded him to bite my fingers off, I brought him to Mr. Brown's shop, then there were two pair of stockings found upon him, but they were odd ones, the women took several pair out of his pockets, the prisoner said they should not be found upon him, therefore girls pick away as fast as you can. I never lost sight of him.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Carrington. On the 24th of July, between three and four in the afternoon, I heard a person come down stairs, I ran into the passage, and saw the prisoner go out, I asked her what she had got there she said nothing; I asked her where she had been, she said no where, and when she found I would call somebody in, she said if I would not call any body in she would give me the tea-tray, she then pulled it from under her gown and petticoat. This is the tea-tray, it is my master's property, it was in the corner of the one pair of stairs, she said she found it on the stairs</p>

               <p>Q. Do you rent the whole house. - A. No, only the shop and parlour, my landlord's name is Spencer, he lives in the first floor. On the 5th of September I and my wife went out at between eight and nine o'clock, and returned at one. We found our premises had been broken open.</p>
               <p>Q.What property was gone. - A. A great quantity of remnants of cloth, callico, and ribbons. We found the major part of them on the Saturday following, some at the prisoner's lodgings, 22 Queen Street, Seven Dials. We found four bundles at four different places, and a tea-caddie at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Q. What other places. - A. One at a chandler's shop in Queen Street, one at a cheesemonger's in the same street, one at a milk cellar in Nottingham Court, and another at a baker's in Wild Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find at the prisoner's. - A. We found two pieces of cloth in a box, I was with the officer and saw them found.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner the key of that room or box. - A. She had the key of both, she was present at the time the things were found. These are the pieces of cloth that were found in the box; we likewise found this apron in a drawer, the drawer was locked and the prisoner had the key. That was all the things that were found at that time, we found more things at her apartment the same evening when we went again: we found this shawl under a green baize, the covering of a table, and this piece of callico that my wife cut out for the little boy, that was under the green baize, the covering of another table, and we found a pair of pockets in the dirty clothes; I know them all to be my property, I had seen them the same day in my shop. The prisoner told us where the other things were.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 24th of January I went to the prisoners lodgings, he kept a pastry cook's shop in Princes Street, Leicester fields, I found thirty pair of stays tied up in this tablecloth in the prisoner's window, the prisoner was at home; I also found in the same bundle some twilled jean to the amount of forty-eight yards, and other remnants of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180018"/>cotton packed up in this paper, I asked him how he came by these stays, he told me that a poor distressed friend of his that was in an insolvent state, and had become a bankrupt, had left them there for protection, I told him I was not satisfied with that, I should take them to the office. At this time we had no information of Mr. Favell's robbery, Lavendar who was with me agreed to take the stays, and to keep them till the Saturday for him to bring the insolvent friend before the magistrate, which he agreed to. On the next morning the Friday, Mr. Favell gave information, we went to Thomas's house, but we could not find him until the 21st of August, I apprehended him at a public-house in Westminster, I had been frequently at his house, but could not find him before.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Saturday, in January, were you at the office. - A. Yes, and the prisoner and his friend did not come, I took thirty pair of stays, and, by the order of the magistrate, delivered to the prosecutor twenty-four pair of stays and kept six.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, and called eight witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>- FOWLER. I am a patrol of Aldersgate Street. On the 24th of August, at half after three in the morning, I stopped at the end of Carthusian Street. I thought I saw a man with something on his back, I watched him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180020"/>until he came to the top of the street, and as he came up I crossed over to him, I asked him what he had got there, he said nothing, I told him I thought he had got something, I said he must stop and go down to the watch-house along with me. He went to go down Carthusian Street again with the sack, I told him that was not the way, he must go to the watch-house; then he pitched the sack down at the green-grocer's door at the corner of Carthusian Street, and said he must ease himself, I catched hold of him by the collar and told him I should stand by him while he eased himself, and sung out for the watchman. He told me he hoped I would not hurt him, it was a bit of corn that was given him for his horses, he had a wife and family, I told him I would not hurt him no more than the law, if the law did it so be it, he must go down to the watch-house to tell the constable how he came by the corn, I took him down to the watch-house, and the watchman brought the corn down after him. On the same morning about nine o'clock I went to Mrs. Rainsdon, she claimed the corn.</p>

            . On the 1st of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon going out of Castle-street into Crutched friers; I felt somebody give me a violent push; turning round to see who it was; I saw the prisoner and asked him what he meaned by it; I told him there was room enough for every body; he gave me a great deal of abusive language, and went into the ale-house at the corner of Seething lane, thinking he was in liquor, I proceeded on my way. When I came to the bottom of Crutched friars, crossing of Cooper's-row, I stopped a few moments because the boys were breaking up school. I then went on into <placeName id="t18110918-52-crimeloc295">John-street</placeName>

I then began to suspect that he had some motive for it, and put my hand into my pocket, and found my pocket-book was gone; I exclaimed out, I have lost my pocket book, and I suspected the person who had pushed me so had picked my pocket. One of the boys said a person had just gone round the corner who had picked my pocket, and if you please I'll shew him you; I followed the boy, and he shewed me the prisoner; I immediately went up to him, and told him my suspicion. He again abused me, and said he was no more a pickpocket than myself, and asked me whether there was any money in my pocket book; I told him no, nothing of much value in it. The crowd desired me to charge a constable with him; I said why so, I can prove nothing against him, and he may have given<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180022"/>the book to an accomplice. Somebody in the crowd said, sir, I believe I know where your pocket book is, he said seeing a crowd I came to see the occasion of it, and hearing you had been robbed I fixed my eyes upon the prisoner, and if I would go, and open a hatch, and go into a stone mason's shop, the corner of Cooper's Row, I might find my pocket-book, I went there; I rang the bell; I asked the maid who came to the bell whether any body had been there, she said no; I then asked her to look in the passage to see if there was any pocketbook there; she opened the hatch, and she and I found the pocket-book in there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I fancy there was nothing in your pocket-book of any value - A Nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact you lost nothing, and your property was returned to you - A. It was.</p>

            . I live in Jewry-street, and and attend upon gentlemen. I was going with a letter into Gould-square, Cooper's-row, the boys coming out of school occasioned me to stop; I saw a man standing at Mr. Smith's door, reaching over to open it, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Where - A. At the corner of Cooper's-row, a stone mason's. I went into Gould-square and returned; I saw the same man standing among the boys. Soon after I heard great bustle in the street, the people said that a gentleman had his pocket picked; I then saw it was the same man that I had seen at Mr. Smith's door I heard the man repeatedly say what have I done, search me if you have lost any thing; I saw Mr. Manwaring, I asked him if he had lost any thing, he said, yes. I saw the same man come from the other side of the street, I said that is the man that I saw at Mr. Smith's door; it struck me that he might have thrown the book in that passage, or thereabouts. Mr. Smith's house has two doors, one in John-street, the other in Cooper's-row; I saw Mr. Smith's servant, I asked her to go round to the other door; she saw the book and I picked it up. I gave the book to Mr. Manwaring, he said it was his.</p>
               <p>- SHERRARD. Q. Do you belong to the school - A. Yes. As I was coming out of the school I saw the prisoner take something out of Mr. Manwaring's pocket, I ran and told him; Mr. Manwaring said, run and stop him; I said, I will shew you the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man - A. Yes; I came out of school first with another boy. I was buying apples, I heard the prisoner insult Mr. Manwaring I am sure it was the prisoner. I never took my eyes off the prisoner untill he was taken. I saw him lean over the hatch, and afterwards he was taken.</p>

            . Mr. Sellars knocked at Mr. Smith's door; he asked me if any body had been there upon business; I said no; he told me to go to the other door in Cooper's-row, and look to see if any thing was there; I went to see, and there was nothing there; he opened the hatch immediately, and came and looked behind the door, and saw the pocket book. I saw him pick it up.</p>

On the evening of the 8th of August, I was in my parlour, I saw the prisoner and another woman walk very quick into the shop; I went immediately forward; I suspected the prisoner had some intention; I watched her; she was in the shop three or four minutes, and these suspicions wore off; she asked the price of several tin saucepans; she changed them about a good deal from one place to another, and then went to the corner of the front of the house, and after cheapening another, she was going away; immediately upon it the next door neighbour, Mrs. Williams, came out, and said give the man the property that you have got under your clothes; her reply was, woman, what do you mean by it; I have none of his property. Immediately upon that the woman that came with the prisoner ran out of the shop, which convinced me that my neighbour was right in her suspicion; a tuftle then ensued between my neighbour, and the prisoner; I took care that the prisoner should not go away, and in two or three minutes; my neighbour took from under the prisoner's clothes the furniture. That furniture had lain in the middle of the shop upon a table before the prisoner came in; I then endeavoured to secure her. After three or four minutes I could not succeed; the street-keeper came and secured her; she then begged my pardon and hoped I would not prosecute her, but let her go home, and that the woman that came with her had made her drunk, and told her to put the furniture in her apron.</p>

I held fast of his coat, and told him if he would give me the spoons I would let him go; my mistress came up stairs; she made a great screaming. He gave her the spoons; he said he did not know how he came by them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all about the spoons.</p>

The man went to get change, I believe; I delivered the note to a young man; he came back and said they could not change it; he did not exchange it, and I had it away again.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did the prisoner give you any other note by which you did get the ring redeemed - A. Not that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the next day - A. I am not certain. I cannot tell exactly what day he gave me the ten pound note. It was soon after I got a one pound note of him, and I got my ring out of pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the ten pound note after you received it back from the pawnbrokers - A I carried it back to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go by the name of Beazely - A. The ring was pledged in the name of Beazley.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Perhaps you go by many names - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot recollect what day this was - A. No I cannot.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, in Bow-street, Bloomsbury. On the 20th of August last, the prisoner came to my shop to redeem a gown that had been pledged for half-a-crown; she said that she wanted change a note that she hand in her had, I told her I could not give her change; she said give me change I'll take five or six shillings in half-pence. I took the one pound note and looked at it, I then asked her name and were she lived; she said Nowland, No. 2, George-street. I wrote on the note No. 2, George-street; I then asked her where she had it from; she said she had it from her father, a bricklayer's labourer. I told her then that it was a bad one, that she must go along with me, and she walked down to Bow-street with me. In our way to the office I asked her particulary who she had it of, and likewise; where she lived; she then told me that she lived at No. 2, New Street. There is a New-street Saint Giles in that neighbourhood. She said that she had it of a bricklayer's labourer, whom she would not tell, he was a relation of her's.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note and see whether your writing is on that note - A. Yes, that is my writiting, I am sure this is the note she offered me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. She gave her true name - A. Yes, and the further account that she gave of her residence is right.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you doing at the time that you saw him put the seal in his pocket - A. Nothing, my attention was fixed entirely to him; I saw him put his hand in his pocket and the seal fell in.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed whether that hand had been shortly before that time in the tray - A. He had had his hand in the tray, and took up a dozen of different seals to look at, he put the seal into his right hand breeches pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the office at Bow-street. I took him in custody he had a half-penny and a farthing that was all the money that he had about him; he had a silver hunting watch, that was traced to the shop where it was bought, but not by him, the gentleman came for it. Two gold seals, a gold ring, and a gold key, and a little tortotshell snuff-box.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they the appearance of being new - A. The watch was but last year's, and the seals and key quite new.</p>

I do not disown I had the seal in my hand, the moment I took up the seal he challenged me with it, I put it down, and he, directly called me a thief and rascal, and the moment I went out, he called after me stop thief.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. to Warnes. Are you sure he remained in the shop any time after he put the seal in his pocket - A. I am quite sure he remained two minutes, if I said four I do not think I should be wrong. After I accused him of it he turned round and went out of the shop.</p>

            . Q. Were you employed on the Archduke Charles as a gangsman. - A. Yes, in July we began on the 12th to unload, she was unloaded on the 31st of July, I know the prisoners and Jarvis were working on board the ship several days.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JARVIS. Q In the month of July, were you a labourer in the employ of the London Dock company. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed in unloading the Archduke Charles. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember while you were unloading the Archduke Charles shifting some seal skins in the coal-hole. - A. Yes, Bassett and Ford were with me, I then saw something in a bag, it was some kind of metal, it looked very black, there was a hole in the bag, Ford and Baskett were in the ship with me and two lumpers besides, the bag was left there that night till the next morning. I told Bassett and Ford that I had found it almost as soon as I found it, Bassett told me to bring up a piece the next morning, he would take it out and see what it was. The next morning I took it up out of the hold, and gave it Bassett about five minutes before eight, he was at a place behind the warehouse, Ford was in the ship's hold at the time I took it up, we had agreed the night before what to do.</p>
               <p>Q. In the morning what time did you go to work. - A. About eight o'clock, Ford was there as soon as I, he saw me take it I have no doubt, this was on Thursday morning, I gave it into Bassett's hands, he put it into the crown of his hat, he went out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Chip come. - A. I did not see Chip until the Thursday following, Chip was ordered in on the Wednesday night to fetch some.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which was afterwards conveyed away by Chip part of that bag. - A. Yes, it was part of that which was taken out of that bag out of which Baskett took away that morning one piece, and then a week afterwards Chip came and took away some more of it.</p>
               <p>Q. The week following did you see Chip come into the dock. - A. Yes. Ford had told me in Chip's cellar that he was to come. Chip has a cellar in Well Street, he sells beer. In the morning Chip came in about ten minutes before eight, Ford ordered me to be there a little before him to give 
               <persName id="t18110918-68-person515">Chip</persName>
             a piece every morning, it was hid under some flax in a shed in the London Dock, that was where Ford told me to hide it, I took a piece from under the flax and gave it to Chip and he went out with it, Chip came in again about twelve o'clock, Basset gave him another piece, he went away with it.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there was a great deal of noise made about this, and at last you were taken up. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And after you were in custody you made this confession. - A. Yes, what I have said is true.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CHIP. I keep an ale and porter cellar in Well Street.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of June last, do you remember the prisoner Ford coming to your cellar. - A. Yes, On Tuesday morning, a little before eight o'clock, he asked me whether I wanted a job, I said frequently, he said it was something valuable to sell, it was a kind of silver, he asked me if I could get sale for it, I told him if it was any thing valuable there was no doubt but I could sell it, he made an appointment to come on the Wednesday night, he did come and Jarvis with him, he then asked me to come to a box in the Docks, on Thursday morning, I went there on the Thursday at eight o'clock, and Jarvis gave me a piece of silver, I wrapped it up in this handkerchief, I took it out of the Dock gates, I went again at twelve o'clock, I saw Ford, Bassett, and Jarvis, Ford pointed to me to go to Jarvis, I heard Jarvis say to Bassett I have been once it is not my turn, I then saw Bassett go to the place where Jarvis had gone in the morning, Bassett gave me another lump, he said there I can trust you, I took and hid it under a watch box in the Dock, the other piece I took home in the morning. When they left work at four Ford came and asked me if I had got any money, I said no, you did not tell me what to do with it, I asked him what he called it, he said it was the best virgin silver. I went to Lloyd's Coffee house to find the captain of the vessel to give information, I took the piece of silver I had at home to Mr. Clarke, coming home I saw a paper, I went to Mr. Barry's office, I left the card with my address at the broker's.</p>
               <p>Q. That led to the ultimate enquiry, so it was a voluntary act on your part. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARK. I live in Husher Court, Water lane. Q. Do you know the witness. - A. I know him by bringing porter and ale to our house, he brought a piece of metal that looked like lead on what day I cannot say, he brought two officers and came for it about a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that which was delivered back in the presence of the officers the same that he left. - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 18th of July I found the prisoner in Broad Court with this bundle in his hand as it is now, I searched him, in his coat pocket I found four knots of silk, in his breeches pocket I found two, I asked him where he lived, he said, 15 Drury Lane, the second floor back room, I went there in company with the apprentice, there I found this property.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoner at the bar been in your service some time. - A. The prisoner was in the service when I went to Mr. Topham's house, which is between four and five years, Mr. Durant keeps an office there. We are not partners in business, only joint occupiers of this house, the wages of the servants are paid by us all three, and the house keeping. Suspecting this man's dishonest practises, I examined the chest in which I kept this plate. It was my own.</p>
               <p>Q. What plate did you miss from that chest. - A. Three waiters, some table spoons, some desert spoons, and some forks. When Lavender came the prisoner was in my room, Mr. Durant and myself charged the prisoner with having defrauded us, that is the term I used, Mr. Durant said,</p>
               <p>"no, he has robbed us." He denied having done so, expressed great surprize, and could not tell what we meaned; I told the prisoner I was confident that he had robbed us, and the best course that he could take was to tell us of it.</p>

Yes, I went with the prisoner into the pantry, he produced these duplicates from the recess in the pantry, from thence we proceeded into the cellar, he there took some mortar out of a hole in the wall, and produced a quantity of duplicates of different plate belonging to different gentlemen in the house, he was then taken into custody. I have two duplicates which were taken out of the recess in the pantry, of the 5th of November, 1810. One of these duplicates relates to one waiter pawned for twelve pound, and the other to two small ones for five pound, I took these two duplicates to the house of Mrs. Reeve and son.

A man came up with a stone bottle, he asked us if we wanted any gin, I took a glass and gave the prisoner a glass, for which I paid six pence, we took a walk between the booths and by St. Bartholomews hospital, the prisoner and I sat down on a board, I was taken with a little sleep. There came a party and said,</p>
               <p>"halloa, who is here, it is time to go home," I said,</p>
               <p>"by all means it is," one of them said, had I lost any thing, I said I had not, I recollected in a moment, I said I had, my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q, You were not quite sober. - A. I was not, some man of the party went behind the booth, and said he found the watch.</p>
               <p>- HODSON. I was at the fair, I am an officer, I spoke to Gregory and the prisoner, and desired them to go home, the prisoner said, that is my father, my partner woke Gregory, he told him to mind that he was not robbed, he said he believed not, the prisoner got off the platform, said</p>
               <p>"I'll go to water," he went away; then the prosecutor said he lost his watch, I immediately pursued him, I saw him throw something away from his hand which glistened much, I directly made a spring and took hold of him, I said to my partner,</p>
               <p>"get a candle and look under the show for the watch," he got a candle and the watch was picked up, I took him to the Poultry Compter. This is the watch, Groves found it in the place where I saw him throw it, I searched the prisoner, I found a pocket book with eighteen duplicates, one of which led to a watch claimed by another person.</p>

               <p>Q.(to Mr. Morton) Do you know the prisoner's hand writing. - A. Yes, perfectly, that is his handwriting, I received it of him. It is directed to Messrs. Woodard and Morton. (Read.) The humble petition of Caspart Thomas. - Honoured Gentlemen! your petitioner is desirous of expressing his heart-felt sorrow, and I acknowledge myself deserving of the worst punishment for the crime I have committed against so good a master. I still hope for mercy, but my thoughts distract me. Your petitioner humbly begs that you would look down on him with mercy. Consider a broken-hearted wife, I am sorry for what I have done. Oh let mercy prevail while you have it in your power, and let my wife share those blessings with me as the wife of an honest man. I have confessed all I know, and you promised me mercy which is in your power. You have done right in what you have done, to mercy's voice your petitioner trusts, while it is in your power let the cries of a mother, with a broken-hearted wife, prevail, and let the cries of brother and sister intercede for me, and I shall be in duty bound to pray for your wellfare.</p>

            . I am a servant in the warehouse where this robbery was committed; about half past eleven I was alarmed by a noise of somebody breaking open of locks, I got out of bed and put some of my clothes on, I went to the window, I saw a glimmering light, and afterwards I saw two persons descending the stairs, I followed them, when I got to the bottom of the passage by the door, the men stopped, one of them said somebody was coming, they both made out of the door, one of them stopped at the corner of Maiden Lane and very near knocked me down, one of the men was close to me that came out of the house, he began to run, I followed him calling stop thief, to Falcon Square, and there two watchmen stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man. - A. The prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he is one that came out of the house. - A. I am sure that he is one that came out of the house, I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any of the property found. - A. Yes, I was coming back to the house to put on my shoes and stockings, we found a bag containing the articles mentioned in the indictment, it was found in Maiden Lane where the man nearly knocked me down, I gave the bag to the constable of the night.</p>
               <p>- I am a constable in Falcon Square. Near twelve o'clock the lad called stop thief, I catched the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing about it, they found no property about me, nor did any one see me throw any thing away, I was not near the house, no higher than Maiden Lane.</p>

               <p>Q. She lives in the house does she. - A. She does. On the 27th of July Mr. Baston, a master bricklayer, came to we, I went with him to a shed, I was ordered to search that shed, the prisoner was not there then, and in a heap of lime that was slacked for mortar, I took a lath and turned it up, and found this pocket book, in it were these ten one-pound Bank of England notes, a Canterbury note of one guinea, two five-pound notes and all the rest are one-pound notes, amounting in all to 27 l. I then had a suspicion that the labourer had taken it, I went and took him in custody, I asked him how he came to take this man's money, he said he had a scold of a wife, the devil came over him, and that he had never done such a thing before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you made this search. - A. About ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor.) You say part of a note was found upon him. - A. No, a part of the property was found upon him.</p>

               <p>MILLER. I was going to search him, he pulled three dollars out of his pocket, two shillings and a penny farthing, he said he got them in change for one of the notes at the cook's shop, he said he had only changed one, there is one missing now, there is only twenty-eight instead of of twenty-nine.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor.) Look at that pocket book do you know it, - A. Yes, it is my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read. - A. No, there are no marks on the notes by which I knew them, I can swear to the pocket book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether there were among your notes any of 5 l. - A. Yes, two, they were country notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the rest. - A. I do not know.</p>

            . I was coming home from the watch-house about half past three o'clock in the morning, I saw two men coming by with a looking-glass, in a little time after I saw the prisoner coming with these things, the fender and the warming pan, I stopped him and took him to the watch-house. He said he met two men in the Strand, they asked him to carry them to the pump in Queen Street, they would give him three shillings for it, he meaned the two men that passed before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the two men that went before. - A. No, nor did I know the prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you stopped him did he say he was hired. - A. About ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the first ten minutes he gave no account. - A. No, after I searched him he told me, if I went as far as the pump in Queen Street I should find them, I went directly, and could not find them. I took these picklock keys out of his waistcoat pocket, and this phosphorus box I found upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking with some bakers, one of them said,</p>
               <p>"White, I am rather in arrears with my rent," I said, worse luck, he said</p>
               <p>"I am going to move my things, would I help them move the things," I said I would, not knowing that these were stolen goods in the least. They gave me them things, and the bundle came untied. I picked them up, and some I put in my pocket, and the others in the bundle.</p>

On the 7th of June last I went out of town, I left a bunch of keys for the use of Mrs. Spybey, in an open drawer in the back parlour, I was two or three weeks in the country, when I returned the prisoner was at home. In consequence of information that he was seen opening my money drawer at night when he was gone to bed. I called in the patrol and told the prisoner that I had suspicion that he had my keys, the patrol searched him in his pocket he found a key, that was one that I left on the bunch of keys in the drawer, this was on the 19th of July, I sent the prisoner to the watch-house, the spectacles were found upon the prisoner's mother at the office, I had lost them out of my desk. The mother's house was searched at Hoxton, we found a variety of things in her house, among which was this hat, it is a new hat, there is my private mark in it, that hat was kept in the shop in the glass case, I had seen it about a week before the 19th of July, the prisoner slept twice a week at his mother's.</p>

On the Monday evening Mr. Charles came into the kitchen, and behaved very rude, he said if I would let him have connexion with me he had put a piece of print in the shop for me on a shelf by itself. In the morning I resisted against him, I had got it in my apron, he tore it from me and swore I stole it. There was no person present but ourselves.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . The prisoner was delivered in to my custody; I took the gown from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing how she came by the things - A. The same account that she gave you that her mistress consented to her wearing them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know this house of Mrs. Davis's - A. Yes; it was a bad house before she took it; the house was indicted; they were obliged to leave it about a week before Mrs. Davis took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am an unfortunate girl. I called there on the Monday between six and seven o'clock; Mr. Keefe is the man that wished me to stop till the return of Mrs. Davis; when she came in I enquired for the persons that were gone away; she said I have taken the house for the same description; she had paid thirty-five pounds for the good will; she said, as they have taken all the girls away, if I would stop with her I should have food, and plenty of raiment. On Tuesday I received company; on the following evening I was dressed and attired, and her daughter with me. On the Saturday I put on the daughter's gown in the evening I went out, it was not my esual hours to return home; Mrs. Davis followed me to the Turk's Head with her nephew; she asked for money; I said I cannot rob gentlemen for money; she said money she would have. She told the constable of the night that I had her things on, and she would bring the man forward; he would swear to the handkerchief. This man is no lodger, he is in the house to insult gentlemen if they lose their money or pocket books, that is his character.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, 83, Whitechapel. On the 17th of August, about eleven o'clock the prisoner offered this shawl to pledge; I asked her who she had it of; she said a young woman in Winfield-street. I opened it, and there was the mark of Richards and Needs upon it.</p>
               <p>Harrison. The shawl is my own marking, it laid on the counter. I did not see the prisoner come in.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 28th of June did you lose any pigeons and ducks - A. On the 29th in the morning, a little after two, I was called by the watchman; when I came down I found the shop shutters were down, and the sash window was thrown up. On searching about there were five baskets taken out, they were in a little enclosed place next to the front of the street, they had a pair of pigeons each, all the five were gone. On coming into the shop again I discovered a basket too large to go out of the window, that basket was cut and the three ducks that were alive in the basket taken away. I came in at eleven at night, and found the shop shut up in the usual way. I did not examine the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the sash was down or not - A. I should rather suppose that it was not, on account of the heat of the weather. I did not see that any force had been used. The pin was found the same morning in the middle of the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you to say that the window shutters were up - A. Yes, I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>Q. If they were not pinned it is possible that the shutters might be pulled out - A. They were rather loose; I might myself, by moving the shutters, take one out; I know I could. I saw the pigeons afterwards; the ducks were killed, part of the pigeons were alive.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were recovered - A. I think five, they were alive; they were here last sessions. I have sold them. I knew them and the ducks to be my own; I saw them on the 29th, between five and six. I valued the ducks at two shillings each, and the pigeons fifteen pence each.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The two persons that you took with the things you prosecuted last sessions - A. I did.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the ducks and pigeons - A. I did; the other two prisoners had put them into a hole in the field, there were three together, the prisoner was one of them. I had watched them above half an hour, sometimes one was carrying the bundle, and sometime the other. I saw them carry the bundle between the three, before they went to the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever carry it - A. Yes, it was in his possession when I first saw the bundle, and one of the pigeons was in his hand. When I came up close to him at the time, the pigeon was in his hand, the bundle was in the hole. I went up to him at the hole, and passed him, I asked him what he was going to do with it, he said he was going to toss it; Norton catched it out of the prisoner's hand, and put it into his pocket, and said, we will not toss it now; the prisoner said, what use is it bringing the pigeon here without tossing it. I looked at the bundle in the hole, and the moment I saw it, I catched hold of Norton and Walmsley, the prisoner ran off immediately. One of the prisoners that I had got hold of twisted himself from my left hand, and got away. Gates the watchman secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the prisoner after that - A. I did not see him until he was in custody at Bow-street. I think about a fortnight ago from this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known the prisoner before - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time in the morning was this - A. About four o'clock, on the 29th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sufficient opportunity of viewing the prisoner's person, so as to be able to speak with certainty at the distance of two months - A. I had. He was the first man that I looked at. I took some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180039"/>pigeons from the other prisoners, and the watchman searched Norton's pocket, and found others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the ducks in the hole - A. Yes, and pigeons, they were shewn to Mr. Castang; he described the ducks before the handkerchief was opened. The pigeons were all alive, there were only five.</p>

I did, I saw him about a quarter after after four, there were two more with him, Norton and Walmsley, I saw them in the fields at the back of Gower-street, I perceived one of them with a bundle, I was about one hundred and fifty, or two hundred yards from them. They were coming from the New-road along to St. Giles's.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they coming in a direction as if coming from Mr. Castang's house - A. Yes, by coming round the fields to prevent them coming along the streets, as little as they could help, they continued in my sight about a quarter of an hour, they stopped by themselves just before they got to Keppel-street; I was then one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards from them; they stopped there; I pulled off my coat, and put it into the watch-box; I went one way, and the constable the other before. Before I came up the constable had collared one; Crane made a catch at the bundle; Walmsley twisted out of the Constable's hand, and came past me; he was nearest me; I was pursuing him. Crane said, here you b - r, come and catch me if you can. I pursued Walmsley and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Crane before - A. I had seen him about Somerstown and Pancras a great many times. His father keeps a green grocer's shop just below the Britannia in Campden Town, he lived with his father.</p>

Mr Simpole claimed the watch, and gave charge of the prisoner. Mr. Simpole is not present in court, I have not seen him since last Tuesday morning. I have been to his house twice a-day, except to day.</p>

I know the prisoner, he was in the habit of coming to the Mansion-house, he appeared to be a man not in his right mind he came with papers to the Mansion-house to have them copied. I took them to an interpreter in Birchin-lane; they were all nonsense; that was six months before this transaction took place, he appeared decent then; I have seen him several times at the Mansion-house.</p>

            . Q. You are the clerk at the Mansion-house - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Bray has mentioned that this man came frequently to the Mansion-house - A. I have seen him frequently there. The man came creditably dressed, with a parcel of papers, they were in the shape of bills of exchange, being a foreigner I thought he was imposed upon; they had Sir Francis Burdett and liberty upon them. I have got them interpreted, and they were perfectly nonsense. I thought him an inoffensive man; he came several times after that, and then became more and more poor.</p>

In the course of five minutes I saw Beadle come with these oats that I have in the sack here; he come out of Mr. Isaac's stable adjoining the shed, with a sack which I afterwards found containing oats. He put it into the cart; Kelly was by at the time, he stood at the hind part of the cart with his back towards me; I was concealed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether any payment was made - A. No, I did not.

            . On the 18th of August last, about half past six in the morning, I was sent for into St. Martin's lane, at the Northumberland's Head; in consequence of information I went and searched the prisoner, he was a lodger there, he had been there about fortnight; I went in the room with the landlord, I told the prisoner a gentleman had lost some notes in the course of the night; I asked him if he knew any thing of the notes; he said no; I told him suspicion fell upon him; I searched his nankeen pantaloons, and as he came off the bed he kept his shirt sideway; I saw him keep his shirt in his hand, up against his groin; I pulled his drawers off, I said, now you shall stand up; he stood up, and there was a bundle of papers fell from his privates, the landlord picked them up. The notes are here, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That note was mine, it was marked 308 on the back, it is a one pound Portsmouth note. The six one pound Portsmouth notes, and the two one pound bank notes, are all here, they are the exact quantity that I lost.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. I came into the room where he was, and spoke to a gentleman, and left him there; I was not in his company.</p>

On the morning of the 8th of August, a little after four I called up my apprentices, I went with them to to this chapel, I found one of the shutters open, I entered the meeting door, we saw the prisoner coming up the aisle; we found the door open, and went inside, the prisoner was coming up the aisle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180042"/>as we went down I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any marks of violence - A. I did, there was marks of a crow on the door of the vestry, and at the window, we found the crow about twenty yards from the place, and the crow fitted the marks exactly; I saw the prisoner jump in the window like a bird. This is the glass that was in the vestry, and these are the fire irons.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up early that morning, and was going towards Bow, and going across the fields it rained very hard; I went up to this meeting-house-door for shelter, seeing the window open I looked in my hat fell off; I instantly jumped in. Mr. Shubirt met me, and asked me what business I had there; I said I had no business, if you think me a thief, send for a constable and search me; I was searched, and no property found; I have nails in my shoes, and jumping in the window to get my hat, my foot slipped, and by that means my elbow broke one of the windows.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Shubirt. Did it rain hard - A. It rained a little.</p>

               <p>Q. That is there declaration of the prisoner being a bankrupt - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any adjucation of their being bankrupts - A. I have the gazette from April the 30th, to May the 4th; and from the 3d, to the 15th of June.</p>
               <p>"Whereas a commission of bankruptcy is awarded, date, the 11th of May instant; the 15th of June next, they are required to meet then and finish the examination."</p>
               <p>Q. On the 11th of May was the first meeting, did the commissioners meet - A. Yes, Mr. Nares, Mr. Christian and Mr. Veesey.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 18th of May, did the commissioners then meet again - A. They did, and on the 15th of June the commissioners met again, on that day Mr. Gibson surrendered and passed his commission. Mr. Whittaker was brought from the King's-bench on purpose to be examined; he was not brought till a late hour, there was no blame to him, it was the mistake of the officer, he did come and declare that he was not prepared, he requested untill the Wednesday following: From information of his absenting, the commissioners did not think proper to give him till Wednesday, they gave him till Monday, and then if they found it necessary, they would give him further time. Mr. Christian stated to the prisoner, that if he did not appear that day and surrender to his commission, he would commit an act of felony, and suffer death without the benefit of Clergy, although he did not receive a shillings of his property. On Monday the 17th of June, they met in consequence of that adjournment. The prisoner did not then appear; the commissioners waited in attendence; I remained part of the time, and the messengers the other time; a little before twelve he was proclaimed. I was present, he was summonsed in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180044"/>usual way, on the steps at Guildhall, as the clock was striking twelve.</p>

               <p>Q. Now you tell us on the Saturday he requested an adjournment did you make any appointment with him to assist him in prison in adjusting his occompts - A. I did, he appointed Sunday at six o'clock at the King's Bench prison, I was to carry all the books and papers that he had previously selected; I took the books and papers at the time appointed, and when I came to the gate they informed me the prisoner was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you seen these things the last time before the pipe and the cock were taken away - A. About half an hour before, they were safe then.

               <p>Q. Who helped you to secure him - A. Mr. Humphreys the constable. I let him go and called my husband, he pursued him and then he was taken; it was not quite dark, I am confident the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>JOHN TRIGGER. I saw the prisoner come across Drury-lane; I saw him go into Vinegar Yard; there he dropped the pipe. The prosecutor lives in Bennett's-court, it is nearly opposite Vinegar-yard. I saw him through the pipe down, I piched it up, he was half way down Vinegar-yard. He took the pipe from underneath his coat, and threw it down; I am sure it is the same man, I saw him in the court before this happened, I have no doubt at all of his person.</p>

The leaden pipe and brass cock the prosecutor has recovered, nor is there any evidence to prove they had been in my possession. In Bennett's-court there was a hue and cry that the prosecutor had lost his pipe and cock; in Vinegar-yard the property was picked up. I was taken in Russell-court when the prosecutor charged me; I offered to be searched, and went voluntary to Bow-street, where the prosecutor said he could not swear to the person of the prisoner as he had changed his clothes, which is not true, as I had the same clothes on. I live in the same court where my prosecutor lives; I left work at eight o'clock, I went through the the court, I saw the man cross over Drury-lane into Vinegar-yard, where the property was picked up.</p>

About one o'clock in the morning, I saw Cable the prisoner go seven or eight times to my piles of bricks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the other prisoner then - A. He was digging the well; after he had taken seven or eight turns with the bricks to the well he said to the labourer if he would came up, he would go down and stem the well; the labourer got up and put the bricks down that his master had taken from my piles; when he had handed all that was along side of the well; he went and brought bricks six or seven times to the well from off my piles, and the master made use of them; the last turn I ran out of the house where I was watching, seized hold of the labourer, and detected him with the bricks upon him. He was in a very great confusion; I said he must go along with us; the master was getting out of the well, I then took him. He was in a considerable agitation; he begged that I would not take him to justice, no doubt it could be settled without. I told him I had been robbed repeatedly at different buildings, I was determined the first I catched should go to justice; Cable wished to settle it, that I would not do, and he was brought to justice. I said I considered it worse in him than in a labouring man. I had told him before it was a strange time of night for a tradesman to come digging a well; he said he was very busy in the day, and he could not come and do it; I said you have no bricks here; he said they were loaded at six o'clock in the morning, he could have them at half an hours notice; I then said recollect them bricks belong to me. There were several stacks, if you take any bricks do not take mine; his answer was, do you think I want my neck in an halter; I said I hope not. After this I went to my house, I had suspicion that he was going to use my bricks; I went to watch. And I had told him if the water came in he would have to pump it out in the morning. It is a very swampy place.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When you apprehended him he was willing to pay for the bricks - A. No doubt of that.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you seized him you say he was in a great agitation - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that he meaned to come to you the next morning to pay you for them - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was a very swampy place must it not be likely that he should have known that he must have land springs come in upon him - A. I should imagine so.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of the bricks that you lost - A.About five shillings.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SMITH. I was with the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard the last witness give his evidence - A. Yes, it is correct.</p>
               <p>Cable's Defence. When I began to sink this well it was about five o'clock in the evening, after I had done my business at home; I sunk about three foot, I found the water began to come in; the man said as we had begun it we might as well finish it; I said it will be ten o'clock before we are done; he said, never mind. I went to get my supper while my man was digging, and when I returned the water came fast in. I then concluded I would finish it. On the further end of the ground there were some of my bricks, they were so small it was impossible to do it with them. The well was within eighteen yards of the houses. About six o'clock in the evening Mr. Stewart came up; he told me, if I wanted any bricks not to take them, but to take them; accordingly I took them, and then he accused me of feloniously taking, which is not the truth. Mr. Stewart gave me free commission to take bricks, but he did not say where.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stewart. I said them bricks belong to me, if you take any bricks do not take mine.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you give him leave to meddle with any of your bricks - A. I did not; on the contrary I cautioned him against it.</p>
               <p>Daley said nothing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Cable called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner taking a small quantity of oats and beans on the 7th of September last - A. I believe it was the 7th, a little after five in the morning, I observed the prisoner coming out of the stable with something in his smock frock; I let him walk about forty or fifty yards; I then tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him what he had got there; he said a little horse corn, it was the first time, and he hoped for mercy; I brought him back to the stable door; I told him to stay there until I brought something to put the corn in, and while I went he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180047"/>strewed the corn about the yard as thin as he could. It was beans and oats mixed for the cart horses.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a little horse, I let Mr. Nicolls have it to ride over the farm; he was to feed it. I took this little corn to give to the horse, I did not at the moment think I was acting wrong; I am now convinced of my error and am sorry for it, I should not have thought of taking the oats if the foreman had not have had the horse.</p>
               <p>Nicolls. With regard to the poney, when the young man Mr. Harper had it, it was in the lane, it was literally starving; the young man asked me to give him some corn, provided he would let him ride it for a week, and then it was in our stable. The poney had been returned about ten days before this transaction.</p>
               <p>The prisoner two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

I got up, she still persuaded me to stop till day light; I told her I could not, I did not like the apartment. I had given her what I had agreed for. I sat down on the chair, and when I was tying my stocking on, she said if you do not give me more money I will charge the watch with you; she took my coat and ran off; I did not miss my coat till a few minutes afterwards.</p>

            . I live in Golden-lane. On the 17th of July I saw the prisoner look at a shawl at Mr. Peart's shop, it was hanging inside the shop, near the door. I saw her pull the shawl down and put it in her apron; I went into the shop and informed the young man. We then pursued her and brought her into shop. She drooped the shawl on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her drop it - A. I cannot say that, I saw it on the ground; Drake picked it up.</p>

On the 2d of July, in looking over the ledger I observed that there was a quantity of leather that appeared not to be accounted for; I asked the prisoner who had sold it; he stated at the time that he was ignorant who had sold it, it was either Scott and Clark, or Mr. Dyson, or Mr.

In about the course of an hour from this time he said he had been out, he had ascertained that Mr. Dyson had sold it, and he had received the money. On the 6th of July I asked him what he had done with Mr. Dyson's draft; he stated that he had paid it to Messrs. Hankey and Co. I remarked that he had not debitted it to them; he said it was his omission; I desired him to do it; he took the cash book and debited it to them.

               <p>Q. In the month of March how many deals were taken away - A. Forty-seven boards after they were prepared for flooring, and several trimmers, joists, and riders for steps, and two newells, they were taken to a house that Mr. Gover was building in Green Man's-lane, Islington. They were taken by me, my partner. Mr. Gover, and his son. He shewed me a paper that Mr. Eades was debtor to him, and I fully believed that he might take them. We used these boards in Mr. Gover's house of an evening or morning. There are four floors that I laid there, I told Mr. Eades of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you able to say of your own knowledge how many boards could be produced from the largest deal you have seen in the market - how many of these boards that you conveyed from Eades's house to Gover's could have been made out of one piece of deal - A. Five boards; thirty-five of such as I conveyed away could have been manufactured from seven deals.</p>

               <p>COURT, Q. to prosecutor. Did you see these forty-seven boards at Gover's house - A. Yes, Fish pointed them out to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they have been manufactured from seven deals - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These seven deals you allowed him in accompt - A. My surveyor did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I wish the court to see the accompt. Mr. Eades was very poor, he got fresh credit over the water on Bank side; I said, Mr. Eades, let me have seven of them deals, I want them. I had the deals on the 2nd of February they were acccompted for; I supplied Mr. Eades with hinges, glue, and every thing that was wanting in the building line; he now swears nothing but nails. Fish is a bad character. When the work was measured I had one surveyor, and Mr. Eades another. I then said there is a few odds and ends of stuff that I have to accompt; I had asked him for them; he said take what you want.</p>

After that Mr. Eades said I should like you to take account of the money Gover has had because he had no receipt; Mr. Eades called Gover and asked him what money he had; he said he gave him three pounds, that made one hundred and twenty pounds; I put it down; Eades said, now recollect you had two loads of bats, two guineas, and October 23d Gover had a small piece of timber of Mr. Eades, they agreed that the piece of timber should be eleven shillings; then said he there were seven twelve-feet three-inch deals, cut into half-inch stuff; Gover said, what do you charge for them. Mr. Eades said the deals cost me sixty pound a hundred; they agreed the deals should be with the cutting four pound.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 16th of July, about half past four in the morning, I met the prisoner with a quantity of fowls in a basket, he appearing to me to be a suspicious character I stopped him, I asked him where he brought the fowls from; he told me from Wemley, after further questioning him I asked him again; he said he brought them from Fleet Market; I then asked him if he was not a foreigner. He called me a b - y English b - r, and if I followed him he would give me this, taking this pair of scissars out of his pocket; I then drew back a little, but kept hold of the basket. When I got to the watchhouse I examined it, and found it contained fourteen fowls; I took two pair of scissars from him, he had them both in his pocket. I took him to the magistrate and found out the prosecutor, I shewed him the fowls, he swore to them at Bow-street. The fourteen fowls were all dead; I suppose they were cut in the throat by these small pair of scissars.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How were these fowls taken out of your place - A. On the over night the door was open till nine o'clock, and then the door is locked up. I know the fowls, I bred some of them, and some I bought.</p>

On the 17th of July I was standing in Red Lion-street, I heard the cry of watch, I saw two men running towards me, the prisoner was one; I followed him across Whitechapel into Essex-street, he got under a gateway, stooped down, and when I came up to him he jumped up, made a blow at me, and then ran on and came to another gate, there he stooped down again; I saw him gather some mud; he put something under the gate, he came up again and made a blow at me; I brought him back and delivered him to the patrol.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the prosecutor - A. He is dead.</p>

            . I am a watchman in St. John street. I was crying half past two up St. John-street, these three men came opposite of me on the same side that Mr. Cooper lives; one said, you go of the other side, you will see. I suspected them; I pulled off my shoes, and watched them down the street; two of them got to Mr. Cooper's yard, they opened the door and went in, they gave a whistle, and the other crossed over to them. I went over to the gate with my shoes in my hand, and listened at the gate, I heard one of the coach doors open, one of them said, let that alone, come on I then put on my shoes and sprang my rattle, directly the gate opened, and out ran one of them. I shut the gate to, and shut the others in; I halloaed out stop thief, he is gone towards St. Johns-lane. One of the patrols stopped him, I kept at the gate and sprang my rattle again for my other partners to come up to my assistance; a man that lived facing of the gate asked what was the matter, and said he had got the key of the gate. I told him to make haste down with it, there were two others inside. When he came down with the key we went in with a light; we searched about, we found one in a coach, and the other in the harness room.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was in St. John-street; I heard the rattle spring about a quarter before three; I ran to Carliste's assistance, he said there were some persons in the gate; I entered the yard, the first thing I saw was a large blue coat laying on a splinter bar of a carriage, I went further down the yard, I found Moore pretending<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180051"/>to be asleep in one of the coaches; I hit him and he made as if he was awaking; I took hold of him and pulled him out; I took him to the watchhouse, I returned, and then my partner had got Knight. We took him to the watchhouse,</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You found Moore in the coach, you struck him with your cutlass - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to say he was not asleep - A. His eyes were shut, as far as his being asleep I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you are not asleep when you know there is forty pounds reward upon each of their convictions - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>NEHEMIAH BRICKNELL. I am a coachman, I drive for Mr. Cooper. I came home about half-past twelve, and left the yard about one, on the night of the robbery; I am sure I left my coat in the stable; I saw it the next morning at the magistrate's.</p>

               <p>Knight's Defence. When I was taken to the watch-house, I stated that the key was my own which I bought when I went into Mr. Cooper's service.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. How is this connected with your house - A. We have no other way to go to the house, but into the house, the dwelling house is in the yard. All the men have a key to let themselves in.</p>
               <p>Q. How did Knight behave when he was with you - A. Very well, I never know any dishonesty of him except taking away the key.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do not you know it is a common thing for them to sleep in coaches - A. Not my men, I never had one of my men to sleep in the coaches in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. It is not an unusual thing for hackney coachmen when they are drunk, to go into coaches to sleep - A. It is an usual thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose house is it - A. I do not know, I was nursing a little boy eighteen months. I was sitting at the window, a man came up and knocked at the next room door, it was in the morning between nine and ten o'clock, I told the man there was nobody at home; he went down stairs and asked the girl for the key of the two pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did this man live - A In the one pair front. He unlocked the two pair back room door and went in; he came down stairs in about ten minutes and came into the room where I was nursing, and took up a book that laid in the window, he held it in his hand a little bit and put it down again. The child took up the book and pulled out this key with a string to it; I told him he had left his key, he said so I have. I gave him the key and he gave it back to the girl. I am sure it was the prisoner, he absented for two days.</p>

On the 16th, about one o'clock at night, I was standing near the Broad-way, Westminster; the prisoner came by with a bundle under her arm, I asked her what she had got there, she said it was nothing to me; I told her I was an officer and I insisted upon seeing. I took her to the watchhouse, I searched her pocket, found these spoons, and a cream jug; two silver table-spoons, and three silver tea-spoons, a nutmeg-grater, two keys and a thread-case; a one pound note, two dollars, four shillings and some halfpence. I opened the bundle and found all these things, she said it was her own; she had taken them out of pawn, in Compton-street, Soho. I asked her what she did down at that part at that late hour of the night; she said she had been to see a cousen, at Pimlico. I told her I was not satisfied, I should lock her up for the night. I took her before the Magistrate, he desired that I would give the pound note and the dollars to the prisoner; I told the Magistrate one of the dollars was marked, some person might claim it. I gave her the note back, four shillings and the halfpence. I kept the two dollars. She stated to the Magistrate that she bought the dimity at a shop at the corner of Bow-street. I advertised it in the paper, and the prosecutrix came forward and owned all the property. I found this hat and gown on her person when the prosecutrix came forward.</p>

            . I am a watchman, in Mary-le-bone Parish. On the 10th of August at night, I was going my round between ten and eleven at night, and seeing the prisoner coming along with a board on his shoulder, I questioned him how he came by it; he told me he was taking it home, he bought it from his master's building. He told me his master's name and were he lived, I took him to the watchhouse and went for his master, he came and swore to his property. It is marked with his master's initials.</p>

I am sure of her person. I lost seventeen pounds in one and two pound notes.</p>

I found the quart pot concealed in a pail of filth, the filth is to be seen on the outside of the pot now. I gave charge of the prisoner. After she was taken to the watchhouse I came back, I asked for the pint of ale that I had drawn; my wife said she missed it.

There was no candle, but there was a fire of wood; he went down stairs, returned with a light, and before he came into the room, he said here is my quart pot.</p>

            . I am a builder, I live in Sloane-street. On the 17th of August the prisoner applied to me to know if I wanted any old paving; I told him I should want some at a future time. He brought me a load of stone on the Wednesday following; I measured them, they made eighty-one feet; I told him I would give him sixpence a foot for bringing it and laying it down, which he agreed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you these stones in your possession until Mr. Parish came - A. Yes. Mr. Parish lay claim to two of them in particular.</p>

On the 10th of September, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in and offered this tablecloth to pawn; on looking at it I saw Mr. Hanson's name; I asked her how she came by it; she said she washed for Mr. Hanson, she hoped I would let her have the tablecloth she meaned to return it. I took the tablecloth to Mr. Hanson, she followed me, begging me to give her the tablecloth back again. I went into Mr. Hanson's and asked him if it was his tablecloth, he said it was, and that he lost it about a week; he begged me to call again in about five minutes, she was out; I called again, the prisoner was called into the bar; I immediately knew that she was the same woman that offered me the tablecloth. The prisoner said she never saw me before, nor had she been out of the house. The beadle was sent for, he has had the tablecloth ever since.</p>

            . I am a beadle. The prisoner was given into my charge, she denied stealing the tablecloth; I searched every thing where she had things, I could not find any thing except these keys, one of them will open a good many drawers. This is the tablecloth.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. it is mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I lived servant with the prosecutor, and in consequence of his losing a tablecloth some day before I left, he said the house maid must be accountable she having them in her charge; unfortunately me and the house maid having words, she swore she would have revenge, and on my coming into the bar to take instruction for the supper, a person came into the house and called for a pint beer and asked me if I had not been into his shop to pawn a tablecloth; I said I had not; he insisted I had, and wished my master to take me in custody; my master said he would consider of it. After he was gone I became passionate, and the next morning the father of the house maid come and abused me very much, he told me he would not mind giving ten pound to make me suffer for the injury I had done to his daughter. Had I been disposed to rob my master there was always plenty of plate about.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. At the time that this tablecloth was brought to your house did you inquire whether the prisoner was at home - A. I did, she was out of the house, I saw her come in and then I sent for the pawnbroker.</p>

No further than her coming into the Kings Arms, public-house, and asked for a messenger; the landlady recommended me being a lodger in the house; she wanted me to go to the Peacock in the same street with a message, and on my coming back I called at Mrs. Parsons for my shirt and stockings, the prisoner followed me in.

            . I am a porter, I work at the Golden Lion, St. John-street. On the 1st of August, about nine in the morning, I met Cleaver with a flat of butter on his back in Charterhouse-square, Widdison was with him, I knew them both before by sight; they were about ten yards apart, but both in one direction. I knew the flat, I asked Cleaver where he was going with the flat, Cleaver told me he was carrying it for a gentleman, which was Widdison; there was no other person by him. Widdison told him to come along with it.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180057"/>He went on into Fan-street, I followed Cleaver, and Widdison went first. When they got into the middle of Fann-street I asked Cleaver to set it down; he set it down. I cut the flat open and shewed the note that was in it to a gentleman, the gentlemen said it did not appear to have been sold by any butter merchant or cheesemonger that morning. Cleaver said he was carrying it for Widdison; Widdison was at the bottom of the street, he went away and left the butter and Cleaver and me. A young man that was with me took the butter, and I took Cleaver to the Golden Lion, and when we came to the Golden Lion the carrier knew that it was delivered to Mr. Hazel. We sent for a constable and gave charge of Cleaver; Cleaver said he was to have sixpence for carrying this flat, of Widdison that was along with him. On the next morning I saw Widdison at Cow Cross, I catched hold of him and asked the carrier to assist me. I told Widdison he must go along with me. I took him to the officer that took the the other in custody, he tried to get away; I gave him in charge of the constable. I know both the prisoners well, I had seen them several times before in Newgate-street, and about Newgate-market. I am sure Widdison was one of the two.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose a watch on the 29th of August - A. Yes, I was at High-street, Whitechapel, between one and two in the morning, I had been at Mrs. Casheer's in Goodman's yard, in the Minories, I was not intoxicated. I looked at my watch just previous to my leaving the house; I was going to No. 12, Brewer's Wharf, Whitechapel, and coming along <placeName id="t18110918-151-crimeloc813">Whitechapel High-street</placeName>

Immediately three other persons followed me in, the prisoner was one of them, I speak to him with certainty. While I was at the bar the two other men went out after drinking their glasses of gin, leaving the prisoner behind. As soon as I went out of the house, he followed me immediately; he came abreast of me and snatched the watch from my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive it done - A. Yes, I immediately cried out stop thief; I did not see any other person but the prisoner, he ran; I pursued him a short way, he was apprehended; he had not gone above thirty yards when the constable of the night took him; he was taken to the watchhouse; he was searched, I was present, the watch was found in his coat pocket; I claimed it immediately. The prisoner said he knew nothing of the watch until it was put in his coat pocket by somebody else. There was no other person near us at the time to have done it; I value the watch at three pounds, it cost me four guineas.</p>

            . I am an headborough of Whitechapel. On the night of the 29th of August I was on duty, I was standing at the corner of Church-lane, between fifty and sixty yards from the Yorkshire Grey, I heard a cry of stop thief, I saw the prisoner running, I caught him by the collar, and stopped him, he said he had got no watch, without my asking a question, I had not charged him with any thing; I dragged him into the watchhouse, the prosecutor was in the watchhouse about two or three minutes afterwards; I searched the prisoner, I pulled his right hand out of his coat pocket, and he had got the watch in his hand. The prosecutor charged the prisoner with having taken his watch; he gave the same account then as he did now; he told me that there was a lady worked in silk inside of his watch; I found that to be correct. The prisoner said he was a man of respectability, and dared me to lock him up in the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell where he lived - A. No, nor would he tell his name. I have kept the watch ever since.</p>

            . Q. I am a watchman opposite of the Yorkshire Grey. I heard the cry of stop thief, the prisoner run from him immediately; I came up to him when he was stopped by Hanbridge; the prosecutor in the watchhouse charged the prisoner with having snatched his watch out of his fob; he described the watch accurately before it was produced.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in the Yorkshire Grey, this gentleman came in intoxicated; I could not finish the glass I had in my hand, he finished it, he called for half a pint of gin and bitters; he drank out of that; he pulled out his watch, and offered it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180058"/>for sale.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not do any such thing, nor did I drink any bitters, nor ever out of the glass with him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eight witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner at the prosecutrix's apartment. When I took the prisoner in custody she wanted me to promise her forgiveness; I told her I could not do any such thing. Coming along, the prosecutor and another woman told her they would transport her if she did not tell where the things were; she then told. I went to Mr. Wildman's, the pawnbroker, and found the property; she took a gown and a pair of breeches to redeem the things, I would not suffer her to do it. The prisoner said she had lost the duplicate.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 26th of July did you lose any saddle-flaps stirrup-irons and trace-buckles - A. Yes, they were on a pentice, as high as a one pair of stair; they were safe on the night of the 25th. I set up till four o'clock in order to detect the prisoner. Finding that he did not not come, I went to bed, and nigh upon half past five Mr. Bellfour called me, and told me some person had been stealing my leather, I got up and pursued the prisoner, and catched him just by the skin market; about half a mile from my house. The saddle flaps had been cut of a whole saddle, he spoiled the saddle. I took them from the prisoner, they were in his hand. The constable found two stirup-irons on him, and two trace-buckles. I asked him how he got them, he said they were mine; I said yes, you rascal, what have you done with the property you took before; he said he took none before.</p>
               <p>JOHN BELLFOUR. My father is a schoolmaster. As I was opening the window I saw the prisoner with a knife in his hand, he picked up two saddle-flaps from of the ground. I told my father, and he called Mr. Parry up.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner in Red-lion-yard, Red-lion-street, Clerkenwell, about two o'clock in the middle of day; he was in bed with his clothes on; when I went into the room I saw a quantity of tools; knowing that Mr. Tanner had lost a turkey stone out of the frame I looked in the drawer, and found that turkey stone was afterwards claimed by Mr. Tanner. I asked the prisoner how he came by it; he said the whole of the tools was his own property. I told him to get up he was my prisoner, he did, I went to hand-cuff him, he made some resistance; I took a pistol out and said I would shoot him; he after that surrendered, I searched about the room and found some duplicates; one a saw, pawned for a shilling, in the name of

I perceived some persons hand at my right pocket, I turned myself round, and I saw that three women had just passed me; I put my hand into my pocket, my handkerchief was gone, it was a silk handkerchief, I think three minutes before I had used it, I am sure that I had it a short time before. There was no other person near me expect a person reading a book besides these three women, who were apparently in company together. I said to the person that was standing by, that I had my pocket picked; I crossed the street, and I perceived them all three go into a gin shop; I saw the bookseller standing the door, I held up my finger for him to come over to me, he came over; I asked him to procure a constable, I said I had had my pocket picked; he said he would go with me to the gin shop; we went in together, we charged them with one of them picking my pocket, they all denied it, a constable was sent for; before the constable came the prisoner said what a bother you make about your handkerchief, or something to that effect, and took it out of her pocket. Mr. Wright took it from her and gave it to me, I gave the constable charge of her, the others went away; she was afterwards taken before the magistrate, and committed. This is the hand kerchief, it is worth two shillings, its mine.</p>

            . I am a bookseller. On Saturday morning I was standing behind the counter, I heard a gentleman say to my boy that he had his pocket picked by these women that went by; I went immediately to the door; I saw a gentleman crossing the street, he held up his finger to come to him, I went; he asked me to get a constable, I said while I am going for a constable they may escape, I said if you chose I will go into the gin shop with you. On going into the gin shop I charged the three women to produce the handkerchief that they had taken out of the gentleman's pocket. I knew the women by passing my door every day; they all denied it at first; I told them it was of no use denying it, the gentleman had kept his eye upon them since they did it. I clapped my back to the door, and said you shall not go out untill you are searched. The landlord sent his son out for a constable, and being so long before he came, the prisoner produced the handkerchief out of her pocket, and said it was of no use to make such a piece of work, is this it; I took it out of her hand, and immediately Mr. Goodwin claimed it. This woman was detained, and the other women were suffered to go about their business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning as I was going along Broad Street I met these two women, they asked me if I would have some refreshment; we were walking along to go to the wine-vault's I kicked something before me, I stooped down and picked up a handkerchief, I turned round and saw no one enquiring for it; we went into the wine vault's; a little time after this gentleman came in, he said one of you women have got a handkerchief, presently the other said one of you picked this gentleman's pocket, I made answer I picked up a handkerchief, I do not know who it belongs to; is this the handkerchief, and immediately I handed it to one of the gentlemen.</p>

               <p>Q. Beyond him does a person live of the name of Andrews - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 31st of July were you the last person in your house that went to bed - A. Yes, and it was always my custom to rake the fire out myself, and see that every thing was safe. I went to bed about half past ten or later, it was not eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. What does your family consist of - A.Myself, my wife, and one child, my maid servant and shopman; the shopman sleeped in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife was far advanced in pregnancy - A. Yes, she has since been brought to bed. The prisoner's family consisted of himself, his wife, and two children, the oldest about six or seven years old.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 31st of July, between twelve and one o'clock, were you awoke - A. I was, by a smoke or smother of fire. I sleep in the back room, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cohen, look at that plan, and tell me whether that plan correctly describes Mr. Phillips's house, and yours - A. Yes, that is as near as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that you awoke with a great smell of fire - A. Yes, I came out of bed, I found the room all of a smoke; I went down stairs, I found the flames coming through a crevise from between the lath and plaster that came into my passage from a partition between my house and Mr. Phillips's, there is no brick wall to these houses, there is nothing but lath and plaster on my side, and waistcoat on Mr. Phillips's side.</p>
               <p>Q. And the flames were coming through the lath and plaster in your house - A. Yes, between the skirting board and the floor. When I found the flames coming at the foot of the stairs I called the servant first, because she had a child in the two pair, and my wife I called all to come down stairs; I had nothing on but my shirt. I went to the street door, I called the boy, he was sleeping under the counter. I opened the street door, there was a watchman there, I gave the alarm there was a fire; the watchman sprang his rattle, then there were some more watchmen came up. The watchman that I called first, he went in doors with me, his name is Street; he then asked me if I could get any water; I told him I would give him what I had; I believe it was three or four pails; I gave him all I had.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had throwed some water and damped the fire did he break in the plaster - A. Yes, with his cutlass, and with his foot he kicked it away; he threw more water in, and I went out, and made further alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had used what water you had what further did you do - A. I went into the yard. We have only one yard to the two houses, the back of his house is in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you could get at the back door of Phillips's house - A. Yes. I knocked as loud as I could, I could not get any answer; I then went to the prisoner's street door, there were several people knocking there before I came out, and then as I was not answered; I tried to save what property I had; I was still in my shirt; I kept moving my things, and therefore did not attend to what was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180061"/>going on in the street; the watchman still continued knocking with their sticks at Phillip's door full five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you in the street when Phillips came to the window - A. Yes, I was crossing the road, he opened the sash and stood at the window; I saw him with a silk handkerchief round his neck, and something like a dark or black waistcoat, and lower I could not see.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had he his coat - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was that the room that he and his wife slept in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His chamber is over the shop door where they were making this noise - A. Yes. When he appeared at the window he asked what was the matter, some of the people cried out, come down stairs, your house is a fire. He said, I cannot come down for the smoke, get me a ladder. There was a great many people about the door, they said break the door open. I heard many people say if he could not get down for the smoke he must know that the house was on fire without asking that question The people upon that cried out, break open the door; some of them broke open the pannel of the door before the engine came, then with a crow the door was broken open. I then got to the house, I looked in and saw Mr. Phillips in the shop; in a minute after the door was broken open. I saw him first, and his wife about a minute afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he with respect to his dress - A. He was completely dressed and all his clothes on exactly as I saw him the day before, and his wife was completely dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. The door that was broken open by the mob was the shop door in the street - A. Yes, the private door was not broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. The fire was I believe put put out in a short time - A. Yes, I suppose it was not above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. After the fire was put out do you remember any person asking the prisoner whether he was insured - A. Yes, he said he was insured some years at the Phoenix; he did not say to what amount Some gentlemen there asked him how his skirting-board, came to be off, he said the rats had knawed it off, and it had been so some time. I remember his being asked how the fire began. He said it must be in the next house, meaning mine. He made use of abusive language to me, and said that I had lighted coals and shavings in my coal-hole.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact that was not true - A. No, I had no lighted shavings in my coal-hole</p>
               <p>Q. In a short time afterwards did your servant shew you some turpentine chips - A. Yes. I gave them to Mr. Harmer.</p>
               <p>

            . Q. Did you receive these chips of the witness - A. I did, I have kept them ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cohen. I received them of my servant girl, I was standing at the door, I asked Mr. Phillips how the turpentine chips came there meaning where the fire was; he said, you must have put it there; I had not; I never had a bit of that sort of stuff in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the watchman cut that plastering away to extinguish the fire had you any place to put them in there - A. There was not a hole to put my finger in.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the firemen shewed the prisoner some rags - A. I was. They called me in and asked me if they were mine; they asked Phillips, he said they were not his; the fireman came and asked me, I told them I had no such thing in the house. Mr. Phillips then said if they are not yours I suppose they must be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the sole occupier of the house you live in - A. I am. I hold the lease under Mr. Thomas Lane, I pay my rent to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a salesman - you deal in shoes and old clothes - A. I seldom deal in old clothes, but if I buy them I sell them again.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal in new and old clothes - you need not be ashamed of it - A. I am not ashamed of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You have lived two or three years next door to the defendant - A. About two years.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a passage between your house and the defendant's - A. I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. There is a private entery into your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Your man slept in the shop - A. He did, he is here.</p>
               <p>Q. When you discovered the smoke you said you ran down stairs and alarmed your own family - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is very natural you should, and after that you went and alarmed your neighbour - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was after that about four or five minutes that you saw him at the window - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You of course were a great deal agitated, you cannot say correctly to the time - A. No. It was long enough to wake him if he was asleep.</p>
               <p>Q. That depends upon how a man might sleep - When the watchman came you and he forced your way into the passage and endeavoured to force down the lath and plaster in order to extinguish the fire - A. I did not touch it; the watchman did it. I was there at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said there was lath and plaster on your side, and wainscot of his side, was not the inside of his place covered over with paper - A. The bottom part of his parlour is wainscot, it comes up as high as the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Above that was there any thing but paper, and under that canvas - A. I did not see any canvas.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning you went to the police office - A. I never went to any police office before Mr. Harmer took me, that was a week after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any examination until the week after - A. No. there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner attended, did not he - A. He was fetched by an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he was fetched by an officer, you would have us infer from that that he was brought against his consent - A. I know an officer fetched him. I do not know whether he came against his consent.</p>
               <p>Q. He remained in his own house a week, so that he might have run away if he had been so disposed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was a week at home before he went to the office - A. It was some days; I cannot say it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180062"/>a week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was any part of your house burned - A. There was the joists began to be burned in my one pair of stairs back room; the boards were beginning to burn, and that was just under the head of my bed.</p>

            . I was awoke as well as my husband by the smell of this fire; we both awoke together; the room was in a great smoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your husband get out of bed and go down stairs - A. He did; I went out of the room door and perceived the flames. I could see them from my staircase.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these flames proceed from the partition of your house and Mr. Phillips's - A. It proceeded through the skirting board, it was breaking through at that place. I ran up stairs and called the servant to bring the child down, she came down directly. Afterwards I ran down stairs and stood at the street door. I did not stop to dress myself. I desired the servant to carry the child to a place of safety, and to come back to help us to save our property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you endeavour to save what property you could. I did not move any property, I stood at the street door to see that no person should take any thing away.</p>
               <p>Q. After you came down stairs was there any knocking at Mr. Phillips's door - A. Yes, there was a great knocking.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did that knocking last before Mr. Phillips opened the window - A. I should imagine near five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the noise considerable - A. The noise was very great, there were people from two dozen houses off they had carelessly put on their clothes and come there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the noise in your judgement loud enough to wake the soundest sleeper before Mr. Phillips came - A. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you yourself any knowledge whatever by what means the fire took place - A. I could partly guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Could it have taken place at your house - A. No, it could have not.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL NATHAN. Q. You are in the service of Mr. Cohen - A. I was then, I slept underneath the counter in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master awake you - A. Yes; I opened the door, and went into the street. Mr. Cohen and me went out together; Mr. Cohen gave the alarm to the watchmen; the watchman came in and endeavoured to put the fire out; I saw Mr. Cohen go first to Mr. Phillips's back door and call Mr. Phillips, he had no answer, he went to the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did other people join in making a noise at the front door - A. Yes. The rattle sprang first.</p>
               <p>Q. At last did Phillips speak at the window - A. Yes, he opened the window and put his head out, he had no coat on, he had something dark about his body like a waistcoat, and a handkerchief round his neck, he asked what was the matter; some of the men made answer, come down, your house is a fire; he directly replied he could not come down for the smoke without going back to look, I went in doors.</p>
               <p>Q. After that the people broke the door open and got in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the people got in did you see Mr. Phillips in his shop - A. I did not. I was taking some things out of my master's house, I afterwards saw Mrs. Phillips bring a large bundle over to Mrs. Hamert's, I looked inside of it, it did not look like things gathered together in a hurry; they were wrapped up quite smooth as far as I could see.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the fire take place in your master's house - A. No, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What time did you go to to bed - A. Between ten and eleven; I am sure it was before eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a candle to go to bed - A. Yes, but Mr. Cohen always fetched it down himself. There was nothing of Mr. Cohen's moved until we were alarmed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The fire was in the back part of the house - A. Yes.</p>

I ran in and found the fire in Mr. Cohen's passage, coming out of Mr. Phillips's place, underneath the skirting board; I told him to fetch me some water, I throwed it along the skirting board to damp the fire; I made a hole with my cutlass, told him to fetch me another; I kicked it with my foot, and got more water, I threw three or four pales into the hole.</p>

            . I am a watchman, my beat is a short distance from the prisoner's house, I heard a rattle spring, and the alarm of fire. I ran to the engine house and got the engine. The engine house in one hundred yards or better from the prisoner's house. I assisted in bringing the engine.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came with the engine was the prisoners house open - A. It was not. There was about five or six people assembled; the first person that I saw was the officer of the night, he and I rapped at the door, he with his staff, and I with my large stick that I carry every night, we got no answer. I called to Thomas to give me the crow out of the engine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the knocking loud enough to wake any person - A. Yes, except by reason of the smoke a person might sleep sounder.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you used a crow did any body break a pannel in - A. Yes, some person, but who it was I cannot tell. With the crow that I had in my hand I broke open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got in the shop did you see the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180063"/>prisoner - A. I did not: It was two or three minutes after I was in the house, I went to the fire; the first thing when I got into the shop I could see it; the fire was in the back parlour, it seemed to me as if it was burning from the skirting board all the way up to the ceiling; with the crow I strove to knock part of it down, and after I found two butts of water in Mr. Phillips's cellar.

             asked him why he did not come sooner; he said he could not get down sooner, there was so much smoke.</p>
               <p>JOHN BATTERSBY. I am an oil and colourman, my house is directly opposite of the prisoners. The moment I heard the alarm of fire I came down in my shirt, and the first person that I saw in the street was Mr. Cohen in his shirt. I took some things of his to save.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time were there any people in the street - A. I do not think there were, except the watchmen, they were knocking at the prisoner's door, and the rattles were springing in the street,</p>
               <p>Q. You I believe returned to your wife to make her hear - A. I did; the knocking continued till I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the knocking continue - A. From five to ten minutes. I could not say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you from the noise that was made, and the calling and the springing of the rattles was it possible that they must be awake - A. I think they must; I was awake before that by the noise, at last he opened the one pair of stairs window; his first words were, what was the matter; the people said, come down, your house is a fire; he said I cannot for the smoke, he gave that answer directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did the smoke issue out of the window - A. There was smoke in the room, it was not so much smoke as that. The watchmen were endeavouring to get the door open, a crow was obtained, and the door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after the door had been opened and the watchmen entered did you see the prisoner - A. A short time, I stood near; it could not exceed three minutes the outside; he was dressed completely; I saw nothing wanting. I was present when Mr. Cohen asked him who put the turpentine chips where the fire had been; he replied, you must have put them there, you know you have lighted coals and shavings in your coal-hole. I directly got a candle and went and searched the coal-hole. I found nothing of the kind.</p>

            . I am a fireman of the Phoenix fire-office.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time did you come to this fire - A. About half an hour after it. About two hours afterwards I searched, and found a piece of a towel among the rubbish between the skirting boards, it appeared to have been a towel, because it had a piece of tape to it; I asked Mr. Phillips if it belonged to him; he told me no. I then said, Mr. Cohen does this towel belong to you; he said, let me look; I gave it into his hand, he said it is canvas, I do not keep any canvas towels in my house. I found it within the skirting board that was loose when I came there, and the hole open. It burnt all the way up on Phillips's side. I did not go into the other house. It was all open when I went in; the edges of the rafters had been on fire right up.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me whether the fire had come out of the floor of that room - A. Yes, I dare say a foot or ten inches. This is the skirting board. This is the inside of it.</p>
               <p>Q. I observed the inside is all burnt and charred - A. It is so.</p>
               <p>Q. If the skirting board had remained in its place could the floor have been burnt without that being burnt through - A. I do not think it could, it must have been pulled out at this end.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been out at least a foot at the time of the fire, or else it must have burnt the board through - A. I should think so.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Harmer. I believe you attended the examination of the prisoner - A. I saw him before the examination at his house; he admitted that the towel that had been found was his, that it had been hanging on a chair, or a table in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state were the boards in - A. They were hot, and a deal of steam came from them when I took them up.</p>

A little after twelve o'clock I was awoke by hearing a great noise in the neighbourhood, I immediately<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181109180064"/>leaped out of bed and ran to the window; I saw a few people collected at Mr. Phillips's house nearly opposite of me, I called out to know what was the matter, the watchman answered me the house was on fire; I told the watchman to go down the street to spring his rattle and alarm the neighbourhood. I went over as soon as I had dressed myself in a hurry, I went over, the door had been broken open, the engine had arrived; the first person I saw was Mr. Fletcher in the shop, and within half a minute I saw the prisoner, he and his wife appeared to be dressed, the fire was burning rather smartly.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was it extinguished - A. Perhaps in ten minutes, and after the fire was extinguished by the exertions of Mr. Fletcher, myself and others that assisted, it certainly struck me that it was not an accident I thought so then, I think so now, I expressed myself so then. The prisoner was a dealer in potatoes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the stock he had and the household furniture - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgement what was the utmost value of all the property in the house - A. Not more than thirty pounds; I saw but one bed, there were three or four chairs in the bed room, and two or three in the back parlour, the other rooms were empty.</p>

My wife awoke first, she awoke me, I opened the back window on the ground floor, I smelled fire, it was then near one o'clock; my bed being backwards is against the private passage in the prisoner's house, I heard Mr. Phillips's voice, he was walking on the same floor, that is the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any other person walking besides himself - A. I did not pay any attention, I heard him, I am quite sure of that, he appeared to me to be in the parlour behind the shop; I heard him about three minutes after I was alarmed.</p>

            . I am headborough of the Parish. At the alarm of fire I went and broke open the pannel of the prisoner's door.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the house did you see the prisoner - A. I saw him before I went in the house, I saw Mr. Cohen's people carrying goods over at that time, both parties were strangers to me; I ran to the first man on the opposite side of the way; I asked him what he was about, he said the next house was on fire. I said it was a surprizing thing to me, that his house should be on fire and your goods almost out. As I went over the prisoner opened the window, and said, for God's sake save my life and my wife and children, I am almost choaked with smoke; he was in his shirt. I could not see any more than his arms, head and shoulders.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people there at that time - A. No more than Cohen's people, and a sailor that I could observe.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why the watchman was there, was not he - A. No. I said my friend, there is no ladder to be got now, if there is any thing that you have in the house that is not on fire. I mentioned beds, blankets; I said there were two of us, and by the help of God I would save their children, I waited for a minute or two, but seeing nothing throwed out of the window I broke the pannel of the door, in about ten or eleven minutes the engine came; Bland called for the crow, forced the door in. Bland, Clew, the beadle and the sailor went in, and after I had taken the door away I ran for the water, I saw the prisoner after the fire was over, he had his clothes on then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then the prisoner threw up the window, and called for you to assist, ten minutes before the engine came up - A. Yes, or more.</p>
               <p>Q. Might it not be a quarter of an hour before the engine came - A. I cannot be sure, it might be minute over or under.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the engine there before you broke open the door - A. The engine was not there two minutes before the door was thrown in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then as long as a quarter of an hour before the engine came, the prisoner knew the house was on fire A. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BROWN. I am a labourer in the rope ground, I arrived between twelve and one at the fire, I saw the door broken open, Mr. Phillips looked out of the window, with a white shirt on.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Did not the engine come directly after he spoke to you - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor laid down and took his watch out; I said, you give it me, you are not able to take care of it: Pritchard asked me to give it him; I said I would not. Then they asked me to give it the landlord. The headborough shoved me, he said you rascal, where is the man's watch, so he took it out of my pocket.</p>

            , in the New-road. On the 28th of July, about six o'clock, a little girl gave me information, I saw the prisoner go up the area steps, I called out stop him; I pursued him, he was stopped about six yards from my master's house, he had the things with him at the time, and brought them all back to the door; upon examining it, it was all the articles mentioned in the indictment. I went into the kitchen and saw they all had been taken out of the drawer. I had seen them all in the drawer at four o'clock. The prisoner said I had got all the things again, I might as well let him go.</p>
               <p>- WHITEHAIR. I am a constable. I took charge of the prisoner; he said two gentlemen coming by, they said, if he would go down into the gentleman's house and bring the things up they would give him half a crown.</p>

I am a Bow-street patrol On Saturday, about nine o'clock in the evening, I stopped the prisoner in Penton-street, Pentonville; he had this lead tied up in a handkerchief on his shoulder; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he was going to meet his master at Aldgate to do a job there; I took him back, and sent for his master; his master denied it; I asked him if he had got any more; he said no; I searched his waistcoat pocket, and found this folder.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner in Swan-street, a few yards from the prosecutor's house about three o'clock in the morning, I asked him who the board belonged to, he was returning with it, I thought he had stolen it; he said it belonged to his brother. I asked him again afterwards, he said two men had given it him, he was to carry it to a certain place, they would pay him for his trouble.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw the board safe in my yard on the Saturday night. On Monday morning, at three o'clock, I was called up by the watchman, he had she prisoner in custody, and the board. This is the mahogany board, it is mine.</p>

               <p>- SPENCER. I am a constable in Tottenham. I was directed by Mr. Isaacs to watch his stable. I put myself in a place to observe without being seen, the first hat I observed was Kelly's boy bringing the horse and cart into the Roebuck yard, the horse and cart was put under the shed; a little white afterwards the prisoner Kelly came.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in the cart - A. Rags and baskets of iron. When the prisoner came he took the baskets out, and cleared the corner of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cart and horse from Mr. Isaacs stable. - A. About three or four yards. After he had cleared the cart I saw Beadle the horse-keeper bring corn in a sack, and he put it in the cart, Kelly was then standing in the hind part of the cart; after the sack was put in the cart Kelly then got in the cart and covered it up with some things over the sack containing the corn.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know at that time that the sack contained corn - A.No, he covered it over with rags so as to conceal it, he then backed the cart out and got into the street; I went after him and came up to the cart about ten yards from the Roebuck yard, I told him he was my prisoner, I took him for receiving corn belonging to Mr. Isaacs; he said he did not know that there was any corn in his cart. I took out the corn and the sack before his face.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find it covered with rags - A Yes, it was. I took out the sack, it contained oats, more than a bushel. I saw the direction on the cart,

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Isaacs see the oats afterwards - A. Yes. The sack did not belong to Mr. Isaacs.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the sack of oats come out of Mr. Isaacs' stable - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Beadle - A. Yes, he was tried and convicted here. I have know him this twenty years, he is a labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a man able to buy corn, is he - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Beadle say for himself in the presence of Kelly - A. His master wished me to let him alone till he had done his work. I let him alone till he had done his work. The corn is here in the sack.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you lose a watch at any time - A. On the 2d of August, after I had gone to dinner, I took my watch out of my waistcoat pocket to see if it was time to go to work, it was time to go to work; there was nobody was there but Smith, he worked in the same yard that I worked. I put the watch into my pocket again and went to work I pulled my jacket off and hung it up in the shop, the watch was then in my jacket pocket. It was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this shop - A. About six doors from the Bluecoat Boy.</p>
               <p>Q.Did the prisoner see that you had a watch - A. Yes; there was no other person with me but him and his mate; his mate's name is Waitford, he is not here. The prisoner saw me pull it out in the public-house; it was safe in my jacket pocket when I hung it up in the shop. In about half an hour afterwards they came to work in the adjoining yard. After they came back Smith came to the partition that parts the two yards and asked me to go and take take some gin; I went. I was not absent more than five minutes; the prisoner and his mate staid with me all the time I was in the public-house; I went to my work, and they went to their work; immediately I returned I went for my watch, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. They were with you, what possibility had he of taking it, he did not come into the shop, he asked you outside of the partition, and from the time that you left the shop he was with you, he could not be the stealer - A. No, he could not. I suspected no man but Smith and his mate, and the watch was found upon Smith.</p>
               <p>- COOK. This is the watch.</p>

When I came up to her I said, you strumpet how dare you to strip a child in the road. I took the bonnet immediately out of her hand. The prisoner said nothing but came back along with me.

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, about five o'clock, I saw the two prisoners, they were both together, they were coming across a field from the New-road. They had each a bundle, I stopped them; I asked them what they had got, they did not answer me; I took them in custody. The bundles each contained a goose and two ducks. I found out Mr. Ford had lost them; he described them before he saw them, and the marks corresponded exactly.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I have nobody here to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Martin's Defence. I was not guilty of the robbery at all; this man said he would satisfy me for carrying the bundle. I told the constable I did not know what was in the bundle.</p>

            . I am a constable of St Pancras parish. On Wednesday the 28th of August, between four and five in the morning, I saw the prisoner, he was in the fields in the path leading from Mr. Buckingham's premises; I left him at that time, and went after some other person that I was in pursuit of. I saw him again in the New-road, he came out of a field, he was tyeing the line up. I went up to him, I told him he was my prisoner; he said he was going to take it to his master in the Borough I took him to the watchhouse and searched him, I found this piece of line in his waistcoat pocket. The servant of Mr. Buckingham came and owned the line. I knew the person of the prisoner before.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I apprehended the prisoner. About nine o'clock on Friday morning, the 26th of July, I received information that a person was shewing tea that had spoons about her; I went to the public-house and saw her there. I saw a large paper parcel of tea upon the tap room table, I went to search her, and she pulled the spoons out of her pocket; she said they were her own, she had had them fourteen years. I took her in custody, and Lawrence came and claimed the spoons.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember a woman of the name of Williams and a woman of the name of Stevens coming to your house on the 22d of August last - A. I do, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, Sarah Stevens came for a quartern of gin, it came to fourpence, she offered me a sixpence; I told her it was a bad one, I kept the sixpence and gave it Kennersley, the officer. Williams came up at the same time and offered another sixpence o pay for the same gin. I told her that was a bad one also, I would have them taken up for smashers. They told me they took it of a woman that sat in the passage of my public-house; I sent for an officer. Tremer the officer came, and the woman slipped off the bench, I saw her hand go from her bosom, as if she was parting with something, I held the candle under the bench, there I saw a little bag, with four sixpences of the same shake, with some shot. I sent her over to the watchhouse. I afterwards looked in the same place were I found the bag; I found a shilling. The canvas bag was warm, as if it had been in some person's bosom.</p>

The prisoner asked me to give her a drink of beer. I did so, she then said for my good nature she would give the some money to fetch a quartern of gin, she put her hand in her bosom and gave me a sixpence out of the bag, I went to the bar for a quartern of gin, I gave him that same sixpence that I received of the prisoner for a quarter of gin; I had no other, nothing but a few penny-pieces. Mr. Osborne objected to it, and kept it.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been but two months out of my own country, and have been out of bed five weeks with this baby; I was put to bed on the road, I was coming to my husband. I sold my shift the last thing for a shilling; I changed that shilling I got two pennyworth of shop, and a pennyworth of bread; I had only then a sixpence and three penny-pieces in my pocket; I was going to Gravesend to my husband. Coming along the road I met with this woman, she said if I was to go to St. Giles's I might find some of my country people who would give me a lodging; she said come along with me; I was fatigued and weak, I could not walk. It was twelve o'clock, she took me to this public-house, she said, we can rest here and have part of a pint of beer; I sat down, this woman went for the pint of beer, I gave her sixpence; the other woman said, had we nor better have a drop of gin; I said, I do not mind.

I had but one shilling; he said never mind, give me that; he said I shall not go into that house so long as I live; he wanted me to go to Snow Hill; I said I shall not go there; he tried to snatch the note out of my hand; I said no, my friend, you shall not have the note any more you may depend upon it; Mr. Williams stood at the door; I asked him to look at the note; Mr. Williams said it was a bad one; the moment I asked Mr. Williams to look at it the prisoner started away; I pursued him and caught him by the corner of the Bluecoat school; charged the prisoner with a constable, and he was taken to Guildhall; he first said, he did not know where he got the note, and afterwards he said Long Jack gave him the note to go, and buy that horse as cheap as he could.

I went and cheapened the horse, he asked five pound, I said that is too much, if you will give me three shillings out of it I will have it; I gave him the note; I told him to tie the horse to the post, and we went down to the cooking house, I said I will not go in here, we had a few words the other day when I bought a horse and cart; I said I will go in here, he would not, and we returned in the market; he shewed the note, and the gentleman said it was a bad one, I knew who I took it of, I ran after the man that gave it me, and my prosecutor ran after me, and took me.</p>

            . On the 17th of August the prisoner came and asked for a leg of mutton for Messrs. Simper and Parry, they keep the Woolpack, St. Peter's alley, I said, you are sure you are right; he said he was; I asked him who sent him for it; he said the man with one eye. I then desired my man to give him the largest one I had. I immediately said to my lad, it is something singular his asking for a leg of mutton for Mr. Simper, he refused having one in the morning; I desired the lad to run after him and to see if he carried it safe. I was sent for in a few minutes afterwards to Messrs. Simper and Parry's On my appearing the prisoner fell on his knees, acknowledged his offence, and begged for mercy.</p>
