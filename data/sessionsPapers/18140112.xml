               <p>Q. What were the value of them - A. Seventy pounds both. On the 17th I learned two were missing; on the Tuesday following, I received some information from Cambridge of the two bay horses; on the Wednesday, I went to Cambridge; I found my horses; they were brought and delivered back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these two geldings that were delivered to you at Cambridge the two geldings you missed - A. They were.</p>

               <p>Q. Were the horses all safe then - A. I did not tell them then. I told them on Monday; they were safe then.</p>
               <p>Q. On Tuesday did any thing strike you as wrong - A. No. The gate was shut, a lashing stick was drawed through the staple, and nailed each side of the stick, the gate was fast; on Tuesday morning the horses appeared to be there; I did not count them. On Wednesday, first of all, I looked round the field to see whether the horses were there or not; the horses were all gone, and the gate was open.</p>
               <p>Q. How did it appear to you that the gate had been opened - A. The gate could not have been opened without the stick had been broken out; the stick had been fastened with a nail each side. I went all round the field; I could not trace how they got out any where, but at the gateway; it being wet and dirty, there were the marks of their feet at the gateway. I found ten horses in the Edgware-road, in a field about half a mile off; the two geldings I could not find; they were two of the twelve.</p>

I exchanged a horse of mine for the bay gelding, and I gave a one-pound note, and a shilling to boot; my man took the gelding home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards propose to you to buy another horse - A. I told him I could not buy it; I had got another, I would exchange with him for it. We exchanged for that, and I gave him five golden guineas, and another horse in exchange for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine these two bay geldings more particularly after you had exchanged - A. I did, after they were cleaned I found them much better horses than those I had exchanged them for; upon that I went in search of the prisoner; I found him at the White Horse, and the younger prisoner at the Bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them did you find first - A. The eldest. I found out the youngest at the Bell in Northampton-street; something a friend of mine said to me induced me to think there was another. When I saw the young one, I asked him whether he was waiting for a young man of the name of Loakes; he said he was. I then told him, I had exchanged some horses with him, and I thought they were stolen. The young one went with me to the White Horse, there we found the elder; I told the elder that I had strong suspicion the horses were stolen horses. He gave me the name of

Yes, I was in the parlour; I heard the shop door open; I said to the little boy, Charles, what is that; we went into shop, and saw the shop door open; we looked up for the hind quarter of mutton, it hung at the further part of the shop; we missed the hind quarter of mutton. I went to the door; I saw the prisoner just going off the step of the door, with the hind quarter of mutton under his arm; I took it from him. I said, what a shame to rob a poor widow woman with four children. I delivered him to Oram, the patrol. I can swear to the mutton being Mrs. Matthews's property. I had seen the mutton hanging up in the shop not ten minutes before, the fellow to it was hanging up; I matched it afterwards, the other hind quarter fitted it exactly.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came up from Deptford that evening, we went to a public-house, and agreed to have a leg of mutton for supper, they gave me the money to buy it; I bought a quarter of mutton in Clare-market; after paying for the mutton in Clare-market, coming along Vine-street I saw a butcher's shop, I said, I will go and buy a sheep's head, and have it for supper with the loin; as I came to the step of the door a man came to me, he said, halloo, what do you do with this quarter of mutton; I said I bought it in Clare-market. He called out two or three times at Mrs. Matthews's shop before any body answered; he asked if they had lost any mutton; this woman came to the step of the door, she said, she would look. She looked all round the place, and said, you had better take him in custody until Mrs. Matthews came home. I paid thirteen shillings for the quarter of mutton in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Andrews. Had any body got hold of him when you went out - A. I do not know; there was a crowd collected. He then did not say he had bought it in Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. to Oram. Did the prisoner say he had bought it in Clare-market - A. No. He appeared to be an ideot.</p>

               <p>Q. What watch was this - A. A silver watch. I called the prisoner down stairs; her mother said, Nancy, your mistress wants you; I went up to her. I asked her to be so good as to tell me where my watch was, it was my husband's watch; I told her my buffett was broken open. I could get no redress at all; I came down stairs, and sat content until the watchman came; the watchman went in, took her, and out her in the watchhouse. The next morning I went upto the pawnbrokers and saw my watch.</p>
               <p>JAMES - . I live with Mr. Watts, pawnbroker, East Smithfield. On the 30th of December, in the evening, the prisoner pawned this watch with me for twenty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That is my watch; I missed it out of my buffett.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you tell me to pawn the watch to get some money to pay the two carpenters that came into the room to mend your buffett -</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She gave me the watch to pawn, and had three quarterns of rum for the two carpenters. I pawned the watch by her order.</p>
               <p>GUILTY, aged 28.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any property in your house in December last - A. Yes, I had five one-pound notes in my chest; I had put them by to pay my rent. I saw them in my chest about a fortnight before I missed them. I locked them up in my chest, and kept the key in my pocket. I missed them on the 8th of December. I saw my chest was broken open. I asked my wife if she had broken it open; she denied it. The prisoner came in and said, your wife did not break it open. I asked the prisoner if she broke it open for her. My wife said, I left nobody else but you here on Friday when I went out. I then said to the prisoner, I will make you suffer for it. The prisoner called me up into her room, and acknowledged that she had changed one of the pound notes; in about an hour after she acknowledged that she had changed two of them. On the next morning I had her taken up to the magistrate. She acknowledged that she exchanged two one-pound notes. This is a chisel that I lent to the prisoner's husband; I never saw it after until I saw it in my chest. The prisoner borrowed it of my wife for her husband's use.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I changed a one-pound note for his wife to get some things out of pawn for her.</p>

I have not found any of my money.</p>

My boy went down the gateway two doors beyond my house, he there saw the prisoner;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120006"/>he brought her into the shop. The prisoner stood with her back to the counter, near to where the stockings had been taken and before the officer came I saw the prisoner place one pair of stockings upon the counter; I immediately put my hand upon them, they were quite warm. I opened them; they were dirty as if they had fallen in the street; that was a pair of cotton stockings. The officer came, and searched the prisoner; he found nothing more upon her.</p>

On the 9th of December, I came into the shop before the prisoner went out, and directly she went out I ran after her; I found her up the gateway with a pair of stockings in her hand. I asked her where the stockings was; she seemed flurried, and did not answer; at last she said the other girl had got them. I brought her back to my master's shop; I went for an officer.</p>

Yes, on the 17th of December, about six o'clock, I saw two boys, they were in the act of drawing ribbon out through the screw holes of his shop window; I could not see which of them did it. I opened my door and run after them; I took one of them, that was the prisoner; he was never out of my sight. I found nothing upon him.</p>

            . I gave Mr. Grafton an alarm about six o'clock in the evening, I had occasion to call upon Mr. Wood; about twenty yards before I got to Mr. Wood's door, I saw the prisoner standing at Mr. Grafton's window; I stopped and looked; the two boys turned round and looked at me. I went into Mr. Wood's and communicated my suspicion to him; we shut the door, and looked through the glass window, we observed the boys drawing something through the bolt hole in the window; the boys ran away immediately before I opened Mr. Wood's door. Mr. Wood pursued them; I went over to Mr. Grafton.</p>

I asked her what she gave a pound for it; she said, fifteen pence. I gave the loaf of sugar into Mr. Turnbridge's hands, he is the officer of the parish, and the next evening we went in pursuit of the man. We found him behind the Back-lane, in Thomas-street. Mr. Turnbridge went to the door, and asked if such a man lived there; they said he did, he was not within, and then I saw the prisoner coming along within four houses of his own door. I asked him if he lived at that door where the light was; he denied it. I took him to the door where the light was; the woman of the house said here is Mr. Shade. He took his key from his pocket, and unlocked his room door, which is the lower room. The officer searched the room, and found nothing. He made his escape while we were searching the room. I pursued him and brought him back; we then took him to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I got this iron pot and feather bed out of Rochester's house on Saturday evening last. I found the feather bed enclosed in a blanket to make a pillow of; it was on the bed on which Rochester slept. I found the pot in the same house, but not in the same room; it was in Rochester's part of the house. I asked the prisoner where he got the feather bed; he said it was a bed that his wife's father gave him seven years ago. He said he found the pot in a ditch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found the pot. My wife's father gave her the bed when he went in the workhouse. He has lost the use of his limbs; he cannot get across the place without being carried.</p>

On the 13th of December I was informed that there was this sheeting concealed on the stairs at two o'clock; when the man shewed it me I desired him to replace it where he took it from. In the course of half an hour after he replaced it the workmen were going to their tea; I heard a step up this landing; I was in the cellar. I came from there, and saw the prisoner walking from the passage into the yard. I saw he had something in his apron; I asked him what he had; he said, some linen. I saw the linen; it is the property of Messrs. Wilkinson, Baker, and Fisher. I know the linen by the mark; it is a remnant of Irish sheeting. I always thought the prisoner to be a good boy.</p>

On the 8th of November last, the prisoner came into my shop; he asked to look at a watch, stating that he had seen it in the front sash. I took it out; he said he must have a chain with it. It was a silver hunting watch, a gold chain, and he chosed three seals. I put them all together, set the watch right; we could not agree about the key; I gave him a gilt key to wind the watch until I got the gold key made. He said he had not the money for it in his pocket; he said if you will send it to No. 4, Southampton-row, I will send the money by the bearer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any name - A. He did not. He was dressed in a middling way. I called my young man. The prisoner went out of the house. I said to my young man, John, follow the gentleman immediately, and remember you do not leave the goods without the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive from your boy any note - A. I went to the house myself to No. 4, Southampton-row; I found a check upon the banker, I think Hammersley and Co. Pall Mall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with that check to the bankers - A. I did not. I sent a friend just to enquire a day or two after; he is not here.</p>

I refused the check. I put the watch, chain, and seals, in my pocket. After I had gone out he called me back, and requested I would let let him shew the watch to his father. I came back.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back where was he - A. In the passage then. He said, give me back the watch, chain, and seals, to let my father see it; we both then went into the parlour. I waited about ten minutes, and rung the parlour bell; I found he was gone out of the house. I never took the check; I left it on the table, and was going home with the watch. I thought I would go home; I sent for my master; he came.</p>

Two days after that I met him in the Park; I told him the manner he had treated my young man, the check was not paid; it is drawn upon Drummond. The prisoner gave me the watch, chain, seals, and key, and begged I would take no further notice of it, he would come the next day, and bring me the money. That was the 21st of November. This is the watch, chain, seals, and key.</p>

My intention was to have paid him, but I was not able to pay at that time.</p>

I did; I have not a doubt but this chisel forced the door open; there were marks on the door and the post that just fitted this chisel. This is the chisel I found in the prisoner's pocket; the prisoner and me had a struggle before I could get the chisel from her.</p>

I saw the carpetting at Bow-street office; I know the carpetting to be the prosecutors property. I had occasion to cut off six yards from the pi and the three yards that was left.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. I am foreman in the Strand. On Saturday, the 18th of December, the prisoner stopped at the door, which attracted my attention; asked I would purchase a calf skin, which the habit of doing; he took it out of a piece of brown holland, and then I saw it was a piece of carpetting by his hesitation I was induced to think it was purloined. I taxed him with it; he said, he had purloined it; he told me freely. I said, I am sure you never came by this honestly, where did you get this; he said, that was nothing to me. I then said to him, I conjecture you are an upholsters porter, that he had been laying it down at some house and this was a remnant; he said, it was. I said, who is your master; he said, that was nothing to me. I insisted upon knowing, or he should not have the property. He said, he was an upholsterer in the City. He had a small bit of paper in his hand which led me to the knowledge of Messrs. Broom and Harris. On Sunday morning I went to Mr. Schofield; I asked him where he purchased the rug; he told me of Messrs. Broom and Harris; I went to Messrs. Broom and Harris; I saw their foreman; I asked him if they had such a man; he said, they had. I asked him if they had missed any thing; he said, I could not tell. This is the capetting the prisoner offered me for sale, and the carpet he admitted he had stolen.</p>

On the 7th of December, I lost a quantity of metal; I had previously marked it; on the 7th of December, I discovered an ingot of brass was taken from the bin or box, where it was kept; I determined on searching the men when they came down to go out to dinner. I stopped a number, and desired them to walk into the parlour; I robbed down one of the men, and afterwards the prisoner, and in his breeches pocket I found the two ingots of brass. These are the pieces of brass; they are my property; I had marked them a month before I found them on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN CALLEB. I am a brass-founder. I saw master rub the prisoner down; he told him to take the brass out of his pocket; the prisoner took out two pieces of brass, one from each breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Mr. Thurkle's foreman; I asked him for six sets of heutenants furniture; he gave mo the keys to go and fetch them; I took the brass out of the shop; the men were coming down stairs, I was obliged to get out of the way to let the men pass, master was ordering the men into the parlour. I put the things in my pocket; I did not mean to take them out of the shop.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am a boot-maker, I live at No. 24, Duke-street, West Smithfield. On Friday the 3rd of December, a waggon stopped opposite my shop window, and in the waggon the prisoner was sitting; the man that was driving it went into a public-house facing of our house, and while the waggoner was gone into the public-house the prisoner employed himself in untying a flat of butter, and out of that flat he took a lump of butter and placed the lump of butter in an empty one that was standing endways upwards; he then tied the flat that he had taken the lump of butter out, and threw it in a careless manner to the other side of the waggon, as though he was about his business. By this time the waggoner that went into the public-house came out, and brought half a pint of purl or beer to the prisoner; he drank it, and gave the waggoner the money to pay for it, and while the waggoner was gone to the public-house the second time, the prisoner took his handkerchief out of his pocket, as if to wipe his nose, instead of that he took up the lump of butter he had throwed into the empty flat, tied it up, and put it into his pocket; the waggoner then moved the waggon; they went on towards Smithfield. I saw two officer; I told them to follow me.</p>

About six o'clock on the 17th of December, I was at the watch-house, a man came to me, and said there was a man at the Blue Boar public-house Rosemary-lane, with a pot in his pocket that belonged to the Green Dragon Bishopsgate-street. I went to the prisoner; I asked him how he came by the pot; he said he knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120013"/>nothing about it. I got him as far as the watch-house; he was very much in liquor. I left him in charge of another while I went and informed Mrs. Redfearn. I only found one pot, that was in his hat.</p>

             when she was brought to the Hospital; she had a small wound upon the head bleeding; I think she was brought there on the 14th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that that wound was dangerous at first - A. Not in the least; it afterwards assumed an alarming appearance by assuming another disease, an erysipelas produced inflammation of the brain, and the inflammation death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the erysipelas produced by the wound - A. I cannot say that; she was attended skilfully by other surgeons of more skill than me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120015"/>Q. Was the erysipelas in the wound - A. Yes, and it affected her arms. It spread from the wound to other parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it would have been at other parts of the body, but from its origin in the wound - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any erysipelas there before the wound - A. I rather think not. I think the wound was the acting cause of the erysipelas.</p>

               <p>Q. When you saw the erysipelas in the wound, and saw it spreading over other parts of the body, did you, as a rational man, think it proceeded from the wound - A. Yes, I rather think it produced from the wound, but there are causes which it might produce besides wounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She and I had been together a month or six weeks, or better. We had been drinking together several times; she was passionate and abusive; she abused me much that morning. The drink rather took effect of me. When she spilled my beer I went from her and touched another pint pot. I am very sorry I happened to do such a thing. I never intended to do any such thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was up last on the 3rd of December - A. I was up last; about eleven I went to bed. I examined the house to see whether the doors and windows were fast; they were all fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came down first in the morning - A. The prisoner; he lodged with me at that time; he went down to go to his master's work.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was in your house that night - A. Yes; he went to bed and came down first in the morning. On the 13th of November twelvemonth, his master came to me and engaged to rent a stable of me; he introduced four horses to his stable, and once or twice he changed his carter; at last the prisoner was his carter.</p>
               <p>Q. He lodged in your house on the night in question - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The doors and windows were all fastened - A. Yes. When he came down he knocked at my bedroom door, and asked me for the key of the stair-case door; I gave it him. In consequence of my having suspicion, and I had been frequently robbed since he had been in the house; I followed him down; when I came to the stair case door, the key that I had given to him to open the stair-case door he had kept to let himself into the larder, which larder is part of my dwelling-house, all under the same roof. I found in the larder he had helped himself to a slice of cheese, which he had cut off and laid on his smock frock, on the ground. The cheese weighed about eleven pounds, or better. He was in the act of turning to help himself to another piece; or something else. This was about five o'clock in the morning, three hours before day light nearly, within a few minutes. I then tried to lock him in the larder by way of security. I found the key in the door, and with my turning I could not make the key set upon the lock. I told him to go and do his horses, or what be pleased, he should not go out. I secured him in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You found him in the larder, and you secured him at five o'clock in the morning - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the cheese - A. I valued it at three pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your larder locked the over night - A. I am positive of that myself, my wife locked it. At eight o'clock the prisoner made his escape out of the yard by getting over a coal shed. We then traced him to Putney Heath; we found him at a public-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

The patrol took that part of the sheep down to where the other part was; that part was compared with the other part, it appeared to be the same sheep; the parts corresponded; the hind quarters corresponded with the fore quarters left on the skin.

               <p>Q. What did you say to him - A. I said, you have got something that does not belong to you; he said he had got some mutton that his brother had given him; he had killed a sheep.

I and the constable of the night searched him; we found a knife upon him; his pockets were filled with horse hair and cow hair</p>

            . I am patrol of Islington. I saw the prisoner in the watchhouse, and the hind parts of a sheep laying on the table. I saw the horse hair taken from him. I went with my brother patrol to about Highbury-barn; I knew the prisoner must have come that way by the way where he was taken. When we got to Mr. Hopkinson's farm we met a person belonging to it, the bailiff; we asked him whether there was any sheep on or about that part. We made search there; we found the sheep wild there, in two meadows; there was one sheep running about; we went to one part of the field; we found a dissected skin and entrails put into the ditch, covered over with roots of grass. We took it with us to Mr. Hopkinson. When we found the skin we did not find the fore part of the mutton. This was the dissected skin, belonging to the hind part. We returned again to the field; in the centre of that field there had been a pond, under a knapsack laid the head, and a little distance from the head laid the bladder and gall, and a little distance was some blood, as if the sheep had been killed there. We went to another part of the field; we found the fore part of the sheep with the skin on. We then went to Mr. Hopkinson, and took the whole together. I put the parts together. I am a butcher. I had not a shadow of a doubt when they were compared together but what they belonged to the carcase of a sheep.</p>

We found the head and skin and neck and breast also; We found them near a brook which runs through that field, where the sheep had been skinned; it laid apparently where the sheep had been killed; the entrails and blood laid there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner's house on Sunday morning - A. There was snow upon the ground; there was a track of a shoe upon it; I thought I knew it by having the shoes to mend at the shop before. I concluded it was the marks of

               <p>COURT. In your tracing these footstep, was it in the public-road - A. Yes, in the public-road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You thought you knew the foot from the appearance of nails in the shoe - A. Yes, and shoes. I had mended the prisoner's shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the nails in the heels - A. No; I mended the shoes; I thought it was the marks of the prisoner's shoes. I went to Read, the officer; he and I went again to the footsteps, and afterwards we went to the prisoner's house. We came to the prisoner's house about two o'clock on the Sunday. When I came there I saw the prisoner; we said we came to search for some mutton that was there; he said he had no mutton in the house. We were going to search in the cellar; the wife said they had got no mutton but what they got from Dorley. Dorley, that is the name of a farm at some distance. We searched the cupboard, and found some mutton. The cupboard was in the back room, over the fire place. We searched the cupboard; we found part of a loin cut up into steaks. From that we searched in the cellar; we found two legs, two shoulders, and a loin. They were in separate pieces, suspended with a string to a beam. The necks and breasts were left on the skin.</p>
               <p>COURT. Both breasts were remaining on the skin, were they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had the mutton the appearance as if cut up by a butcher - A. No, it is haggled; it had the appearance of having been cut up by some person not used to it.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep had you in the field - A. Forty-two on Saturday night, and the next morning forty-one; we lost one sheep. The skin was found in the same field where the sheep were in. The prisoner lived about a mile from me, from Uxbridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barry. There is a market there on Saturday - A. No, on Thursday.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the prisoner - A. The prisoner is a labourer.</p>
               <p>Q. Were all the sheep in the field your father's - A. No, only four of them; they were all under the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120017"/>care of Mr. Fowler, the shepherd. I can swear that the sheep that was lost was my father's sheep, because there was a mark of a W upon the skin.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the sheep in the field on Saturday - A. Yes, on Saturday the 8th, at four o'clock, I saw them; I had forty-two sheep under my care, four of them belonged to the prosecutor, he bought them of me.</p>
               <p>Q. After you found the head and skin were you able to say the sheep that was killed was Mr. Weedon's sheep - A. Yes, it was; I found the skin and the remainder part of the mutton. I was present when the mutton was found in the prisoner's house, we compared it to the other parts in the skin. We compared the shoulders; they seemed to fit very well according to the cutting them off; they were cut off very bad indeed, irregularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apply the parts so as to compare them, and they fitted, did they - A. I have no doubt but the parts found at the prisoner's house were cut off that sheep. I am sure that sheep was the one I sold to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You compared the fore quarters with the parts on the skin - A. Yes, and they fitted; we could not compare the hind quarters, they were cut from the loin; we could not compare the loin, they were cut in steaks, all in pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner - A. Yes. I sold the sheep in September to the prosecutor. The field is Mr. Boddy's field.</p>

            . I am a constable. About ten o'clock the prosecutor applied to me, I accompanied him into the field where the sheep had been slaughtered; I saw the blood on the snow where the sheep had been stuck. I afterwards accompanied the prosecutor's son to the prisoner's house; on my going into the house I told 
               <persName id="t18140112-33-person345">Jones</persName>
             I had suspicion there was mutton there; he told me there was none, I was welcome to search the house. I then asked him what place that was; he said it was the cellar. I said we will look in the cellar first; we opened the door to go down, Jones's wife hallooed out Jones, we have no mutton but what you got from Dorley; that is about three miles from the prisoner's house, a farm-house belonging to Mr. Hammond. I said, where was the mutton; he said, up stairs; that was after his wife said he had no mutton but what came from Dorley. I went up stairs, there were on two plates the fat caul and kidney fat of a sheep, and in another plate was part of a loin or loins, and two kidneys of a sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. To the parts of the sheep in the field were both kidneys gone - A. Yes. I said, is this the mutton. I thought the prisoner was upon the move, then I secured the prisoner. In searching the further part of the cupboard I found the middle of the loin of mutton covered over with a cloth in the same cupboard. I went into the cellar, it was dark; I got a candle; I found two legs and two shoulders suspended with pitchnettle string. On searching the prisoner I found some Pitchnettle string, pitchnettle is what they tie sacks with. The mutton was very badly butchered indeed, nor was the sheep skinned as a butcher would skin it; it was very badly skinned indeed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was the meat fresh - A. It was very fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge how long it had been killed - A. I should have thought recently by the appearance of the mutton. I went then and saw the skin of the beast, and the young lamb that was cut out of the sheep, with Fowler, the shepherd; I put my hand to the dug of the yew the dug was full of milk, as it was so near lambing. I compared the parts with what we brought from the field about the middle of the loin where it comes off the neck, it exactly tallied in thickness. In my own opinion they were the same parts of the same sheep, only seperated with the knife. The fat on the skin matched with the part in the leg; in the corresponding part of the leg I found a deficiency in fat, they fitted. There was part of the udder of the yew left in the skin; the udders were taken from both legs.</p>
               <p>Q. Do butchers commonly sell cauls - A. Not usually at one time, as we found; both kidneys had been taken from the sheep, and we found two kidneys.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

            . I live at No. 29, Little Earl-street, Seven Dials.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your shop the bottom of the house in which you live - A. Yes, and part of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 9th of January, had you fastened the door of your shop - A. Yes; I came down about five o'clock and found the door fast. Between ten and eleven I went to bed, and about one o'clock I was disturbed by my brother-in-law calling me; I went to the window and asked what was the matter; he said Mr. Rouche come down immediately, the shop is broken open. I came down, and found the shop was broken open, and the prisoner in the watchman and patrol's custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the goods that were found in the basket - A. Yes; I took them to the watchhouse just as they are. The basket is mine; there was some old bits of leather in it. The basket was emptied out, and he had packed up these old boots and shoes from various places in the shop where they were hanging; some were hanging very high. He had packed up thirteen pair of shoes, two pair of boots, and two bottles of blacking.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home; I found this place open as I came by; I could not get in my lodgings, so I went in there.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body with you - A. No one. I saw the prisoner and another man; at first of their meeting me they asked me if I was homeward bound; I told them I was. They passed on before me, and took no further notice. They came to a small turning, I passed them there; they followed me back again. They went on my left, and crossed me on the right; they went before me again. I passed them the second time; the prisoner crossed and passed between me and the wall, and took my watch from me; they turned down a street, I saw them turn down, I cried out stop thief. Then in a short time the prisoner was brought forward; I knew him to be the person that took my watch; he was taken to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. The watch was not found upon him, was it - A. No. I value the watch at one-pound.</p>
               <p>MR. WHEATLEY. I am constable of St. George's in the East. The prosecutor came to me at the watchhouse, and desired me to take the prisoner. On the evening stated in the indictment, I heard the cry of stop thief; the prisoner was taken immediately. Upon the prosecutor seeing the prisoner, the prosecutor said the prisoner was the man that robbed him. The prosecutor was a little fresh; he seemed positive he was the man, and there is no doubt but he was the man; I had my doubt in consequence of the fog. I searched the prisoner; I did not find the watch. The watch was produced to me the next morning; I received the watch of Mrs. Jackson. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch.</p>

Then she returned again, and said the watch was detained for five shillings; he gave her some silver; she went out, and returned with the watch; she then delivered the watch to the prisoner. The prisoner delivered the watch to me; I kept the watch, sent for Mr. Wheatley; when Mr. Wheatley came I asked Mr. Spencer if that was his watch; he said yes.

               <p>Q. What time of the night was it - A. I cannot tell, it was late. They told me they would put me in the way to London bridge; after they walked some way together, they asked me for something to drink for their trouble; they went into a house, and called for a drop of gin; I paid for the gin, and we came out of the house. We then came on perhaps ten yards, or not so much before I was knocked down, or pushed down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know by whom - A. No, I do not. As soon as I arose they went to lift me up; I said let me alone, and as soon as I came up I found my coat unbuttoned; I put my hand in my pocket, I found I was robbed; he women were present. I cried, out I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120019"/>am robbed; the officer came up immediately, he said who has robbed you; I said I had my money when these women came with me; I have not it now. The women began to start; the officer catched them. They took my pocket-book from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where it was when you first met these two women - A. No, I am quite a stranger in town.</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the watch for St. George's the Martyr. On the 1st of December, I was stationed in Gray's-inn-lane; at one o'clock I was in Fox's-court, and while I was there I heard a woman say, Charley, come here, here are two girls robbing a countryman. I followed to the spot; I found them in George's-court, Gray's-inn-lane. When I entered the court I met the two prisoners, but not knowing that these were the two women I did not stop them at that moment, because I did not know that they were the two. I went a little further down the court where I saw the man laying down, he was trying to get up, saying that he had been robbed. The girl that first of all spoke to me was standing by the prosecutor; she told me the two girls that I first met where the two girls that robbed the gentleman. I immediately went in search of the two prisoners, I overtook them in Brook-street; I knew both of them perfectly well. I stopped the prisoners; Cager and Belsover, my brother officers were with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure that the two persons that you saw coming out of George-court, are the same persons you overtook in Brook-street - A. Yes; I knew them both perfectly well. Upon Conway we found a pocket-book; upon Hill we found a receipt. We took them to the watchhouse, and near the watch-house Conway began to struggle; I told Belsover to take care of her; I knew she wanted to make away with the property; I saw she was wishing to make away with the property. I at last picked up some bank notes; I picked up four one-pound notes; I did not see them drop from her. I picked them up exactly at the spot where she was.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was with Hill in George's-court; I met the women in Fox-court coming from George-court; I knew the prisoners well. I am sure the persons we overtook in Brook-street, are the persons we saw coming out of Fox-court. I helped to search them; I found a pocketbook on the prisoner Conway; this is it. I found a receipt for a quarters rent, that is paid up to Lady Day for six pounds six shillings; upon the prisoner Hill I found that. Hill confessed to Read, the officer, and me, that Conway robbed the gentleman.</p>

I am not clear how much the pocket-book contained at that time. The receipt is mine: it was for a quarter's rent I had paid up to Lady Day. This receipt was in my pocketbook at the time. None of the five pound notes have been found, nor yet the two pound note. I received it the same day.</p>

               <p>Conway's Defence. I went home with my work at almost twelve o'clock as far as King-street, Seven Dials. This woman was with me; she kicked something with her foot; she picked it up, and gave it me. I put the pocket-book in my pocket; two men came up and demanded the notes and the pocketbook. As to the prosecutor, I never saw him until I saw him at Hatton Garden office.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body with you there - A. Yes, a corporal belonging to the same regiment. I went into the public-house at near eight at night. I left it at nine at night. I drank gin hot during the time I was there. I was perfectly as sober as I am now. There were several other persons in the house; there were two or three girls of the town in the house dancing with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes, he was there at that time; he continued there until half past ten. I went out at nine. I went home and returned again.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he there when you left the house - A. Yes, and when I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No, I never saw him before to my knowledge. li might be near ten o'clock when I returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the house when the prisoner left it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he leave you in the house - A. It might be a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, as near as I can guess. When I left it I proceeded home the second time. It was about a quarter before eleven. In my way home I proceeded through <placeName id="t18140112-37-crimeloc197">Tothill-street, Westminster</placeName>

As I was going up the street, the prisoner crossed over the road to me; he came up and said something, but the words I cannot express that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120020"/>made use; at the same time he pulled my watch from my fob. It was a silver watch, a seal, key, and a ribbon to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this taken from you by force against your will - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the person who took your watch afterwards - A. He ran away from me immediately; I hallooed out immediately that I had lost my watch; corporal Lee came to me; he picked up my watch-case; the prisoner returned to me, and said, God d - n your eyes, do you mean to say that I have robbed you. I said, yes. He struck at me immediately, and on my turning round to save the blow he ran away. I saw no more of him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when he was apprehended - A. One day last week, by Pace, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, how can you be sure that the person that took your watch was the prisoner - A. I can swear to it. I saw him in the house the evening before. I might be in the house an hour and a half, or better. While he was dancing I observed his countenance, his figure; I knew him again when I returned to the public-house, and I knew him to be the same person when I saw him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt the prisoner is the man that took your watch in the way that you have told us - A. I can swear he is the man, without doubt.</p>

               <p>Q. After this did you see any person come up - A. I saw the prisoner come up; he said, d - n your eyes, do you mean to say that I robbed you. The prosecutor said, yes, I do. The prisoner struck at him; I ran in between to save the blow. The prisoner returned, and ran away. I saw no more of him that night. I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

I went into this public-house to have pint of beer after I had done work; on my returning home I saw the prosecutor coming up the street; he had some girls of the town with him; he said he had lost his watch. He challenged me with the robbery; he said I had robbed him of his watch. I asked him if he meaned to say that I had robbed him of his watch; he said, yes. I offered to strip my clothes off for him to search them; he would not. About a month after, he got a constable to take me up. I am innocent of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. I think you said he took the watch by force - A. Yes; he came up against me, and made use of some words that I cannot express. I thought it was to rob me. He pushed me against a shutter, and took the watch from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect going out on the 22nd of December - A. Yes; I locked my door and came home again. I met the prisoner as I came home on the stairs; the prisoner had my property in her apron; I could not tell what it was when I met her. I went up to my room door; it was unlocked, but shut to. Finding that, I pursued the prisoner; I over-took her; I saw her where she ran in; I followed in after her; I catched hold of her arms; I said she had been robbing me; she said, me robbing you; I said, yes. I saw in her apron four gowns, one petticoat, a yard and a half of gown new print, and two pockets; she had taken them out of a box in the room, but the box was not locked. These are the articles; they are mine. The four gowns are worth twenty-seven shillings.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CARR. I saw the prisoner and the prosecutrix in Compton-street; I saw a bunch of keys drop from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. I was going up Compton-street when some man stopped me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it in the early part of November, that he said any thing to you about keeping a school - A. It is about ten weeks back; he said he was going to keep a school himself, and my son should be his scholar; he would take him cheaper. They were going to raise the schooling, and I could not afford to pay any more than what I had paid. I agreed that he should go to his school.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say he wished your son to go with him to a friend of his - A. Yes; this was about the latter end of November. I agreed to this. My son had a suit of clothes that he had on, and took a great coat, two pair of shoes, and shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them put up - A. No, I did not: I was out upon my business. After my son was gone with him, in consequence of hearing something respecting the prisoner, I became alarmed; I tried to find out the prisoner. I heard of the prisoner in Cloth-fair. My son was taken in the street, and was brought to a house in Cloth-fair to me, and a person took the prisoner and brought him to the house in Cloth-fair also. I took the prisoner by the collar, and asked where my son was; he said he was very well, and very well off, not to make myself unhappy about him. Somebody brought my child to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner searched - A. I did. This is the duplicate of my child's shoes that was found on the prisoner. I never permitted or authorised him to pawn my child's shoes.</p>

               <p>Q. This was at your father's house - A. Yes. I took a suit of clothes I had on, a great coat, and a pair of shoes, besides them I had on, and a shirt besides that I had on; I cannot tell how many stockings hardly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you set off for the country - A. No; instead of that we went into a house in Compton-street, Drury-lane. The prisoner took the bundle and left it there; he then went about with me to different houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go from that place - A. He took me to a public-house in Mile-end-road, there he left me; he said he was going to my father and my master, Mr. Hayden; he was away half an hour or more. He then went to a house in Rosemary-lane, where we slept that night; then I walked about with him the best part of the next day, and slept at the same house the next night; I cannot tell where I went the next day. We slept the third night at the house in Rosemary-lane; the fourth day we went into a house in Rosemary-lane, and had some bread and cheese and porter. Then he said he would take me to a place where I never had slept before; he said it was a place where they set off to Gravesend. The next morning we set off to Croydon; we slept at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120022"/>Croydon on the Sunday night. The next day he came to town; we went to a public-house in Moorfields, and the next day he said he got a place to sleep for half-a-crown, at the Goat in Cloth-fair; we slept at the Goat in Cloth-fair on Tuesday night, Wednesday, and Thursday, and on Friday my father found me. I never authorised him to pawn my clothes, or knew that he had pawned them until afterwards.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 28th of December, I saw the prisoner commit the robbery. I saw the prisoner and two more in Holborn; they passed Red Lion-street. There was one person rather taller than the other two, that person was placed at the window of the prosecutor, while the prisoner went to the door; the other went near the curb of the pavement. I saw the prisoner have a pull at a piece of print; a signal came from the one placed at the window, and they separated; they then came back, and took the same stations which they had formerly bad. When the prisoner stepped on the door and where the print was hanging, he gave two pulls, the linen then came down; he then ran across the road, folding it up. I caught him in my arms, and took him to Hatton Garden office. This is the print.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This print was taken out of my shop on the 28th of December; it is my property; the value is thirty shillings.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I saw the prisoner at the door about half past six; I saw him at the shop door, and the shop window; he was loitering about the door about five minutes; he proceeded from there towards the City. I pursued him; I saw him through Middle-row, Holborn; I got in the street opposite Middle-row; I saw him come out of Middle-row, Holborn; he went behind the stone pillar; he took something off the heap of rubbish; he shook it. I said to my brother officer that he had got something that he had taken from behind the stone pillar. We asked him what he had got; he said, nothing, at first. We unbuttoned his coat; these was the cotton. He then said it was a piece of stuff he had found.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this stone pillar from the house of the prosecutor - A. One hundred and fifty or two hundred yards. I never lost sight of him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you saw him he had not taken the linen - A. No; he must have taken it before, and there have hid it. He went out of the foot way.</p>
               <p>Q. to Stock. How long after you saw the prisoner was it that he was brought back - A. About a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any time during which it appeared he was absent from the door - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you missed the cotton had you seen him; you told me just now five or ten minutes - A. Yes, I saw him about ten minutes before I missed it. I was gone upon some other business; I had turned my back.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming down Holborn, I picked it up; that gentleman saw me pick it up. I threw the snow off it, and put it under my coat. I thought of giving it to my mother.</p>

Creswell, the prisoner, came up, he would shew me Rose and Crown court, Shoe-lane, where I lived. I told him I would thank him if he would. He laid hold of my arm, and took me to Eagle and Child court, Shoe-lane. He there thrust his right hand into my left waistcoat pocket. I made a grasp at him, and some of the money fell to the ground, He ran away. I followed him immediately. He ran down Shoe-lane as far as the Red Lion. I called the watchman, and we then took him to the watch-house. At the watch-house he was searched; no money was found upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. Now what do you produce to-day - 
               <persName id="t18140112-49-person470">A. </persName>
            Three broaches, that is all; whether they are the produce of what the prisoner brought I cannot say. The prisoner then was a working jeweller.</p>

            . I keep a grocer's shop in Drury-lane. On the 10th of December the prisoner came to my shop; she asked for an ounce of tea and a pound of lump sugar; it came to 2 s. 8 d. she offered a pound note to pay for it. I looked at the note and asked her name; she said her name was Stevens or Stevenson; she resided No. 10, Charles-street, Long-Acre. I looked at the note again; I said I believed it was a bad one. She repeated over and over again, if you do not like it give it me back again; that gave me suspicion. I called to my niece to give me my hat to go along with her to Charles-street; she then said, I do not live there. We both went out of the shop together; she made a sudden stop, and said she did not live there herself. I offered to go there with her; she then said she was an unfortunate girl, a gentleman gave it her in a coach. We went back to my shop; I asked her where she did live; she said she did not live any where. I then sent for an officer. I marked the note.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WESTBROOK. I am one of the patrols of Bow-street office. On the 10th of November I took the prisoner in custody at Mr. Greenham's shop. I saw a 1 l. note lie on the counter. I searched the prisoner; I found nothing upon her, except a farthing in her pockets and a small key. She told me a gentleman gave her the note in a coach; she was an unfortunate girl; the gentleman picked her up in the Strand. She told me she lived no where, she was a country girl. I took her before the magistrate. I found that her mother lived at No. 4, Phoenix-alley, Covent-Garden.</p>

            . I am sister to the last witness. I received a note of my sister to get change. At the time the prisoner was in the shop I went to Mr. Andrews the haberdasher; he would have given me change if I would promise to stand to the goodness of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were at Mr. Andrews's, did you observe any thing particular on the note - A. That black mark at the side of the note, it was not out of my sight during the time I was there. I did not get change; I returned home with it. I said Mr. Andrews disputed its being a good one. I said that in the presence of the prisoner. My sister desired me to go to Mr. Gedney, and ask him if it was a good one. I took it to Mr. Gedney; Mr. Gedney said it was not a good one. Mr. Gedney gave the note to Hewitt the officer in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had it been out of your sight before it was delivered to Hewitt - A. No. I marked it after it was delivered to Hewitt the officer. Hewitt came home with me, he and I together.</p>
               <p>Q. Just look at that note, and see whether that is the note - A, That is the note that I marked, my mark is upon the back, which I made when Hewitt came back with it, and the black mark is in the margin. I have not the least doubt that is the note.</p>
               <p>Court. To Prosecutrix. Did the prisoner make any objection to remaining while your sister was gone to Mr. Gedney's - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what he said when you told your sister to go and ask Mr. Gedney whether it was a good one or not - A. He said he had not change sufficient, he would call the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing to prevent the prisoner from going away while your sister was gone to Gedney's if he had wished it - A. No, there was nobody else in the shop but me and the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is now a year and a half ago that I was bound for a person, which person absconded out of the way for the present; in consequence of that I have been obliged to keep out of the way of sheriff's officers. I have been obliged to sell my clothes and furniture to support myself in selling them is the way I got these notes, one after the other; for the list note particularly I sold all the clothes I had except these on my back; I sold them to a Jew his name I did not ask him; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120029"/>should know him if I was to see him. I have done business in the City of London; I have sold out three or four hundred pounds in the Bank, and never was accused at any time. If I had known these things to be what they are I never should have gone so nigh the office door to have changed one, that is a clear case; no man would put his head in the fire. And as to what the woman has said at the other end of the town, is it likely that I should shew her my hand as it has a particular mark, it is not likely. I have lodged in London-wall, and I have lodged in every place I have spoken of; I might be wrong in the number, it might have been at the next door; I have been in Uxbridge also. I throw myself on your lordship's mercy. As for knowing any thing of these bank notes being bad I did not; I know no more than any of these gentlemen here. I dare say there is not one person here but what has had bad notes in his hand; unfortunately for me there are four come through my hands at different times. I did not choose to plead guilty, because I knew myself not guilty.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it a door that any one might open by turning the latch outside - A. Just so. I heard the bell ring, I came out of the parlour; I saw the prisoners, and the door was open; one of them asked for a yard of fustian. I went towards the door; I thought some one had run away. When I returned I fastened both the prisoners in the shop. I called for assistance from the back premises. My man came. I asked what laid in the window, nearest the door; my foreman said, he had laid a great coat; there was no great coat there. I charged the watch with them for taking the coat, and they were taken to the watch-house.</p>

I saw the coat in the window half an hour before the prisoners came in; in the evening I was called from the back premises, and when I came in the shop the coat was gone; no one had been in the shop that evening. No person could open the shop door without the bell ringing.</p>

               <p>Q. How many did you see - A. I saw three. I saw them two prisoners at Mr. Stacey's; they were loitering about two doors from Mr. Stacey. I heard one of them say, move; that attracted my attention, therefore I suspected them; I proceeded a little further, and returned back, and then Mr. Stacey had got two of them in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Reynolds. Do you know me to be one of them three persons - A. It was too dark to distinguish your features, by your dress I think you were.</p>
               <p>Reynolds's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, suspicion only has brought me here; I had given a coat to a tailor near my prosecutor to turn. I was directed there to purchase fustian for the pockets; the door was open a small space. On my entrance a bell rang; I asked for what I wanted; a man ran to the door; he returned, and said he would give us pepper; he said he lost a black coat and waistcoat, these however were found, and whether he has since found the great coat he best knows. I never attempted to run away.</p>
               <p>Shirley's Defence. I knew nothing of the property I am charged with; I went into the prosecutor's after a man that owed my brother for soaling and repairing a pair of boots, which he had obtained without paying for them; when the light came I found he was not the man.</p>

            . On the 29th of December, about eleven o'clock in the evening, I was in Newgate-street, my brother dropped his stick; the two prisoners came up, and asked him what he was looking for; my brother said, his stick. Thompson picked up his stick, and Wilson took hold of me; she wanted me to go with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with her - A. No, only in the street in my way home. The other was with my brother, he gave her two-pence after she picked the stick up; she kept hold of his arm. She wanted me to give her something to get her a glass of gin. I felt Wilson's hand in my breeches pocket after my brother's stick was picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in your pocket in which your notes were - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes had you in it - A. A single one-pound note in my purse, three three-shilling bank tokens, one eighteen-penny token, and one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at this time - A. Yes, quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you perceived her hand in your pocket had you perceived your note safe in your pocket - A. Not two minutes: I kept my hand to it; I had suspicion what she was after; I could feel the paper in my pocket. I called to my brother after I found my pocket had been picked. I laid hold of Wilson; Thompson had come back to me, and left my brother. I told Wilson that she had picked my pocket; she said she had not, and directly I called my brother, Thompson walked a little way from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, at the time you perceived Wilson's hand coming out of your pocket was Thompson with your brother - A. No, Thompson had left my brother, and was close by me. When Wilson was picking my pocket she was saying something to me, I do not know what; she was on the other side of me to what Wilson was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your note again - A. Yes; my brother came, and stopped Thompson; we took them both to the watchhouse. The patrol said he thought it was the best to go back and look, he said possibly they might have dropped it; I went to the spot where she drawed her hand out of my pocket. I found the purse in the kennel, with the note and silver in it; that was close to the spot where I first missed it.</p>
               <p>RICHARD RAMPLING. I was going home with my brother. In Newgate-street I dropped my stick; the girls came up; they asked me what I was looking for; I told them I had dropped my stick. Elizabeth Thompson directly stooped and picked up my stick; I gave her two-pence for picking it up; she was not content with two-pence, she said that would not get her and her sister a glass of gin; I gave her three halfpence more. Wilson was pulling my brother along the street, asking him to go with her. As soon as I gave 
               <persName id="t18140112-57-person539">Thompson</persName>
             the three halfpence I endeavoured to get rid of her; I went to my brother,

             said let the countryman alone, and shoved me away. I asked my brother if he had given her anything; he said, no. I told him to give her two-pence and let her go about her business. I had not walked but a few yards before my brother called out that she had picked his pocket; I instantly went to my brother, and Thompson was walking away; I thought she had the property as she was walking away.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Thompson in possession of the purse, did you - A. No. I took them both to the watchhouse, and the purse was afterwards found in the kennel, near the spot where my brother was.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Farringdon Ward. I was coming from the watchhouse as the charge was going in; the prosecutor said he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120031"/>lost his purse; I told him it was likely they had dropped it, I took the lanthorn, and found the purse a quarter of a yard off the pavement. The money was in the purse that the prosecutor described he had lost. I produce the purse.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the purse that I lost.</p>
               <p>Wilson's Defence. As I was walking down Newgate-street one of the young men catched hold of me; he wished to behave in an indelicate manner indeed; I refused. What money he had in his possession I know not. He might have dropped the purse.</p>
               <p>Thompson's Defence. Wilson never saw me before that night. I picked up the young man's stick; he said he would give me sixpence; he gave me twopence; I walked away.</p>
               <p>Thompson called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

Yesterday morning, between the hours of twelve and one, I saw the prisoner come in the shop; she had a child in her arms then; she asked for a small piece of sprigged muslin. I had one other customer in the shop. I saw her set the child on the counter. She took the child off the counter again, and took it in her arms. She was anxious to be served before the other customer left. I made a reply that I would serve her directly. The other customer went out of the shop. I perceived the prisoner with the child in her arms had got something under her shawl. She bought a quarter of a yard of plain book muslin; she paid nine pence for it. I espied three pieces of lawn on the counter; I was certain my employer had left four pieces on the counter; I missed one. I had observed four pieces on the counter twenty minutes before this. I let her go out of the shop. I followed her, and asked her whether she had got any thing that was not her own; she said, no, I pulled her shawl aside, and took the piece of lawn out of her hand. She had got the child in one hand, and the piece of lawn in the other. The lawn was twelve yards.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am innocent. I get my living honestly. I went to purchase muslin; I sat the child on the counter. When I came out of the door I heard the child say, dolly. I said, what have you got there. The shopman came up and said, my property. I did not know the child had got it. I was taken in custody immediately.</p>

               <p>ROBERT HAINES. I live nearly opposite of Mr. James. On the 31st of December, about a quarter before six in the evening, I was crossing the road towards Mr. James's shop; I saw the prisoner come out of the door with a cheese in his hand; he put it under his arm; it was a whole Gloster cheese. The prisoner set off running, which made me suspect he had stolen it. I ran after him, and called out stop thief: he directly chucked the cheese down; he ran three hundred yards; a man told him if he did not stop he would knock him down. A boy picked up the cheese, and it was taken to Mr. James's. I am sure I saw the prisoner come out of Mr. James's shop with the cheese.</p>
               <p>RICHARD BEAL. I live at No. 27, in the same street that Mr. James's shop is in. I saw the prisoner on the day he was taken; I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw Mr. Haines running after the prisoner; I picked up the cheese in Scott's-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was never charged with any thing of the kind; I was going to my master at Hoxton; I heard the cry of stop thief; I run after the man a quarter of a mile; I lost sight of him; the gentleman stopped me, and charged me with taking the cheese.</p>

I had just stepped backwards; when I returned my young man asked me if I had sold the silk handkerchiefs. This was just before seven in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that when he left your shop that these four silk handkerchiefs were safe in it - A. Yes, they were in the window, enclosed by a sliding sash.</p>

            How long were you absent from the shop - A. Two or three minutes. When I returned my servant asked me if I had sold a handkerchief. I only missed one that time; the next morning I examined the window; I missed the others. Two or three of them are remarkable ones. The next day, Wednesday, about three in the afternoon, I went to the prisoner's apartment in Webb-square, Shoreditch; I took Kennedy,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120032"/>the officer, with me. The prisoner was at home; she keeps a clothes-shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not she be as likely to have purchased them as to take them - A. Probably so. She was asked for a bundle of handkerchiefs that had been left there last night; she said, there was a bundle left there by two boys, but they had away in the morning; we were welcome to search if we choosed. On looking about, I opened a drawer: the first that presented itself was a particular handkerchief that I had described to the officer going along. I only found two; I missed four or five. She said, these two handkerchiefs were chucked out of the bundle by the two boys; she did not purchase them. I gave them to the officer. The two handkerchiefs are worth about six shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen any of your property since - A. Yes, I saw one of the notes on the 1st of January, in the possession of a man of the name of Hughes. I had the number and dates of the notes before I lost them. When the prisoner was taken in custody, Clements (the constable) searched him; in his breeches pocket (the breeches were in his box) was found a one-pound note. The prisoner lodged at Wellington's; he did not abscond.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at that; is that one of them - A. Yes, that is 20,132, August 5, 1813. I wrote the name of the person that I took it of before I lost it, and that name is on the note now in my own handwriting. I am sure I received that note on the 23rd.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday night, the 26th of December, I was going to bed; the prosecutor was in bed; I having a candle in my hand I picked up a bit of paper; I opened it, and looked at it; I saw these notes; I said, Mr. Griffiths, are these your notes; whether he was asleep or awake, I don't know; he said, they are not my notes, I have no notes to loose, let me go to sleep. I put these notes in my pocket. On Tuesday, I changed one of them. He never said any thing to me about the notes until the Sunday following. I have lodged in the house seven months; I never robbed a person of a farthing nor ever was in any place of confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you remember the prisoner bringing the paper to you, and asking you if the notes were yours - A. No, he never spoke to me concerning any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever speak to me of your loss until you gave me in charge.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had never spoken to him; I told the landlord and his wife of my loss.</p>

            On the 23d of December were you in the shop - A. Yes, I was; I saw the prisoner in the back shop; she was being served, and when she was served by Mr. Philpot, the gentleman who is here, he stopped and talked to another lady in the back shop. I was going to open the door for her; as she was coming to the door she stared me very hard in the face. I saw under her shawl a piece which is now here; I suspected she stole it. I let her out, and shut the door; I went back, and asked Mr. Philpot if he had sold her the cloth; he answered he had not. I had let her go out of the shop; I went after her, and caught her about fifty yards from the shop; I laid held of her arm, and under her arm was a piece of Irish linen; I asked her what she had got, to go back with me. She said she had got nothing at all. I took her back to the door; she held the cloth to Mr. Philpot; she said, this is not yours. Mr. Philpot took the cloth from her, and then he charged a constable with her; she escaped from the constable. I went over to her lodgings at Lambeth with the officer, and there we found her bonnet and shawl that she had on when she committed the theft.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen it that day before - A. Yes, not ten minutes before I took notice of it laying on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120033"/>counter. I knew the piece of cloth myself, by taking that and another piece myself to Union-place, Lambeth; I left it with, the lady all night: I marked the prices, and left both pieces, and the young man fetched it back in the morning, and left it on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen it on the counter ten minutes before the prisoner came in the shop, had you - A. Yes; it was the same piece that was found on her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This is charged privately stealing; you saw it under her arm as you shut the door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was somebody else in the shop serving, who is not here to-day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was there any alarm given by any other person in the shop that saw her take it. Did any body see her take it - A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received charge of the prisoner of Mr. Mann; I was going to take her to prison, and I met Darvill, the constable: the woman said she wanted to go to her lodgings in Stratton-ground, Westminster. I told Darvill the circumstance; he said he would search her; he searched her, and took a ten pound note and a five pound note from her. She wanted to go into the yard; I let her go into the yard: she escaped. She was taken in about three quarters of an hour afterwards. That is all I know, except the linen I marked it when it was given to me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my property; I value it at thirty-eight shillings; it is worth more than that.</p>

               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her counsel; called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. On the 13th of December, the patrol and watchman brought the prisoner to the watchhouse; the lady charged the prisoner with robbing her of her hat and veil; the prisoner said she was a false woman to say he took her hat and veil. This is the hat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 13th of December, a little after nine in the evening, I met with this young woman in King-street, Covent Garden; she asked me if I would give her any thing to drink. I went with her to the watering-house in Bedford-street; we had sixpennyworth of gin and water, and after that I called for sixpennyworth of rum and water: we drank that; she turned sick, and vomited in the coal-box in the tap-room. She wished me to go home with her; I refused, she being in such a state of intoxication. In the street she vomited again; then I left her. I went into Oxford-street; I met her again. I never had her veil in my hand.</p>

               <p>Q. At the latter end of October, did he furnish you with any bank notes - A. Yes, on Sunday the 31st of October; I took these bank notes to the White Hart, Hooper-square, Goodman's-fields. He gave me eight one-pound notes and a two-pound note, ten pounds in value.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house - A. The White Hart, Hooper-square, Goodman's-fields; it was in the evening. I went there about half past seven.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got there whom did you meet - A. The male prisoner at the bar; I told him I was informed that he had got some screens to dispose of.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you understand by screens - A. Bank notes. The prisoner said he had got some screens to dispose of, but he had got but seventeen, what could I stand for them; I said, what are they, bank; he said no, country, Colchester bank; they were prigg'd screens. I understood by that that they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120034"/>were stolen notes; prigg'd screens is the cant term for stolen notes. I told him as for that I did not care about that, I was going out of town, and if any body could work them I could.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by working them - A. Get rid of them. He then said, are you going to Wales; no, Yarmouth; I thought of trying them along the coast. The prisoner said, oh, the coast will do well, and seemed pleased at the idea. He next said, well, what will you stand for them; I replied, I am not prepared to take a great number, as I have but ten pounds about me; I said, when were they got, have they been got long; he replied, no, only the night before last. I said it was necessary I should know whether he would wish them to be started immediately, or whether he would wish them to sleep, that is to lay by until they were forgot; he replied, oh, sleep, by all means; I would not have one of them started for three months; I told him very well, it should be so, the money was no object. He said now to business. I said what do you ask for them; he said, he did not know; what did I give; I said, that depends upon circumstances. He then said, what did you give for the last; I said, twelve; meaning twelve shillings a piece. The prisoner replied that will be about fourteen for ten pounds; I said, no, as it is our first dealing, and I have to lay out my money, I must have fifteen. The prisoner said, I have got a partner, I don't know whether he will agree to it; I said, tell him it must be so, I will have fifteen. The prisoner replied, I do not know, I will go and get them. I said, dear me, I understood you had them about you here; he said, no, but I shall not be long in fetching them. How long will you be gone; he said, I will not be above twenty minutes. He went, and in about twenty minutes he returned to me again, told me he had got the fifteen. He came into a private room. and very carefully drawed the curtains around him; he took out the fifteen notes. He gave me the fifteen notes, and desired me to count them; I being somewhat agitated, I counted only fourteen. The prisoner said, give me leave, you have made a mistake.</p>

            . Q. In the latter end of October last, did you employ the last witness, Emblin, to endeavour to detect the prisoner - A. I did, under the direction of the magistrate. On Sunday the 31st of October, I furnished Emblin with eight one-pound notes and one two-pound note for the purpose of dealing with him; I took the numbers and dates of the notes on a piece of paper, and marked some of them in the back; some were already marked on the back, of which I took the particulars.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that Emblin went to the public-house that he has spoken of, did you, Lavendar, Westbrook, and Bacon, go any where - A. We did;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120035"/>we went to the Swan in Mansell-street.

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see him again - A. I waited in the street for him; I saw him within a quarter of an hour. I saw him running on the other side of the way; I met him in the street. He gave me fifteen one-pound, Colchester notes; I marked them all, and the next day I delivered them to Mr. France. I marked them before I parted with them. These are all the right notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the last, the last note is the note upon which this indictment is framed. After you had received these of Emblin, did you and the other officers proceed to the habitation of the prisoner - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was that to the spot where you saw Emblin come back - A. From where I left Emblin to make the purchase I suppose it is about a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>COURT. You found him about a quarter of a mile from the Swan public-house - A. Yes, I knew that was in the way to his lodging. I found him and the woman walking together; I walked behind them about an hundred yards; at the turnpike-gate I stopped them; I knew there was a house there that I could search by the light. They were arm in arm walking together, as if in company. I called them by name, took hold of them both, and took them into the turnpike-house. The prisoners were searched in my presence; there were a quantity of notes found upon them of that description; they are in Lavendar's custody. I heard Lavendar say he found two one-pound genuine notes upon the prisoner

            's Defence. I beg leave to observe the things that Westbrook produced were brought to my lodgings, by Samuel, saying, he wished to leave them at my lodging until he returned; he never did return. Samuel was the man that 
               <persName id="t18140112-64-person620">drew</persName>
             the draft of the plate on paper, and took me to this man's door to give the order for the plate. When I went for the plate then he took me again to the door, and gave me a pound note to pay for it; and the very Sunday evening of this transaction Samuel gave me a roll of paper with a bit of thread round it, and told me there was a particular friend of his waiting at the public-house for it. He did not observe what the roll was to me. When he gave it me he said, there is the man, go in and have some conversation with him; the man has been transported, but that is nought to you. As to the conversation that Emblin has said I had with him is all false; there was, nothing of the kind. The only conversation that I had with Emblin, was to know whether he was the man that wanted the roll of paper, and when I gave him the roll of paper he presented me with ten pound, saying it was for Samuel. Samuel sent me to him in that house, saying, he had got to go to Wellclose-square, and that he had no time. When I came out of the house Samuel came to me, and said, has he given you any money for me; he then said, he promised to lend me two pounds; he lent me two pounds out of that ten pounds. I presume that is the two pounds the officers found upon me, and then when we came out of the Brown Bear my wife and me were talking together upon different subjects. I had occasion to go under a gateway; Samuel gave me these things, saying, he would call for them in the morning; there was going to be an execution in his house. I left him under the gateway, and when I returned he was giving my wife a parcel, I presume the parcel that was found upon her; he said to her here, mistress, put this in your pocket, and when you come to tea to-morrow bring it with you. I am sure she did not know what it contained. Emblin told me he knew 
               <persName id="t18140112-64-person621">Samuel</persName>
             a long time. I did not ask him what the transaction was. As for the conversation that he has related never passed; it is entirely false. Mr. Vickrey has said, he should like to have got hold of Samuel. It is well known that Vickrey knows what kind of a man Samuel is better than I do. I could enter into many things about Samuel. It is well known it is not in my power to bring such a thing as this to perfection. Samuel was the man that found the money to get this plate made, under pretence of its going into the country, and when we went to Mr. Justins' door he told me to go in and pay for it. I am very sorry Samuel is not at this bar to-day; it would be of service to this country if he had, for the the numerous things that he has been guilty of; he is the sole cause of my misfortune. It is well known it never was in my power to do such a thing as this. The rascal wanted me to rob the house I lodge in of two feather beds, and the landlady's chest at the foot of the bedstead; he wanted to unscrew the lock to see what was in it. I am confident my wife is innocent of any offence.</p>

               <persName id="t18140112-66-person636">A. </persName>
            Never to my knowledge. Near eight o'clock I was going out for some tea and sugar, a ring came to the door; a man came in and asked for one of the gentleman's hats; he said he came from the hatters in Cheapside. I called up the house-maid to answer the man; the house-maid came up: I went out. I did not like to go far from the house, for fear my mistress should find me absent, as I was going without her leave. I was absent about three minutes, and when I returned to the door the man was coming out with a parcel under his arm. I asked him, was he a thief, because I saw he had got the great coats and the umbrella I am sure the bundle was not a hat. He knocked me down with an umbrella he took out of the house. When I got up I ran after him; he got out of my sight. There was a great crowd; they got the prisoner; he was taken to the watchhouse. I saw the prisoner at the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at the watchhouse, did you believe him to be the man that was in the passage - A. I believe he was not the man, only his face was paleish like the man that was in the passage; his face resembled the man.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a reason to believe he is the man - A. I believe he is not the man; his features resembles the man that knocked me down. I cannot say he is the man.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WHITEHEAD. I am a watchman; my beat goes from the corner of New North-street. On the 25th of December, about eight o'clock at night, I heard the cry of stop thief; I saw a great mob coming from Theobald's-road; I ran to them. The prisoner tumbled down; the mob said he was the thief. I laid hold of him, and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM ASHLEY. I was constable of the night. I was in the watchhouse when the prisoner was brought in; he was charged on suspicion of stealing two great coats and an umbrella. I asked the prisoner what he had to say; he said he was running with the mob, he knew nothing of the charge. The property was produced by Burdon, another watchman. The prosecutor said the coats were his; the umbrella was his friend's; he did not know that the prisoner took them.</p>

            Whether he was dressed or not he could pop out of one room into the other - A. Exactly so. When I came up I had occasion to go to the drawer. I missed one of the watches, and afterwards the second. I wrote the description of the two watches on the back of some cards of my address; I went round to the pawnbrokers. I saw both the watches at Marlborough-street office. I took the prisoner in custody; he acknowledged to the fact. When I took the prisoner, I said, you have stolen two watches from me; he said, he had, without any promise of favour or threat whatever. On the prisoner being taken to the office he was searched; the two duplicates were found upon him by the officer.</p>
               <p>THOMAS STANTON. I am shopman to Mr. Lowther, pawnbroker. The two watches were pawned with me at one time, I believe by the prisoner; I advanced one pound two shillings upon them. I produce them.</p>

             took her bonnet off, and laid it on the top of the drawer of the ribbons; I suspected them, the difficulty of her choosing them, and the motion of her arms that she was stealing some property; I tried gently to remove the bonnet off the drawer, she held the bonnet very tight in her hand. I then gave it a sudden pull, and discovered half a piece of ribbon in her bonnet; I threw her bonnet off the counter, and withdrew the drawer of ribbons, and desired my servant to call the constable; she asked me what I was calling a constable for, and desired me to some of the ribbon that hung in the window for her; I replied, I would do no such thing; I would call a constable for her; she dared me to do any such thing, and ran out of the shop; immediately Mary Smith followed her. Johnson, the officer, was waiting outside of the door, he came in and asked if they had stolen any thing; I replied, that I had found the ribbon in her bonnet.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 31st of December, I saw the three prisoners in Holborn, between one and two o'clock, knowing them I suspected them; I went into one or two shops after they came out, they never purchased any thing. They all three went into Mr. Saxton's shop. From there the two women went into Mr. Lee's shop; the man was standing outside, waiting for them at the corner of a court. After waiting there a short time Fercley ran out of the shop briskly, leaving the other prisoner in the shop. Perry, who is her brother, concealed himself in the passage of Mr. Bett's shop, the baker; about half a minute afterwards Smith ran out of the shop; Perry gave them a signal; they all three came together. I immediately went into Mrs. Lee's shop, I asked whether they had bought or stolen any thing; Mrs. Lee said they had concealed a piece of ribbon, she took it from them by snatching the bonnet. This is the ribbon that was in the bonnet</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that - A It is the ribbon that was given to me. I searched them, and found nothing on them but some silver.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The ribbon is mine; it is what I found in

            's bonnet.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not it get into the bonnet by accident - A. I conceive that impossible; the back part of her bonnet was on the drawer. These two young women had been in the shop two or three days before; I lost some ribbons then.</p>
               <p>Fercley's Defence. I went into this lady's shop on Christmas Eve, I bought several yards of ribbon; this young woman was with me. I did not go into her shop again for a week. I then asked the price of ribbons, I pulled off my bonnet to match the colour, and that young man was not in the shop at all. If the ribbon was in my bonnet it might have catched it by the wire of my bonnet when the lady took it up.</p>
               <p>Smith's Defence. I did not take the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Perry's Defence. I was coming up Holborn; I met these two young women; that young woman is my sister; I was going home at the same time, we were going to have something to drink; they said they were going to buy some ribbon, and when they came out the two gentlemen took us into the wine-vaults and searched us.</p>

The prisoner Johnson ran after me, he came right in the front of me, and stared me in the face; I recollected I had seen him before; I thought it strange of his turning round and looking me in the face. He immediately went and made water. I immediately crossed the road and went on the other side of the way; Johnson returned back to his companion. I went to a potatoe shop as if to conceal myself for a few minutes; I then saw Johnson and the other prisoner walking backwards and forwards by the door of the prosecutor: a coach passed; I then saw Johnson with this piece of velveteen under his arm; I kept on the same side of the way. Johnson came over to me; I catched hold of him with the velveteen under his arm. The prisoner Finch was crossing over to where I was, but seeing I had got hold of Johnson he made his escape.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the evening of the same day, I went to the house of the prisoner; Todd he keeps a green stall, and a horse and cart; sometimes Jones drives the cart and sometimes Todd. It was about seven o'clock in the evening, the shop was shut up; I opened the door; I found the three prisoners sitting round the fire. I told

             I wanted to speak with him; I took him backwards, and asked him if he had received any casks that afternoon; he told me, no. On my looking round I saw this kilderkin with William and Mary chalked upon it; it was in the yard behind his house. I asked him how that cask came there; he told me Jones had brought it, and asked him to let it stay there. I went into the shop to lay hold of Jones, and he had ran away; Gillmore, my brother officer, pursued him, and brought him back again in the space of five minutes. I then asked Jones where he found the cask; he told me he saw it just outside of the kennel, he thought it belonged to somebody, and so he rolled it in there. At that time I found no other casks. I asked Todd if there were any other casks there; he told me there was not. On the next night I went again to Todd's premises; Todd and Jones were then in custody. I went and looked over the wall of the yard; there were four or five barrels there in the yard. I then came round to the front of Todd's house, and found there was somebody in Todd's house; I knocked at the door; Crew opened the door, and when I went into the shop I saw the fire was composed of staves a burning. I asked Crew where he got these staves; he told me in the stable. I had searched the stable the night before, there were no casks there; among the casks I found two were defaced; the barrels belonging to Messrs. Moreton are here. There were other barrels there belonging to different people, they are not here. I took Crew in custody.</p>

               <p>Jones's Defence. I implore your lordship's attention, that however the crime may appear against me, I declare, in the presence of my God, as I returned from the Quay I found the cask in the street; I took it to the shop until I was able to learn to whom it belonged; soon after, I was made a prisoner.</p>

               <p>Crew's Defence. These men were taken up, I went to the office to them. Todd told me to go and mind the house. In the night three or four casks were chucked over the yard, and one broken one.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of December, I went to search Harrison's premises, No. 1, Back-hill, Hatton Garden; I found Harrison and his family there at breakfast; it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning; afterwards I saw Chilvers coming down stairs. Mr. Harrison came out; I told him Mr. Dawes had lost some mahogany, he had some suspicion it was on his premises; he said I was wellcome to look. Mr. Dawes went first up stairs, as soon as he got to the top, he said here is my property. I then told Harrison he must go with me to the office; I took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the property that you found that Dawes owned - A. Three large mahogany and two bed-pillars unturned; the two bed-pi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120040"/>here; the planks are too large to be brought in here. At half after eleven o'clock at night I took Chilvers; he was in bed with his clothes on, except his shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search any other place - A. Yes, I had a search warrant and searched No. 47, Seward-street, Brick-lane, Chilvers and Harrison's premises; we found nothing there belonging to Mr. Dawes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, bring in one of the pillars - A. This bed-pillar was fourteen feet long; it has been cut in two.</p>

My father told me he had let the shop to Harrison and Chilvers, on the 24th of October they took possession; they took it at three shillings a week; they carried on the business of carpenters.</p>

Chilvers paid some rent in advance; they both took it, and they were joint tenants there. I saw them at work there once; they kept the shop until they were apprehended.</p>

            . I am a mahogany-turner. On the 24th of November, Harrison sent me ten or eleven pair of bed-pillars to turn; he told me to sell them for him if I could at twenty-four shillings a pair. I applied to Mr. Blackhall; he refused buying them, he said they were worm-eaten. He then told me to turn them, and he would sell them. On the 1st of December, Cook and Mr. Dawes came, Mr. Dawes claimed them; he said they were stolen.</p>

I accidentally went to the door; I saw the prisoner going along with a bundle on his shoulder; I asked the prisoner where he was going with that on his shoulder; he said, a person gave it him, if it was mine I might have it. I said, I must take you too. I took him; he let the dowlas fall on my arm; a gentleman took the dowlas who is present.</p>

               <p>MRS. EDWARDS. I lost my husband's watch on the 14th of September; it was on a drawer in my room. The prisoner took the watch out of the bed and put it on the drawers in the other room: I asked her where the watch was; she said on the drawers. I then asked her to look what o'clock it was; she replied, it was exactly twelve; some time after that she was walking about the room; I then had occasion to go down stairs, I gave her my young baby to nurse while I was gone; I took the other child with me of two years and a half old. On my returning back to the room, I saw the door open; the prisoner met me at the door with the infant in her arms asleep, she said the child was asleep, shall I lay it on the bed; I said, no, I will take her out of your arms in one minute; she said, as quick as you can. I want to go down stairs. I took the child, and she left the room immediately. About half an hour after she was gone I thought it very odd of her not returning, I looked on the drawers, and missed my watch. There was no one in the room after she left it.</p>

               <p>PATRICK M'IVERS. I am an invalid belonging to Chelsea. I lost my watch on the 25th of December; we got our pay; I received a one-pound note I went into a public-house to get change; the landlord said he had not change. I went out to see about my billet; the prisoner followed me out into the street; she said, there is a bad woman in company here, if you come back you will be ruined. She came forward, pulled my watch out, and ran away with it; I ran after her; I could not overtake her. I had my knapsack, and I am lame, I could not overtake her; I am sure she is the woman.</p>

I came to get my pension; I picked up the prisoner in St. Martin's-lane, she took me to a house in Vine-street, and when I came into the room I paid her for what I agreed. My notes were all safe in my pocket when I entered the room. I felt her hand at my pocked twice, I shoved her away. I felt in my pocket, and my notes were gone; I challenged her with robbing me of eight pounds. She took two pins out of her breast and said, I might search her.

               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On the 11th of December, I went to the house of a woman in New Gravel-lane; I took the prisoner in custody; I searched him, and found four duplicates upon him, two of which belong to this property. I afterwards went to Mr. Exton's house and searched the prisoner's chest. In his chest I found a knife with the name of King upon it, and a waistcoat that belonged to a man that left his things there, and the bit of canvas and the cuttings of cloth were found in the prisoner's chest, and the other things at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>JACOB LEWIS. I am a carpenter; I live in Crown-street. I saw a mob; a woman had lost her shoe. I heard a person say he has stolen my watch. I saw the prisoner; the prosecutor had caught hold of him. The prisoner said he had not got his property. I called for a light; I dragged the prisoner two feet with intention of taking him into the Flying Horse public-house. I was looking to see if the property was on the ground; I heard something fall. I saw the two seals in question taken up and delivered to the prosecutor. I am sure the prisoner is the same man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they carry any bones for you on the 29th of December - A. They did, their carts received fourteen loads, but we heard they only received thirteen loads. Their carts were employed to carry bones to their dock at Whitefriars, and the road they should take is through Gray's-inn-lane, Fetter-lane, and Water-lane; that is the direct road from Battle-bridge to their dock; Fleet-market would be out of the way. The prisoner was a carter; he was employed, and took several loads that day, and particular the last. About seven o'clock the prisoner had a load of bones at our house, Battle-bridge; he had two horses to his cart; the horse between the shafts was a grey horse; the prisoner was the driver of that cart. The prisoner said at the magistrate's that he did not drive that load. I am quite certain that he did; I saw him go with it. It would take half an hour to go from our house at Battle-bridge to Whitefriars dock. I am certain he drove the last load of bones; the load of that cart was worth four pounds ten shillings.</p>

The prisoner was not with his cart; the man that was with it was driving the horses as fast as he could drive them. The cart appeared to me to be empty, by the rattle of it.

I walked down towards Bloomsbury-square, and one of the prisoners came as if from Mr. Todd's shop; he gave the prisoner that is rather lame, a something which he put in his apron, (it was a foggy night), and after he had done so he walked by the shop again; he then made a return, and gave a whistle; the other prisoner cried, here I am. The prisoner was running at the time that is rather lame; he stopped, and the other prisoner came up with him, and when they got opposite Bedford chapel in Charles-street, the prisoners saw me coming, as I supposed; they were going to run, I caught them in my arms, and on the lame prisoner I found this piece of print. I then took them back to Mr. Todd's shop; I saw a lad in the shop; I asked him if he knew this piece of print; he said, yes, it was hanging within his shop within a quarter of an hour before.</p>

On the 11th of January, between four and five, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Williams's shop door; I saw him untwist this piece of print from the rail; he folded it up in his hands, and he ran off with it. I pursued him, and laid hold of him near King-street, Holborn, and took him to Hatton Garden office, and I went and gave Mr. Williams information. This is the print; I have had it ever since.</p>

            , who has absconded, were to drive the waggon. I desired them to stop in George-street; there were two trusses of clover hay upon the top of the waggon, besides a truss of meadow hay for their horses. They did not know I was there until I told them to stop. I got upon the wheel; I observed the two trusses of clover hay, besides that a truss of meadow hay for their horses, and a nose-bag full of corn for their horses. When we send out horses we send meadow hay with them. When Pearce saw me upon the wheel he desired the prisoner to hold the whip; he absconded immediately. They were both equally entrusted with the waggon. The prisoner staid with the waggon until I called my clerk up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man lived with you - A. A month or five weeks. The prisoner said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this clover hay in the same place or near it, in the waggon - A. No, the meadow hay was on the shafts, and the clover hay was upon the top of the waggon on the dung. I directly called my clerk up, and sent the prisoner to the watchhouse. When I returned, after calling the clerk up, I observed one of the trusses of clover hay off the waggon; my clerk found it throwed into a neighbour's yard. I left the prisoner with the waggon while I went and called my clerk up.</p>

On the 5th of December I lost my handkerchief; the handkerchief I know was safe in my pocket a quarter of an hour before I missed it. It was intimated to me by a lad standing by me that my handkerchief was taken away. I was waiting while the militia were going to chapel at Whitehall, that occasioned me to stop. I took hold of the prisoner; I charged him with stealing my handkerchief; he said he had a handkerchief; that he had picked it off the ground. He gave it me. This is the handkerchief. My handkerchief was a similar pattern to this. I cannot swear to it being my property.</p>

About two weeks ago Molloy had a gown put by until she could afford to pay for the whole. She came to pay 6 d. on the Friday; my young man took the 6 d. and gave it to me. Abrahams then wished to look at some print. They came in together. I shewed her a considerable quantity. After a long time she purchased a yard and a half; she gave 3 s. 6 d. for it. I was serving a customer at the top of the shop; my young man brought me the money. I had scarcely got the money in my hand, when a young man looked in the shop after the prisoners had gone out, and said, here is a woman has gone out that I believe has got something that does not belong to her. I and my young man followed the two prisoners, and when we came to Molloy, she had got a piece of Irish linen under her petticoats; she had got hold of the linen, one hand at one end and the other hand at the other end, underneath her petticoats. We took her back to the shop, and as soon as she came into the shop she dropped it. I sent for an officer, and had her taken into custody. She must have done it under cover of the other, or else we must have seen her take it out.</p>

            . On Friday last, about three o'clock, I was going past Mr. Beech's shop. I saw the prisoner Molloy just as she came out of Mr. Beech's shop; she dropped the linen from underneath her petticoats. I suspected that she did not come honestly by it. I went into the shop, and informed Mr. Beech and his shopman of it. Mr. Beech and his shopman jumped over the counter, pursued the prisoners, and overtook them about thirty yards from the house. They were brought back into the shop, and in the shop Molloy dropped the cloth from underneath her petticoats. Mr. Beach then sent for a constable, and had them taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Molloy's Defence. I was going to Covent Garden market to get something for my throat. I met Biddy Abrahams; she said she was going to get a frock for her child. I never saw any thing of the linen until the man followed me and brought me back; then the piece of linen was lying down in the shop.</p>
               <p>Abraham's Defence. I met this woman; she told me she was going to pay something off her gown. I went then with her. I bought a frock. That is all I saw of the woman.</p>

He has had six accommodation bills of me. Campion said he had no money. The day before Harvey, the man that gave evidence against me, Campion lent him his coat to pawn for eight shillings. I went and took a table out; he afterwards pledged it for ten shillings.</p>

On Tuesday, the 4th of January, the prisoners came to my house between ten and eleven o'clock; they had two glasses of rum; one only of them partook of it, the other gave his share away; they afterwards had six-pennyworth of gin and water. I told them then to go. They wanted more liquor; I would not draw them any more. We missed King out of the tap-room; the other prisoner went and stood with his back against the tap-room door. I requested my sister-in-law to fasten the door, and let no more in. She went with intent to fasten it. Harris stood with his back to the door, and said the other man was coming in. I said, let her have none of your nonsense, let her go and fasten the door. He still refused. I pulled him away. While I was pulling him away, I happened to cast my eye on a window that gives light to the stairs in that passage; by the reflection of the lamp I saw King coming down stairs. I went into the passage; Harris followed me. One of them whispered to the other; after the whispering, King got the street door open. I saw King's pockets stick out very much. I asked him what he had got there. Harris got in between me and King, and prevented me from holding him. King held up his hand, made a blow at me, and ran away as fast as he could. I pursued him as far as the

His feet slipped; I catched hold of him, and brought him up to my own house. Harris came behind him, and took some linen out of King's pocket. Harris then went and dropped some things under the window. My sister picked them up; one of them was a little boy's shirt and a half handkerchief. I do not recollect the other things in my confusion; they are here, and they are my property. I am quite sure as to the persons of the two prisoners.</p>

The prosecutrix called for a quartern of rum; we went to another public-house; we all got intoxicated. I took the bundle to Mrs. Barclay's, and there I left it with her. I was intoxicated almost as much as the prosecutrix.</p>

After I delivered it at the office, I heard the coach had been robbed. I have seen some of the goods that were in that parcel, the lustring, at Mr. Wilson's shop, Crown-street, Finsbury-square; he is an umbrella maker; it was umbrella silk.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was it when you packed up this parcel - A. On the 8th of September, and some time in November I saw some part of the lustring at Mr. Wilson's shop.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CROSSBY. I live in Seward-street, Old Artillery-ground. About ten months ago the prisoner brought me two pieces of lustring to dispose of for him.</p>

A woman ran up against my arm, and instantly I felt my watch go out of my pocket. I called out, I have lost my watch. I felt it go. Mr. Thompson took the woman, but the two men ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the woman - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she at all out of your sight - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your watch a silver watch - A. No, a metal watch; it was worth 1 l. and the seal was worth five or six shillings. The watch has not been found; the prisoner snatched it away, and the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120048"/>men ran away. The watch was not found about the woman, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>CHARLES THOMPSON. I live with my father; he is independent; he lodges at Mr. Stapley's. I was coming home from my brother's; he keeps the Rum Puncheon.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you intoxicated - A. No, not in the least. In White Cross street two men and a woman met us; the woman ran up against Mr. Stapley; he instantly said he had lost his watch, and instantly the two men ran away. The woman never offered to run. I catched hold of the prisoner, and took her to the watch-house. She was searched, nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutor; he was intoxicated. He cried out he had lost his watch. I never offered to run away.</p>

He said he had it given to him at Kingsland, and he had stopped until late. I told him I must take him and the pig to the watch-house: At the watch-house he told another story to the constable.

I undressed myself and went to bed with her, and when I awoke at five in the morning the prisoner was out of the room. I called for a light, and said I was robbed. The prisoner then came into the room, and the landlady brought a light. I was not sober; I felt my money when I was going to bed. The prisoner laughed at me, and said she knew nothing of my money; there was another girl in the house; it was a bawdy-house. The prisoner was searched, none of my money or notes were found upon her. When she came in the room at five o'clock, she was not dressed; she said she had slept in another bed. The landlord of the house has absconded.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JACKSON. I am an officer. At half after six o'clock I took the prisoner into custody. I searched her, I found nothing on her. The landlord escaped. I took the landlady in custody. Dayley nor any of the notes have not been found since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor would make no agreement with me. I told him to go out of the house. I never saw any of the money. I would not go to bed with him; he would not go out of the house. In the morning when he called out he was robbed, I went into the room.</p>

He said, he came from Mr. Hares, a hatter, in the Strand, for a hat to be made larger; I asked him who the person was; he said, a young gentleman, a slim young man. We had a young gentleman in the house of that description lodged and boarded in the house. I told him he could not see the gentleman, he was at dinner; he had better call in a quarter of an hour. The prisoner then particularly desired to take the hat back with him; in consequence of that I asked the prisoner to come in, and said I would inform the gentleman of it; I went into the back parlour, and when I returned the street door was a little way open; I asked him if any body had gone out; he said, no, the door opened of itself. I shut the door, left him in the passage, and went down stairs. When I came up the prisoner was gone, and likewise four great coats and a hat were gone; the four great coats were in the passage when the prisoner was there. I went in the parlour and informed the gentleman of it; the gentleman went in pursuit of him, and could not find him. The coats and the hat have never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On Sunday morning following. The 4th of December was on Saturday. Oddy, a Bow-street officer, asked me to go to the Park with him, and the first person I saw was the prisoner, I knew him by his dress, and features; no person pointed him out to me; there was a number of other people looking at the soldiers. I am quite sure the man I picked out in the park is the man. I asked the prisoner if he knew me; he said, no. I told him I knew him; I saw him at No. 19, Adam-street, Adelphi, and that he then said, he came from Mr. Hare in the Strand, for a hat to be made larger; he said it could not be him. I laid hold of him, and Oddy came and secured him.</p>
               <p>ABIGAIL MILLER. I live at No. 2, Michael-grove, Brompton. The prisoner is my son; he lives with me; he is a carpenter.

            About ten minutes before six; he immediately returned with the basket. He set out again about five minutes before six o'clock; when he set out with the basket of things to his brother my watch hung up; I noticed the time; and when he returned home it was about half past nine.

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Golden-lane on the 23rd of December; on the day before I had received information of stolen property being at a house in Fireball-court, Houndsditch; I went there. I saw these two coats in a room of the sister to one of the witnesses; she said her brother sent the things there. When I apprehended the prisoner I told him I apprehended him for stealing coach-glasses and coats; he said, he knew nothing of it. I found a two-pound note upon him with the name of Lion Solomon upon it, the witness who had bought the coats.</p>
               <p>LION SOLOMON. I keep a clothes shop, 19, Playhouse-yard. On the 21st in the morning, about nine o'clock, I was sent for, to go to Golden-lane: I went the house in Golden-lane, and when I got to that to house I saw two men and a woman; I did not see the prisoner when I bought the clothes. They asked me three-pounds for these coats; I gave six pounds for the lot; two have been claimed by Stevenson. I had to go home to pay the money; I appointed to come to the Black Horse, Barbican, to pay the money and there I found three men; the prisoner was one of the men. I paid the money in that house; I put the money on the table, a woman took the money up. I left the house.</p>

I said to the other woman that my watch was gone; I catched the prisoner. I was persuaded to put her in the watchhouse. I went home with the other woman to her lodgings in Smart's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with the prisoner - A. About a quarter of an hour. I felt my watch in my fob when I was with the prisoner; when she run away I missed it.</p>
               <p>JOHN GRIFFITHS. I am a watchman. Cragnell desired me to take the prisoner into custody; I took her to the watchhouse. I saw the prisoner take the watch out of her pocket, and put it on the ground.</p>

My landlady went into my room on the 9th, and they were gone. I have seen my hat since at Lion Solomon's shop, No. 19, Play-house-yard. On Saturday evening I asked the prisoner what he had done with them; he told me that he had sold the boots and the hat to Lyon Solomon, and when I went to No. 19, Play-house-yard, a woman shewed me the hat. The boots were not produced. This is the hat; it is mine; it is worth a shilling.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sober at the time - A. I was not. I had my watch with me when I went into her lodging, and I left it there. I have seen my watch again in the hands of Bishop, the officer of Worship-street office. I do not charge her with stealing my watch; I believe if I had called the next morning for it she would have given it me. The watch never had been pawned or parted with; it was found in her possession.</p>

               <p>WOOLF JESEPHESON GOLLIN. I lost four silver table-spoons and a soup-ladle, on Monday the 3d of January. I left my house about eight in the morning; I came home between eight and nine in the evening; I was then informed I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these spoons and soup-ladle again - A. Yes, on the 4th, the next day, at the office in Worship-street. The prisoner was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GRIFFITHS. I was charwoman on the 3d of January, at Mr. Gollin's. I saw the prisoner in his parlour; she was a stranger to me; I asked her what she wanted; (this was about two o'clock); she said she wanted to sell a frying pan. Mr. Gollin's house is a private house. The back-door was left open for the lodgers. It is generally left upon the latch. My master's sister catched the prisoner before she went out of the house; the prisoner dropped the spoons and the soup-ladle.</p>
               <p>SARAH WOOLF. I am sister to the prosecutor. I was on a visit to my sister. I saw the prisoner in the back parlour; she left the parlour and was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120052"/>away. I stopped her, and took her in the parlour again; she dropped directly the spoons and the soup-ladle. The spoons were kept in the back parlour; I had seen them on the table just before the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>JOHR HAWES. I produce the four spoons and the ladle.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These four spoons and the ladle are mine; they are worth about three pounds; they would sell for that in weight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite friendless.</p>
