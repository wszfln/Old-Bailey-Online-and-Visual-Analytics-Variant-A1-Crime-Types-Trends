I am a booking-clerk at Farringdon Station—on 10th June I heard something, went on to the platform of the Chatham and Dover line—that would not be the proper platform for him, because he had taken a Hammersmith ticket—I told him I wanted him in the refreshment room for passing bad money—he said, "Very well, I will go quietly"—I took him, and Jane Haines accused him—he said that he was very sorry, he had only 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world, and pulled out four half-crowns, a half-sovereign, a florin, and a Hammersmith ticket—I said, "You have got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. now, and a Hammersmith ticket, so your story cannot be true; I shall detain you"—he heard me send for a policeman, and as soon as my back was turned he slipped off—I followed him, and saw him running as hard as he could, 300 or 400 yards from the station—I caught him, told him that was not the way to Hammersmith—he struck me a violent blow on the chest, and scratched my face—I threw him on his back—on the way to the station we heard something drop twice, but found nothing; presently we heard some<lb/>thing else drop, and we found a good half-crown—he said, "I dropped that; I shall drop some more presently."</p>

I am a farrier, of 5, Garter Court, Barbican—on Satur<lb/>day night, June 7, about 9.45 o'clock, I was in Bartholomew Close with my wife—Connell came up from behind, snatched my watch and chain from my pocket, and ran off—I caught him by his shoulder, but he escaped, and I was knocked down; I do not know who by, but I believe Quinlan is the man—I got up and followed close to Connell—I went into Jews' Court, and found him in custody—he was taken to the station—the bar of the chain and the bow of the watch were found near the spot—they are mine—my watch was worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my chain 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen them since—the man who I believe is Quintan stood at the side, as Connell was running away, and gave me a blow on my chest—I staggered, and he gave me another blow on my back, and knocked me down—I saw three other men there.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Rose and Crown public-house, in Went<lb/>worth Street—on 1st July, between 5.0 and 6.0 in the afternoon, I was sprinkling the bar with water, the weather being warm—a few drops went on the face of a man who was lying on the pavement, just outside the door, on the step—I don't know whether he was asleep; he might be in a fox's sleep—he said, "All right, Mrs. Johnson," and got up and went away—the prisoner came up, and abused me very much—we have a book in which we put down the lodging account, as we keep a lodging-house as well as a public-house; and she said, if she had a knife as long as that, she would rip me open—she threw the book at me, and then she threw some kind of liquid at me; I don't know what it was—I went to a doctor—this is the dress I was wearing at the time (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—when she threw it, I stooped, and it went over my skirt; it burnt that, and my finger—she said the meant to take the color out of my face, for I had been in the house four years, and I still held the same color—the man that I had sprinkled with water came and pulled her out of the place—she had been in the house drinking, about five minutes before.</p>

I live at the Rose and Crown—I was there on Wednesday night, 1st July, standing at the bar—I saw Mrs. Johnson sprinkling water about—this lady (the prisoner) came into the bar and abused Mrs. Johnson; and called her everything she could think of, in very abusive language—Mrs. Johnson said, "What is this for, I don't understand what you mean?"—she said, "Oh, I will let you know what I mean"—she took a vase off the mantlepiece, and threw it at Mrs. Johnson, and after that she took a bottle out of her bosom, and threw it at her—it was a bottle with some sort of burning stuff inside—Mrs. Johnson leant on one side, and through that it escaped her face; the remainder of it went on her dress, and burnt holes in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Reform Place, Whitecross Street—Hunt is my son—I never knew of his being in trouble before—he was sleeping at home, and was always at his father's—he followed his father's trade of printing, and was going to be apprenticed to it, but he went into the militia from April 9 to May 8, and then came home, and was at home honestly and truly every day, doing odd jobs and selling fish—on June 19 he came in at 4.30 o'clock by my clock, and said, "Mother, have you had your tea?"—I said, "No, I cannot have it till this dozen of work is finished"—I work at braces—we generally have tea at 4.30—I took my work home to Bell Alley, Goswell Street—I went at 5.50—my son was then in the house holding his sister's child in his lap, which was very bad with diarrhoea, and by the time I returned home with a loaf and butter it was 6.30 by St. Luke's clock—his sister was with him she helped me to finish the braces—he sat down to tea with us, and did not go out till 7 or 8.</p>

I am married—my child was ill with diarrhoea—my brother took off his coat, and I said, "Will you hold the baby, and we shall be able to do the work quicker"—he took my child in his arms—we finished work about 5.50, and by the time my mother returned with the loaf it was 6.20—she had gone out with the braces—I was with my brother all the time—I did not go to the Mansion House—the policeman did not ask me any questions, my mother asked him to come into the room, but he would not.</p>

I am one of the Sanitary Inspectors of the City of London—I was formerly a butcher—I have a knowledge of animals—it is part of my duty to visit Newgate Market—Mr. Fisher, the collector and inspector, is also engaged in a similar duty—on the morning of 6th May last, ray attention was drawn to two hampers outside the shop of Mr. Coward,</p>

               <p>a meat salesman, in Newgate Market—they were not then unpacked—they were the ordinary hampers used for sending meat by railway—the legs were protruding from the hampers—that drew my attention to them, and I had them taken into the shop and opened—the meat was in a very wet and inflamed state, very bad indeed—the wetness indicates disease—the inflammation was obvious—I took the label off one of the hampers, and produce it—the other hamper had a similar label; I have not got that.</p>

               <p>with straw—I have always known the defendant as a respectable dealer in the market; I have nothing at all to say against him—I hare known meat sent up, examined by the salesman, and then found to be unfit for food; it does not necessarily follow that because it is sent the salesman will sell it, he exercises his judgment upon it—if he finds it is not in a proper condition a respectable man would not sell it—I have never known it sold as cat's meat; he would inform the inspector that he had meat of a doubtful cha<lb/>racter, and if bad ho would take it away and it would be destroyed; car<lb/>bonic acid is put upon it to prevent its being used in any way—for aught I know that course might hare been taken in this case, or it might have been made into sausages, if it had escaped me—I have had a good deal of ex<lb/>perience in dead meat, not much in cow-calwing—I have heard that one of the witnesses in this case has stated that he killed the cow to save its life; I believe that to have been the case; that is, it would have died if it had not been killed—that would make no difference in the meat, in the state in which these cows were—I could tell by the carcase how the animal must have suffered previous to its death—in my opinion the meat must have been unfit when it started—I have never examined a cow that has died from calv<lb/>ing, I only speak from an inspection of the meat in the market—it does make a difference in the appearance of the flesh whether the cow has been killed while in the process of calving, or whether it is allowed to die naturally, it depends upon how near death the throat is out, it is a question of degree—I have often been sent for by salesmen to inspect neat to see whether it was fit, and I have frequently passed it as being fit—salesmen do not like to run any risk, and they often send to us when there is really no necessity—if the defendant had sent to me to look at this I should have con<lb/>demned it, and reported it to the commissioners—he did not ask me to look at it; I think I ordered the hampers inside before he had the opportunity; he deals in veal, I believe this was his first transaction hi beef—I could form a judgment of what the value of these carcases would have been in the mar<lb/>ket, had they been healthy; they are sold without the head and offal; that makes a very trifling difference, it might perhaps, make the difference of about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one cow—all the eight quarters were unfit; they were all very bad, as bad as any I ever had—all the meat was unfit, and very bad indeed.</p>

On Sunday evening, June 7, about 6.25, I was on duty in a field close by the North Kent Railway, in plain clothes—a bridge crosses the railway there—I saw the prisoners and two other boys, and while I was watching them an up train passed on the Chatham and Dover line—I saw them throw at it, and saw a stone strike the carriages and rebound from them, Gray was on the stonework, and Parker on the ironwork—they both threw several stones at the train—a down train passed at the same time, and I saw Gray throw a large white stone, about the size of a man's fist, it missed the driver and struck the funnel of the engine—they were directly over the engine—I was about twenty yards from them—I went towards them, and they ran away—Gray, knowing me, stopped and said, "It is all right, Mr. Ling, we have all done so"—I afterwards took Parker in Charles Street, and told him the charge—he said, "I will prove you are all liars"—Harvey was one of the boys with them, but he did not throw at the train.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Osborne Terrace, Clapham—the prisoner was in my service for five days—on 29th May, I went to business at 8.15, and left my wife and children at home; one of my children is two<lb/>and-a-half years old, and the other a little one in arms; I had a nurse who had been with me since November—I was sent for at 1 o'clock, and got home at 1.20—I found my house in the possession of the police and firemen—I went over the premises, and in the lumber room found a portion of a hamper which had been burnt, and some charred straw—that was on the ground floor—there was also some fire-wood there not burnt—it had no business there—under the kitchen stairs I found two old chairs, two or three bundles of fire-wood, some tinder-paper and rags, all up together in a heap—the chairs were charred through, and part of the wood burnt—there were marks on the stairs such as would be produced by a candle being held to them—I then went on to the drawing room stairs—the banisters were split as if done with a knife, in two places, and there were marks of a candle—there were pieces of candle sticking in the wood—I found a hole in the wall, a little higher up, with matches and candle—it was only big enough to put two or three fingers in; it did not go through the wall—there were marks of burning round the hole—I went into the drawing room—I had locked the door in the morning when I opened the window—there were no signs of burning then—in the bed room the bed was all burnt, and the hangings on one side—I saw this candle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) found in the bed room—we have gas all over the house, and never use candles—when the prisoner came I had not time to go for her character—her former employer, Mr. Monnery, where.</p>

I am nurse in the service of Mr. Mell—on 29th May, about 11.30, I heard knocks at the street door—I was going down stairs, and noticed smoke coming up the staircase—I called out, "Where does this smoke come from"—there was no answer—I went up, and ran to Mrs. Mell's bedroom—the little boy was with her—the baby was in the nursery—I was down stairs at 10.45, in the kitchen—I went up stairs, but saw no signs of fire there—I ran down stairs with the baby, and found the little boy on the landing, by the drawing room door, playing with the handle—it was locked then—I then passed through the hall, and went into the street—the hall was full of smoke—I had seen the prisoner last at 10.45,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186807060065"/>
               <p>she was then in the kitchen with me—I spoke to her again at 11.30—she had gone to mistress's bedroom with a cup of cocoa—that was before I saw the smoke—about the time I went into the street, I saw a gentleman carrying a basket of flaming straw—he threw it out of the door—I saw the prisoner bring some clothes to the door, and throw them out—I saw her in the dining-room first, after the fire—I said, "I wonder how this happened"—she said, "I don't know"—I went and looked in the coal<lb/>cellar, and found it full of smoke—that was under the lumber room—I afterwards went to the drawing-room, and found that full of smoke—up<lb/>stairs, I found a chair burning by the side of the fireplace—there was no fire in the grate—I had been in my bedroom in the morning; it was all safe then—about 4 or 5 o'clock I went in again, and saw my dressing<lb/>gown lying across the bed, with a hole burnt in it—the bed was scorched at the foot.</p>

I am an architect, and live next door to the prosecutor, at 12, Osborne Terrace—my attention was called to his house—I looked over the wall and saw smoke—I got over and went into the house—the smoke was coming from a wing of the house—I went into the basement and saw the prisoner in one of the rooms below, doing some work—I said "Do you know the house is on fire?"—she said "No"—I said "Well it is, and show me where the water is and I will help to put it out"—it was sometime in the forenoon, I don't know exactly the time—I went up stairs and the prisoner went with me—I took up a pail of water—I opened the lumber room door and threw in the water as quick as I could, it was fall of smoke but I could see no flames—I called in two or three men to get some more water, and as I threw some more into the lumber room I saw a flicker of fire in a basket of straw—I went in and took up the hamper and threw it into the street—it was burning then—I went to the front drawing room and found an easy chair burning—the room was open then—the chair was standing by itself, a little way from the fire<lb/>place—I also found some clothes burning, and when I went down I asked the prisoner if she had taken those clothes upstairs—she said "No"—I</p>
