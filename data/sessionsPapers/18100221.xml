No, I did not find him until the 18th of January; at last I found out where he lodged, I applied to the office and got a search warrant; I went to his lodgings in Bunhill-row, and there I found the articles mentioned in the indictment.

               <p>Q. Did you examine to see how he got in - A. He had opened the doors and left them open. When I seized him we both fell down stairs, and then I observed both the doors open.</p>
               <p>Q. Do both of the doors lead into the yard - A. Yes:</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner taken into custody - A. Yes; I kept him till the watchman came, and Donaldson the officer; then I delivered him up to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210005"/>Q. You say you had hasped the doors, did you try them after you had hasped them to see whether they were fast - A. No, I did as I always do, I put them to close.</p>
               <p>Q. So, that if the hasp had missed, if any body pushed, they might open them - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By a hasp, I suppose, you mean a common latch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at your own clothes, the black coat and waistcoat, and pair of stockings - A. I know them to be mine, they were made for me, there are no marks to them; the handkerchief was in my coat pocket, that is marked.</p>
               <p>Q. From what part of the room were they taken - A. Just by the foot of the bed, upon a box; they were the clothes that I had worn the day before. I had taken them off about an hour and a half before.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two doors, were they both outward doors - A. One door leads into the accompting-house, the other is the landing to the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is only one outward door, and the outer door was only upon the hasp - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shut-to, both - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been in trouble, I came out, I had no where to go to; the two handkerchiefs I had on my arm, that is the only thing I had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (to Hodgson.) You say he had upon his arm your coat, waistcoat, and stockings - A. Yes; he had got two of Davidson's handkerchiefs putting into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he endeavour to get away - A. Yes. He got my two fingers into his mouth; he almost bit one off.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did the clothes, when he and you fell down, fall down with you - A. Yes, about three yards down the stairs.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at Mr. Kendall's on Friday last - A. Yes; I slept there with Hodgson. I went to bed about half past nine o'clock, as near as I can tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you alarmed in the course of the night - A. Hodgson jumped out of bed about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before I saw this man, he looked about, then he thought it was only the carriages going about; he got into bed again. I was afterwards alarmed by a light. I saw a man standing with a candle in his hand, he had both these coats, this waistcoat, and a pair of stockings, that I have in my hand, over his arm, and three handkerchiefs that I had taken off my neck. I saw him reach them, put his hand under his coat, and put them into his pocket. I just looked a moment, I stepped out of bed, he never saw me, his back was towards me. I took my fist and knocked him down, I fell into the other room, about three steps. I came back again, and Hodgson had hold of his collar; he fell down with him. I went to them, and shut this man and Hodgson in the staircase. I got outside.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got down you found the door open, did you not - A. Yes. I got down and shut them in. I gave the alarm, the watchman came up. I kept the door shut till two or three men came; we then took hold of him, brought him into the yard, then the watchman came; he was taken to Bow-street; he was never out of my sight until he came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the clothes that he had on his arm were your's - A. Yes; they were the clothes that I had worn the day before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going into the bed-room to sleep.</p>
               <p>- CALLIGAN. I am a watchman. When I came into Mr. Kendall's yard I took the prisoner into custody. I searched him, he resisted me; these handkerchiefs I took out of his pocket. I have had these handkerchiefs ever since; they were in his right hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Davidson.) Look at these handkerchiefs - A. They are my handkerchiefs; this stuffer was too broad, I cut it off. They were all rolled together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all of the handkerchiefs: I was going to bed.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. (to Hodgson.) Were there any other bed in the room besides that you and Davidson were sleeping in - A. No, there was another bed in the room adjoining. One of the post-boys slept there, his name is

I went up stairs to go into the two-pair, I met Passmore coming down the garret stairs; I asked him, if Dudley, another workman, was in the two-pair; he seemed very much confused, which made me take notice of him, and in a faultering voice he stammered out, I do not know. I asked him, if Elijah, another workman, was upstairs; he recovered himself a little by that time, he answered me, No; then he went down. The prisoner had nothing to do at that time upstairs, nor for a great while before: he ought to have been at work below in the vault. The next morning Mr. Williams acquainted me of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Williams.) I forgot to ask you, whether the prisoner had the day before borrowed any money of you - A. Yes, a one pound note; he told me, that he was low in circumstances, that his wife had wrote to him for two guineas, he could not make it up, he should be obliged to me for a one pound note towards it, he would work it out. I lent him the one pound note.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I have known the prisoner eighteen months. On the 20th of January, he came into my mother's room, where I was, No. 17, Oxford-buildings. He brought a coat, two waistcoats, and a pair of breeches. He asked my mother's leave to let them be there while he went and fetched a trunk, she gave him leave, he went and brought in a leathern trunk; he said, I will put the things into the trunk, and I will leave them here awhile, by your leave; he took the key, and went away. The trunk had his initials, T. P. upon it. He came again on the Monday, about five o'clock in the evening, and brought some more clothes: I believe, they were women's clothes. He put them into the trunk, he locked the trunk, and took the key, and away he went. On the next evening I saw him again, he had a bundle with him; he put it in the trunk, and went away. I produced the things to Mr. Williams on the same evening that the prisoner was in custody.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of January, in Oxford-buildings, within a door or two of the witness mother's house. I told him what I apprehended him for; he said, he knew nothing about it. I found upon him this watch. It is not the prosecutor's watch; it is a silver watch. He said, he gave fifteen shillings for the duplicate; the watch had been in pawn for two pounds. In his box were six seven-shilling pieces, thirty-six shillings in silver, and about ten shillings in halfpence. On the next day, we went with a search warrant to No. 17, where Neale lived; there we found this trunk (it has T. P. upon it), and all the articles described by the last witness; the articles consists of new mens' and womens' apparel; the whole together are worth between fifteen and twenty pounds. When I had found the things, the prisoner said to me, you old file, what can you do, there is nothing there that you can swear to.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Friday, the 9th of January, about ten minutes past seven in the evening, (it was dark), in consequence of information, I went out of the shop and saw the prisoner taking out this diaper table-cloth with his right hand, and he was holding his coat with his left hand, to hinder people from seeing him, as I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it taken out - A. Out of a pane of glass in the shop window, which he had cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him cut that pane of glass - A. I did not. I saw him taking out this cloth; I seized him by the collar, he had not got it quite out. I dragged him into the shop. When I laid hold of him he let go the cloth. When I got him into the shop, I gave him into the care of Mr. Young, an attorney, until I went and fetched Mr. Foy, the officer.</p>


               <p>Q. Where was the diaper table-cloth - A. It was laid against the window, not against the square that he cut, the square next to it; it was on the railing of the window, to shew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he removed it from the place where it was -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210007"/>A. He had entirely removed it from the place, and about one quarter of it was out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed that pane of glass before this - A. The same pane of glass had been cut four nights before, there was no hole, there was a crack in it before. I walked round the window, which I usually do; there were lamps suspended to the window, in order to shew the goods. About half an hour or an hour before it was whole, except the crack; the piece was not out.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he appear to be doing - A. He was pressing himself against the window, and spreading his great coat I suspected he was at no good. I walked backwards and forwards near the shop, and saw him cutting the glass; I could not see what he was cutting it with. I saw the glass going as he pressed. I could not see any thing in his hand.

               <p>Q. The whole pane was not quite out, was it - A. No, only part of it. I went in the shop and informed the last witness Portington, he came out immediately, I saw him drag the prisoner in.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner take any thing out, did you - A. No, I went into the shop immediately I saw him put his hand in; and I saw his hand moving as if cutting the glass.</p>

I stood there about five minutes, and this piece of cloth was standing against the window, I was thinking to go in and let the gentleman know the cloth was standing there, and I thought he would give me sixpence. He came out and said, you rascal, what do you do here. I really think I saved the house from being robbed, instead of robbing it.</p>

I pursued him about three hundred yards, I never missed sight of him; he dropped the sheeting about three or four yards from the door. He was stopped, I gave the alarm, stop thief. He dropped the sheeting in consequence of my holloeing out, what do you want with it, when he came and took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout was the sheeting laying. - A. It was placed near the door, within the door. This is the sheeting, the person that picked it up in the street has brought it here; it has Mr. Richards private mark, it is his property, it is valued at seven pounds. I am sure the prisoner is the person that took it out of the shop. He was stopped and taken to Marlborough-street office.

No; I found the India muslin concealed between the sacking of her bed, and the bed; it was new muslin; I did not miss it until I found it; I had seen it about a week before, I kept it locked up in a trunk in the two pair of stairs bed-room. The china had never been used, I kept it in a store closet. The whole of the articles are worth forty shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. When you returned did you find your door open. - A. No, it was locked and bolted, I knocked at the door a long time, I thought she was asleep. I went to a neighbour's house and borrowed a key and unlocked it. I found it was bolted, I got a man to put a young man over the door, he got inside and unbolted the door; there is an opening over the door, so that any person could get in; he opened the door, and I went in, I found the key in the drawer where I had left it, and the prisoner was gone, the fire was out, and there was a light on the table. I went up stairs and took the man and the boy with me, and several more people. I found some pieces belonging to my gowns, and an apron that were at the bottom of my chest on the bed. I searched the chest, I found there was nothing left in it, the chest had been broken open; I missed all the things in the indictment; they were all taken out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon before this had you seen them. - A. I believe it was the day before that I went up stairs, I went to get something out, I saw them all safe in the chest. From information, I went over Tower-hill in search of the prisoner, and in Barking church-yard I found her, she was standing against a door, she pulled a girl upon her to hide herself from me; I knew her by my pellise that she had on, and a gown, cap, and tippet; I catched hold of her and holloed out, watch, he came directly; she had got a large bundle with her. Follingwood, the watchman, took her to the watchhouse and the bundle with her; the things are all here.</p>

The woman of the house informed me he was gone, he only took the lodging that morning; on my coming home I met Mr. Cooper in Aldgate, I told him the check was refused at the banking house; he said, no, it must be a mistake; I said, he must return back with me or give me the money; he said, he was booked at the coach, he was going into the country, I must go with him to a friend of his, he would borrow the money; he took me to a coffee house, told me to stop at the door while he went in; I told him I should not leave him; he said, I was an impertinent fellow, he would not go in, the porter was with me, I sent the porter for a constable, and afterwards he walked very pleasantly with me; the porter lost sight of me. At last the prisoner went into the Commercial-road, there I charged<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210009"/>the watch with him, and he gave charge with me; he threw the gun on my toes, he got out of the watchman's hands; he was pursued and taken to the watchhouse, and from there to Lambeth-street office.</p>

            . I am a patrol; about six o'clock on Saturday evening, I had been to the ward beadle, for the key of the watchhouse: going from there to the watch-house, I saw three men that I knew perfectly well to frequent the Ward; I saw them go up a court opposite the watchhouse; I unlocked the watchhouse door. I saw the carman stop his cart, then I pushed the watch-house door open, and run backwards and got the cutlass down, and coming to the door again, I saw three men nearly close to the cart; one of them was on the pavement, and the other two, the prisoner was one of them, pulled the truss of goods off the cart. I immediately threw the cutlass down in the watchhouse on a bench, ran out and seized the prisoner by the skirts of his coat, or the collar, I cannot be sure which now, and he dropped the goods. I immediately called out, a thief, a thief, in case the others should come and rescue him from me; by that time the carman came up; he was the next man that laid hold of him. The prisoner then pleaded that he did not know any thing of it, nor was he the man that dropped it when I catched hold of him; he had it in his arms, and would have got it on his shoulder, if I had left him a minute. I then sent for an officer, I never let him go until I took him to the officer's house, and searched him, which was near to the spot; I gave the goods into the possession of

On the 8th of February, about eight o'clock in the evening, I had occasion to wait upon a barrister in Lincoln's Inn. On return a quarter before nine, I found the people in my house in a state of consternation, on account of a robbery that had been committed. I found, by my foreman, that the house had been robbed of a quantity of unfinished work which was going from my press. It is a new work I am printing for Mr. Longman, called the Scottish Chiefs, to be published in five volumes; it has never been out of my hands; there was no other person could be in possession of it; I lost, as near as I can guess, a thousand sheets. On the morning after, I went out in search of the property; I went to Mr. Jones, a cheesemonger in Fleet-market; at the far end of the shop I saw a bundle tied up; I discovered it to be a part of this property; and my suspicion fell upon the prisoner.</p>

My suspicion fell upon him in consequence of his having frequently applied for work, and generally on an evening. I got a search warrant, and the officer Hawkins found out where he worked; we searched his lodgings and found nothing; we took the prisoner from his work, and then requested him to come to Mr. Jones's, the cheesemonger; and when we took him into Mr. Jones's parlour, Mr. Jones recognised him to be the person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. In what part of your printing shop had this paper been placed. - A. In my wareroom; I did not place it there, I knew it was stored there. They were missed by my foreman; when I came in, he pointed out the sheet, and said, we are robbed again, this sheet is gone.</p>

            . I am a cheesemonger, No. 5, Fleet-market. On the 8th of this month, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner came in, and asked the shop-man whether I could buy any waste paper; I was called out; I told him to wait, as I was busy telling some silver; they told me the gentleman was in a hurry; I said, then send him in; the prisoner came in to me, I asked him what he wanted a pound for the paper; he said, five-pence; I looked at it; I said, these are regular sheets; he answered, they had been misprinted; I said, it was not the paper that exactly suited my trade, it would not hold the brine; he replied, perhaps you wish to have some old ledgers or bill books; I said, that is the paper that is suitable to me; I said, I would give him fourpence halfpenny, he took it; it weighed eighteen pound, I told him to take it in the shop; my son weighed it, and paid him six shillings and ninepence for it. I am sure the prisoner is the man, and that is the paper; he told me he had sold a great deal to Mr. Skinner, the tobacconist. Mr. M'Creery called on me on the next morning; I told him I would be at home about two o'clock. He brought the prisoner in, and another man very much like him; I pointed out the prisoner, I am positive the prisoner is the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of it; at the time that Mr. M'Creery was robbed, I was at home; when the officer came to take me in custody, he said, take no notice to your fellow workmen, I have a warrant against you. There was nothing found in my possession at all, I had nothing but a five shilling piece. When Mr. M'Creery took me down to Mr. Jones, there was another person that looked like me; Mr. Jones did not know which of us it was; he took my hat out of my hand; he said, he knew me by the silk hat, and he observed, that I was genteelly dressed when I brought it. My earnings is thirty-six shillings a week; I have had several situations. I did not go to Mr. M'Creery's to work, because I was told he was a particular man, and that I should be like a negro there. No man has stood more to his work than I have done; every body, that knows me is surprized that such a thing should have happened.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Dunstan's. On the first of February, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, I was sent for to Mrs. Pettit's, a haberdasher; she said, she saw the prisoner cutting her shop window, with two more boys with him; she ran out of the shop and took the prisoner and another boy, the other ran away. I searched the prisoner and found six gold rings upon him and this knife, that he said he cut the window with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say, that he cut the window - A. Yes, the boy said he cut the window with this knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to induce him to say this -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210011"/>A. I asked him, what the use of this knife was; he said, it was what they cut the window with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the window cut at Mr. Gould's - A. Yes, a small bit was cut out, a child might get his hand in.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr. Gould.) This window of yours, when had you seen it whole - A. It was cut on the over night, but not broken; it was as sound as the other part, I had it fastened with putty. They came the next morning, and forced another part out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that the window was whole - A. It was whole, though it was cut on the overnight.</p>
               <p>Q. How large was the hole - A. About two inches square; and the tray where the rings were for shew, came against the edge of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were taken out that day - A. I am certain they were taken out that day, I had not missed them above a quarter of an hour. I had sent for a glazier, and they were bringing the boy by before the glazier could put the square in.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose shop was this that he was endeavouring to break open - A. Mrs. Pettits, No. 150.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not observed him before your shop, had you - A. I did not take notice.</p>

               <p>Q. Where had you been dining - A. At the Virginia Coffee-house, Cornhill. I had drank rather more wine than I usually take. Between Holborn-hill and Middle-row, near Middle-row, the prisoner addressed himself to me; he said, that he had got boots to sell to gentlemen, he could supply gentlemen with superior boots much under the usual prices. I said, if he was a good workman and would give me his address, I would call and look at them; he mentioned something about Tottenham-court-road; I do not think that he mentioned any street or place; he continued walking by the side of me towards my own house, and going through a passage, I think it is called Red Lion-passage, leading into Red Lion-square; he said something about the particular mode of cutting boots at the present time, and proposed to call at a coffee-house that is in the passage, to have something to drink. I do not recollect what particular we had to drink, nor do I recollect that I went into the house, but I went near the bar. We left there, and proceeded up Red Lion-square and up King-street, until we came near the end of <placeName id="t18100221-17-crimeloc101">Bloomsbury-place</placeName>

               <p>Court. What pocket was it - A. My right hand breeches pocket. Having discovered his intention, I resolved to be more watchful of him; it made me more collected. I then, opposite the end of Bloomsbury-place, crossed the way and bid him good night, expecting by that means to get rid of him; he crossed over after me, and not wishing that he should follow me up to my own door, seeing what sort of a character he was, I went up Southampton-row, and then along the south side of Russell-square, till I came to the end of Bedford-place; I there told him I could say nothing more to him upon the subject of boots and shoes, bid him good night, to go home; I turned down Bedford-place towards Bloomsbury-square; he still kept importuning me about the boots and shoes till I came to the end of Bedford-place, next Bloomsbury-square, near to my own house; I turned round to him and desired him to go away. I looked over my shoulder to see if I could see a watchman.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. By this time perhaps you got quite sober - A. Yes, at that instant I was collected; he made a dash at me, got hold of the seal and chain, and snatched it away; he did it with considerable force, he broke the seal and chain off, the ring gave way, I thought he had got watch and all at first. I called out watch, and followed him, he ran towards Russell-street; I collared him at No. 21, he collared me, a scuffle ensued, I never lost sight of him, he never was above four yards from me; I threw him down, I saw the seal and chain in his hand, and finding himself overpowered he resigned it up, and wished to get away; I laid hold of his hand and took the seal and chain out. The watchman came up at that instant, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. When he snatched the watch, did not you both fall down together - A. No, I threw him down.</p>
               <p>Q. It was very frosty weather at that time - A. No it was very wet.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know whether you can undertake to say it was not an accidental occurrence of him endeavouring to snatch it from you, to save himself from falling - A. No, it was quite the contrary; he continued wrestling with me when he was down, he was undermost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he charge the watchman with you - A. No, I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>- BAXTER. I am the watch-house keeper. I produce the seal, key and chain; it was given to me by this gentleman at the time the prisoner was brought.</p>

On the 17th of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and purchased a small quantity of print; she paid for it; she went away and took the print with her. On being informed by a lady that a woman was going up the street with a piece of flannel in her arms, I immediately pursued the prisoner, I came up with her about four hundred yards distance,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210012"/>she had hid herself in a court, she had the flannel with her, I apprehended her and took the flannel from her. I gave the flannel to one of our people, they mixed it with the others, it was impossible for me to pick it out; I knew it to be my employer's property, it had our private mark on it, I kept it in my possession till I went to Marlborough-street; I then identified it, and then I gave it to the boy; he put it among other flannels. I had seen it half an hour before it was taken away; I am certain it was our flannel, it had our private mark which I had made myself; it was placed about eight feet from our door; there are twelve pieces of flannel placed at the end of the counter. At the time the prisoner took the flannel, there were no other customers in the shop besides three or four young men that belong to the shop and me. At the time that I took the flannel from the prisoner, she was in the utmost distress of mind; she has a husband and four children. I am confident in my own mind, that nothing but the utmost distress could have drove her to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of these young men here that were in the shop with you. - A. No, I am the only witness in this case, I value the flannel at twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

            . I am a lamp-lighter. On Wednesday in the afternoon about a quarter before five, I was crossing down Strand-lane, I saw the prisoner leading the prosecutor. I passed him about thirty yards. I heard the cry of stop-thief. I ran up the lane again. I saw the prosecutor lying on the ground; I picked him up, and he being intoxicated in liquor, I put him against a house. He said he was robbed of his watch; the soldier was gone. I pursued the soldier across the Strand into Windsor-court; when I came there he had been down stairs, and came up again into the passage of the house, No. 6, Windsor-court.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were pursuing him, was he out of your sight at all - A. He was; I am certain he is the same man, I took notice of him as he was leading the man down the lane. The officer searched him; he found nothing; another officer came, he told him that he had secreted the watch in the dust-hole, he went and got it. I went down stairs and saw the watch found; the prisoner was taken to Bow-street.</p>

I seized him as he was coming out of No. 6, Windsor-court. I held him until Read the officer came up; I then gave him into the charge of Read. I charged him with stealing the watch, he denied it, the officer searched him and found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you afterwards to find the watch. - A. Some person or other said, you had better tell and you shall go about your business. He took Limbrick the officer, and shewed him where the watch was.</p>

            . Q. Did the prisoner ever come to your shop - A. Yes. On Wednesday, the 24th of January, he came to look at some diamond rings and other diamond articles; he looked at a pair of diamond earrings at six guineas; he said, he would take them with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210014"/>him; I declined, not knowing him. He looked out things to the amount of about 250 l. He said, he would call the next day, my uncle not being in the way; he went away, he told me that his name was Harvey, of Wimpole-street. He came again on Friday, and looked over some articles, my uncle was present at that time; he said, he wished we would get him a diamond necklace to the value of about two hundred and fifty pounds; my uncle said, he would do that. He desired my uncle to wait upon him, in Wimpole-street, on the Monday. He said he would take a ring and a broach with him as part of the articles, and if he did not keep them we would not feel ourselves hurt, and he would let us know on the Monday if he meant to keep them. He was to give forty pounds for the broach and ring if he kept them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he agree for the other articles - A. Yes: there was a diamond watch and chain for one hundred guineas, a diamond ring at eight guineas and a half, and several other articles that I cannot recollect. I think the amount altogether, including the broach and ring, is two hundred and fifty pounds. We were to send these things on Monday next, between the hours of eleven and two, to No. 11, Wimpole-street, and to deliver them to himself, Mr. Harvey, he said his name was. He went away with the broach and ring.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on the Monday - A. No; my uncle went. I went and made enquiries on the Saturday at the house, if Mr. Harvey lived there; a woman servant informed me, No; they did not know such a person; Dr. Heath kept the house.</p>

            . On Tuesday, the 23d, there was a sale at Mr. Phillips's, in Bond-street; it consisted of plate, diamonds, watches, and various jewellery; which sale I attended. Mr. Chamberlain was at the sale, I never saw him before, he stood the next person to me. A Mrs. Williams, of Wimpole-street, said to me, Mr. Davis, have you got one of your cards in your pocket, I presented her with one, and Mr. Chamberlain said, I will thank you for one of your cards; I gave him one. He then informed me, that he was partial to diamonds, and a great buyer of them, and that he should be a good customer, and he should come to my house on the next day. On Friday he came to my shop, some things were shewn to him which he had looked out, and the price agreed for two hundred and fifty pounds odd, and two hundred pounds before. After that Mr. Chamberlain told me, if I would come on Monday to No. 11, Wimpole-street, he would pay me for these: I was to bring the articles myself. He said his name was Harvey. I shewed him a diamond ring and a sapphire broach, set round with diamonds, he liked them very much; he said, Mr. Davis, I will not buy these, but on Monday I will determine whether I will keep them or not, but do not feel yourself hurt if I do not purchase them. Twenty-six pounds was to be the price of the sapphire broach, and fourteen pounds for the ring, if he had paid for them. He then said, Mr. Davis, you will permit me to put these in my pocket till Monday when you come; I said, certainly, and I presented them to him. He did not say that he would pay me for them, only that on Monday he would determine. Mr. Chamberlain went then away, and had possession of the broach and ring. On the Monday, I went to No. 11, Wimpole-street, according to his appointment; I found that no such person lived there. I then returned to Mr. Phillips's, Bond-street, as Mr. Chamberlain purchased some things there on the day I was at the sale, to see what address he left; he had left there, Mr. Harvey, No. 12, Wimpole-street.</p>

I said, very poorly, go up and see him He did, he came down into my room again. I saw him take a Jew's harp that my child played with; he said, good bye, took hold of my hand, and went, out of the room, saying he would call and pay me next Thursday.

I was coming from the city, and passing by Mrs. Knight's door, she asked me to come in, and after I had been in her room some time, she asked me if I had any money to get her some gin. She desired me to pawn the watch and bring in a pint of gin. I went and pawned the watch. After I came out of there, I met a friend, and spent fifteen pence of Mrs. Knight's money. Not being willing to go back to Mrs. Knight's, I went to my lodgings to make the money up, and before I could get back again, an Officer came and took me at a Bookseller's in Piccadilly. Mrs. Knight knew that I had the Jew's harp likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Knight. Upon the oath that you have taken, did you give him the watch, and desire him to pledge it - A. I never did, nor did I see him take it down; not a word was said about gin.</p>
               <p>Q. to Humphries. Did he say that he had the watch to pledge for Mrs. Knight - A. No, I charged him with taking the watch, he denied it.</p>

               <p>Q. What is he - A. A Jew, a <rs id="t18100221-26-deflabel150" type="occupation">goldsmith</rs>

I have known him this five or six months, he was in the habit of visiting our house when we kept a public house, I have bought several things of him. The prisoner called at our house about eleven o'clock in the forenoon. Mr. Woodroffe was arrested for one hundred pounds, and the people were all in confusion, expecting to be seized upon for ground rent. I put my plate in a trunk, and locked it up. Mr. Levi came in, and asked what I was crying for. I told him that my husband was arrested. He asked me whether I had any private property that I wished to take care of. I told him I had none, except a small trunk. He said he would take it with him for me; he said, seal it with a guinea. I wished to seal it with my husband's watch seal; he said, no, seal it with a guinea; I said, I could not seal it with a guinea, I had not got one; he put his hands in his pocket, and pulled out a guinea, and he sealed it with a guinea; that is all I know. When the trunk came home, the seal was not in the same place, and there were sixteen crown pieces taken out of the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me what was in the trunk. - A. Eight silver table spoons, and a milk pot, two pair of silver sugar tongs, two pair of salt spoons, a bundle of muslin and lace, six babie's caps, two muslin gowns; and a sarsnett pellise, and some babie's bed gowns, sixteen crowns were in a small white box, four yards of lace, and two yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210016"/>and a half of muslin, and other things that I do not recollect; the box was brought home by my servant girl, on Monday the 29th, about six o'clock in the evening; when she brought home the box, the seal was broken, and it was not sealed in the same place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was missing from the box when it was brought home. - A. Two yards and a half of muslin, four yards of lace, sixteen crown pieces, two old dollars and about one pound fifteen shillings in other monies; a pair of table spoons were changed, and a child's cap, these things were missing from the box; he desired me to send the servant for the things; I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. With your servant you sent a written order from your husband to give up the box. - A. I did; this is the written order, when the servant went for the box, she told Mr. Levi, that the seal was not in the same place; she saw it sealed.</p>
               <p>Q. Now Mrs. Woodroffe, where was the seal placed - A. On one of the corners, I cannot say which, and when it was brought back, it was sealed almost in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of all the things in the trunk. - A, About forty or fifty pounds.</p>

            . - Q. You are servant to Mr. Woodroffe, are you. - A. Yes; I have lived with him three months.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 25th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning Mr. Levi came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your master. - A. He was in trouble; he was arrested on that day. On that day Mr. Levi came to our house, and seeing my mistress in trouble, she gave him this box; I saw what was put in, it was corded, and sealed at the left hand of the lock with a guinea. I fetched the box on the 29th of January from his house, his wife delivered it to me; she said, you see it is corded and sealed; I said, yes, but not where it was when it went from our house; she made me no answer. I took the box and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from the prisoner's house. - A. We live in Old Ford, and he lives in Ebenezer-square, by Houndsditch. I came home with the box in the Bow stage, and when I brought it home my mistress opened the box perceiving the seal being moved.</p>
               <p>Q. Who spoke first of the seal being moved. - A. That I cannot say, she opened it herself, and found several things missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day was it you went from Levi's house. - A. I suppose about four o'clock; I came home by the five o'clock stage, I stopped at the biscuit shop till the stage came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the biscuit shop. - A. Adjoining the Black Boy and Camel in Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had to wait pretty near an hour, had you. A. I did; Sir, I stopped in the biscuit shop near an hour, I had a shillings worth of biscuit, and waited till the stage came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the box before it was delivered to you - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the box away in that state. A. It was sealed, I supposed that the seal might have given way in carrying it, and he had sealed it afresh, and that the cord had slipped; I had no other idea.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew this place in Leadenhall-street was no great distance from Levi's house. - A. No; the box was heavy, I could not carry it without resting. I was to go by the four o'clock stage, and when I came there it was gone.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What time did you leave Old Ford. - A. It might be a few minutes before two, or a few minutes after. I walked to town from Old Ford, it could not be above half past three when I came to Mr. Levi's; it was only half past four when I got to Leadenhall-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not you have walked from Levi's house to Leadenhall-street in five minutes. - A. No; the box was heavy, I was obliged to stop at every door; I dare say it took me half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went home with the box, your master and mistress said, the seal was not in the right place. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So then you must understand, that if that took place, and any thing was taken out, it must be either Levi or you. - A. I had no keys with me; I did not think any thing about it till it was opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when it was opened, and the things were missing, did not you think that one of you should be laid in fault for it. - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When the trunk was delivered to you, did you say one single word about the seal being in the wrong place. - A. I did, and that I stand to, were I going out of the world now.</p>
               <p>Court. Does Levi live at the end of Houndsditch. - A. No; you go up Gravel-lane to his house, and the Black Boy and Camel; is by the India-house.</p>
               <p>Q. The stage must have passed the end of Houndsditch if you came away from Levi's house at half past three, the stage must have passed you. - A. You cannot get a place first always, without you take it first.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of February, between the hours of six and seven in the evening, I was standing, in company with Eldridge. under a gateway going into Union-court, Holborn-hill; the prisoner passed us with a cask on his shoulder; we followed him a little way up the court and asked him what he had got; he said he had a cask of vinegar, he brought it from the Borough, he was going to take it to Tottenham-court-road to his master; we told him he was going the wrong direction to Tottenham-court-road, we must look at it; I took the cask off his shoulder and Eldridge took hold of him; I looked upon the head of the cask and found there was a permit on it; I then said he must go along with us, I was sure he had not come by it honestly; I took it into a public house in Fleet market, and found it contained brandy; we took him to the Poultry compter, I found out by the permit that it belonged to Messrs. Burnett and Co; I went to them the next morning. The cask is here.</p>

             is my partner. On Friday evening, I think it was the 2nd of February, between seven and eight, I was in the accompting house, I saw the prisoner standing over a tub of butter, his back was towards me, I saw him take up the tub of butter, put it on his shoulder, and run off with it, I run through the shop as fast as I could; immediately I got to the door I called out stop thief in several directions, he ran down Skinner-street with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you follow him - A. No. I turned back for fear another should go.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he is the man - A. I did not see the man's face. I have no doubt that he is the man by his back appearance.</p>

            . I am a brush maker by trade. I was standing at Mr. Hems's window, I saw this man hoist up a firkin of butter on his shoulder, he immediately crossed the road and ran up Skinner-street; I pursued him; when he found he was closely pursued he threw down the tub of butter; a man knocked him down and stopped him; I did not see him stopped; he was brought back. I am sure the prisoner is the man that had the tub of butter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You are a new witness, you were not before the Lord Mayor - A. No, I was not. I was coming by last night and Mr. Hems asked me if I saw this man.</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Studd, oilman, in Bishopsgate-street. I was coming out of my master's house when Mr. Hems cried out stop thief. I asked Mr. Hems which way the man was gone; Mr. Hems being confused did not tell which way the man was gone, and I being confused, and having a cask stole the night before; I ran up Skinner-street, I saw the man running with something like a trunk on his shoulder, I did not know what it was till I came close to him, then I saw it was a tub, and just as I got to the side of him I heard the tub fall on the road, I turned round and saw the cask rolling from the middle of the road into the kennel; I still kept my eyes on the prisoner and pursued him; he was stopped by two men coming down the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man who dropped the tub - A. Yes; because there was no other man near.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. It is very odd - you say you were confused, and all of you were so confused you took a cask for a trunk - A. When I came to it I found it was a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him - A. Only while I turned my head to look at the cask.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Please you, my lord, I had been into Red Lion-street, Spitalfields, and after that I came from Union-street into Bishopsgate-street; my wife was with me; she said she would go to buy some things to bring home for tea, she asked me to get the kettle to boil, I said I would; I crossed the way and went on to Skinner-street, which is my nearest way home; when I got four or five hundred yards down Skinner-street I heard the cry of stop thief; I had not gone far before a man rushed by me and ran down Angel-alley, in a few minutes after I was laid hold of, and knocked down; my eye was swelled up with the blow, I thought I should have lost it; I was never in the gentleman's shop nor on the side the shop was, after I came out of Sun-street.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. I had a search warrant; I searched the prisoner's lodgings on Thursday the 8th of this month; and in a closet up stairs, I found this jar of sugar; after that I went and apprehended the prisoner in the sugar-house. I challenged him with having stolen the sugar; he denied it; I asked him how he could tell such a falsity. When I had got his wife and the sugar in custody, he then begged that he might see his master; he hoped he would forgive him; he only took it for his own use. I weighed it; it was six pounds and three quarters.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTOR. This is the kind of sugar that we use, and that we lost; it is unmanufactured sugar.</p>

            . I am a bookseller. On the 9th or 10th of this month, the prisoner offered me three or four books for sale; I asked whose they were; she said they belonged to a gentleman that was gone abroad; he had mispacked his things, and what few things were left were theirs. I bought the books, and placed them in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for them - A. Three shillings. Mr. Laycock, a bookseller, came in and informed me, that I had three or four books in my windows that were stolen from a bookseller in Panton-street in the evening. Mr. Maynard came in and brought the books that corresponded with them four books I bought, and the other the prisoner brought on the Friday following. I was not at home. The witness Latham took the book in. I came in soon after; he told me the prisoner had left the book, and was to call in half an hour. I went to Mr. Maynard, and informed him. These are the volumes she brought to me the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the woman that brought them the first time - A. Yes.</p>

We shewed different patterns to Barnett; the other was standing in the middle of the shop. Barnett bought three yards and a half of printed cotton; she was to give eighteen-pence a yard for it; she had it put by for her, and gave one shilling in part of payment. There was one pattern in particular shewed her she said she would not have it a gift. The prisoner Larkin was looking at some buttons, and asking the price of them; she said she would call the next morning; then they went away together. After they were gone, we missed the same pattern that Barnett said she would not have it a gift.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you miss it after they were gone - A. About an hour, there were twenty-five yards of it; it was lying on the counter while Barnett was there; she pushed it of one side with her hand. About an hour after they were gone, we wanted that same piece to shew to a customer; then we found it was gone. I have not found the whole twenty-five yards; it was cut in pieces; I can only swear it is exactly the same pattern.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended both the prisoners on Friday evening last at the Crown public house, Pie-street, Westminster. Larkin and her husband were sitting together; Larkin asked me if I was looking after him; I told him no, I was looking for the woman sitting by the side of him; I did not know it was his wife at the time. Barnett came in; I said here they are both. They both asked me what I wanted with them; I said if they would go to their lodgings, I would tell them; they both lodged in one house, about three doors off. We went to their lodgings. I asked Larkin, if she did not recollect being at a linen-draper's shop the night before in Tothil-street; she said she had never been in any linen-draper's shop in Tothill-street; I then said, yes you were: and you, Barnet, bought a piece of cotton for which you paid a shilling off; and Larkin had pawned it at Mr. Hill's; she said no, she had not; I said I should take her to Mr. Hill's, and if they did not know her, I should give her no further trouble. She then said she pawned a bit of cotton at Mr. Hill's that the other young woman had given her; I searched Larkin's apartment, and found nothing. Larkin lived in the parlour below, and Barnett up stairs over the parlour, and as soon as Barnett got into her room, I saw her catch this piece of cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210020"/>up; she endeavoured to push it under the bed; I told her this was what I wanted, and I should detain them both. I took it from her; I have had it ever since the next morning; I discovered a piece of the same pattern at Graham and Stocks, pawnbrokers in Stratton-ground. The piece of cotton I took from Barnett was about a yard.</p>

            . I am an officer. Me and my partner, Forrester, were coming away from Petticoat-lane on Thursday the 18th of January, about seven in the evening; he noticed a man going past us; he said, Kinnersley, that man has got something secreted under his coat; I pursued him and stopped him in Petticoat-lane; I asked him what he had got there, he said some monkeys skins; he bought them in East Smithfield of a jew; my partner came up; I enquired what he was going to do with them, he said, do not you know me, my name is Cooper, I used to watch for you. He was a watchman in our ward. I asked him what he was going to do with these skins, he said he was going to make money of them; I let him go; he being a poor man, and knowing him, I thought what he said was true. After I left him I was rather sorry I had not stopped him and made some further enquiries into it, and on the Saturday following I was going to the watchhouse, I said to a person that recommended him for a watchman that I had met him with some skins; he replied he knew all about it, he had sold two dozen to a jew for twenty-four shillings, and he advised the jew not to buy any more of him, as he worked for a respectable gentleman in Leadenhall-street, and he must have stolen them; I went to Mr. Dyster, and when I was called into the accompting house, I said, Cooper, do not you recollect me stopping you with these skins; yes, he said, I do - how came you by them? he said a jew sent for him at the warehouse down to the waterside to purchase these skins. One of the gentlemen said, how could he tell such a story; he was very much agitated, and then he said he only stole two half dozens. The master then gave me charge of him, I lodged him in the Compter, and then I went to his house in Little Middlesex-street, Petticoat-lane; I went up two pair of stairs, I searched the room and found these skins; there are ten dozen all but one. Some were under the bed.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed - A. About a quarter before two in the morning, my husband and me went to bed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house shut up, and secured when you went to bed - A. Yes, there were three or four excise officers in the house when we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they sleep there - A. No; there is always one or other of them there all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember your back parlour window - A. Yes; the back parlour window, I fastened myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you disturbed in the night after you went to bed by any noise - A. Yes, my husband told me of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210021"/>Q. How did you fasten the back parlour window. - A. I fastened the parlour window with Iron bolts, I shut the parlour window myself; the staircase window was bolted inside.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it that you was awoke by your husband, and he said, there was a noise. - A. He awoke me, and said, there was a noise; I said, I dare say it was the excisemen.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Did you hear it. - A. No; my husband heard the noise, I did not, we went to sleep, we were disturbed by Mr. Fox, the exciseman, at six o'clock we got some information that the house was broken open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was it dark then. - A. Yes; it was dark, we got up immediately; we found the back door with the pully cut off, and thrown into the yard adjoining, that is White-Lion yard, the cell of the back parlour window, where the shutters slide in, was pulled entirely down; it is a very large window, one of the sashes were open, and the other shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you lost. - A. We lost a great many things; boots, shoes, and gowns.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen a great quantity of goods that have been produced to you. - A. I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many boots and shoes you lost. A. I cannot speak to them, my husband can better speak to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You did not go to bed till a quarter to two. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went to bed, there were three or four excisemen up - A. I spoke to one when I went up.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they all to stay there all night, or to go away. - A. One stopped so long, and went away, and then another came; they have all a key of the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you in the morning perceive how they got in. - A. We thought they got in at the back door; we did not know till we heard the evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the excisemen any business to do in the shop. A. No; the shop is fastened, and then we go through a parlour to go where the excisemen are. The excisemen could not go into the shop without breaking the lock; we had the key; no locks were broke. The staircase window comes into the passage. They took the shutters down, and went into the parlour, and then they could go into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. The excisemen could not go into the shop. - A. No; not without they had done as these men had; what I mean is, there is a lock on the door where the excisemen passes. A person getting in at the back parlour window might get into the shop, without breaking the lock, but they could not get into the shop without they got in that way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself lock the door which leads into the back parlour - A. No; I never lock the door myself my husband always locked it; when I got up in the morning, I found that door locked.</p>

            . Q. You are one of the officers belonging to Worship-street office. - A. I am; in consequence of information, I went to Mr. Sinclair's house on Sunday, between one and two o'clock in the day. I went into the back yard, where there is a parlour that communicates to the shop, and joins it by a door and partition, and under that parlour window, the cell was broken down in crumbs, whether by decay, or by force, I could not say; I saw no marks of instruments; I then was taken into the shop, and saw where the goods were taken from. I came away after that, and on the Monday, I received information, in consequence of that, I and other officers went and apprehended the two prisoners at the Gold-house in Golden-lane, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, on the Monday night they were secured; and on that very night I went in company with Vickery and Bishop to Stanton's house in Providence-place, Bridgewater-gardens, there I found this pair of half boots, a pair of childrens pumps, six clouts, and two habit shirts. That is what I had from there; I took Stanton, and put him in the watchhouse that night. And these are the things that I found at Crutchington's house in Essex-street, on Friday, the 2d of February: here is a pair of sheets, a number of child's skirts, calimanco or stuff, these two silk gowns, a petticoat, a child's frock and a shirt; all these goods were shewed to Mrs. Sinclair.</p>
               <p>Court. You produce another parcel. - A. These are a pair of Hessian boots, three pair of shoes and a piece of cotton, they were found at the same time; that is all I found. I went with Cartwright, and searched Wheeler's house, Cartwright has that property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. to Mrs. Sinclair. Look at any part of that property and tell me whether you know it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This a part found at Crutchinton's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sinclair. These are very much like my things; I do not see any marks.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any of your work upon it; look at the other things that you are likely to know. - A. There are some child's things. There is no mark on the sheet; that gown is like what I had in my shop; I had such a thing in the shop I know, but I might have sold it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Look at that sheet again, whose initials is that. - A. There is T. D. on it; I generally mark my sheets in the middle. This is a pelisse; it is like what I had in the shop, but I might have sold it.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop do you keep. - A. A clothes shop on one side. That petticoat I think I have had in the shop; I do not see any mark upon it: I cannot say whether it was in the shop at that present time.</p>
               <p>Q. There is another sheet, look at that. - A. I cannot see any mark upon which I could swear. This is a child's morning gown; I have had this in my shop, there is some of my work about it; I cannot say whether I have sold it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when you had last seen it - A. No, I cannot say. This is a petticoat that I never missed until I saw them; all the seven were together. I know I have had them in my shop. I cannot say whether I had sold them or not. I remember they were all in one parcel, over a vinegar cask.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the house was broken open, had you seen them - A. I do not recollect of seeing them a week before; but when I saw them, I knew they had been in the shop. This gown, I know I had this in my shop, because there is some of my work about it. I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210022"/>seen it on the Thursday that my house was broken open on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that your own - A. It was one in the shop. This is a child's petticoat. There are so many things alike of this kind, without it was marked, I cannot say I think I have had it; but I cannot swear to it. This is a boy's shirt; I think I have had this in my shop, but I cannot swear to it. This child's frock was along with the stuff petticoats the last time I saw them. I bought it with the petticoats. I had them about three weeks. I drawed the tape out of it. I know I had it in the shop. I have no doubt it was mine once; and this other frock was in a piece with the petticoats. I made it a frock at the same time I bought the petticoats. I had seen that a fortnight or three weeks before. These two habit shirts, I might have had them, but I could not swear to them; they have not my mark, nor is there any of my work on them. There were two dozen of these clouts together, I had in the shop the Saturday night before these were taken out; they were very much like these.</p>
               <p>Q. How many are there now - A. Half a dozen. I bought them only on the Saturday; they are clouts or napkins.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the shoes and see, whether you see your husband's stamp upon them - A. There is his stamp upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. These boots were found in Essex-street, at Crutchington's - A. They are stamped; these boys shoes, there are no stamp upon them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. With respect to these napkins, there are no marks upon them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you are upon your oath; your husband and you keep a shop, he sells shoes - A. Yes, and I keep a clothes shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you purchase hundreds of them articles - A. Yes; we buy at auctions some of them things.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not your husband have disposed of these things in your absence, he does sometimes serve in the shop - A. Yes, and sometimes I serve of his side when he is not in the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not they common napkins - A. Oh, yes, they are. I have sold many of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you pretend to say, that these half dozen were half a dozen of the two dozen that you had in the shop - A. I have not much doubt but they were, but I cannot swear that they are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. What time on the Saturday did you buy them - A. About ten o'clock in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How late did you see them afterwards - A. I do not remember seeing them after ten o'clock in the morning. I recollect buying some. I do not pretend to say they are them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Q. (to Armstrong.) You forgot to state to his Lordship and the jury, that you searched Landers's lodgings - A. I did, I found nothing there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. On Monday, the 15th of January, I went to Mr. Sinclair's house, in company with Armstrong and Bishop I saw the situation of the premises, and after that we went and took the two prisoners at the Gold-house in Golden-lane; we brought them to the office; we found Stanton at home, and I found these two odd boots; these were up in the place where he kept pigeons.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutrix.) Look at these boots and tell me, whether they have your husband's stamp upon them - A. Yes; that is a stamp that we generally stamp them all with, because the men should not change the stuff; they are two odd boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined them with two odd boots that you had at home - A. I have not examined them, we often have odd boots. I never saw them matched.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I found these two black silk handkerchiefs Stanton's house, in company with the other officers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Now, Mrs. Sinclair, have the goodness to look at them - A. I lost two black handkerchiefs, one of them was quite a new one, it had never been worn, there was no mark upon it, I had it a month, I bought it for my own wearing, I saw it on Saturday night, I took it out to shew to a sister of mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that you had shewn the handkerchief to your sister on the Saturday night, do you mean by that the night of the robbery - A. Yes, and I lost a crimson one, wrapped up with this.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen that - A. I cannot say; this was in the shop as rubbish.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You said you lost two black handkerchiefs, one of which was a new black handkerchief, and never worn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not they both been worn - A. Yes, and very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, from the appearance of them, do you believe them to be yours - A. I cannot pretend to say, whether they are, or are not; these were not found till a fortnight afterwards at Stanton's house. It is much the same size and quality, and the old one is like the one I lost; but it is impossible for any body to say.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Joshua Armstrong.) On what day did you find the two black handkerchiefs at Stanton's house - A. On the 2nd of February.</p>

               <p>Q. You produce something - A. Yes, some shoes and sheets; I took them from a house in Long-lane, No. 31, kept by a person of the name of Wheeler, in consequence of a search warrant. Wheeler was at home; one pair of shoes were upon Wheeler's feet, which the prosecutor owned to directly, and another pair of shoes in a box in the garret; then we sent for the prosecutor's wife, and shewed her a bundle of dirty clothes in the room; she picked them up herself, and said she could swear to them; they were shifts and sheets, and two pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutrix) Look at these sheets - A. I do not see any mark. I do not doubt but I have had them both in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they in your own use, or articles in the shop - A. In the shop to sell.</p>

I said I knowed that I had had them in the shop; there is a shift, I have had this in the shop; how long I cannot say. I bought a great many shifts of this description on the Thursday. I saw it at Wheeler's when the officers pulled the things out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you there identify it as your sheet - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these shoes and see whether there is your husband's stamp upon them - A. Yes, there is on these; the new ones have not, they have the stamp of a man that worked in the house, his name is Howard; he is gone from us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Have you not sold shoes with Howard - A. Yes, more than once, he worked for us a good while.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean from the time that they were taken up, or from this time that you are now speaking; is it not above two or three weeks; you know they were taken in January, how long before they were taken up were you acquainted with them - A. It might be five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know White-cross-street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being in company with the prisoners at the bar at any time in January last - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet them - A. At the Gold-house public-house door, in Golden-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was it - A. It was on a Saturday night, I think it was the 13th. I met the prisoners there; we might be there, in and out of the house, two or three hours in the course of the night; we drank together, and just by the time of the public house being shut up, that might be between eleven and twelve o'clock, we all agreed to go together, to go to Mr. Sinclair's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever known Sinclair's house before - A. No further than seeing the house in the street, not to live in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that proposed that you should go to Sinclair's - A. I cannot say rightly, whether it was myself or either of them: it was agreed to go there. We walked about some time, and I think it was between two and three o'clock when we first went; then we got upon the wall, they two lifted me upon the wall at the back part of the house; when I got upon the wall, then Lander came up upon the wall after me, then we opened the stair-case window, I cannot say whether it was me or him, one of us opened it. How was waiting in the court on the other side of the wall. When the stair-case window was opened I got in, and Lander staid at the window while I went down stairs. I could not open the back parlour door, it was locked; I opened the back door on the inside and went into the yard.</p>

               <p>Q. How did you open the door - A. I forgot whether there was a bolt or a latch; I do not think there was any bolt, only a latch. I unlatched it and went into the yard, and I opened the back door that leads into the court, that door is in the wall; then How and Lander came in, we then contrived to get the back shutters down in the yard of the parlour window.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you manage to get the shutters down - A. We had a small piece of iron, and the ridge was all rotten, and then the shutters came down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use the piece of iron then - A. Yes, by me and Lander, How standing by. When we got the shutters down, we opened the window and got in, it was a sash window that slides up and down; I got into the window, the other two staid at the window while I went in; when I got in I brought them out some things that I got out of the shop, a quantity of shoes, boots, and linen; I gave them to the prisoners at the window, and then we all went away together; then we took them to a house in Red Lion-market, Mrs. Jennings's, and left them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Red Lion-market - A. In White Cross-street; we left them there, and came back again to the house of Sinclair. All of us went in at the back door into the yard, then I got in at the same window, and went into the shop and gave them more things, shoes, boots, and linen, some of all sorts; we went away to Mrs. Jennings's again, and when we went in Mrs. Jennings would not have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen her there the first time - A. No, I did not go in; the second time I saw Mrs. Jennings and Mr. Jennings too, they would not have them. We then brought them all out, the first parcel and the second. We went to try another house, we did not succeed in getting them up; we went to a house in Bridgewater-gardens, and there we left them. I do not know their names. We went back to Mr. Sinclair's again, we went in the same way at the back door, I got in the window again, I went into the shop and gave the things out of the window to them again, a quantity of shoes and boots, and a quantity of half-pence out of the till. I cannot say how many, perhaps there might be seven or eight shillings worth, and perhaps there might be more. I put some into my pocket. We then went into the house in Bridgewater-gardens again, and the people said, they did not deal in these things, they would not have them. Lander went out to see if he could get a place to put them in, or to see if his own place was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after this return to Sinclair's house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you leave the house of Sinclair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210024"/>the last time - A. Between four and five o'clock, I believe, it was not day light, it might be peep of day, it was not so dark but you could see. I cannot say whether there was any moon.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that Lander went out to look for a place to put these things in - A. Yes, he did not return for some time. I went out to look after him, I met him; me and Lander went down Long-lane, we went to knock a person up, we did not succeed, we came back and went to Stanton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for these things that you had lodged in Bridgewater-gardens - A. Lander went first and spoke, and then me and Lander carried the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you and Lander only carried the things, or was How with you - A. I went with the first parcel with Lander and staid with them, and then Lander brought them up stairs, who helped him I do not know; How was not there till the afternoon. We left the whole of the things at Stanton's, in Providence-place, Bridgewater-gardens; we took them up into the pigeon loft and looked over them; we put a few things of one side; some old things were given for the woman's children, and the rest we kept for our own use.</p>
               <p>Q. What woman's children do you mean - A. Stanton's children. After that we left the things there, and went to the Catherine Wheel, in Bridgewater-gardens, and found How there, that might be between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; then we had some rum and water and beer; and there we were in company with a man of the name of Banbury. Then me, and Lander, and Banbury, went to Long-lane to speak to this gentleman; I believe his name is Wheeler, he keeps a green-stall. We spoke to him; he said, he would come to us at the Catherine Wheel after he had his breakfast; we went back to the Catherine Wheel, Wheeler came about twelve o'clock; then I and Lander went to Stanton's and shewed him the goods that we had deposited there, he looked at them, we asked him nine pounds for them; he said, he must consider about it; he had two hours to consider about it; he did not come in the two hours. Me and Lander, and How, went down to his house, he was not at home; we went to a public-house and staid till he did come home, and when he came he would not give above five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it - A. It might be between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. Then he came to five pounds ten shillings, and a crown to be spent, we agreed. We left the things till dark to take to his house; they took the things in a coach, and we went to Mr. Wheeler's with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take all the thinks - A. All the things, as far as I know. I missed of them, and when I came back to them they had the things in the coach. We got in there with the things. Mr. Wheeler then said, that he had but three pounds to give then; we were to call for the other the next day; we then came away and went to the Gold-house, and divided the three pounds among us; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were you taken up - A. Between eight and nine o'clock that night, on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you tell this story that you have been telling to-day - A. On Monday morning I informed Mr. Armstrong of it, and then I went in and acquainted the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing that you forgot to state, recollect yourself - A. There was an old pair of shoes that were given to Banbury; whether he had them I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. My honest lad, this Saturday night you had received your wages, had not you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. A hard working lad, what business may you be - A. A watch-gilder.</p>
               <p>Q. You work regularly at watch-gilding, and you had received your wages - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your master - A. Messrs. Holloway and Gildi; they paid me my wages, one pound twelve shillings and two-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you work of a Sunday - A. No; I never did any thing of my business of a Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to this public-house in Golden-lane - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know nothing about Mr. Sinclair's house before this night - A. No more than it has been mentioned by a good many, of going to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many - A. Five or six might.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were hard working young men like yourself, were not they - A. I do not know whether they followed any business.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it, a month, that you heard talking about this house - A. It might be three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. And you do not know whether you yourself proposed it this night - A. I cannot say, I was mentioning it as much as them.</p>
               <p>Q. You just received your wages, mentioned this as a good thing; speak out, you know you are a good honest, industrious lad - A. I might have proposed it, and I do not know whether they mentioned it to me: it had been proposed by several of my companions.</p>
               <p>Q. This must be a new thing to you - A. Quite.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not seem to know any thing about it: you used, when you came to the house, a small piece of iron, you do not know the name of it, was it a jemmy - A. Something of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. But you thought it to be a small piece of iron; upon your oath, had you never seen such a thing before in your life - A. Not of that sort; it was made of iron.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you had never seen one before in your life - A. Not of that kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You agreed to do this on the Saturday night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Sunday you went to church and spent the day as you ought - A. Not on that Sunday, I did not go to church.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not sorry for what you had done - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were very sorry for what you had done - A. I have been very uneasy ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very sorry, and determined never to do so again - A. Never, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you taken up that very Sunday for robbing a man of a bundle in the street.</p>
               <p>Court. You cannot ask that.</p>
               <p>Witness. I was taken up for an offence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Q. Were not you taken on the Sunday, and taken before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Court. That is not right.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. You gave this account before the magistrate - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you told this of your own free will. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was mere sorrow that made you do it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210025"/>Q. Determined never to do the like again. - A. I never was convicted before.</p>
               <p>Q. No hope by telling this story you might not be convicted yourself. - A. No; I wanted to retrieve my character again, I did not think of myself, I was wishing to get clear of the company, and go to my work.</p>
               <p>Q. Then do you mean to say, you had no hope of escaping yourself by convicting these men. - A. I was accused of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you keep very good company, do you mean to say that. - A. I have been drawn into company before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given evidence in any court before. - A. No; Sir, not before this here.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never been in a court of justice before. - A. Yes; when I was an apprentice, for running away from my master.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have learned from five or six persons that you were acquainted with, that their intention was to rob Mr. Sinclair's house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these five or six composed off. - A. I know them very well by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoners at the bar either of these five or six persons that told you, that they were going to break open Mr. Sinclair's house. - A. I cannot be positive that they were in company then. Lander had heard it I was told.</p>

               <p>Q. What day did you leave town - A. On Tuesday evening, the 17th of October, between five and six o'clock. I went with my husband. I made all the fastenings of the house perfectly sure, I took the key with me, I locked the house up myself, and I am sure I made all the fastenings safe. It was rather dark when the tide swelled, I locked the door, me and my husband went together, leaving no person in the house. I returned in about a week, we were detained in the Downs by contrary winds. I received a letter on the Sunday, I returned on the Monday, I think the 30th. When I returned to my house, every door and every lock of my house had been broken open, and every part of my property was taken away. They broke in at the cellar window, the street door was locked; it appeared as if a crow had been put in, and the cellar flap wrenched up, there was the mark in the wood work; there are stairs come down into the cellar from the street, and go up into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, every door in the house had been broken open - A. Yes, the doors had been locked, all of them; and the part of my goods that were left were in the cellar, packed up ready to be removed. I went into the house at the street door with my own key; I unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost a great deal of wearing apparel and household furniture - A. Yes; I lost all the articles in the indictment, and a great many more; it is not a third part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose four China images, a glass, two aprons, three table cloths, eight pillow cases, a blanket, three handkerchiefs, a counterpane, a table cover, a looking glass, seven napkins, a quilt, a pair of stockings and a candlestick - A. Yes, and a great deal more.</p>

On the morning of the 18th I heard a slight noise, it was like the scuffling and putting on a pair of heavy shoes in Mrs. Duncan's house; I paid attention to it; immediately afterwards the watchman called past four o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Shadwell Office. On the the 12th of January, I went to Murry's house, in Queen-street, Wapping; he is a coal-heaver. It was about two o'clock in the day time; I found Mrs. Murry there. I went in company with Mrs. Duncan and Hope, another officer. I acquainted Mrs. Murry, that I had a search warrant to search the house for things that Mrs. Duncan had been robbed of. As soon as I went into the house, Mrs. Duncan pointed out a pair of China images on the mantle piece, (there are them.) We searched the house, and found out this property, which Mrs. Duncan pointed out to be her property: here is two hats, two aprons, a black silk skirt, a gauze cloak, three silk handkerchiefs, a table cloth, a table cover, a quantity of thread, three towels, a pair of pillow cases, a curtain, a counterpane, a piece of old bed furniture, and a looking glass; these are all the things that I found.</p>

             said they belonged to himself. I asked my husband where the things came from, my husband struck me in my bed; my husband made me pawn them. I pawned them in my own name at Mr. Mounts and Mr. Cordy's. I was taken up for this.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was it when they came - A. I cannot tell, I was in bed; I generally go to bed about ten o'clock; I was awoke out of my sleep when they came. It was night, and dark when they came. I have never seen my husband since I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Upton's Defence. All that I know of this good woman and her husband is, I had a writ out against me for money that I owed, I went to a townsman of mine that lived at Shadwell to get me a lodging till I could pay the money; he said, he could not; if I would go to his house of call, he would ask that woman's husband to let me have a bed; he said, yes, if I would give him one shilling and six-pence a week for the bed. I was there about three weeks; that is all I know of this woman. I never see any thing amiss of him, nor he of me; and what things were taken out of my premises, I can give a good account of.</p>
               <p>Dufty's Defence. I never was in Murry's house but twice in my life, that was two afternoons; I was going past. I am perfectly innocent of what I am charged, and what is more, I was on hospital duty that night.</p>
               <p>Dufty called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Upton called no witnesses to character.</p>

Mrs. Ingram lived facing where I lived; she used to bring her work into my room, and sit with me; she wanted me to put in the lottery with her; she brought a gown into my room, and asked me to pawn it. I told her I could not, my husband was coming home. I told her to go up to Mrs. French, perhaps she would. She then asked me to buy it, I bid her four shillings for it. I gave her a shilling in part, and the remainder the next morning. She offered me half a guinea to take a false oath against this woman, that she did not bid her take this gown to pawn.</p>
               <p>French's Defence. The prosecutrix came up to me, she said, she had a frying-pan to sell, I bought it of her; she brought the gingham gown up to me, I pawned it for five shillings. I went out in the morning into the Highway, and in the afternoon I went out with her again, pawning for her. After I came home, she called me down; she said, my key opens Mrs. Collins's door. Collins and I fell out, she owed me two shillings, and I out of spite said, if any body has robbed you, it is Mrs. Collins.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Prosecutrix.) Did you go out with her in the afternoon - A. I did; I did not give her the gown and shift to pawn.</p>

I have seen the prisoner frequent at Mr. Grant's; about six months ago he was there getting a watch repaired, he said it was his fellow servant's watch; he then expressed a wish to have a watch made of Mr. Grant's make, and looked at some watches; I shewed him one in particular which he recollected on the 24th of last month when he called again; he said then he was come to buy the gold watch which he saw before; Mr. Grant shewed him the watch that he had before seen, about six months ago. On learning that the price of the watch was twenty eight guineas he said it was too much, and wished to have one at about twenty guineas price; Mr. Grant then shewed him two or three others; one of them was a particular watch which he objected to; Mr. Grant hung it up in the usual place, and Mr. Grant referred it to me to execute the prisoner's commands, and as I understood he wanted a twenty guinea one, I handed him down a watch, as he wished me to recommend him one, of the price of twenty three guineas; the prisoner objected to it, it being rather too much, and not of the kind he wished for; I left the watch on the counter with others, while I went to get one at rather less price, and the shape he wished for; on turning round I found that the prisoner had changed his mind, and he told me he would call in eight or ten days and bargain for the watch, he did not wish to take it now; I then observed to him that he might as well take it now as then, that I could recommend to him the one that I had in my hand. After this conversation he choosed the one that I had in my hand for eighteen guineas; he said he could pay ten pound of the money, the remainder he could pay in two or three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree he should have it - A. I agreed so far that I would mention it to Mr. Grant, and if he chose to consent to it; Mr. Grant was busy, he could not be spoke to; he left that watch behind him, I was to regulate it, he was to call for it in eight days. In the course of three hours, in the same day, the watch of twenty three guineas, that I mentioned before, was missed; the watch which I first took down to him, it is of particular dimensions; the watches were there hung up, and had not been shewed to any one person until the watch was missed, therefore I was clear in my own mind that it must be the prisoner that had stolen the watch. I went to Bow-street and returned again. The prisoner came back again according to his promise in the course of eight days; when he came into the shop Mr. Grant said to him in my presence, one of the watches that were shewn to you on such a day is missing, we missed it immediately after you were gone; perhaps you may have put it in your pocket in a mistake; if you have, it will be well to return it without farther trouble. The prisoner denied knowing any thing of the watch; he said he recollected all the other watches but that particular watch; I then turned round to the prisoner, and told him the watch must be between him and I, there was none but him and I upon it, and if it had been left in the shop it would have been there; at this instant I observed his face change three different colours, from a light red to a dark red, and then to a dead pale; it still made my mind stronger that he had the watch. The prisoner said that he had a good character, that he lived with Mr.

            , esq. 33, York-place, Baker-street. Mr. Grant said that if his master would sign a note for the remainder (the eight guineas) he would let him have the watch. It was then agreed that I should call on the Saturday following to know whether the master would sign it or not. I did not call on the Saturday, but I called on the Monday or Tuesday following, I saw the prisoner, I enquired of him if his master had signed the note, or if he would do so; he told me that he did not wish to trouble his master with it, that he had not signed it, he said, as he had a friend coming from Brighton, from whom he could get the remainder of the money, and he would call and pay Mr. Grant in a fortnight altogether for it; I then observed to him the strange and unaccountable circumstance of the other watch, and again told him it was between him and me; I remonstrated with him of the extreme difficulty it left me in in Mr. Grant's house; he said he knew it must, but he knew nothing of it; I then left him. He called on the 8th instant at Mr. Grant's shop, he changed his mind with respect to the eighteen guinea watch which he had before chose, and he chose one of twenty-five guineas or pounds, he left ten pound on account in part of payment and went away. We saw nothing more of him untill the night of the 14th; an officer and two men came to our house, they said they had apprehended a man with a watch which was suspicious. On this information Mr. Grant and I went to Mr. Morrat, a pawnbroker, No. 6, High-street, Marybone; we found the watch before mentioned, that was lost at Mr. Grant's; I had a description of the watch, name and number; I compared it to the watch. I have since sworn to the watch.</p>

On Monday the 5th of February, when I came down stairs between seven and eight, I saw a truss lay at the warehouse-door in the yard. I examined the truss; I found it contained a quantity of paper; my ostler told me that some man, about an hour before, had pitched it there. I suspected that it might be taken from some Inn-yard. I sent to the Bell Inn yard to know if they had lost any thing; the ostler of the Bell came, and said he believed he knew who it belonged to; a person of the description of the prisoner was in the habit of leaving a parcel there for two hours of a morning. About nine o'clock the prisoner came in, and said that he wanted his parcel. I asked him where he had it from; he said he had bought it, and paid for it; it did not matter from whom; I told him, I should detain him and the parcel till such time he told me who he bought it off, or where he had it from. Accordingly, he told me the truth that he lived at Mr. Divett's, in Smithfield; and these things were his perquisites. I told him, if so, he would not have brought them away so soon in the morning; but if that was the case, I would go with him to Mr. Divett's; and if they approved of it being his perquisites, I should have no objection. I went with him to Mr. Divett; they said they never suffered him to have any perquisites from their house; as such, he was taken before the Alderman.</p>

On the 21st of February, the prisoner in company with another person came into the shop, and the other woman asked for an article. I shewed it to her, during which time I observed the prisoner to be shuffling something under her pelisse, which raised my suspicion. I paused to see what was gone; I discovered a piece of Irish linen missing; the prisoner appeared to be in a very great hurry to be gone, and went out. I immediately followed her, and overtook her some considerable way down the street. I laid hold of her arm, and asked her to walk back; she took the property from under her pelisse, requested me to take it, and said she did not wish to wrong me of it. I told her that I should not take the property; that she should come back, which she did, within one door, at the same time bringing the property; she then set the property down, and refused to come any further. I took hold of her, and took the property up, and told he she should go in, and sent for a constable, to whom I delivered her.</p>

The prisoner passed me with some property under his coat, which appeared to be heavy. I followed him down West-street, and catched him. I said, what have you got here; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210031"/>said, what is that to you; I demanded he should tell me; he said it was some copper. I asked him who he worked for: he said, a man in the middle of Thames-street. He had forgot the partners names. I took him in custody; he dropped it directly. My partner picked it up; we took him and the property to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a lodger to Mr. Rice. I rent the shop and parlour. On Sunday last, about a quarter after eight in the evening, I was sitting in my room. I heard several wrenches, as if some person was attempting to take the pipe. I took the candle, and went to the top of the kitchen stairs; I called out, but nobody answered. I heard a footstep; I went to the door, and saw Mr. Crook that lives in the same house; he was coming from chapel; I told him I thought there was somebody in the kitchen; he took the candle, and went down into the kitchen; I followed him; I saw the prisoner up in the corner; she said she was intoxicated, and came there to get herself sober; we sent for a constable; the watchhouse keeper and a watchman came, and upon their searching her, the cock of the water-butt was found upon her, and we found that the water-pipe had been wrenched.</p>
               <p>MR. CROOK. I am a bricklayer, I lodge in the same house. I came home about a quarter past eight on the Sunday evening. Mr. Gordon met me in the passage, he said there was somebody in the kitchen; I took the candle out of his hand and went into the kitchen, and up in the corner I found the prisoner, with her nose and her knees together to conceal herself; I asked her what business she had there; she told me that she had a drop too much, and she came there to get herself sober before she went home. I then looked up to the pipe; I saw eighteen inches of the pipe almost off; it had been wrenched; and I missed the cock out of the water butt; I asked her what she had done with the cock; she fell upon her knees and wished heavy judgments from heaven if she knew any thing about it. When the watchhouse-keeper came, he searched the prisoner and found the cock upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much in liquor, and very much reduced; I went out picking up rags and bones; I picked up that cock among some ashes. I have two fatherless children.</p>

            . I am a salesman, 123, Swallow-street. On the 1st of this month the prisoner came to my house, he asked me to buy a coat; I looked at it; he asked me three pound for it; he said it was his own; he found it near Bellfound. I asked him where he lodged; he said, at the Ship in Swallow-street; I told him I would go there and ask if he lodged there; he said it was of no use my going there, they would not take any account of it. I asked him what he had taken the buttons off the coat for; he said for a particular use. I would not buy it; he went out of the shop, and took the coat with him. I followed him as far as Grosvenor-street; I said to a person of my acquaintance, there is a man going with a box coat; I suspect he has stolen it. He went and fetched a constable. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

On the night of the 5th of February, at eleven o'clock, I examined all the fastenings of my shop, and saw it was all perfectly secure, and I and my family went to bed. In the morning, about half past seven, I was informed that my house was broken open. When I came down I found that the shutter of the shop door window had been broken open; the shutter had been wrenched off, and the iron bar had been taken down. One of them was fastened by a padlock: the padlock was broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you by what means this violence had been done - A. It appeared as if it had been done by two iron crows; the marks of the crows were remaining in the wood; a pane of glass was taken out; I think they must have put some person in through the place where the pain of glass was taken out; it was large enough for a man or a boy to be put in. I suppose the shop door had been opened in that way. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210032"/>fastenings were all off when I came down, and the bar laid upon the floor.</p>
               <p>COURT. The outer door next the street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Was any of your property stolen - A. Yes; all that property mentioned in the indictment. Fourteen hundred pounds worth of cloth.</p>
               <p>COURT. That, I suppose, was almost all the stock in the shop - A. No; there was a good deal left.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. What sort of cloth was it - A. It was mostly superfine cloth, and part of it milled kerseymere.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know, sir, whether you were with the officers when they apprehended the prisoner - A. I was. He was apprehended in Bottle-hay-yard, St. John-street, three or four days after the robbery was committed. On searching the prisoner's room we found two iron crows; the officers took these crows and fitted them to the impressions on my door, in my presence; they exactly fitted. I have no doubt at all but the impressions had been made by these crows.</p>
               <p>Q. Among other things did you find any cloth there which you knew to be your property - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had it been in that state - A. It had not been long; it is dark at seven o'clock at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it was not light half an hour - A. No; it could not have been.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down in what condition did you find the shop - A. There is a door in the passage that leads into the shop, which I usually go in of a morning, I found it fastened on the inside, which led me to suspect that there had been somebody inside had fastened it. I went to the shop door and found that the shutter had been taken down and replaced; the shop door I opened, which I found only on the latch; the iron bar was laying in the shop; there were marks of crows underneath the shutters. I found a pane of glass had been taken out. The shop was in confusion, and cloth was laying all over the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, Stanton, and Mr. Gustard, go, on the 10th of January, to the lodgings of the prisoner - A. I did; at two o'clock in the day; his lodgings were at No. 4, Bottle-hay-yard, St. John-street; I knocked at the door, the prisoner's wife opened it; I asked if Mr. Maddox was at home; she said, yes. I went in the room; I found the prisoner in bed; his room was down stairs. I told Mrs. Maddox that I had a search warrant to search the same room, in the prisoner's hearing. I searched the room; I found in a drawer fifteen skeleton keys, and under the stairs, by the bed's head, ten bales of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean ten pieces - A. Yes. Some whole pieces and some parts of pieces. I went out to Mr. Gustard and informed him that we had found his property; he then came in. I told the prisoner to get up and dress himself; I then took him in custody. Stanton found the pistols and crows in my presence, in the same drawer I found the skeleton keys; he found two loaded pistols, one of them loaded with slugs, and two iron crows. I have the charge of the pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Stanton to Mr. Gustard's to fit these iron crows. - A. I did. I found the impression made on the door to correspond with them crows; I have no doubt that these crows had been used for that purpose; one is broader than the other; one fitted the impression to the right and the other to the left. One of the crows is jagged, I found the impression jagged.</p>
               <p>Q. How many places did you find the crows to correspond - A. Three; two on the outside, and one on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any duplicates - A. Stratton found the duplicate concerning the cloth.</p>
               <p>COURT. Had he a house to himself - A. No; an apartment only; his wife and he lived in the room; she ran away.</p>

             I am a cabinet maker; I live in Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn fields.</p>
               <p>Q. On the night of the 5th of February, or the morning of the 6th, did you come through Bedford-street - A. I did; at two o'clock in the morning. I passed Mr. Gustard's house; I observed two men at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210033"/>door, they appeared to me to be attempting to force the lock of the door; on my approaching one of them turned down Henrietta-street, and the other up Bedford-street. I followed one of them, and, in doing so, I passed a watchman; I turned round and spoke to the watchman; then I went home.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were they - A. One of them was like the prisoner in size; not having seen his face, I do not swear positively.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at the dark blue cloth - that corresponds with that found at the pawnbroker's - A. They were examined, both, at the office by me and Mouls. I know the cloth produced by Mr. Chapman perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. First look at that piece of blue cloth found at the prisoner's lodgings; what is the quantity there - A. There were eighteen yards stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the quantity at the prisoner's lodgings, and the quantity pawned, to make up that quantity - A. No; there were two yards deficient. The quantity pawned is two yards and a quarter, and fourteen yards were found at the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it appear that that remnant, pawned at Mr. Chapman's, was torn off that very piece - A. Yes; we have matched it; it agrees exactly. I am quite sure it was torn off that piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of that cloth found at the prisoner's lodgings - A. About one hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. The other piece produced by the pawnbroker is light blue - A. Yes; that corresponds with that piece. The quantity stolen was seven yards and a quarter; we found five yards at the prisoner's lodgings, and Chapman produces two yards and a quarter; it is my property. The dark grey is my property; there is six yards and a half; there were damages in it; and the list is very particular. I have examined it all; I believe all that is here is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am entirely innocent of the theft. It was brought to my place on the 6th of January, about half after five in the morning. There was a person that worked fellow servant with me, and lodged in the same yard with myself, he was in the habit of calling me in the morning when he was up first, and I was in the habit of calling him if I was up first. I gave the watchman orders on the over night to call me between two and three o'clock, he came and called me in the morning between two and three o'clock; I had been very ill about a fortnight before with the pain in my bowels; I told my wife not to go to sleep. I had a good deal of work to do; I expected this man to call me when he went to work; I went to sleep and my wife went to sleep. About half after five I heard a knock at the shutters, I called out loud; I did not know but what it was this young man,

               <p>Q. Did you call him up on the 6th of January - A. I did, about two o'clock, within a few minutes of it; he answered me; I did not see him. I knew his voice; it was his voice that morning, I should suppose, and no other but his. I am sure he answered.</p>
               <p>COURT. Whom did you receive your orders from - A. His wife.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. When was you first applied to to come here - A. About ten days ago I went to the New Prison to see him; it was Wednesday, last week.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say if I was to ask you what time you called him on the 5th of January you could tell me - A. No; I do not always call him at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time you called him on the 4th of January - A. No. I never think any thing at all about it unless I am asked.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell me of any other morning before or since, only just that day - A. No, I cannot.</p>

            . Q. I believe the prisoner lodged at your house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember his being apprehended - A. I do; it was on the 10th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember on the 5th of January what time you went to bed - A. At eleven o'clock, I believe. The prisoner was in the house, and I believe he went to bed at that time; I did not see him; I heard him in his own room. His room is under mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Who fastened the door (that night) of your house - A. Mr. Maddox. He asked me if I was going out any more, I told him, no; he fastened the door. About one o'clock I heard him cough; I was very ill that night and could not rest, and I heard him cough at past five in the morning, before he went out; he went out after five, but how much I cannot tell. I heard him answer the watchman at two o'clock, when the watchman called him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210034"/>Q. How many times do you think you heard him coughing. - A. I cannot say; he coughed very much; he coughed at 3 o'clock, and his own child cried. I thought he was going to get up.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had gone out at the time that you supposed he was up stairs, must not you have heard him go out. - A. He very seldom went out but what I heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had gone out before five o'clock, must not you have heard him. - A. I must.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that he went out before five o'clock. - A. Not till after five o'clock, that I solemnly pledge myself that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You were very wakeful that night and the morning too. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sleep with a light in your room - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A clock in your room. - A. No; Clerkenwell church-clock is near me; I counted the clock every hour from twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. This was a very wakeful night to you indeed. - A. Yes, I was very ill; I had a bad cough.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first asked to come here, and give evidence for him - A. Mr. Bennett, the attorney, was the first person that asked me; I believe, last Monday.</p>
               <p>A. Are you quite sure that no person made application to you to come here before last Monday - A. When Mr. Maddox was in Clerkenwell prison; he spoke to me about it, that is a fortnight ago to-morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to ask you of the night of the 4th and the morning of the 5th, could you give me the history of that as particular as you have of this night of the 6th that you have been speaking of. - A. On the night of the 4th, he helped me with a tub, and then wished me good night; I went to bed nigh ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were all night laying and counting the clock on the 4th. - A. Yes, I was</p>
               <p>Q. And the same on the night of the 3d. - I can't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say you mostly heard the prisoner go out of a morning. - A. Very seldom that he went out but what I heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. If he chose to go out softly, I suppose he could. - A. I do not think he could; the door makes such a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after five was it on the morning of the 6th. - A. A quarter after five, or half after five; I got up before Maddox went out, and staid in my own apartment till seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the house quiet all the time, except Maddox's going out. - A. Yes; I never heard any thing but Maddox go out; I heard the spring latch catch.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any man come that morning, you must have heard him. - A. I did not hear any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body had come, and knocked at the door at hall after five, you must have heard him. - A. I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any persons knock at the door at half past five. - A. I did not hear any; I never missed of hearing the watchman call Maddox.</p>
               <p>Q. And at five you were up, if any persons had knocked, you must have heard them. - A. I must; I never heard any body knock at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. If three men came, and knocked at the door, and brought great bundles, you must have heard them. - A. I must, I should have thought. I am very quick of hearing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

As soon as he went into the crowd, I cried out, take care of your pockets; he went out, and a young man came and told me he had dropped a pocket book. I enquired, and Mr. Lyons said he had lost his pocket book. I pursued him, and when Mr. Pitt laid hold of him I saw him throw the pocket book away.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 13th of January, was your house broken open. - A. Yes; my husband and me went to bed together about a quarter before two; we were the last persons up belonging to the family, and to the best of my knowledge we left every thing safe and secure. In the morning, at six o'clock, we were alarmed by an exciseman; that was before it was day light. We went into the shop (my husband keeps a shop for boots and shoes, and we deal in clothes besides); the shop was quite distressed; the things were taken away chiefly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did these things consist of boots, shoes, gowns. - A. Yes, and a variety of articles; there was also between twenty or thirty yards of printed cotton, and about three pound's-worth of halfpence.</p>

            . Q. You know Mr. Wheeler, the prisoner. - A. Yes; I did not know him before the Sunday he purchased the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know How and Lander. - A. Yes, them are the two men. I have known How and Lander about five weeks before the house was broken open. On Saturday night, the 13th of July, I was in company with How and Lander at the Gold-house, Golden-lane. I went there after I had done my work, it might be near nine o'clock at night; they were in the house. I sat and drank with other company that were there, and I might drink with them, but I did not go into their company before it got late. I sat there till the house was shutting up about twelve o'clock. I, Lander, and How, agreed to go to Mr. Sinclair's house, with intention to do this robbery. We went there between two and three o'clock in the morning. When we got there, Lander and How lifted me upon Mr. Sinclair's back wall; there was a yard between the wall and the house. When I was put upon the wall, Lander followed me; he got upon the wall too; me and Lander then went to the staircase window, leaving How on the outside; one of us lifted the staircase window up, I am not sure which; it was not fastened; I got into the house, and went down stairs. Lander waited at the window. I could not get in at the parlour window, it was fast; I opened the back-door, got into the yard, and opened the yard door that adjoins to the court. We all three men came in the yard; we got the shutter down, chucked up the parlour window, I got in the window, and went into the shop. Lander and How were waiting at the window. I brought out a quantity of boots, shoes, and linen; I handed them out to How and Lander, a quantity of articles, a good many halfpence, and sheets, shirts, shifts, frocks, handkerchiefs, and printed cotton. I handed them over to them in the yard. We then went away with the articles that I have mentioned to Mrs. Jenning's, in Red Lion market, in the same street. Lander and How went in to Mrs. Jennings; I did not; they left the things that we took; they came out; we went to Mr. Sinclair's house again for more property; I got in to the window again, and handed the same kind of articles out that we had each of us as much as we could carry. They were taken to the same place; we went in, and saw Mr. and Mrs Jennings; they refused keeping them; we took all the things to a house in Bridgewater-gardens; I cannot tell the people's names; I saw a woman there; we left them, and went to Sinclair's again, and when he had got a quantity of things, each of us, we came away; that was the third and last time. We went to this woman's in Bridgewater-gardens with these things. She then said that she did not deal in them kind of things; she would not have them there. Lander went out to see for a place to put them in; he did not return for some time; I went after him, and met him; then me, Lander, and a man called Banbury, went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210036"/>Long-lane; How was left in the house at Bridgewater gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose house was it in Long-lane - A. I do'nt know; it was up a gateway; we could not get admittance; Lander got admittance at Stanton's, in Providence-place, Bridgewater-gardens; we then went to the house, where How was left with the things, and brought them all away to Stanton's. How was upon the look out; Stanton gave leave to let them be for a little while up in the pigeon loft; we went up into the pigeon loft with three bundles, and left them at Stanton's. We overhauled them, kept some of the things for his own use, and two or three things, such as clouts, were given to Stanton's wife for his children. Lander and I went away; we saw How at the Catherine Wheel; it was then about half past nine in the morning; then I and Banbury went down to Mr. Wheeler's in Long-lane, No. 31, I believe; I saw Mr. Wheeler there, about ten o'clock on Sunday morning; we told him that we had got a quantity of things, if he would come and look at them; we told him where; he said he had not had his breakfast, he would come in half an hour; we went back to the Catherine Wheel, to Lander and How; Wheeler came in a little more than half an hour to the Catherine Wheel; me and Lander went to Stanton's and shewed him the goods in the loft; Wheeler looked at them; Lander asked him nine pound for them; he wanted some time to consider about it; he was to come in two hours; he did not come; Lander, How, and myself went down to Wheeler's house in Long-lane, he was not at home. We went to a public house over the way and waited for him; about three o'clock we saw him, and then he offered five pound, and at last agreed to give five pound ten shillings, and a crown to be spent.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present - A. No; I did not see Wheeler till the evening; we went with the things on the same Sunday, at dusk; we took all these things to Wheeler's in a coach; we then saw Wheeler, between five and six o'clock; what passed between Lander and him I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Wheeler when the goods were delivered in the house - A. Yes. We put the goods in the house, and then Wheeler paid three pound; I am not certain whether he paid it to Lander or How; I had my share, one pound, and each of them a pound a piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you are sure that Wheeler is the person that you left these things with, and from whom you received that three pound - A. I am.</p>

               <p>Q. On Sunday morning, the 14th, about what time did you see Lander - A. I was in bed; Lander knocked at my door, near to eight o'clock, he asked me to get up; I did; he said he wanted to leave a little bundle for a little while; I gave him leave; knowing him, I had no suspicion of any thing of the kind; he had nothing with him then; it was light. He went down stairs, and instead of a little bundle he brought a large one up stairs; he went and brought another, and Ballad came up after him with another bundle as large as them; there were three bundles in all. As soon as he brought them up stairs, I said, James, I don't think they are your own; I will not have them here; he said they were all his own; he would not leave them there long, and he would come and take them away; Lander and Ballad took them up into my pigeon loft, and before they went away they made two bundles of them, and said they would come directly and take them away; then they went away. About ten o'clock they brought a man up; I have every reason to believe the prisoner is the man; he was rather pock marked in the face; I was at the other end of my loft, feeding my pigeons. I do really believe he is the man; he came along with Lander and Ballad; I don't know what for; I heard no conversation pass between them. As soon as Wheeler came into the loft he stooped and looked at the property, and went down directly; they all three went away; I heard the prisoner talking with them, but what it was I don't know.

            . I am one of the marshalmen of the city of London. On Wednesday, the 17th of January, I, in company with Mr. Armstrong, and other officers, went to Wheeler's house; he keeps a green-stall, No. 31, Long-lane; Mr. Sinclair was with us; Wheeler was at home. We went through the shop into the back parlour; Armstrong was before me; Mrs. Wheeler had a pair of boots and was going to get up, Armstrong made to her; he said, them are what I want; he took the boots out of her hand and gave them to Mason. We told Wheeler what we had come for, and shewed him the warrant; we read the warrant to him; he said nothing; he seemed very much flurried. I put a pair of handcuffs on him; we took him with us to every part of the house that we searched. In the room below we found a quantity of dirty linen, and as Mr. Sinclair could not speak to it we left it and went up stairs. We perceived Wheeler to have a new pair of shoes on, we told him to take them off; he took them off, and Mr. Sinclair said, they are my shoes, they have my stamp upon them; Wheeler said he had bought them and given a crown for them. We gave him another pair of old shoes, he put them on These boots were found in the presence of Sinclair; he said they were his boots, in the prisoner's hearing; he gave no account how he came by them. Sinclair claimed them by the stamp; they are new boots. We found another pair of shoes on a landing place in a box; Mr. Sinclair claimed them by the stamp. We went into the back parlour again; Mrs. Sinclair was fetched, and among the linen she picked out two sheets and a shift; she said, these are mine; Mrs. Wheeler said they were her's, and Mrs. Sinclair said, that is wrong, that is mine. I can swear to them. I brought them away.</p>

It is of great consequence that you should speak the truth here; if you dare to exceed the truth, as against the man, you will most certainly be punished; if you speak less than the truth you are liable to be punished. Your oath is, to speak the truth, the whose truth, and nothing but the truth and neither more or less and that you appeal to God to do; by the solemn oath you have taken, and by your appeal to God, and you draw out the linen that was in Wheeler's house, or did Cartwright draw them out by your direction - A. I could not draw them out; I said then I believed them to be mine. The sheets that we found the mark is off; it had my hand writing in the middle with common ink, the selling price; I turned the sides of one of them into the middle; there is no mark on them now.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that is your property - A. I have not any doubt that I had it in my shop.</p>

               <p>Q. You are quite sure that you mended it - A. Yes; and this shift, I have not a doubt it is one that I have had.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you understand the reason of the officers taking you to Wheeler's house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then truly state to them that you believed that was one of the sheets you lost - A. I have no doubt of that. I should be sorry to say it was if I thought it was not</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Take these shoes into your hand and tell me whether you know them - A. I know that there is my husband's stamp upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the new shoes - A. There is the stamp of a man that did work for us upon them; and the boots have a stamp I do not know</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that at the time you was sent for to look at the sheets they had a mark upon them - A. No; if they had then they must now; I think there was a mark; I know I owned one of them; I know I have had the sheets in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that is the same sheet that the officers shewed you at Wheeler's house - A. No; that is the same sheet.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was you examined before the justice - A. I don't know what day it was.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. It was the 18th of January.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was your husband examined at the same time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me where he is - A. No; I have not seen him since Tuesday night; I dare say he is gone into his own country, into Norfolk, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The sheets and shifts I had in my possession a long while; the shift is worked by my own little girl at school, and the other is my wife's work; and there is two others at home to match with it, and I can bring the school mistress.</p>

               <p>Q. Did that induce you to look over to see if there was any more on the ground - A. No. I then went with the shilling for the change, when I returned I saw Kolp with one hand in her pocket hole, and her side stuck out very much, which made me suspect that she had taken something. I saw Mr. Thwaites pick the print up; I did not see it drop; I believe Kolp dropped it; Mr. Thwaites picked it up from the place where she was standing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him pick up the other piece - A. I saw him stoop, and then when he got up he had it in his hand; I was not on that side.

               <p>Prosecutor. The small piece is what May dropped; it has my private mark upon it. The other piece, I picked it up at the same time, it has my private mark; the value of the smaller piece is ten shillings, and the value of the large one, it cost fifteen pence halfpenny a yard; it is near forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the cotton fall did you say any thing to either of the prisoners - A. I charged them with having dropped the cotton; Kolp did not deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge May with dropping the other piece - A. I cannot say I did. I could not be certain that May did drop the other piece; I only saw it lay at her feet. I saw Kolp distinctly drop one piece; I was within three feet of her at the time it fell.</p>
               <p>Kolp's Defence. I went to this gentleman's shop with this young woman; we went to buy some muslin for caps; there were a great many pieces on the counter; I never touched them at all; after I had the change the gentleman came and challenged me with taking a piece of print, and at Hatton Garden he only challenged us with taking one piece. He locked us in a room for two or three hours; when he came round the counter and challenged us; I told him I did not know what he meaned; I knew nothing of it. He searched me; I had nothing. I was outside of the door; he brought me in again and said he had lost some print; he told the young woman at the time he did not see any thing; somebody said there was a piece of print laying on the ground; I was never nigh it.</p>
               <p>May's Defence. I cannot say any thing more than what she has said.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I challenged her she was at the further part of the shop; fifty-five feet from the door. I picked up the two pieces at one time.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. You are the person he ought to account to. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Is there any other book that he accounts to. - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the entry in that book import that he had delivered the parcel, and received the money. - A. No; it does not. The entry is C. Pocock, two articles, 1 l. 1 s. 8 d. to receive - signed, received M. N. That is Mr. Pocock's clerk; I had nothing to do with that but to settle with him.</p>

            - A. Our clerk's.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Vincent) When he pays you the money, do you call over the articles to him. - A. He calls them over himself out of the delivery that book, and I copy them into that book afterwards; he takes that book, and calls the numbers over, and I mark them off, which I have received in his own delivery book.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this man taken up on this charge. - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find out that this sum had been omitted to be accounted for. - A. I left Mr. Deakin on the 5th of February. Before I went away, I brought it forward as not paid; I was present at the latter part of the time before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner ever accompt to you for the omission of this sum. - A. No; he said they were not paid.</p>

            . Q. When this man was apprehended, did you speak to him about this sum of money that had been paid. - A. I told him that sums of money had been paid that had not been accounted for; he said he knew it; he kept the money; he would pay me by instalments; he offered to pay it weekly, I think two shillings a week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went into Mr. Deakin's service, I understood I was going to be bookkeeper in a short time. I expected, by a person that recommended me, that I was to have twenty-five shillings a week; instead of that, I only got a guinea. I sent to Mr. Deakin to have my wages raised; in consequence of that I was discharged. I wished to pay Mr. Deakin; I had not money enough; I got a place at Mr. Savage's; I wished to make the account right, If Mr. Deakin would have given me time; he wished to have it immediately; it was out of my power.</p>

            . I am an officer of Whitechapel office. On Monday I received information that a man had been robbed on Sunday of thirty-five pound. I went to the prisoners lodgings in company with Freeman and found a padlock on their door; I searched after them three weeks, at last I found Sibley in Red-Lion-court, and Cohen in Checquer-alley, Bunhill-row.</p>
               <p>Sibley's Defence. The reason that I left my place I was in debt with my landlady, she put a padlock on my door. He has no reason to accuse me; he has known me many times; he wanted me to live with him; he kept a bagnio down Swan-court.</p>

               <p>Cohen's Defence. He drank five or six glasses of liquor. I never saw him before nor since till I saw him with the officers.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Thursday the 8th, I received information that the prisoner, in company with another man, robbed some person of his watch; I went in search of him and could not find him. On the Friday the prosecutor came to the office and gave information; I told him to wait a little while, I would bring one of them to see if he knew them; I went and took one and brought him to the lock-up-room; he said he really believed he was one, but he could not speak positively to him; he was discharged. I then took the prosecutor with me and went into Wentworth-street, and by the description that he gave of the prisoner I apprehended him at the Prince of Wales; I brought him out a little distance from the public house, to the prosecutor; he then said, that is the man; I'll swear to him. He then began to whine or cry, he said I was always pulling him in innocently. I had apprehended him before for a robbery, he was discharged; there was nothing proved against him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever find the watch - A. No; I searched him and found nothing on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The officer on Thursday morning came into the house while I was having my breakfast, he never said a word to me. On the 9th of February he came in again and never said a word to me; in about an hour after he came and took me out. I am an innocent young man. I was a bed at the very time the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You mentioned but one - A. There was another man that ran away; I could not swear to him.</p>

            . I was coming from Fore-street about three quarters past twelve o'clock; the moon shone very bright; I saw three men at a little distance from me, they appeared to be wrestling; I came up and looked, and saw that they had got hold of this young man; I heard them say, do you mean to give it, he said, no; they then said, we'll give it you; with that the man in the great coat knocked him down. The man that was behind was dressed like a butcher: I saw him pull his hand out of the young man's breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that - A. The butcher. The prisoner tapped this butcher on the shoulder, and said, come along; they both ran up Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of three - A. Yes. One stopped in the great coat. I saw a watchman at a distance, I ran and told him; the prisoner and a butcher ran away, leaving the man in the great coat behind; the man in the great coat was then coming towards us, I told the watchman to stop him, as he had knocked the young man down, below, and robbed him; the watchman said he had no charge of him, he would not stop him. I then returned to the young man that was laying bleeding; the watchman went with me; I helped to gather the young man's onions up, that had rolled about, and while we were talking the prisoner returned; I then said to the watchman, catch hold of him; he did; we got the young man up, and asked him if he knew him; he said, yes, that was the man that had knocked him down; he would give charge of him. We went to Hatton Garden watchhouse; the constable of the night being busy we went to the fire backwards, the young man sat down and went to sleep, quite senseless; the prisoner then pulled three shillings and sixpence out of his pocket; he said that was all that he had got, and that he would give it me if I would say he was not the man; I told him he must make it up with the young man. The constable of the night then came, I stated the case to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, my boy - I thought you said it was the man in the great coat that knocked him down - A. Yes, it was, but this man was of the party; I had a perfect view of him by the moon shine; I am sure of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. to Perry. Do you remember the last witness coming<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210042"/>up to you - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose - A. Twenty-three shillings and sixpence, a piece of beef, and some onions; my money was in my right hand breeches pocket; my pocket was buttoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you before they knocked you down - A. I do not remember any thing; it was done in an hurry. They came up the passage as I was going in.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - do you know him - A. I cannot safely say that was one of the men that was with the three.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing him - A. I remember seeing him, but I cannot swear positively; I believe he is one of them; I remember the face; when they took me up, owing to the blow, I was quite senseless; my backpart of my head fell on the edge of the stone step. I did not know where I was till I came to myself in the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night this happened I was calling half after twelve on Sunday morning; I was coming back from Ely-court to where my stand is, I met that lad, the witness, Cook, he told me there was a young man knocked down and robbed, close to Ely-court, I hastened to him and saw seven or eight men altogether, and some onions laying upon the pavement; Cook pointed out the prisoner and told me that he was one of the three men that knocked the young man down; I asked him whether he was sure, and whether he would give charge of him or not; he said, yes, and then I took charge of him; I took him to the watchhouse, and from thence to Clerkenwell prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop the first man - A. The man was a great distance from him; he was going along solidly, and fast asleep almost; and I saw a great number of people standing at my stand, I hastened to them.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there an entry of a parcel in the way bill to your house. - A. There was; I did not get that parcel; I have never since received it.</p>

Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if they were taken in London, and the parcel had never got down to you, they were discharged from that payment, until you did the act of re-issuing them - A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he live - A. I cannot tell you. I saw him on the 5th of January, about eleven, in Dover-street, in the Borough-road, he stopped me and said he had got two or three Wotton Bassett ten pound notes; he said he would give me a pound a piece if I would pass them for him; he said they were as good as could be; his brother had come from Wotton Basset, and had brought them with him; he said he would bring me one by four o'clock, and shew me; I saw no more of him on that day. On Sunday afternoon I met him at a house near Turnstile; he said he had passed two or three of the notes, he had passed one at a linen-drapers in Blackfriers-road for a tablecloth, another at a linen-drapers shop in the Borough, where he bought three pair of stockings, and he went to a linen-drapers shop in Holborn and bought some shirt cloth; he gave them a note, they did not give him the change until they sent to the bankers; they gave him a guinea to support him until Monday morning; they were as good notes as could be; and then he said he would give no more than half a guinea to pass them; he said he had got fourteen or fifteen hundred of them. On Monday morning I met him again, he took me to a linen-drapers shop through Temple bar, he bought a shawl and gave a pound for it; he paid for it with a Wotton Basset ten pound note, he got in change eight one pound bank notes, and a country one pound note; he then went to a linen-drapers shop in Holborn, where he had left the note on the Saturday evening, at Mr. Stroud's; he said he was going in for his change; he went in, I did not go in with him; he came out again; he said that the gentleman had sent his boy to the bankers, and that if he would call in half an hour he might have the change. He went again, I went with him and stood at the door; the gentleman said his lad had not come yet, if he would go and sit down till he came back. He came away; he told me he was going to his brother, he would go no more after the note; I left him in Middle-row. I went into a public house, he came back and said his brother's house had been searched on suspicion of stealing these notes; he said he would go in search of his brother and tell him to keep out of the way. Then he went to a public house in Shire-lane, he could not find him; they denied him; he said he would go and buy some clothes and disguise himself. I saw him on the next day, and then he said his brother had been taken up on suspicion of stealing the notes. I did not see him after until he was in custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you stand to the work - A. Yes, when I have business to cut out.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that - A. Two years past.</p>
               <p>Q. You first of all said, you was in the silk mercery line, then a taylor, and you now are in the shop way; that is to say, you serve in the shop of Mr. Herbert - A. Yes; he is a shoemaker, in St. John's-street.</p>

               <p>Q. I do not wonder that you are puzzled in answering me - A. I do not know that I am exactly puzzled, I fancy I was living at Mr. Shakespeare's, Covent-garden, or at Portsmouth, I will not be sure. I lived with Mr. Shakespeare about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You do improve upon it. I see you lived this year a month at a place and last year a week, where were you before that - A. In the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. What business did you carry on - A. A silk mercer, in Whitechapel; I cannot say the number. Mr. Herbert served me with shoes when I was in business.</p>
               <p>Q. You never accepted any bills for him - A. I accepted one when I was in business in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that signature - A. That is not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, is not that the signature of your friend Herbert - A. I have not a doubt it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not accept any bills of Mr. Herbert payable at Mr. Pickett's, and when the bill became due you were not forthcoming - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pickett was rather a troublesome visitor of Mr. Herbert's for money - A. I do not know; I never saw him before that day. I know now Mr. Herbert owes him money.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that Mr. Pickett's umbrella was before you when the man took the leather, why did not you push him down stairs and go by - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pickett was alone, was not he - A. Yes: as soon as I could I ran after the person, and I found nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Pickett was taken before the magistrate this day fortnight - A. Yes, and his brother; the examination was adjourned till the Thursday, and then adjourned till the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Thursday they were set at liberty, and came on the Monday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday the magistrate examined all the witnesses you had, and you were managing the prosecution, and suggesting every thing to the counsel that attended, the magistrate told you, you might indict if you pleased; they were set at liberty - A. It is impossible for me to tell whether they were set at liberty, or on bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any recognizance either for you or any body else - A. I did not enter into any.</p>
               <p>Q. They were set at liberty, and then last Friday you indicted them for breaking and entering, and stealing all this leather - A. I attended according to his order.</p>

I was not positive until I came out of the shop; and then, when I saw him at the distance I did in St. John's-street, then my idea was stronger. I was coming down St. John's-street, he was going towards Islington; I thought he seemed rather confused. I saw him turn up a court. When I came level with the court he came back again, passed me, and went towards Islington. I lost sight of him. I was going to Mingays, the bankers, in Smithfield. When I came level with Mr. Herbert's shop, I saw Mr. Newman and

I gave the prisoner a punch of the head as hard as I could; he laid down and cried, with his hand to his head; I walked away. In about five or six minutes the prisoner came and throwed a handful of mud in my face; he drew a case knife, and cut me between my back and my loins; I bled a good deal, and laid by for two days. I went to a surgeon. The prisoner was taken up about an hour afterwards; he has been in jail ever since.</p>

On the 15th of February, near six o'clock in the evening, I stepped to the street-door in haste; I found the prisoner standing against the window, the window was cut, and two pieces of kerseymere had been taken out; I saw the prisoner's arm in the window, higher than the cuff of his coat; the glass had been cut and taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that the window was entire a short time before this - A. Yes; I passed the window twenty minutes prior to this, and every thing was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose, his arm being through the window, the goods were within the reach of his hand - A. Yes; when I saw him, just as he drew his arm out of the window, there was a blue piece of kerseymere that had the appearance of his hand being upon it. I had the pane of glass put in the week before; there was the mark of putty on the kerseymere. I ran in haste and cried out, what are you about; he took to his heels, crossed the way, and ran into Cecil-street; as he turned round to get into Cecil-street he fell down. It was light sufficient for me to see him fall down and run into Cecil-street. He was brought back in about five minutes; I firmly believe him to be the man I saw standing against the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered these two pieces of kerseymere - A. I have not. When the prisoner was brought back, I charged him with the theft; he said, he was not the man. I detained him. An officer came and took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you think the blue piece of kerseymere had been removed from the place where it was - A. About four or five inches. I cannot swear that the prisoner moved it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of the two pieces of kerseymere stolen - A. Six pounds, and the blue piece four pounds.</p>

When I went from Newgate I went to the Isle of Wight, and there I went on board the prison ship, from there I was drafted on board the ship with troops to go to the West Indies, and from the Isle of Wight I went to the Motherbank, and laid on board this ship five weeks. During the time I laid there, I was picked out three or four times on board the launch to fetch beef and sometimes water; and the last evening we went the water was very rough, we could not come off. During the time we staid on shore we got very much intoxicated; the whole six of us, these men that were with me, made an agreement to go away, and I being intoxicated went with them. It was not my intention to leave the regiment by no means.</p>

               <p>MR. TURNER. I reside at Rochester. On the 12th of this month I had passed the New Church, in the Strand, I saw two boys; one Newton had this book in his hand. I said, my lad, how came you by this book; he said, he found it in the street: it is the Italian Master. I then took hold of the other <rs id="t18100221-74-deflabel437" type="occupation">boy</rs>

I took them both to Mr. Wingrave's shop; one of the prisoners said, there is another boy, Morgan; I looked and saw Morgan getting away. I told the prisoners they must have stolen the book; I found they contradicted each other, each accusing the other. At last I catched the name of Longman, in Paternoster-row; I think first of all from Jones. Newton said, he stood at the door while Morgan and Jones went into the shop in a morning early, and took the books from the counter when there was a number of people there; they said, they had done so three or four mornings. At Bow-street the prisoners were searched; Jones had a book taken from the inside of his waistcoat, and three in his hat.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. King. I had seen the carpet safe on the stairs about ten o'clock. About five minutes after I was going up stairs, I met the prisoner coming down; I perceived something under her arm. I asked her what business she had there; she answered, to see Mrs. Dudley; I told her, there was no such person there. I missed the carpet immediately after she went out; I ran after her, and catched her in Portland-street; she said, the carpet was hers. I know the carpet to be my master's; it was on the stairs about five minutes before.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been in business - A. On the 17th or 18th of December I commenced business at Brentford. On the 12th of January, Mr. Thwaites's son produced a shawl to me; on Monday week. Mr. Thwaites's son was with me the first fortnight; he marked the goods. I then took down the linens from the shelf and examined my stock-book, and found one piece of linen missing. I found the shelf filled up with this piece of cotton; the shelf had the appearance of the same number, but when I examined it, I found cotton instead of linen; that was on the Wednesday. I came to Bow-street, there I saw the linen. The prisoner was in custody. A piece of cambric and a shawl was likewise produced.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you received your business from Mr. Steele, did you examine the stock-book, and see that it all corresponded - A. Yes; I saw that the stock and the book corresponded. These linens were called over, and they filled up the shelf compleatly; and this piece of cotton came in the house a fortnight afterwards.</p>

            , Jun. Q. I believe you are the son of a linen-draper, in Holborn - A. I am. In consequence of suspicion, I obtained of Mrs. Green, the prisoner's washer-woman, a shawl; she lived in Brick-street, Piccadilly. I asked her, if she had any shirts or handkerchiefs; she produced a length of linen from a Mrs. Geary, and cambric; there is my own mark to that shawl which I had put on it at Mr. Bright's. I marked most of the goods for him. When Mrs. Green produced this length of linen, she said, there was more at Mrs. Geary's. I afterwards went with Mrs. Green to Mrs. Geary, in a court in Brick-street; I found three squares of French cambric. On Monday, I took a piece with me to Mr. Bright, at Brentford; he claimed the cambric. On the Tuesday afternoon I went with Perkes, the officer, and took the prisoner into custody. We afterwards went to Mrs. Geary's, and brought away a piece of linen with the maker's mark upon it, and the cambric also.</p>

            . On the 17th, between one and two, I was in the shop at work, the prisoner came into the shop; he said, he wanted a man of the name of Trimming, a smith, he was putting on stays to the springs of a carriage. I went up into the shop and enquired; my master said, there was no such person. I returned to the lower shop, the prisoner was standing there; I told him, there was no such person; he seemed to be in great agitation, and wished to go the back way. I spoke sharp to him, you cannot go that way; he said, this way will do for me the same. In a few minutes afterwards the report came, that the pole-pieces were gone, and a man had been seen to go out of the shop with them. I am certain it is the same man. I knew him when a boy; he is a smith by trade.</p>

I found myself sitting on a chair before the fire, and a young woman at my right hand; I laid my hand upon her shoulder, she put it away again; she d - nd me, and said, what did I want, I had got no money. I laid my hand on my breeches pocket, which contained three one pound Bank notes, they were gone; I laid my hand upon my left pocket, which had two dollars and seven shillings in silver, that was gone; I laid my hand where my watch was, it was gone; the next thing, I clapped my hand to my side, my pocket-book was gone; this alarmed me very much.

            . I live with Mr. Matthews, pawnbroker, 105, in the Minories. On the 5th of January, between four and five in the evening, a man, that I think is the prisoner, came accompanied with two Jews, for the purpose of redeeming a watch to sell them, upon which they offered him three pounds; he refused to take it. Mr. Matthews looked at the watch; and shewed it to me. I thought they had not offered a fair price for it, I offered three guineas and a half; he refused, and said, he would ask his wife. He then went to the door, and brought in a woman, which I am certain is the prisoner Hughes; she likewise refused to take three guineas and a half; she rather wished him to pledge than to sell it; the man made answer, you know if I pledge it I shall not have money to redeem it in time; on that he agreed to take three guineas and a half for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the man - A. I have but little doubt upon my mind about it; I should not like to swear positively to the man. Mr. Matthews paid them the money, and they went away. The watch I now produce is the watch that was bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that pawned the watch with you - A. A man.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. All I know, after the prisoner Bankes came, I really believe him to be the man, and he could not agree with the Jews; he asked me to buy it for four guineas and a half. I turned round to Stubbings and asked, what it was worth; he said, three guineas and a half. He called in this woman, and then they agreed to take the three guineas and a half.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of January, the Saturday after the robbery, the woman prisoner came to me about eleven o'clock, she was rather intoxicated with liquor; she said, she wanted to speak to me. I took her of oneside, she said, there was another watch lost in our court last night; and she said, I have every reason to believe that the devil that lives with me had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know who lived with her - A. Yes; the prisoner Bankes; she said, he went out this morning without any money with him, he has come home to-night full of money and drunk; she said, if I could come up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210052"/>and pull him, no doubt but he would come it, and if he would not come at that, she would tell me where the capped and jewelled watch was, and shew me the door in the Minories where it was lumbered, that is pawned. I did not pay any attention to her that night. On the Monday morning I called upon her, she then was very much confused, and begged I would not take any notice what she said when she was drunk; she begged that I would not tell it to Bankes, he would murder her, and seemed very anxious for me to go away; she asked me to drink. I had not time on that day, nor on the Tuesday. On Wednesday I went to Mr. Matthews, they told me they had bought the watch; they shewed it me, it is capped and jewelled; a very valuable watch it is.</p>
               <p>Hughes. How can you tell them lies. What he has told is as false as God is true; I never told him that.</p>
               <p>Banker's Defence. I am innocent. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Hughes said nothing in her defence. Neither of the prisoners called any witnesses to character.</p>

            . I am a sawyer. I stopped the prisoner, on the 26th, with the plank; he offered to sell it to me in Long-alley; he asked me fourteen shillings for it. I took him to a public-house and detained him, and sent to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The piece of mahogany I am charged with stealing, I acknowledge having it in my possession; it was not taken from the prosecutor with any intention of stealing it. I had done work for the prosecutor; and on the evening I had done work for the prosecutor, he paid me part of the same, and the board was given for the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. (to prosecutor.) Did he work for you - A. Yes; about a year ago he used to saw for me; I did not owe him any thing. The plank is worth thirty shillings.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you let lodgings - A. Yes; I let lodgings to this man and woman about four months ago. The woman came in the afternoon, and the man in the evening, as I supposed, when he came from work. They had the kitchen at three shillings a week; it was furnished; it contained all the articles mentioned in the indictment; they were to have the use of them. Some weeks after they had been in my house they were quarrelling; I went and begged they would be quiet. The man said, he had great reason for doing what he had done, and if I knew I would be as angry as he was, she had been pawning my bed clothes. I begged them to be quiet, and in the morning I would see about it. On Monday morning I went and found there were some things missing; he promised he would get them again, and leave my house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210053"/>quietly. They were brought back that time, I saw them; some weeks passed, and they were there, I begged of them to leave my place, they would not; I could not get rid of them, then by way of seeing whether my things were safe, I said, I was afraid my bed tick wanted mending, if she would let me see it, I would place some pieces on it, and send my children to sew it, I saw the blankets and sheets were all gone, except the bed, an under blanket and a rug; she told me, that her husband had not minded his work in a proper manner, and through this they were made away with, but not without his knowledge. The man went regular to his work, in the evening when he returned from his work I spoke to Mr. Clarke, he told me, that his misfortunes were much worse than mine, I should not be injured by it, if I would wait till Saturday night he would restore me all my things again, and he would leave my house quietly. On the Saturday night following, they returned in the evening, my husband did not return till twelve o'clock, they quarrelled and abused each other, and were fighting, I was afraid to go near them, on the Sunday morning they got up and went out together, in the evening they came home together, and laid down the three shillings for the last weeks rent. On the Monday morning the door was shut, I could not go in to see what they had done with the things. On the Wednesday or the Thursday about six o'clock I saw the man coming out of the kitchen; I said, Mr. Clarke, I have been looking for you, I want to see if my things are safe; he said, it was through the misconduct of his wife, if I could let it be till the Saturday night, he had a considerable sum of money to receive. On the Friday evening I went down; I said, Mr. Clarke, I understand you have got your wife with you, she had been shut out three days; I said, open the door; he said, excuse me opening the door, she is not here; I was convinced she was there; I went out to Worship-street, the magistrate did not sit. On Saturday morning, I went to the kitchen, I said, Mr. Clarke, are not you up; he said, no; I went out, and he sent his wife out before him; he went out, and I followed them into George-yard, Whitechapel, they separated to look, they saw me, they got out of my reach, I could not find them; they never returned. I found the duplicates in my kitchen.</p>

On Saturday evening the 13th of January between seven and eight o'clock, being in company with Valentine in Dog-row, Bethnal-green, we saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, we stopped him, and asked him what he was carrying; he said, it was nothing, we took him into a shoemaker's shop, and examined what it was; it was withinside of his great rough coat, buttoned up round the body, tied up round the collar and bottom with rope yarn, so as to conceal the contents; he said, it was hemp that a man of the name of Freeman working for Mr. Tierney in the Commercial Road had given him. There is such a rope-maker there, close to Mr. Dawson, we told him that we did not believe his story, that we must take him before the magistrate, he then said, he would tell us the truth, he worked for Mr. Dawson in the Commercial Road, and that it was hemp that he had been to work on that day, and that he had stolen it from his master, we went to Mr. Dawson, and asked him if he worked for him, he said, he did.</p>

             my prosecutor came along with the coach very much intoxicated; he asked me the way to Balls-pond, I directed him, instead of which he drove towards Robin-Hood Ferry, his coach was plunged into a pit, and from my feeble strength and old age, I could not relieve or ease the horses, therefore I went for another watchman for assistance; we extricated the horses who was lodged for the night at an adjoining house, the coach was obliged to be left till the next morning. The great coat I did not find for two hours afterwards, and I did not imagine that it belonged to the prosecutor, as he never mentioned its loss, the coat was wet and dirty, I found is a great way off the coach, I took it home, and to prevent the wet and dirt from communicating any damp or dirt to me, I wrapped it up in some hay, when I came home I thrust it into a hole under the stairs, in which place it remained till it was fetched away, when I was in custody, I instantly told I had it, I meaned to return it when I found an owner for it, I have lived all my life by my industry, I am very comfortable in my family, I never stole any thing for myself or them: I hope to be acquitted by the court.</p>

I went up through the joists into the garret floor, he was there concealed between the joists and the roof; I asked him civilly then to come down, he said, no, he would not, he said, d - n you, if you come nigh me I will blow your brains out, he said, he had got a pistol, and put his hand to his breast as if he had a pistol there, two more persons came up, we tied a ladder from floor to floor, and forced him down; we then took him to a public-house; I said, I think you have been cutting the lead, or else taking some of the lead away, he replied, if the lead is cut or gone away, you have found none upon me; I know you cannot hurt me. I don't think there were any other person on the roof but the prisoner, there was no other man standing behind.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any knife upon him. - A. No; he was put in the watch-house. We could not go upon the roof that night, we went up the next morning, we found three parts of the lead gone, and a bit left; we found a carpenter's chisel on the parapet wall, and a sack and rope was down below, and by the edge of the chisel it appeared to have been cutting lead. When we apprehended him, I said, here is your sack and cord; he replied, I will take my oath it is not my cord.</p>

            . I live at No. 12, in the same street, I came upon the alarm, and said, I am glad you have taken some person, because I have been very much disturbed, I had heard something two or three nights previous, I sprang a rattle and got assistance. The moment I entered the house where the prisoner was, I perceived him at the back garret window, he threatened to destruction, any man if he come up; I told him, I would fire if he resisted, and when they got him down, I seized him, and I knew him. I sent to Mr. Scothrup, and to the prisoner's employer, the prisoner had been working next door to me, he was a plaisterer's labourer, he had been discharged about a fortnight, when his master came he asked him, how he came in the situation that he was apprehended, he pretended that he had lost tools, he went up there to watch to detect them.</p>

He said, William, how am I to procure the money from Mr. Masterman? I told him if he would give me a bill and receipt, I would give him the money immediately. I never had a bill and receipt; I thought it proper as I had left him; and I having bought a horse and cart to maintain my wife and family, he has taken these steps against me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you ever authorise the prisoner to pawn any of your articles in your house - A. Never; I had never any occasion to do it. In the month of November last I was going in the country, I wished to take linen, waistcoats, and smallclothes to last me while I was out of town. I never went to the drawers myself, the prisoner always brought my things to me. I observed she put up certain things for me, and was rather confused; I asked her for the breeches, she said some of them were at the scowerers, and others were at the tailors, and the linen was at the washerwoman's; I said, the breeches that I wanted had not been worn for some months; she said she would go and look for them; I said I could not wait, I would go to the drawers and look myself; on searching my drawers I found they were completely stripped, I had not a second pair of small clothes left, and I saw no shirts; I then taxed her with having made away with my property; she cried and confessed it, and told me that I should not lose my things, they should all be forthcoming; I told her that she was walking about my chambers with a halter round her neck; she said she knew it; I told her that she was an extreme bad woman; to give me my property or tell me where they were; I supposed they were pawned; she promised to do that, but a great length of time elapsed before she would do that. She promised to do that.</p>

               <p>HONOURED SIR. What can I do to atone in some degree for the crime I am guilty of in injuring you, my tender-hearted master. You have shewn mercy to others that have been in your service; I trust to God and your mercy. Oh, sir, did you know the torture that I feel, you would pity me; consider, for mercy sake, I am now far advanced in pregnancy; having been helping those that turn their backs, upon me, so much so I have a thing to put on my child when it comes; I do not think it possible to survive without you could be merciful for my unpardonable crime to you, and pray let me see the person at whose house your property is at, to convince them that it was not by your knowledge that they were put in. When, sir, can I make you amends for injuring your character; I do assure you, as I hope for mercy of God, I never meaned to wrong you, or any one; I would go all my life as I am at this moment, without a thing on my back; I pray you, sir, for God's sake forgive me; I know not what to say, but trust to you and my mistress for mercy, and own myself your greatest penitent.</p>

I hope, sir, you will have some regard to my humble petition; pray do not think the worse of me. You have been merciful to others that robbed you, but I never did. You know I am the only servant that has left you poor, so many have left you with fine clothes, and God, that knows the secrets of all hearts, knows I only left you with two shillings, and had not you been so good to me as you have been, I could not have gone to any one's house. I have not tasted one morsel of meat since I left your house. For God's sake let me inform you I am doing well, and next Saturday I shall go into business, and with the money I get I will pay you honestly. For God's sake; my dear sir, consider my wretched situation; my own mind is more adverse than the most dreadful punishment you can inflict upon me, which God forbid. I hope you will be merciful; I have many friends, although I am starving for want of assistance. I saw York on Saturday, he gave me two pence, that is all I had. I hope my good friends will be rewarded as they deserve. The night I left you my mistress gave me her hand.</p>

               <p>COURT. Did your wife or not dictate this letter - answer yes, or no - A. I believe she did not; and as a proof, the second letter was given me by the coachman as he was driving the carriage.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You deny that your wife dictated that letter - A. Yes; to the best of my belief. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn at the office upon the New Testament - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a Jew do not like the New Testament - A. That I deny.</p>
               <p>Q. My question is, whether you believe the New Testament - A. I believe it so much; I believe that a great part of the New Testament is made out of the Old Testament, and that I am bound upon oath to the Supreme God to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a Christian or a Jew - A. I am of the Jewish persuasion.</p>
               <p>Q. You think it the same thing to swear by the Holy Gospels as by the Old Testament - A. I answer, I swear by the Supreme Being, if I swear by either, or both the books, my oath is binding to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. You know the nature of an oath - if you swear by the New Testament, you swear believing the contents of that book, and that Christ is God; now as a Jew (if you are a Jew) that is inconsistent. - You are not a Christian - a man that does not believe the Godhead of Christ is not a Christian - A. If I have been in an error, I believe that in swearing, so help me God, I swear by the Supreme Being, my oath is binding to me.</p>
               <p>Q. If you are a Jew, do you believe it to be the same thing to swear upon the five books of Moses, as upon the Evangelists - A. I did answer that. I certainly do believe I am bound to speak the truth on one book as well as the other. I believe Jesus Christ to be a prophet.</p>
               <p>Q. You believe Jesus Christ to be a prophet, then you are a Mahometan; he believed in the New Testament; he did not believe Jesus Christ to be God - A. I believe him to be a great man - a very great prophet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Common Serjeant. You ought to recollect that this is not the first time you have been admonished upon that subject; when I was counsel you indicted for an assault, you were sworn upon the New Testament, and the answer that you gave to sir

             on that respect; he told you you were totally unworthy of belief, as a Jew you could not be believed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The things that you call stolen were pawned at Mr. Meachams, are not these things altogether of considerable value - A. They are of value, but they are not pledged to a large value.</p>
               <p>COURT. Why do not you get out of your old habits and answer the question pertinent; you are asked whether the things that are pawned are not of large value - A. They are; but it is necessary for me to say they are not pledged to a large value.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not necessary for you to answer - I know what you want - When were the things pawned - A. In November.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get the duplicates - A. In the middle of December. I took her up in January: I got the duplicates in November.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You did not take her up till January. You live at Furnival's Inn, Mr. Meacham lives near you - A. Perhaps about five hundred yards from me; by Brook-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. What office did you select to go to - A. To Worship-street office; I went to Bow-street first, they told me there, it was regular to go to the office nearest where the prisoner lived; she lived in Brick-lane, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210060"/>COURT. In January you took the prisoner up; there was one sessions in December and another in January - what day in November did you get the duplicates - A. I rather think I did not get the duplicates then, but in December. The reason I did not take her up, I had some business in Chancery; I did not mean to prosecute her, I meaned to pass it entirely over, but she went about the neighbourhood and said I was perfectly aware of her having pledged the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if she had held he tongue you would not have prosecuted her - A. I should not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. So far from consenting to her pawning your things, you did not know it, you never consented to it - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never pawned your things in your life - A. There were some things that I pawned for a gentleman going in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. The things pawned, that you charge the prisoner with stealing, are worth fifty pound - A. More than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Two hundred pound - A. I do not really know. They are worth from one hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty pound; I can get them back for five and thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. It would be an easy thing to get them back by prosecuting the prisoner - A. I did not do it for that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know if you convict the prisoner you can get it back for nothing - A. I believe it is generally known.</p>
               <p>Q. His lordship asked you what you were, you answered that you bought and sold estates - Is that your only mode of getting a livelyhood - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You keep a chariot and four horses - A. Yes, and two out-riders; I have two extra horses for that; I have race-horses besides, and a country-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many servants have you altogether - A. Sometimes three and sometimes four, only one maid servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you owe this woman fifty pound - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you acknowledged that you would not have prosecuted this woman if she had not asked you for the fifty pound - A. No.</p>

Mr. Emden certainly must know it, because he did not leave sufficient money in the house to support it. The prisoner told me so. I bought with the money, bread butter, cheese, eggs, candles, half a peck of coals, frequently, half an ounce of tea, a quartern of sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the lady they call Mrs. Emden - A. There is many Mrs. Emden's there. I have known things pawned many mornings, when otherwise there was nothing to eat; even when Mr. Emden has been there, and a-bed with the lady. And I have met Mr. Emden when I have been carrying the things to pawn, he must have seen it, and frequenty I have seen him when I have come back with the things I have redeemed; and when they have not had coals I have lent them a shovel full of coals. I never shewed him the things when I met him, that I had in my lap for decency sake; he must know it, he could see the bulk, and I have left the duplicates at different parts of the kitchen; and I have pawned the prisoner's cloak to make a shilling to pay the postman.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 12th of February I was on duty at the theatre, Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the persons of these two men - A. Yes; I have seen them in the street from the 5th to the 12th; they were walking to and fro <placeName id="t18100221-108-crimeloc637">Bow-street</placeName>

On the 12th, about half past ten, I saw each of them at different times, in the course of the time that I followed them, with their hands in different gentlemen's pockets; I saw Hart draw a handkerchief; White was behind; I think it was this handkerchief, I am not positive, because it was wet when I had it of him. I saw it drawed just at the end of Bow-street. When Hart drawed it from the gentleman's pocket he rolled it up in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was one of those that you now produce - A. No, I cannot be sure of that, because he had gone away from me sometime before I apprehended him; I believe it was this. It is a silk handkerchief; the corner was wet, it appeared as if the name had been bit out with the teeth, that made me suppose that was the handkerchief that he had drawed out. He was a tall gentleman, leading a lady through the mob. Seeing him pick this gentleman's pocket I wanted to get as much against them as I could. I followed White, he was talking to a gentleman about the play; he took, I believe, this handkerchief. I apprehended White, and found upon him three handkerchiefs, and twenty-four duplicates of different articles; White was charged afterwards by a gentleman of picking his pocket, and when he came to see the handkerchiefs he said neither of these were his; there was a man behind that received it. I apprehended Hart nigh a quarter to twelve, he was coming about the house again; it was a few minutes after I apprehended White. I searched Hart, I found two handkerchiefs upon him. I was rather short. There was an hackney coachman went into a public house and made his brag that he had got a hatfull of handkerchiefs. The gentleman, whose pocket Hart picked, told me he would attend, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think the value of that handkerchief is that the mark is picked out - A. About one shilling and sixpence.</p>

            . Q. You serve in the shop of Brown and Ingham - A. Yes. The prisoner came in alone, she asked to look at some black muslins for handkerchiefs; she bought one for one shilling and nine-pence. After she had paid for this she asked to look at another sort of black muslin, rather larger, I opened her another piece, she took hold of it with one hand, and put her other hand under it, and pulled out another piece from under it, and put it up her petticoats, between her knees; she then sat down on a stool and ordered me to cut another handkerchief off, it came to three shillings and a penny halfpenny; she paid two shillings and a halfpenny; it was to be put bye, she was to bring the rest of the money the next day. She then spread her handkerchief over her knee, and put the handkerchief that she had paid for in it, it was wrapped up in paper; she folded all together. I took the handkerchief out of her hand, and the other piece of black muslin was in it, it contained six yards, just ten shillings the prime cost. When I asked her what she had in her handkerchief, she said nothing but what she had bought, and when I took the handkerchief out of her hand, and discovered the piece of black muslin in it; she then said she did not know it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very much troubled in mind; I had an affectionate brother laid dead at home. When the young man said, what have you got in the handkerchief, I said nothing but what I bought; he said you did not buy this; I said, I beg your pardon, I did not intend to thieve it. It has almost broke my honest husband's heart.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

            . I am inspector of the lamps and watch for the liberty of Golden-lane, St. Luke's. About half past three on Sunday morning, the 11th of February, I saw two people pass at the back of the Toll-house, at the top of Golden-lane, about three hundred yards from Mr. Allen's shop; I followed them into Golden-lane, when I got into Golden-lane I lost sight of them, the lamps were out; I went up to the end of Honduras-street, and then stopped; I thought I heard a voice, I called the watchman to bring me a light; it is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210062"/>a dark place. They then went from that spot into Old-street, and then I saw the prisoner with a large bundle on her shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. She had no child with her then, had she - A. She had not; and the man that was with her had no bundle at all; I told them to stop, I must examine to see what they had got; the man made off immediately the woman stopped, I asked her what she had got; she said, a little bit of lead. I took her to the watch-house. The lead was tied up in a rug. On Monday morning the lead was owned by Mr. Allen.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a native of Ireland; my husband has lately died, leaving me with two children. I was coming along Old-street, I met a man with the lead in question; he requested me to carry the lead; I took it, and when I was charged he ran away and left me.</p>

            . Q. You are the husband of the last witness - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You were shewn a dollar, and you returned it to the prisoner - A. I did; and another dollar was given me by my wife, that was bad also. I chinked the second dollar, and immediately ran after the prisoner; I saw the prisoner at the top of Lime-street, close to the India house, I said, my friend, you have given me another bad dollar; he replied, his dollars were both good; I told him he must walk back with me to my shop, then you'll see whether they are good or not; going down Lime-street, opposite of Cahum-street, he made a sudden stop, and swore he would be d - d if he would go back any further, and struck me with a large stick over the crown of my hat; I received no injury. I took him back to the shop, there was an officer waiting, and he wanted to strip; he shuffled his clothes; he said, they should search him; I said not; he should go to the watchhouse. I gave the dollar that I had in my hand to Dayley, the watchman. I saw three dollars in his hand when he came to buy the bacon.</p>

               <p>MR HOMERSON. Q. You are the teller of the bank - Look at them dollars and tell me whether they are the genuine dollars of the bank, or whether they are counterfeits - A They are counterfeits, all of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Davis said the first dollar was not a good one; I gave her another, it was given to Mr. Burge, he said it was a good one, and when I got to the bottom of Lime-street, Mr. Davis came and said this is another bad dollar you have given me; I said I took it of serjeant Renshaw. He will be here to prove that he gave me two dollars.</p>

            . I am a serjeant in the Royal East London militia. I know nothing of these dollars. On a Friday night, this day four weeks, I gave him two dollars, good or bad I am sure I don't know; to the best of my knowledge they were good. I saw them dollars before the Lord Mayor; I could not recollect them.</p>
