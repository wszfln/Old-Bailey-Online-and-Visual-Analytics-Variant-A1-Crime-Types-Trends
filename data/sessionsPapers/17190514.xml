A pleasant Dentance, being the same that King Charles II. constantly used; it makes the Teeth as white as Ivory, and preserves them from decaying, destroying the Scurvy, She bath a Cephalick which certainly cures the Tooth ach in a Minute's Times beyond any Person in England: and froms selaing Teeth, so that the Pain will never return again. If the Tooth are rotten or uneven, and full ol Holes or B'ack Specks, she will make them smooth, even, found and white; so that no Person shall distingalm where the Deces has been. She sells a pleasant Water that prevents any Rottenness from selaing the Teeth, and takes all Pains and Impostimes, Cankera or dwellings out of the Gums, and fastess toose Teeth; which several Persons of Quality and others know to be true. All the above mentioned Preoparations are to be had of her (at the same Place) the Sign of the Queens Arms and Dial and next Door in the Tin-shop near Exeter Exchange in the Strand, and at Will's Coffee-House in Cornhill, at Reasonable Rates.</p>
