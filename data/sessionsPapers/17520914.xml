Mrs. Edwards came to see me, I asked her to stay and lie with me that night. At going to bed she desired my maid, the prisoner, to call her up at 6 o'clock in the morning, but she did not call her, so we got up and look'd about the house for the prisoner, she was not to be found; I found the key in my book case, I likewise found she had taken away her cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any quarrel previous to this?</p>
               <p>M. Showring. No, my Lord, none at all. I sent for Mr. Chillingworth to see if he could find her, which he did and brought her to my house the same morning betwixt 9 and 10 o'clock. [ The pillowbear produced in court and deposed to.] She had it under her arm with her cloaths in it, when brought back.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that pillowbear?</p>
               <p>M. Showring. It was in my house the Sunday before. I believe she then put it on her own bed, in the pair of stairs room where she lay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chillingworth. I found the prisoner in White-chapel, and told her she had no good reason for going away, and persuaded her without discovering farther to return; so she took her bundle in this pillowbear and returned with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she searched?</p>
               <p>Chillingworth. She was at the prosecutrix's house, but found no money upon her. She did not go out of my sight from the first time I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140003"/> her. She owned (before she got to Mr. Alderman Chittey) in the coach, that if her mistress would pull down the coach window, she would tell her the truth; I was on the outside the coach; when it was pulled up again I heard her say she let a young fellow,

She owned the some before the alderman; she was afterwards before my Lord Mayor, there she denied it, and said she had not seen that young man for above a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any threatnings made use of in order to her confession ?</p>
               <p>Chillingworth. No, none at all, her mistress said she would forgive her if she would tell the truth.</p>
               <p>The prosecutrix being asked, confirmed this of her confession, but said she never found any thing dishonest of her before.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Edwards confirmed the whole of the prosecutrix's evidence.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner from about February or March. I was clerk to one Mr. Bridgewater, in Pope's Head Alley. The second time he saw me, he ask'd me to drink some bumboe, and where my master was. I said at the other end of the town; he took me to an alehouse, and gave me three six penny worths of bumboe. The next time I saw him was the 17th of June, in Rotherhith; we had some cyder and brandy. Then I left him in King-street at the Duke of Cumberland's head ; I staid about a quarter of an hour, then went to him, and had some more cyder and brandy. Then we went with a man and played at skittles, and about eight o'clock we went away to his house, in Barnaby-street; but his wife was not at home. Then he took me to a house he had taken, up in a court near that place; there he took a pistol off the mantle-piece, and bid me down on my knees, and take my oath of what he was going to say, and then said, if ever I told Bridgewater my master, or any body else, what he was going to say, he'd be revenged. Said he, I owe my landlord rent, and you must go with me to rob coaches to pay it, and we shall be made men of in a night or two's time. We went out about eleven o'clock, to bid his wife a good night; she was at an alehouse, and he said he should not be at home that night. We went to Mr. Graunt's, on London Bridge, and had a quartern of rum. I had half of it; he asked Mr. Graunt to change half a guinea. Then we went to a house in a court close by Ludgate, on the right hand. We got there about half an hour after eleven. He put one pistol in his pocket, and an empty one in mine. I said I suppose you want me to be taken; he replied I have got a loaded one, if there is any danger call me. I saw him put it in his pocket; we stayed about a quarter of an hour, and then went up the Haymarket together. He heard a coach, and said now is your time. This was near twelve o'clock, in either Shug-lane, or Silver-street; he said, go up to it, and see what you can do. Said I, my heart fails me, I don't know how to go about it; if we must do it, you must go first. He said he would, and do you look out. He went up, and stopped it as it was at a corner. I stood about thirty yards off. It was a hackney coach; he bid the coachman stop, he did directly. He went and said, Deliver, and swore a great oath. I saw him put the pistol into the coach, and hold out his left hand to take what they'd give him. He came to me in about a minute; said he, I have made a prize; I believe I have got some gold, and shook a purse, and put it into his waistcoat pocket. After that there came three more coaches, but they were all empty; then the prosecutrix's coach came down Shug-lane, a hackney coach. Said he, I hope you will not deny it is your turn. I said, if I must, I'll go and try at once. I went up, and bid the coachman stop; he did not directly. Then I bid him again, and put the pistol into the coach, but gave a reel, and my heart failed me. The lady, as I thought, looked very cross and harsh. I ran up Piccadilly into a court, and call'd, Jack, come along. He was near the front of the horses, but I did not see him till he came after a good while, and shewed me a gold watch, a chain and seal, and said, See what I have done; we shall do for ourselves presently. He put it into his waistcoat pocket, and said, here is another coach; I said I'd not go. Then we went into Darkhouse-lane, to the Green Man and Bell. After we had drank three six pennyworths of bumboe, we went and lay down; but I was so uneasy, I got up again. He gave me a Spanish dollar, which I sold for 4 s. 7 d. and said, that he had it of the lady he robbed last; it was a white net purse. He gave me the watch to take care of. I saw another foreign piece, which I took to be a Duke of Cumberland's piece. He said he'd keep that. There did not appear to be much in the purse; it was a little gold watch, plain, and the box and case in one, with a long pinchbeck chain, a seal and key. We stayed there till about four or five o'clock in the morning, and then I went and sold the watch about noon, to Mr. Winstanley, a silversmith, in Lombard-street, for four guineas. I gave him two guineas. The dollar was sold to Mr. Winstanley. I went there alone.</p>
               <p>Question from prisoner. Did I go any farther than Mr. Garret's in Darkhouse Lane, after we had supped?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes, you went to Mr. Graunt's, on London-Bridge.</p>

            . On the 17th of June in the morning, I went to my Lady Head's, in Vere-street, between twelve and one. I went home in a hackney coach, with my two boys.

I saw but a little of the side of his face. He was about the size of the prisoner. I can't be sure he was not the evidence. He swore a great oath, and bid them deliver. I was behind the coach, and saw the barrel of a pistol shine by the moonlight. I think he had a light colour'd coat and striped waistcoat. I did not see what was delivered to him.</p>

This was in the forenoon; in the afternoon, I believe about 3 or 4, he came again and ask'd if I would give any more for it. I said no, and so gave him four guineas for it. I can't say there was a chain to it, but believe not. I knew him to live with an attorney, and thought he lived there then. I believe in the forenoon I bought a Spanish dollar. Two or three days after, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked me if I had bought a gold watch. I ask'd what sort of one. He said a small one in a single case. I said I had. He desired to know what I gave for it. I told him four guineas. He said he was told so: it was honestly came by. I said I did not dispute it, and knew the person that I had it of. He said it was a sailor's watch that came home, and since that his buckles were gone also. I did not shew it him. Two or three days after that, a person saw it, and said he believed he could sell it. He took it, and brought word it was advertised. Then on the next morning, being Friday, I went to Pope's Head Alley, and found he was gone, and was at his mother's by the old Swan in Thames-street. I found her; she and I went to the lady's house in Spring Gardens. She said it was her watch. We went to justice Fielding; she made affidavit it was hers.

It was very moonlight; the prisoner was sitting there on my left hand. He turned his face, and made a little jostle near me, and gave me a little touch upon the elbow. I turned about to look at the people; for I thought it was to liften to what the people said. Then I felt him twitch the string of my watch. He then ran away, and by moonlight I saw him fall on his hands. I came up to him, and as soon as he recovered, he called, Jack, Jack, Jack.

I ask'd him what he meant, and the serjeant desired me to feel in my pocket; for may be, he had put the watch in it, going through the passage into St. James's court. I felt in my pocket; but it was not there. About the middle of the passage he dropped the watch, betwixt the serjeant and me. I saw it drop, and the serjeant took it up.

            . In the month of August I had been at Westminster. Coming back again, about five minutes after ten at night, the prosecutor was about ten yards from the seat where he said he had been robbed of his watch, and said the man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140007"/> gone under the wall. I said I would assist him, and followed him. The prisoner was walking pretty smartly. When I came up to him I seized him by his left arm, and led him away towards the guardroom. Going through the passage under the princess Amelia's room, I saw him put the watch out of his right hand into his left, and saw part of the case and seal, so as to distinguish it to be a watch. I immediately said, You villain, you have the watch; he let it fall on my foot, and from thence on the ground, and broke the glass; the case flew open. I took them up and put the watch and case into my waistcoat pocket, and never pulled them out till I came before the justice, between ten and eleven o'clock, and there delivered it to

               <p>I went with a friend that lives at Fulham. We parted in the park, and he went towards Buckingham Gate. As I was returning, this prosecutor was sitting on a bench, with another fellow in a lightish coloured coat, very close together. The man got up first, and the prosecutor then stood by himself. He crossed the way upon me, and said to me, Did you sit by me? I said, No, honest friend. He said he had lost his watch; and I answered, You scoundrel, I know nothing of it. He then went to this serjeant, and told him that I had his watch, and he came and laid hold on me. I never saw his watch, or sat down by him, as there is a just God in heaven.</p>

            . On Friday the 3d of July, I was at work in the Temple. Going home, I saw the two prisoners standing at Salmon's door. Wright was three parts in getting over the window when I was near him. I had not gone three doors past, before I heard the door unlock, and saw Hutton go in, and the door shut again. Then I came back again, and look'd over, and saw them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140008"/> looking about the house. I took them to be bailiffs, they having great sticks. I went to a green stall over the way, and staid there about ten minutes; then they came both out and went down Fleetstreet. I crossed the way and laid hold of Hutton, and with giving a spring took hold also of Wright. I saw a gentleman's footman coming, and called him to my assistance; he came and took hold of Wright. I took a stick and a hand saw from Hutton, the other person took another saw from Wright; they had the two saws under their coats. We carried them to St. Dunstan's church, to Mr. Hunter, the constable, who I knew to be there being a carpenter at work there. Then we took them to Guildhall before the sitting alderman, the prosecutor came there and saw the saws and swore to them, and he, I, and Mr. Hunter put our private marks on them; here they are; then they were delivered to the constable again. There Hutton said to Wright, you may as well make yourself an evidence, for it is now in your power, and save yourself, for I shall be hanged.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Dunstan's in the West, Mr. Remnant and a gentleman's footman brought the 2 prisoners to me on the 3d of July in the morning to the church. We took them before the sitting alderman, where Mr. Remnant said the same as now. There I heard Hutton say to Wright save yourself if you can get to be an evidence. I took these saws into my possession after they were marked.</p>
               <p>Here the prosecutor is called up again.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two saws, do you know them?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are both mine, I put a mark upon them before the Alderman. They were in my shop that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you open your window that morning?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My wife then lay in, so I did not lie at home; my apprentice had opened the windows before they took the saws. I was not at home till about half an hour after 7 o'clock, after the saws were missed.</p>
               <p>Remnant. The prosecutor told me he put a handle to one of the saws.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did so, it is the smallest saw.</p>
               <p>Hutton's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had a small acquaintance with Mr. Salmon, and he knew something of me. I went and knocked at his door, a man looked out at his window, and said he was not at home; I wanted to borrow a saw of him, the door was open, I went in and took these saws with intent to borrow them, in tending to bring them back again.</p>
               <p>Wright had nothing to say.</p>

Mr. Swain joined me on the Common, we staid there till about 9 o'clock, and then returned to the Wrestlers at Highgate again.

In the parcel there were blue and white handkerchiefs, and several goods besides, which came to 12 l. I staid there about half an hour, then brought the goods to London to where they were bought, in order to prepare a proper advertisement. I went then to Finchley, and had a search warrant, and searched two or three houses there, but found nothing at either. There was a box picked up on the Common by a man with a hay cart, which was carried to my inn, the cord was cut, but the box had not been opened, it was directed to esquire Bradeel at Preston. The robbery was on the Friday, I set out again for Lancashire on the Sunday morning, after leaving money in my landlord's hands for him to spare no cost in inquiring and advertising to find the goods. I overtook my man with the horses at Fenny Stratford, there was then one of the fifteen horses without a pack.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these goods, you mention to have been found, put up in any of the packs which were on these fifteen horses?</p>

            , I was the driver of these packhorses, my master and I set out on the 24th of July from Lad-lane, he left me at Islington and went back. When I came to Highgate, I had all my horses and packs, one horse carried a woman, and 15 with packs; I stopped and drank at the Wrestlers, and there told the horses over; it was then dark and a rainy night. I turned them before me, and did not stay above five minutes after them, and kept with them all the way till I came about a quarter of a mile beyond Brown's Wells, sometimes on the side and sometimes behind them on foot. Near the six mile stone, but it was so dark I could not see it, in telling them over I found the bald mare with her halter about her feet, and no pack on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss her out of the number before you found her unloaded?</p>
               <p>Fenton. I told them and I thought I had made a mistake in telling them, so I ran forward and found she was about the third or fourth without a pack. Then I got upon her and looked about backwards and forwards for almost an hour, but could not find any thing; then I rode on and over-took the rest of the horses on this side Barnet; I believe it was then betwixt 10 and 11.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with any body that you drank with on the road?</p>
               <p>Fenton. No, I did not. I was quite sober. I went on to my inn the White Lion at Coney, and got there betwixt 12 and one. Then I dispatched a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140011"/> messenger to let my master know what had happened, and proceeded for Lancashire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search to see if your saddle things were cut?</p>
               <p>Fenton. The saddle and girt were safe; but the wantey that fastened the pack on was taken away.</p>
               <p>Glover. The wantey was found on Finchley common. I saw it on the Saturday morning, it appeared plain to be cut.</p>
               <p>Q. to Fenton. Did you observe any body on the road that night molest you?</p>

I asked her if she knew any thing of the goods? she knew me again by seeing me at the searching of the house. She carried me to an adjacent place in her mother's house, and there I found two pieces of brown callimanco, another piece of dark callimanco, some red, some yellow, of the remnant of which her gown was made. And likewise another gown cut out, which she said was for her sister. Some muslin wrappers, and calico wrappers, black gloves, white gloves, womens green shoes, a handkerchief with pins in it, a piece of new lawn, an apron.

He produced part of a wrapper, which he said was found on Finchley common, marked R. Addison, Preston. I took Pearvoy on Ludgate-hill the Friday following, he looked very pale and said, before I had said a word to him, I know nothing of the matter. He knew me by seeing me at the search.</p>

            's house, by the Three Cups near the bridge, in St. Paul's, Shadwell; the pig gave a squeak or two, and the dog barked. It was kept at Penprice's house about three weeks, in a stye where he laid sand; and afterwards was killed by Cook, a butcher. I discovered it to Mr. Chapman voluntarily, and am not in custody now.</p>

I observed a boat shove from between the ship and lighter, and saw a large bundle lying in the boat head; it went to Storehouse yard, and I followed it in mine. I saw the man of the boat take a bag on his shoulder, and carry it into Storehouse yard, to a house; the mark I do not know. but I saw No. 3, such a bag as this produced. I did not see him carry it into the house. I shoved my boat stern on shore. After he had taken the bag out of the boat he asked if it was my property; I said no. Penprice was then in a boat along with Robertson; not above a quarter of an hour after he came out of the boat, and asked me what it was. I told him I could not tell, but would go and see. Then I rowed my boat to Bell Wharf, and stoved her, and went to Storehouse yard, and saw the bag standing in a house. He followed us to the house I found to be Clark's. Penprice took it and turned it down, and said, This is the right sort; and asked who would be porter. I said I would not; he then asked Robertson, who said he would. He put it on Robertson's back, and he carried it to some distance, with the mark and number upwards, so he turned it downward. Then he carried it to Penprice's cellar, and put it into one corner, with saw-dust or bran out of a basket upon it.</p>

            . The bag of ginger was brought into Clark's house on the 8th of July, betwixt ten and eleven in the day: it was set down on the right hand side, and had an I. and S. S. with a cross and figure of 3. I was there. Penprice followed it in about 5 minutes, with the 2 witnesses; those two stood at the door. Penprice turned the bag down, and breaking a hole put his finger in and took out some ginger, and said it was of the right sort; then broke a piece and flung it into the window. The numbers were towards the door when first set down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag of the size of this produced?</p>
               <p>A. Austine. I think it was a little longer and whiter. He asked Herrington to carry it, and he refused it; then he asked Robertson, and he did; but in the middle of the yard, Penprice stopped him and turned the mark of the bag downwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he mention any thing against Clark?</p>
               <p>Rose. No, he did not. My master said he would not grant this warrant on any condition, only on the account of some roguery being found out.</p>

I asked him his business, he said he was come to buy my goods, and said my wife spoke to him about selling them; I told him I did not want to sell them, and desired him to go out of the room. Then he said there was a broker to come who would buy them. I desired him to go about his business, I went down to my landlady, then there came a broker and two porters through the passage and went up stairs, I followed them up; the broker said I am come to buy your goods. I said I am not going to sell them; the broker took his leave of me, saying, he hoped there was no harm done, and went away. The prisoner insisted upon staying there, and buying my goods, I told him if he'd not go I would make him, then he went away.

I went past him, and observed him so as to know him again. When I was gone about half way of the field, walking very slowly along, I heard a pattering of feet behind me: I turned myself round, and saw the prisoner and another man with him about 5 or 6 yards from me; they seemed to be in haste, I went on one side to let them come by; the prisoner pulled out a pistol with a brass barrel, clapped it to my breast, and desired me to deliver my money, or I was a dead man if I made any words. I told him I had but a very little, and if they were in earnest they should have a share of it. I put my hand in my pocket and took out about six peny worth of halfpence, which they refused. I put it in my pocket agai n; the prisoner lifted up the flap of my waistcoat and pulled out my watch and put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What watch was it?</p>
               <p>Chalmers. It was a silver one. The other man stood over me with a large stick, and put his hand in my breeches pocket. I had thirteen guineas in one pocket, and about 14 s. in the other. I had two pockets on one side; he took his hand out of my pocket; I was afraid he had got hold of my gold. I took hold of his hand and desired him to let me see what he had got, saying, he must not have all, he must give me a part; he opened his hand, and I saw it was silver, which made me quite easy. Then the prisoner was for going, but the other seeing the gold of some bulk in my other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140017"/> pocket, he put his finger to it and swore it was gold, and he would have it; the prisoner was then gone I believe five or six yards from me. This man put his hand to my pocket, I catched his other arm, and took him by the collar with my right hand, and told him he should have no more. He then desired me to let him go and he would give me no farther disturbance. I said, if they did not deliver back my watch I would follow them. They immediately ran off, I followed them. The prisoner turned round and said if I followed him he would do for me. I still followed them, and saw a man on horseback, upon which I waved my hat to him and he came up, then we chased them through the fields towards Islington. The man on horseback passed by me and drove one of them into a boghouse at Islington, the other we lost in the fields, I should know him again could I see him.

The second was the 24th of July in the night. I let her in and let her lay with me; I left her in the parlour, and while I went down in the kitchen, she pushed the lock back and got in the shop; and out of a little room, which is between the shop and parlour, she took two shirts, a quart bottle of wine, and a quart bottle of cherry brandy. The white wine belonged to a lodger in the house. She carried them out, and said, she'd go and pawn them to make a little money, but would return them again. My master and mistress missed the shirts, and she was taken up ; she owned she took the things, and sold the tea in German street and the soap for six pence, before justice Fielding. I lived there six weeks. I am married, my husband is a soldier. The two shirts produced in court. I know these to be my master's property.</p>

I missed a silver saucepan, which had not been used during the time she had been in my service; it was not under lock and key, the key was lost. I inquired of her, after I had looked about, where it was, she said, I'll go and look for it; she went to the place where it should have been, and returned again and said it was not there. What, said I, have you moved it, and where? She said indeed, madam, I have took it to keep Benjamin out of prison, and if I would let her go out, she would go and find it. She returned and said it should be got some time the next day. I missed a silver watch and a gold chain fixed to it, which had been a constant plaything for the little girl; I asked what was become of them, she said she had taken and given them to Milley. We missed other things by looking about, a silver milk pail for a tea table, a silver egg, a play-thing of the child. She pretended she knew nothing of them. Then she went and fetched Millicent. After that we missed 4 sheets, and 6 napkins.</p>

I knew the sheets were in a store chest about two months ago. I have seen the silver saucepan in the house since she lived with me. I kept her in the house endeavouring to find out the things. I got a constable and took her before the justice ; there she owned all, that she had taken the things she was charged with. Her sister Millicent was taken before the justice at the same time, and was charged with having received them from her sister, and pawning them. She cried and told us the linen was at Mr. Figg's, the saucepan at one Mrs. Hunt's in Orchard street ; I can't say she said she received them, but she did not deny it. The mother came to my house the morning after the discovery, and said she was sorry, and asked ten thousand pardons. She denied seeing any thing.</p>

She was sent for the next morning, I charged her with receiving them of her sister and pawning them; she acknowledged the charge, and promised to bring them again. She said some was at Mrs. Hunt's in Orchard street; at that time we could get no more out of her. I was with her before Justice Lediard, Ann confessed there she was guilty of taking the things mentioned in the search warrant which was read to her. She said she had delivered them to Millicent. Millicent owned she had received those things from her sister. The brother and mother were then taken up; she confessed where the plate and chain were; that she had told their distresses to her sister, who had lent her the things and she had pawned them. She likewise confessed that the watch and chain were at Mrs. Sugg's in the Bowling Alley. I think the two dimitty petticoats and silver pail were in Pye street. The mother denied she knew any thing of the matter; then the son denied it, but he afterwards said he knew of it, and that when he was ill, Ann cried to him to have the things taken out, upon which he raised some money and got them out. She looks at the silver watch, this I saw in March last. The silver milk pail, silver snuff-box, and tweezer I saw in Jan or Feb. They are my property.</p>

As we were going from the Justice to New Prison, he confessed he took them out of the ship, and had slung them over board, for fear of being discovered.

               <p>The three ducks and drake appeared in court, and without variation or hesitation gave evidence against the two prisoners, as they had done before when in confinement in the gravel pit; after which their respective owners deposed to them as their property.</p>

The prisoner lodged at my house, with his wife, in ready furnished lodgings, some months; they quitted it two nights before the robbery was done, which was on the 22nd of August; he gave me no warning when he went away. On the Friday night he came again, and desired I'd let him lie there that night; his wife came that day at noon and paid for their lodging, and gave me two-pence for it. He staid there in the former lodging. I called him in the morning, as he had desired, about five, and took my leave of him in the yard ; he went as tho' he was going for London. I have no family at all, there was only he. I, and Jeffery Mills had lain in the house that night; we were all gone out, and I had lock'd the outward door, and my chamber door, and had the keys in my pocket. I have no shutters to my windows, but am sure the casement that he got in at was hasped; I looked out at the window to see what weather it was, and shut and hasped it again; there were no panes broke. I was told the prisoners was seen going in at my window about six o'clock on that morning. I was then in the fields. I came home and unlocked my outward door; the window was shut, not hasped then, and a pane of glass broke in it. I lifted up Baymont to get in at the window; he came down one pair of stairs, and unbolted the door; then Dancer and Baymont went up to this chamber ; I followed them. Then they went up into the garret, and saw nobody there; we then went down again into my chamber. I found the lock of the chamber door broke, and Dancer saw a key lying in the window, which I left in my breeches pocket; that was the key of a trunk where my money was. I took it and unlocked the trunk; there was no money left. There was one guinea, one half guinea, one five shilling piece, and the rest in silver, in all three pounds two shillings. I had one gold ring in the same trunk, that was gone; I saw them all on the Friday morning lying there, but did not tell it. I desired my master to ride after this man, and I'd follow. The prisoner's wife came as I was going out of the house, and asked for her husband; I seized her. I went up to put a coat on in my chamber; there I picked up a handkerchief, produced in court; it belongs to the prisoner who owned it before the justice; and I know it to be his handkerchief. I walked to London with the woman; we took her before the justice. When he found his wife was in confinement, he came to my house on the Sunday night, and threatened me for taking away his good name; then I charged two men with him; carrying him away, he got from us, and ran two hundred yards before taken again. He had parted with his apparel, and bought others. I never saw any of my things again.</p>

            . On Saturday morning last was fortnight, about five o'clock. I was going to my master's by the prosecutor's house; it was light. I saw a man creeping in at the prosecutor's chamber window; I was within thirty or forty yards of him. I went on and told my master, and that he looked like the prisoner, but could not be sure. He was in a sort of a dark coloured coat. My master told the prosecutor ; we all went to the house. He unlocked the door, but could not get in. Then he helped me up on a shed, and I got in at the window; I went down and unbolted the door, and master and he went up together.</p>

I went out on the 20th of June; when I returned, I missed a silk brocade waistcoat, which I left on a shelf under the care of Richard Burks; he was my servant. I advertised it on the third of July, and on the fourth a pawnbroker brought it to my shop. Produced in court, and deposed to. I desired him to detain the person that brought it if he came again. The day after he went again, and there was detained, and I sent for.</p>

It was in his shop upon the twentieth of last June. It had hung out, but rain came, and I took it in again. The prisoner came in and asked for a linen waistcoat and black breeches.

The prosecutor to that said, there were no men employed in Tower-street at that time. He said he had a job there, but he would not have wanted that quantity, and there were flooring brads in his pocket, tho' no flooring to be done in the job.</p>

            . On monday morning the 15th of June the prisoner's daughter brought a bundle of rags to my yard at the Rose and Crown, Catharine-wheel Alley, Whitechapel. It was these things put up in rags. She came again in about two hours and desired to put them into the cellar, that was not granted. Then she went and hid them in a coalshed. The next day we laid in some coals, and the men in removing some boards found the bundle. There was cloth cut out for three coats, and linings for them, and a piece of red cloth. The prisoner's wife came to demand them of me the 16th of June, and threatened me if I would not deliver them. Mr. Bradshaw came to me and asked me if I had such cloth. Mr. Bradshaw's son came and said he was the person that cut it out, so I delivered them to him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Martin's parish, in the Strand, On the 22d of July, betwixt 11 and 12 at night I stopped the prisoner with a parcel loose in her apron near Bullin court ; she said she was going to a place, and went into Exeter street to her own mother's door. Mrs. Turner came up to me, and told me the prisoner had got some things of hers. I carried her to the constable.</p>
               <p>Samuel Green. I am constable. The prisoner, with the things loose in her apron, was brought to the watch-house by the last evidence. She seemed much confused, and said very little.</p>

               <p>I was hired a weekly servant in this house for 2 s. When I had been there about three days, my dinner did not agree with me, and my mistress gave me a glass of brandy, and the other young lady gave me two or three glasses of wine, and I was so much in liquor that I can't tell whether I took the things or they put them in my apron.</p>
               <p>Mr. Birmingham and his wife, and Mr. Caswell and his wife, appeared, and gave her a good character, exclusive of this affair.</p>

I took him before Justice Fielding; he owned nothing. This was on Saturday, and on the Monday after came a porter. (He is since dead of the small pox.) Then Mrs. Taylor, behind St. Clement's church, came and said, she had some whalebone, and a letter, which she said she had received; it is directed to her, at the Little Blue Anchor.

I asked him whether he came honestly by it, he said he had it to sell for one in the Strand; it weighed twenty three pounds and a half, the half pound I did not pay for.

After that, in about 5 minutes, Purple went down stairs, the other said, she will not come up again, I'll go for her, so she went, and I heard one say upon the stairs, has he miss'd it yet. Then I took my breeches and felt, and said, I do miss it, and ran down stairs without my breeches and seiz'd Masters; Purple got off. Then I went up stairs and put on my breeches, and got a constable and some watchmen: they went up stairs and search'd but could not find it; somebody said look, under the bed. They then went up and found it there on the floor.</p>

               <p>It appeared the prisoner denied her being either married or with child the day before she was delivered. The child was found in a box, in her room, dead, on the 22nd of July. All the evidences deposed there were no marks of violence upon it. She in her defence said it was her first child, was taken in labour sooner than expected, and being surprized, had not proper assistance as is necessary. She called the person who was ordered to search her room, who produced a quantity of child-bed linen; and called Mr. Clark, who lives in the Temple, who depos'd, she came to him about two months ago and told him her case; and that he would assist her in speaking to a surgeon to help her; and that a Jamaica gentleman, one Mr. Roberts, was the father. James Mophat deposed, that one Mr. Roberts, who is now gone to Jamaica, had applied to him to assist a young woman with proper conveniences, who he expected would be delivered of a child about Christmas, but did not mention the prisoner's name.</p>

He gave a very great sigh, I asked him if his name was Brown, he said yes. Then I asked him, if he lived at the sign of the King's Head, at Mr. Lowrey's, he said yes. I and the landlady of the King's Head took him there, which was about ten yards of, then Mr. Pell, a surgeon, was sent for, who came and dressed him. The landlady desired me to examine his breeches, which I did I turned the pockets, and found nothing but a pencil in a side pocket.</p>

            . Mr. Brown was clerk at the brew-house where I belong. I heard of this melancholly affair of his being knock'd down and robbed. I went and found him alive, but in a very bad condition, in bed mangled, with his cloaths all extremely bloody, and speechless. His face all over black, his mouth so beat that it could hardly open, and all bloody; his head was bound up, the surgeon having been with him. I consulted a friend what to do in this affair; he told me, there were proper persons for that. After which there came five or six thief catchers to the brew-house, I told them I had a suspicion of a person : they took up one Spanish Jack (the person who was an accomplice with, and evidence against, Antho. de Rosa, for the murder of a man near the Barking Dogs) and brought him to the brew-house. He confessed he knew of the affair, and that four of them went out at that time upon the Scamp, as they call it. After that they took Branch and lock'd him up, then I went down with them to Deptford, and there they took up three more Descent was one of them. Coming up by water he acknowledged he was in the robbery, but denied he knock'd Mr. Brown down. We brought him up, and had him into a summer-house in the garden, he then said, he himself being-lame, Branch took the stick, being nimbler than he, ran up and knock'd him down at the corner of Virginia-street.</p>

               <p>Backwell. They acknowledged afterwards another attempt they made that night. I will not be positive whether they might mistake the one for the other, but I talked to him and Branch too of the affair of Brown only. Descent said, he robbed a gentleman near Well close square, of a watch and five shillings, but did not mention the name. We took them both before Justice Manwaring, where they wanted each of them to be admitted an evidence. His worship told them he would not admit either, if they had any thing to say before him they might. They were examined apart, each acknowledged this robbery. Descent was examined first, he said Branch knock'd him down. Branch, when he was examined, said Descent knock'd him down. Branch acknowledged that he himself took the watch and five shillings from him, and that he took three keys from his pocket, and afterwards flung them away. We found one in Well-close square, it was bloody. Mr. Brown had been out from the Sunday morning. I did not know that he had a watch, or what money he had about him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in to attend Mr. Brown on Sunday the 9th of August, about eleven o'clock at night. I found him with several wounds on his head, one large one under his left eye; the arteries were divided, his head and face very much swelled. I thought the wounds must be given with nothing less then the bar of a window, as they appeared to be given with a blunt weapon, for they were bruises. I was the next day with him, then there came an account, that the people that were supposed to do it were taken. They were carried into a back room in the garden, there I saw Descent, Branch was not then in hearing, he acknowledged himself to be one of the people that did the fact. I desired he would let me know with what weapon these wounds were given, because it might be of some service to me in the course of my attendance in healing those wounds. There was a large oaken stick produced by one of the people that had taken him. Descent told me, he believed the gentlman was knock'd down with that stick (produced in court, it was a large oaken stick, quite out of size, being over large, with a knob to it). Descent also told me this piece was broke out in striking the blow (a splinter from out of the knob), the stick then was bloody. Descent then shew'd me his knees, and said, you see I am not fit to enter into these exploits, I got into the company of young Branch and he has lead me into the fact. I asked him how it was done, he said, they were coming along by the end of Virginia-street, and saw a gentleman before them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the time of night?</p>
               <p>Pell. I believe he did not. Upon seeing him. Descent said, that Branch snatch'd the stick out of his hand, and made use of such an expression as this, I will shew you how to knock a man down, upon which he knock'd the gentleman down. I was with him afterwards before Justice Manwaring, then they were examined apart; there Descent was pretty near in the same story. Branch I think, said, they were coming along, and either he or Descent said, there is a mark; upon which Descent went up, and gave him a wipe or a lick, or some such term, and kept paying him over the head, while I put my hand in his pocket and took out his watch and money. Then Mr. Backwell asked him about some keys, he said he had taken some but had thrown them away coming along.</p>
               <p>Justice Manwaring. On Monday the tenth of August, in the afternoon, the two prisoners at the bar were brought before me. Mr. Backwell had told me he suspected they had done murder. I desired they might be kept back that I might examine them one by one. Descent was brought in first, I asked him what he had to say for himself about the charge laid against him in robbing and murdering Mr. Brown. He said he met Renney Branch at the house of Mrs. Stitchbourne in Rag fair, about five o'clock on Sunday night, who asked him to go into the fields. He went with him and one Roberts, from an alehouse where they had some beer. Going along they met a man and Branch knock'd him down in the fields, and took from him a knife and threepence; that he found fault with him for robbing the man, saying to him, if you want money I have money, why did you abuse him. After this they went into an alehouse, in Ratcliff-high-way, there Roberts left him, and betwixt nine and ten o'clock Branch and he went out together; and going by the end of Virginia-street, leading to Wiltshire-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. How far from Virginia-street did you find Mr. Brown lying?</p>
               <p>Williams. Virginia-street is, I believe, about a hundred yards from Well-close square, and we found him about twenty yards from Virginia-street in Wiltshire-lane.</p>
               <p>The Justice continues. Branch said to him with an imprecation, D - n his eyes, here is a mark, and twitched the stick out of his hand, stepped up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140029"/> the man, and knocked him down, and after he was down struck him several blows, but the man never spoke; he blamed him much for abusing the man. That Branch took his watch and money from him, and went away, and when he came to Mrs. Stitchbourne's, Branch offer'd the watch to her for thirty shillings, and I think made use of such an expression, that he had milled it; she took it and said she would pay him for it in the morning, and in the morning she gave him a guinea in gold, and four shillings in silver, and Branch gave him sixteen shillings of the money. He also said, Branch told, him he had given half a guinea to one Bett Thomas, to go and get a pair of pistols to go upon the lay with the next day. When Descent was carried out, and Branch brought in, I asked him in the same manner what he had to say for himself; he came in with a good deal of courage, and wanted to know whether I would admit him an evidence. I said if he had any thing to say, he might say it freely and voluntarily, I'd lay no injunctions upon him, nor give him any encouragements. Then he said, Descent, Roberts, and he, were at the house of one Sergeant, at Prince Frederick's head, in Rag Fair; that those three went out together into the fields. As they went along they met a man, that Descent gave him a knock on the pate with a stick, and took from him three pence and a knife. That they went from thence into Ratcliff Highway to an alehouse. That there

             left them. About nine or ten they went from that house ; and as they were going along, Descent said to him, with several imprecations, the first man he met he'd knock his brains out if he had no more money than the man they met before. When they came a little beyond the end of Virginia-street, they met a man. Descent knock'd him down, and he never spoke afterwards. He hit him several blows after he was down, and bid him [that is Branch] take out his watch and money, which he said he did. That he blamed him for beating the man so much, and desired him to let him alone. Then they went into Well Close Square; there they met a man and knocked him down. That he cried out, and the neighbours got to their doors; so they ran away, and got nothing from him.</p>

               <p>Macdonald. On the Monday after the robbery I went to Stitchbourne's house; there Branch was in bed, just getting up. Descent had made his escape to Deptford. After we had secured Branch in a place of safety, we went to Deptford and found Descent; after Branch was carried to the Tower jail. He bid me take up Mrs. Stitchbourne, and wanted to be admitted an evidence. He told me the watch was disposed of to Mrs. Stitchbourne for twenty-four or twenty-five shillings. Descent said at Deptford, he wish'd he could be made an evidence, and that he sold the watch for twenty-five shillings to Stitchbourne. I took Stitchbourne up; the justice ordered us to keep her by herself, and so to come at the watch. I kept her a day at my room; she sent a girl for the watch, who brought it and delivered it to her and me, she wanted to have me swear against the girl; she own'd she bought it for twenty five shillings.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Hall. I lived at Mrs. Stitchbourne's, Branch and Descent came there about five o'clock the ninth of August, in the afternoon, and asked if she would buy any thing if they could steal it; she said she had trusted to Branch, and might as well again as before, as he had had it in his power to hurt her, and did not. They came again the same night between ten and eleven, all in a sweat; I was standing at the door talking to three young fellows. The prisoners went into the house, and to the inward room to my mistress: the young fellows went and peeped through a crack in the window shutter. I went in and bid my mistress draw the curtain; she was looking at the works of a silver watch; after that they called for a pint of beer.

            , a lodger in the house, fetch'd it from the alehouse, and I was ordered to bring it into the room, which I did. I heard them ask thirty shillings for the watch, and heard her say, no, but five and twenty. They lay at that house ; after they went up to bed, they had words. Descent charged Branch with having two watches; I thought they would have went to fighting. Spanish Jack went up with intent to part them, and heard their whole discourse. I saw Mrs. Stitchbourne the next morning give them a golden guinea, and said she would make it up another time ; I went and changed the guinea, and gave the money into Branch's hands. I brought half a pint of rum. Branch had sixteen shillings and six pence.</p>

Betwixt ten and eleven, Elizabeth Hall and I, and three butchers, were standing at the door talking; the prisoners came rushing in, and went into Mrs. Stitchbourne's room; she called me to go and get a pot of beer, and give it to

Then we went into Ratcliff Highway, and called for some beer; there I left them. About five or six stones throw from Well Close Square, a little before nine, they both had sticks in their hands; Descent had the large stick produced here, which he shewed to me the next morning after he had knocked down the brewer's clerk, and said a splinter came out here at the time ( puting his finger to an open place in the nob.) That he beat him over the head, and took a watch and some silver from him.</p>

            . I parted, with Descent the ninth of August, in the back lane near Well Close Square. In the morning we appointed to meet, to go to Deptford. I came according to my promise in the morning; he called up Roberts, between eight and nine o'clock; at Prince Frederick's head. When we were there, a man said a robbery had been committed near Well Close Square, and the man so beat that he was not likely to live. Going along, Descent shewed me the stick, and a piece out of the head of it, and when we came to take water, he shew'd it me again, and said, It was I that did that job in Well Close Square last night.</p>

            , were examined over again, and deposed as in the former trial.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pell was here more particular as to the wounds of the deceased, as follows:</p>
               <p>Mr. Pell. I found the deceased bleeding, his head and face very much bruised, and several large wounds on his head; one under the left eye, the temporary artery was divided, the wounds seemed to be done with a blunt weapon, they were what we call contused wounds. I put up the divided vessels, stopped the effusion of blood, and made use of restringent applications, dressed him and left him till next day. I then desired the assistance of another surgeon, and Mr. Harrison, surgeon of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140031"/> London hospital, was called in; I open'd the man's head. After removing the rollers, the first thing that offered itself to our view was part of the brains lying on the hair on the outside of his head, just above the temple on the left side. Upon this, with the advice of Mr. Harrison, I made a large incision about five inches in length, in a semicircular shape, taking in best part of his forehead, and separated the scalp from the scull. When we had done this things observed a prodigious fracture of the scull, the Biggest that ever I saw; it was broke into many pieces, several of which I extracted. I believe one (spike or splinter ) was drove two inches into the brain. We suffered a bone to remain, fearing the whole of the brain would come out. The man lay under great and horrible pain, which induced us to shorten the work. Every day after in the course of my attendance, I hardly dressed him without taking out more pieces of the scull, that pressed in upon the substance of the brain. The third day I discovered a large piece of bone loose, down the forehead, the fracture running down the forehead ; there was a discharge of the brain from the inside. In a few hours after the extraction of this bone he recovered his senses, which was on the third day. Before he lay as it were in a stupified way. I was very particular in asking him what he remembered of his being so used, and he always said, the first of it he remembered was my first dressing him ; he remembered nothing of what was done to him at the time of the robbery. He died last Monday was se'nnight, which was the 31st; he was dying four days. We had so great a discharge of the brain towards the latter end, that I did not care to open it. After he was dead, I opened him in Mr. Harrison's presence; upon taking the upper part of the scull from the under, out of six bones which the scull is composed of, I found four of them fractured; the bone of his nose was broke from that of the forehead. His left cheek bone was broke, the fracture of which must be by a violent blow; for this bone is less liable to a fracture than any other in the body ; all the left side of the brain, which we call the left hemisphere, was absolutely dissolved by a mortification. I opened his body, and found all the bowels bid fair for a vigorous old age.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the whole do you, or do you not believe these wounds were the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Pell. No doubt but he died of these blows he had received about the head.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mordica. I live in Shoemaker row and keep a glass-shop. On Sunday between 9 and 10 in the morning, there were two men and the prisoner offering to sell a silver milkpot, the people told me they believed it was stolen. I being Constable, took it out of Gaines's hand, who had it to sell, he asked 3 s. or 3 s. and 6 d. he said it is not mine, but that persons there, and said I know him. Then I said he should go before the Alderman. There the prisoner said, he found it, and it was his, the other ran way. I took them and brought them to the Compter. On the way Gaines told me, if I'd go to one Mr. Goostree, I should find that the pot was his property. I went there and told him of it; he then missed it and came with me and saw it, and said it was his property.</p>

I worked in the garden at Brumpton, and have known the prisoner two years, he scowers clothes; I attended a sick gentleman at Brumpton ; he desired me to go out the 28th of June in the morning to get some mushrooms, going thro' the five fields at Chelsea, betwixt five and six, I met the prisoner, he said Frank, I can go and get a good breakfast if you'll go along with me. I consented, we went to Mr. Goostree's house at the corner of a street, he knock'd at the parlour window, a servant maid open'd the window, and said, I'll come presently, she open'd the door in about a quarter of an hour and let him in, I stood just by the corner of the street. He came out with an apron full of bread and cheese, and said, we'll go and have a breakfast, which we did. Then at his desire we went and took a walk over the new Bridge, and to Dukes-place, there I believe were a hundred Jews walking about. He said to me, I have found a very fine thing, I'll sell it, and pull'd it out of his pocket, I thought it was the case of a watch. He gave it me in my hand, I shewed it to a man who went to the Constable who came up to me, and asked me whose it was? I said a man has found it, and he'll sell it for three shillings and sixpence an ounce. He took hold on us both, when we came to the Compter, I took the Constable into the large, and said, he came from a very creditable house, and may be he has took this from thence. He asked me where?

The next morning, being the 30th of July, when we came to ship the goods this package was missing, upon which it was advertis'd; after which, this piece, with the prisoner was brought to our house by Mr. Brown the pawnbroker. Then the prisoner said he had taken it for work which he had done, but could not tell where the persons liv'd, nor tell their names. The next morning he was taken before my Lord Mayor, but before his Lordship came to the hall, he acknowledged to Mr. Chancey, in my hearing, that he was the person who took the box out of the shop, and hop'd he'd be as favourable as possible to him, and he'd let him know where the rest of the goods were, and desired we would stay till his daughter came to us, and then he would give us the keys of the room in order for us to find them. We were agreeable to this, staid till she came, and then went with her into some street near Bloomsbury-square, and found some of the lawns, some of them were torn.</p>

               <p>I am used to draw for people that pay me in goods, sometimes in money. This was brought to me by a man that told me he had no money at that time, so I took the things. It is not to be imagin'd I'd go to pawn things with marks on them, if I had any notion of their being stolen. I have lived threescore and ten years in town, and never was charg'd with any thing of this sort. I have drawn for nobility and could have cheated them of hundreds of pounds had I been inclined so to do.</p>

I shew'd her some a yard wide, but she did not like them, and then they went out of the shop. After they were gone about three minutes, I turned my head and missed the cloth mentioned, which was of twenty red handkerchiefs, and a piece of ten blue ones.

            . I live in West-street near the Seven Dials, and am a pawnbroker. After the prosecutrix had lost the things mentioned, Chapman came about five or six in the evening, on the 30th of July, to pledge a red handkerchief for a shilling, and said she bought it in St. Martin's Lane. I stopt her, sent for the prosecutrix and she owned it. After that the prisoner said she brought it in Compton-street. She had another on her neck which the prosecutrix owned.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in that handkerchief, so that you, or the prosecutrix, can know it from the others of the same piece?</p>
               <p>Pardey. I cannot say there is.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the closet locked?</p>
               <p>Watson. It was, but the key was in the door. At that time the prisoner was my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the money last?</p>
               <p>Watson. I saw it between seven and eight o'clock at night, and missed it at eleven, when I went to take it up to bed, the box and money were both gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Watson. She was gone also, I did not see her after nine o'clock. I went to see for her the next day, and between one and two o'clock I took her at the Savoy, and carried her before a justice of the peace. She owned she had taken the money away. After this I was informed, that the box had been seen, at the Chequer alehouse in St. James's. I went there and found it; it was produced by Mrs. Fowley that keeps the house. There were in it some notes which were there when in my house.</p>

            . On the 28th of July last, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came into my house and desired she might have some stakes dressed. She took me on one side and gave me a bundle, after that this box, in which was thirty shillings, and then desired me to put them by for her. She came again the next day, took out all the money, but twelve shillings, and went away (the box produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

The prisoner came down the yard and asked if any sailors lived in that place. I being a sailor's wife, said, there was, and asked him who he wanted; he said, he could not tell; that there were three men that day at the Exchange, from that place, and he was come to ship them; then I directed him to my sister's house, as there were sailors lodged there. He went there, her door and window were open. I found he did not come back, then I looked out and saw my sister in her chamber over the lower room. I called to her, and said, did you see the man that wanted you? She said, no, What man? Then I saw him jump from towards her drawers, in the lower room, to the out side of the door.</p>

On the 12th of July, a little after ten at night, I had been hiring a coach at the Mews-wall, and was coming home to my lodgings in St. Martin's lane. The prisoner came rushing up to me, and jostled against me, and to the best of my knowledge his right hand was in my pocket. I saw an handkerchief in his hand; I think it then was hardly out of my pocket, and felt him at my pocket. I catched at the handkerchief, but could not take hold on it. He ran and I ran after him; he ran no other way but round the cross, and went twice round where the statue stands. I had like to have been upon him four or five times. I called out as I ran, Stop pickpocket, stop thief. At last I secured him; he had dropped the handkerchief in his running, and it was picked up near the statue of Charles on horseback, and brought to us; after which he acknowledged he had taken it, and begged I'd excuse him, before the people in the watch-house, and went down on his kneess and said it was his first fact. The handkerchief produced in court, and deposed to, with the prosecutor's name on it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Moss. I had but just before taken it out of my pocket. and wiped my face with it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 12th of July, after calling the hour ten, I heard the cry of Stop thief, and ran where I saw people running; I was within about ten or twelve yards of them when the prosecutor took hold of the prisoner; he gave me charge of him, and we took him to the watch-house. There the prosecutor asked him if he would tell him what he had done with his handkerchief; the prisoner at first denied his knowing of it. We confined him, and went and traced the ground round where they ran; there we found the handkerchief lying on the ground. I took it to the watch-house. The next day he acknowledged he had taken it, and had dropped it because it should not be found. He begged of the prosecutor on his knees that he'd forgive him.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor went down to the Bath after I was committed, and is come up in order to prosecute me. He told my father if he'd give him as much money as it had cost him he would not hurt me. I knowing myself to be innocent, was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175209140036"/> willing it should cost my father any thing, so chose to take my trial.</p>
