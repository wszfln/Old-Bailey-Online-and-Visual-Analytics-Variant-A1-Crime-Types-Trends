                  </hi>. I am Deputy Coroner of the City and Liberty of Westminster—on 20th September I commenced an inquest on the bodies of two boys, Isaac and Leo Serne; the prisoner Serne was sworn and examined as a witness—I took down his evidence—I produce my original notes—after him the prisoner Goldfinch was sworn and examined—I took notes of his evidence which I produce—other witnesses were examined on that day, and then there was an adjournment to the 27th—no evidence was taken then—there was a further adjournment to the 11th October—Goldfinch was then recalled, and gave further evidence; after Mrs. Serne and her daughter Kate—Serne did not attend on that occasion; he sent a doctor's certificate that he was suffering from quinsey. (<hi rend="italic">The depositions were read as follows</hi>: "<hi rend="smallCaps">LEO SERNE</hi>, 274, Strand, hairdresser, sworn, said The deceased are my two sons, Isaac Serne and Leo Serne; Isaac Serne was 14 years old; Leo Serne was 11 years old. My wife, my four children, my servant and myself were in the house on Saturday evening; three of the children went to bed at half-past 9 in the room next to my bedroom; the fourth child went to bed with me. I went to bed at half-past 12; the bedrooms are at the top of the house at the back; the servant went to bed at the same time; he sleeps front room, top floor. My wife awakened me about 2.30 am; she said there was smoke round the gaslight. I opened the door, and saw a mass of smoke. I pulled my children out of their room into my room. I helped them out of the window on to the roof. There was a fire in the front first floor; I left it in; it was burning very small. I left no gas alight; I left no candle or lamps alight. I keep no oil or petroleum in the house. I have been in the house five months. I tried to insure it. No company would take it. I paid a premium to a clerk in the 'North British Fire Insurance,' on the 1st of September. The premium was for the stock-in-trade and furniture. I do not know if the house itself was insured; the house was refused because it was considered dangerous. I took special precautions as to fires. I turned out the gas. Two gentlemen were with me till 10.45 p.m. Saturday. They were smoking. I smoked; that was in the 1st floor room. I saw no flame when I was roused. After ten minutes staying in the gutter I was helped into another window by the police. I can give no idea myself how the fire originated. We all went to bed at about 12.45 a.m." "<hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN GOLDFINCH</hi>, assistant to Mr. Serne, sworn, said: I assisted in putting out the lights at 12 o'clock. I went to bed at 12.45. I had been downstairs all the evening at work till 12; there were customers till then. No customers were smoking. The two gentlemen were smoking in ground floor back. They were Mr. Smith and Mr. Keenan. I went into the room at 11.30 after they left. I noticed nothing then; no smell of fire. Mr. Serne remained in the room until we retired at 12.45. I was also with him. There was a fire in the room. It was very low when we went up. We both smoked until 12.45. I am sure no matches were thrown about. Mrs. Serne was there as well. Nobody sleeps on the ground floor. There are no oils kept in the back room. I was alarmed by screams from the back room, about 1.30. I opened the window. I tried to get into the back room; I was suffocated and went back to the window. I called again. I got no answer. The escape was brought, and I got down by the escape. I have no idea where or how the fire arose. There was a small fender; there</p>

               <p>was no guard. I put two small lighted coals on the hob; there was stone round the fireplace. On the first flour was one room used for an office. The 2nd floor two rooms; one as a sitting-room, the other as a kitchen; it has been used as a bed-room occasionally. I was not in that room. There was a small tank for hot water in the room over the shop over the front door; it was heated by gas; it is never empty. The gas was put out about 11.30 p.m.; the gas is not turned off from the main. <hi rend="italic">Recalled</hi>. I have been three or four months with Mr. Serne. I have been employed by him previously at casual times. I lived and slept at the house, and had 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week. Mr. Smith did Serne's correspondence. I was awakened by the screaming. I was sound asleep in bed, un<lb/>dressed. I found the room full of smoke. I opened the window at once, and looked out. I had nothing but my shirt on. I dragged my trousers on, and tried to get into the back room. I found the smoke so thick I could not get there. My room door is 10 feet from the boys' door. I found the escape outside near the window. I came down. I had only my trousers and shirt on. I only leant on the window two or three minutes. I was then putting my trousers on. The escape arrived as I got back to the window. I am quite sure I had not my coat on. Mr. Serne and his wife did not quarrel as far as I heard. I heard the name of Harry, my name. My real name is John Henry. I am always called Harry by the family. I heard nothing said besides that. I heard nothing fall downstairs. I heard nothing of the cats. I did not hear a call of murder. Mr. and Mrs. Serne quarrelled occasionally. I do not know why the little girl was removed the night before. I never knew for certain where the children would sleep. I was not asked to rescue the boys. I had been in bed three-quarters of an hour; sound asleep. The boys were treated very kindly by the parents; they were always clothed decently; they had new suits of clothes recently. I did not know the amount of furniture; there was a bedstead, chair, and carpet and cupboard in my room; there was perfumery in the shop. The hair-dressing business was not very extensive. He Lad 1,000 tins of capuala; they held about 4 ounces. There were a quantity in my bedroom, and a quantity in the office; the principal ingredient was hogs' lard. Mr. Serne never had any gunpowder to my knowledge. I know Mr. Antincke. Mr. Serne had no interest in his house. I saw him about a week previous to the fire. I think between 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was taken weekly in the business. The advertisements' are made of gelatine. As I came down the fire escape the fireman that passed me asked if I was alright. I told the fireman the people were in the house. I knew it was easy to get out at the back in case of fire. We often talked about the place burping. He never mentioned any way but by the window. The pointed can produced was used for lime water; the other tins I have not seen before. I think the hairdressing stock, without the tools in the saloon, was worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. The daughters slept in the second floor front room. A large order was returned of the capuala. I don't think any of the tins were under the foot of the stairs. The smoke was very black.")</p>

About half-past 1 a.m. on Sunday, 18th September, I was in Howard Street, Strand, when I smelt fire—I immediately ran into the Strand and up to 274, where there was a shop window, which I looked through—I saw a fire on the right-hand corner of the shop window against the door-post, three or four feet from the door—I should think the flame ran two or three feet high; it did not run very wide, not so wide as high—I went more to the right, towards where the fire was, and looked through the same shop window at another place, and saw flames in the left-hand corner of the shop; it was very much in flames; I should say the flames were about four or five feet high, I could not say exactly; it was about three feet wide, I should say—It was the much larger fire of the two—the two fires were five to six yards apart, I should say—there was nothing between the two fires that I could see to connect the one fire with the other—I saw two or three constables there when I came up; I could not give the name of any person who was there when I came up; they were men in uniform, but they were upon the spot before I was—after I had seen the fires I broke into 275, next door, and, accompanied by brother constables, I made my way up some of the staircase of 275—a glass was broken—I heard screaming, it was a woman's voice shouting "Help"—some of our body called out as loudly as they could "Where are you? Where are you?"—the smoke in 275 then became very dense, and we were</p>

               <p>obliged to make our way back to the street; the flames and smoke, too, were coming through and getting hold of 275—when I got back to the street I went in the next house, accompanied by other constables, amongst them being Johnson—I made my way up the staircase to the back—when I arrived opposite to a window my attention was called to people on a roof outside—one of the constables said "Here they are on the leads"—on the ledge of the roof outside, opposite to the window, I saw four persons, the prisoner Serne, his wife, and two daughters—they were rescued through the back window of 277 by the aid of the police—the cries I had heard when in 275 continued as I went from 275 to 277, and up the stairs there; they were always the same kind of cries, for help, and "Where are my boys?"—those cries continued up to the time of the rescue—the woman, when she was brought down, was very much upset by the look of her, she seemed almost crazy—she was undressed, with her nightdress on—I did not see that the prisoner Serne had anything on but his nightdress when I saw him, I did not notice that he had anything more on—I did not see that the two girls had anything more than their nightdresses on when I saw them at the window.</p>

I first mentioned having seen two fires burning in the shop, on Friday, 28th October, I believe—I mentioned it to Inspector Conquest; he sent for me and asked me what I knew about the fire in the Strand—I mentioned this about two fires—that was the first time I mentioned it to any one; from 18th September to 28th October I kept it in my own breast—I was asked by the inspector to make a full report of what I did at the fire—he told me to attend the inquest; I did so; I did not give evidence there—I did not hear McGore give his evidence, I was not allowed to go in—I was not called as a witness at the inquest—I saw Inspector Conquest there; I did not know he had charge of the inquest—he might have been there for several things—he is my superior officer, he is our local inspector—Inspector Hines was there—I did not mention to him about the two fires—I was</p>

I was on duty in the Strand on the early morning of 18th September; I was outside King's College, when I heard a policeman's whistle shortly after half-past one—I went in the direction of it and came up to No. 274—when opposite to that house I saw Goldfinch at the second floor window—he had on a black coat, but no hat—he was leaning on the window; his attention was drawn to two constables underneath the shop—I shouted loudly "Fire!" Fire!" because I saw him looking at the constables underneath, and he seemed to be quite unconcerned—I saw smoke coming from the window imme<lb/>diately below him and passing his face—he could see the constables—after I called "Fire" he left the window—I crossed over the Strand and looked in the shop and saw a small fire on the left band side—I then tried to force the front door of 274; it was fastened too securely—we then forced the door of 275, and I went into 275 with a number of other con<lb/>stables—I was not there when the glass was broken—when the flames burst through the passage separating 274 from 275 I ran out back to the street—I heard screams at the back when I was in 275 and the constable shouting "Where are you?" up the stairs—I remember these words—when I first heard the screams I was in the back of 275 just leading out of the passage—I could not hear them in the street—when we forced the door of 277 we heard them again—after getting into the street we went to 277; I and other constables went through the door there, and then heard screams again—I could not say it was a woman's voice; it seemed to be screaming altogether—I could not hear any distinct words—I</p>

               <p>made my way up to the second floor back of 277, and I was present when the window was smashed and the people rescued from the leads—when the woman came from the leads on the staircase she said "Oh, my two boys" or "Oh, my poor boys"—Serne said nothing—I put a question to Mrs. Serne; I believe Serne had gone downstairs then; I could not say; it was very dark—before Mrs. Serne was taken in through the window from the roof I heard the fireman on the roof say "Have you got her?" and I said "Yes, let her go"; that was the only conversation that passed with me; that was when I got her—I afterwards came down and went back to the Strand—I remained there till half-past four—I believe I was inside at the back when Goldfinch was brought down.</p>

Smith's stables—I know who you mean; I believe I was there before him; I did not see him that night—the window of the second floor was open when I got there; I pledge my oath to that—I did not see it shut—when the door of the next house was broken open, the second floor window remained open, I believe—I remained on the pavement with the two constables till I broke the door open—before I broke the door open Goldfinch had left the window; when he left be left the sash of the window open; I am quite sure of that—after the house got well alight I saw flames coming out of that window; that was after the Sernes had been rescued, after I got out again into the Strand—before the door was broken open I saw nothing of any flames coming out of the second floor window; no flames were coming out of, that window at that time—I remained on duty till half-past four; the second floor window was open then, I am quite sure—I believe the win<lb/>dow opened from the centre, a French window—I had not seen Goldfinch before—I saw him with his elbows upon the window sill—I next saw him at the inquest after he had given his evidence—I did not see him when he was giving it—I saw him come out after he had given it—he was not pointed out to me as Goldfinch; I recognised him as he came out—I made no report of this matter to my superior officer; I told several other constables during Sunday morning—I was examined before the Coroner, and then I said Goldfinch had his coat on—I am sure it was a black coat, an ordinary black cloth coat—when I broke the door open I and the other two constables all went in together.</p>

               <p>paraffin—I noticed nothing in it—he only gave it to me to smell, and then passed it on one side—the three cans were found close together close to and under where the staircase had been—besides those I saw a large quantity of capuala advertisement paper, newspapers, small advertisement papers found near them—they were round the tins, lying scattered close to and round about these tins, and round and underneath where the stairs had been—there were 50 or 60 pounds of the capuala transparencies—they were all more or less burnt—they are all now in the condition they were produced to me—these are about the best among them; some were more burnt than others—almost immediately afterwards I made some experi<lb/>ments with them to see how they would burn, but they were wet, and would not burn—when dry they were tried in my presence in the Coroner's Court, and burnt very fiercely—besides the tins and the trans<lb/>parencies I found about half a dozen newspapers scattered about near the transparencies and the tins—besides those I was present when some 12 or 14 empty tins (I forget the exact number) were found—they had had capuala in, some greasy material; small portions were left, and some of them were burnt out—I saw some in relation to the staircase and other things—I did not notice any other bottles there at that time—I was present when a number of those tins, both full and empty, were found in the front room on the top floor, 371 full and 380 empty tins; some of them were labelled capuala—I don't know if most of them were labelled, nor if the empty ones were labelled as well as the full; we did not take that notice—I remained some considerable time in charge of the promises—there had been a fireplace in the front shop; it had been match-boarded over—that had been in the first floor—there was no fireplace at all in the front shop—there was a fireplace in the room running at the back of the shop—there had been a fireplace in what had been the first floor room; the floor had been removed and that fireplace match-boarded over—it formed a portion of the wall of the shop; the ceiling of the shop going up to what had been the ceiling of the first floor—there was a fireplace in the room at the back of the shop—I don't know if there was a partition running between the two rooms on the ground floor; there are no remains of it now—there was no fireplace in the front, or what seemed to be the front room—the only fireplace in the front was the fire-place that had been in the first floor when the first floor existed—it is match-boarded over now.</p>

There was carpet on the ground floor at the back in front of the fireplace; that was charred—the place was very inflammable, lath and plaster—the whole place was in a blaze within half an hour—the tins and capuala were found on 4th October by Howe, a labourer—I saw him find them—they wore close to the capuala tins, scattered round, not piled together—the other tins were found under the staircase—not one of the tins is a gunpowder tin—the capuala is stuff used in making this greasy stuff—some greasy stuff is used in preparing them—part of the building was of oak—oak catches fire very slowly—if old it creates a very dense smoke—this oak was old by the look of it—I don't think after smouldering it would burst out; it burns red hot—it gives out dense smoke.</p>

I live with my husband at 47, Holywell Street, Strand—our house runs behind the block of buildings of which 274 was one—274 was next door but one from the front of the house in Holywell Street—I was at home on the night of 17th September; I went up to bed about one—I slept on the first floor—my husband keeps a shop—as I was going upstairs my attention was attracted by a woman calling "Help, my God, my boys, there's murder"—those cries came from the back—I went into the scullery, which is at the back with a side window—the cries still continued—I heard a woman say "Don't, don't, my God, my boys, no"—I think I then went into the front room that faces towards Holywell Street, and is my bedroom—my husband was at home; he got into bed when I went into the scullery—he was in bed when I returned into the front room—I did not get into bed; I stopped there about two minutes—the woman was still screaming when I went back into the scullery—I still heard the woman calling out "My God, my boys, murder"—I should say that when I went into the front room I undressed with the intention of going to bed—the woman was crying out when I went back—the cries continued the whole time I was undressing—then it was that I went back into the scullery—after I had been there some few minutes I heard a man's voice—I could not understand what he said; it was in some language that I did not understand—after that I heard the same man's voice say "Get in" and something else, which I did not quite catch—the woman kept calling out "My God, my boys," and "Murder! will any one help?"—at the time I heard the man's voice saying "Get in" the woman called out "No, no," and she kept calling out "My God, my boys, help, for God's sake, help, murder!"—besides the man and woman's voice I heard a very feeble voice; it was a different voice from the other two—I should think it was a child's voice—at that time I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I am now living at 1, Albion Place, Blackfriars, and am an accountant by profession—for some months in this year I was engaged in keeping the prisoner's books and accounts, and writing letters for him in his business in the Strand—my employment commenced about July and lasted down to the fire—I was well acquainted with the downstairs part of the premises—as you enter you went into the shop—it was used as a barber's shop—there was a room at the back, divided by a partition from that which was called the ladies' room; it was used by ladies if they came to the premises—there was no fireplace in the shop, there was one in the ladies' room at the back—the partition between the two rooms was wood and glass—in the left hand corner of the front shop there was a staircase leading upstairs—the shop ceiling was carried up to the second floor, which left but one room on the first floor, and that was situate at the back—that room was used as an office; it was not rented by me, but I did the business there for which the prisoner engaged me—the second floor was composed of a kitchen at the back and a sitting room in front—I was not very well acquainted with the top of the premises, the sitting room was the only room I have been in; perhaps I had been in that a week before the fire, I think it was the Saturday pre<lb/>vious, there was then a bed and bedding in it—I cannot tell from my own knowledge where the different members of the family slept—I have seen some of these transparencies in the office—they were kept on the floor in the office for some time in paper boxes or card board boxes, tied round with string, I believe, 25 in a box, and were divided by thin pieces of paper—I think I saw them there about a month before the fire—I can only give an approximate time—there was a fireplace in the office—the prisoner said the office was too warm for them, and he should remove them into the cellar—he said that perhaps a week before they wore removed—I was not present when they were removed; I never saw them after<lb/>wards, they were then in the boxes—I was in the house on the night of 17th September from about five in the afternoon until a quarter to ten, when I left, but I afterwards returned at 20 minutes to 12; I stayed five minutes in the shop, and then left at a quarter to 12—at that time I saw Mrs. Serne, the prisoner Serne, and Goldfinch, and I think the eldest</p>

               <p>daughter Annie; she was about 15, Kate was about 12—Annie assisted in the barber's business—I knew the eldest boy and had opportunity of observing him, he was of weak intellect decidedly—I saw Serne three or four days after the lire; he asked me to make his claim against the In<lb/>surance Company; I told him he had better to his solicitor—I have only known Goldfinch since July as working for Serne—he came a few days after me—he and the Semes always seemed on very friendly terms—I kept a press copy book, into which I took off the letters written by me at the prisoner's request—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—about three weeks before the fire there was a sheriff's man in possession—to the best of my belief the signature to this letter of 19th December, 1885, is the prisoner's writing.</p>

As you came into the shop from the Strand you went into a kind of lobby, a square doorway boarded up—I could not say whether a person looking through the window could not see the street door on account of that boarding—as you go in the door is on the left, and the shop is on the left; on the right is a boarding, and straight in front of you a glass written on; it is partly glass and partly wood—on the right is a wooden partition, it is really part of the partition between the two shops, the next door shop and 274; it is a kind of square entry—this rough sketch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) correctly represents it—there is no partition or anything between the door opening into the shop and the street door—the door opens inside the lobby; if the door was closed a person in the street could not see the street door—the door opens back into the lobby, you pull it to get into the shop—I remember Serne's brother coming over from Holland on a visit to him; a bed was put in the sitting-room while he was there—I Was not acquainted with their domestic life—I have seen Serns with his children—as far as I could see I considered him a kind and affectionate father, fond of his children, and they fond of him—Serne was very sanguine about this capuala, he thought if it was properly advertised it would become a valuable property—a number of newspapers used to be sent to the house containing copies of the advertisements—I do not know where the cellar was, I believe the entrance to it was under the front window, inside the shop—there was a cupboard under the staircase, inside which odds and ends were stowed—I recollect Serne mentioning about the shop in Oxford Street—I believe the reason why he wanted that was because their was a blank wall at the end, where he could advertise for Partington—he had such a place at 274, for which he got 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—Isaac was certainly not so bright as other persons of his age.</p>

I live at 278, Strand, and am the wife of George Burton, who is in the employ of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> and also the <hi rend="italic">St. James's Gazette</hi>—I was subpoenaed by the prosecution to attend at Bow Street as a witness, but was not called—I occupy the third floor at 278, Strand, and my front room looks out into the Strand and my back window into Holy<lb/>well Street—the back window is about two and a half yards from where the Sernes were rescued—I remember the night of the 17th and the early morning of 18th September—on that night I went <hi rend="italic">to</hi> bed about 11.30 my husband followed me shortly afterwards—about one or half-past I was aroused from my sleep by cries of "Help, help, my boys," I opened my window and looked out and saw Mr. and Mrs. Serne and the two daughters standing on the gutter facing my window—on that I aroused my husband, and while he was getting up I returned to the window—he then came to the window and said something to me, and then put his hat and coat and boots on, and went downstairs, but before he went down he told roe to tell them not to jump as he was going to bring a ladder, which was hanging in the passage—as he was going downstairs he slipped down; I could not tell how many stairs he fell down—he seemed to stumble because he had not done his boots up, and I could hear him falling down the stairs making a stumbling noise—when he had left I went back and opened the window again, but in consequence of the smoke being so thick I had to close it, and then I tore down my blind—when I closed the window I do not know whether it was Mr. or Mrs. Serne said "Don't"—I can't say whether they said it once or twice—Serne went several times to the window of their premises that looks out on to the gutter, every time Mrs. Serne called out for her boys, the window was then very thick with smoke—I then saw the reflection of a police<lb/>man's bull's eye in No. 277, and saw the prisoner break <hi rend="italic">two</hi> top panes of glass—I could not say whether it was with his fist or feet—the policeman then came and told me to go out—Serne broke the panes of</p>

               <p>glass in the window of the side of the house next door to me, to draw the attention of the police—the gutter slanted where they stood, and the window being lower than they were he was able to reach the top of the window and break the top panes—I see on this photograph the edge of the gutter upon which the Sernes stood; that is the window that Serne broke, but my window is not shown there; it is in this blank wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard no cries before I opened the window, but afterwards I heard cries of "Help, help, my boys" coming from Mrs. Serne, and the children were calling as well; they were all halloaing together for help—it appeared to he a woman's voice, not a man's voice—I think they saw me looking out—that was all I heard—I called to them not to jump, they were going to jump—my husband got up directly—he was used to getting up at that time—he made a stumbling noise down our stairs as he went down—I could not tell bow far he had gone down the stairs when I heard the stumbling—I was at the window, I saw the Sernes actually rescued by the police into the adjoining house, about five minutes after the glass was broken—I could not say who it was said "Don't" when I closed my window—I could not say bow long it was from the time I got out of bed to the time I shut the window, such a lot happened in such a short time—I dare say it was a quarter of an hour from the time I heard the woman crying "Help, help, my boys" to the people being rescued by the police off the gutter; I cannot speak with any confidence as to how long it was—when I heard the woman's voice I saw Serne try and enter at the window, and then he put his hand like that—the smoke was then coming out of the window very thick—that it the only window that opened on to the gutter—I never left my window until they left the gutter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. My window is above the level of the gutter—Mrs. Serne afterwards said to me that it was like stabbing her with a knife when I shut my window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am husband of the last witness, and am a driver in the employment of the <hi rend="italic">St. James Gazette</hi>—I live at 278, Strand, on the third floor—I remember this night, 17th September—I went to bed about three minutes to 12, and was awakened by my wife, and when I opened my eyes I saw her at the window, and heard cries of "Help, help, my boys"—I jumped out of bed and opened the window, and saw a group of people in the gutter—I told my wife to stop there while I got a ladder, and I put on my boots, trousers, and coat, and rushed out of the room, and going down I slipped down the first flight of stairs—when I got into the passage I found the street door had been burst open—I made several gropes in the passage for the ladder, which I had seen there before, and found it was not there, that it had gone—when I got outside the door I saw a woman screaming, and I said to her "Shut up, will you?" because my wife was upstairs with a child, and I did not want to alarm her—just as I got outside, the fire-escape got to the house, and I saw somebody jump from the top window on to the escape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>, I tumbled three-parts downstairs; my legs slipped, and I fell on my back on the stairs, but I was up again in a minute; I only grazed my leg—I was about a quarter of the way down the stairs when I slipped—there are three flights of stairs to our house, and I slipped down 10 or 12 steps.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 164, Portobello Road, Notting Hill—in September last I was living at 49, Holywell Street, with my father, who is a hatter there—I am schoolmistress of the Roman Catholic Middle School in Gate Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields—on this night I was sleeping in the back room of 49, Holywell Street, which is almost opposite to the window where the Sernes were rescued—I did not go to bed till after 12 o'clock, and I first heard screaming about 20 minutes past I—I then threw up my window and looked out, but could see nothing but smoke first—the screams continued—I then heard the words "My boys, my boys, oh, my God, my boys"—I then went into the next room and called my father, and then went upstairs to my sister—my father then came into the room, but I could see no persons—I then went upstairs to the third floor—at first I could see no persons, but afterwards I distinguished some figures standing on the ledge in the corner of the roof; I could not distinguish who they were; I could see one was a woman, and she was screaming, and my father called out to her "Hold your noise, there is help coming"—he called that out two or three times—the smoke was very dense at first, and then it cleared away—I then heard a policeman's voice, and Mrs. Serne came to our house and remained until after 4 o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I heard a man's voice call out "Where are yon?"—that was after the voice said "There is help coming"—I think it must have been seven or eight minutes from the time I heard the voice say "My boys, my boys," to the voice saying "Where are you?"—I had time to partly dress—the smoke was very dense when I first looked out;—I have nothing to fix the time, but I looked at my sister's watch when I called her—the watch was then 20 minutes past 1, but I think it was slow; I cannot tell how much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder's surveyor, of 102, Theobalds Road—on 7th November, at 11 p.m., I was opening my front door—I received a blow from behind on the back of the head—I turned round and grappled with the man who struck me, I caught him by the coat; another man standing by him got hold of my watch and chain—I let go my right hand from the man that struck me, and caught the other man by the collar as well—I pulled the two men into the passage—I threw myself back, we all went over in the passage, I was underneath—two gas jets were alight in the passage—we struggled; I got up last, being underneath, and the men rushed out of the door—I never lost sight of them, but I jumped upon a man outside who struck me—I cried out "That is the other one," pointing to the man who took my chain—I was struck</p>

               <p>several times by other persons—when I caught hold of Mason I was struck in the jaw, I think by a third person—I struggled for about fifty yards, and then got a blow at the back of the neck, and Mason wrenched himself away—a friend assisted me—I have been under the doctor's hands three weeks—in the struggle I lost a gold chain, an ace guinea, a half-sovereign, and an envelope—the bar of the chain was found in the passage—I suffered considerable pain in my head where I was struck—I communicated with the police the next morning—about a fortnight afterwards I picked out the prisoners at the station from about 16 men—Mason was the man I struggled with, I believe Williams to be the other man in the passage.</p>

I live at Southgate—I am a congregational minister—on Friday, 25th November, about 6.45 o'clock I was in Harper Street, Theobalds Road, at No. 7 (the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children)—I was on the doorstep or flat that corers the area leading to the footway—whilst I was ringing the bell my attention was called to persons behind—I turned round, and the middle one of three men asked me the way to Suliman Street—Williams was one; before I could answer the question he grabbed with both hands at my watch and chain, drew it out of its place and decamped with it—I followed him along Harpur Street into East Street or Ord Street, Great Ormond Street, down Conduit Street, Chapel Street, Emerald Street, which is entered by a court from Chapel Street, which I did not enter, but went for a policeman—when I found a constable he took me to enter the charge at Hunter Street, after which a detective was sent to the spot that I described—I was called to Hunter Street the following Thursday—I saw eight or 10 men similar in appearance to the prisoners and about the same age—I identified Williams at once as the man who had asked</p>

I shall pay you 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and a commission"—the rates of commission are mentioned in the agreement—he said "The salary and commission will amount to over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week"—I said "I think it a good offer; you tell me you are in a large way of business, but before I close with you I should like to take time to consider it"—he showed me a few old papers—I said I did not reckon much about that; that was all right, but I wanted to see the books—he said "I do not keep any books; my business transactions are all cash"—he paid "I have received 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the excellent way in which I do my business"—he showed me this agreement, drawn up ready for signature—I asked him to show me the way, as I wanted to see some of the sights of London, and he said "I never turn a band away from getting a honest</p>

(<hi rend="italic">By this Hunt agreed to pay</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a week and certain com<lb/>missions to the prosecutor for his services as clerk, terminable on a month's notice</hi>, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">deposit being paid by the prosecutor.

I parted with my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. because I believed him when he told me the splendid business he was doing, and I thought I should have my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my hand every day—then they sent me home—that was about five p.m.—I came the next morning, when the manager gave me this list of businesses for disposal, and names of persons on whom I was to call—no business was done—in the six weeks I received about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for an advertisement—that was all I received on account of business done—I received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. salary for the first week—I did not see Mr. Hunt at business—I went at 10 in the morning, and left about 6, but my duties were outdoors—I did not get my full wages the second week, but only 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from the managing clerk, Mr. Gear—at the end of six weeks I wrote to Mr. Hunt, and received this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">Stating</hi>"I was at the office yesterday, and to-day, but did not see you; kindly see me on Tuesday next at two o'clock)—I went at the time indicated—I did not see him—this letter of 20th September is an answer to one I wrote: "Kindly see me at 12 on Thursday, or make an appointment by letter for next week. I was unable to keep the other"—I also received this postcard of 22nd September, and I kept the appointment mentioned in the letter. ("Make it 1 o'clock when you call instead of 12.30.") I saw the defendant on the 22nd at 70, Fenchurch Street—I said "I must have an explanation; you have swindled me; my duties are totally different. I never find any business being done, and I demand an explanation"—he said "There is no business being done; things are so very quiet"—I said to him "Where is the commission coming from? Where are the moneys, the rents, and the accounts I ought to have picked up"—he said "There are none now"—I said "Why did you take my 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he said "I know I took it wrongly, but I was hard up; I had to meet a payment and must get money from somewhere"—I said "I shall take proceedings against you"—he said "Do not hurt me; give me another month, and I</p>

               <p>will pay you all I owe"—I said "Have you served anyone else the same"—he said "No"—I said "Why did you serve Mr. Gamon and Mr. Davis so then?"—ho said "I intend to pay them if things will only turn round," and he said "If you will wait one month I will finish up all"—meaning that my duties would be at an end—that was to finish all the business connection between us—I said I would give him a trial, which was accepted—I was away for about a month or five weeks—on the day it was appointed I should recommence, Hunt failed to pay me the salary—he promised to pay me a week's salary in advance—then I got this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Dated</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th, September</hi>, 1887. <hi rend="italic">From Hunt</hi>, 70, <hi rend="italic">Fenchurch Street, to the witness</hi>: "Circumstances prevented me doing as I wished, but notwithstanding I shall be at the office at 10 o'clock on Monday, when I hope to meet you, and if you work with me with a will you may depend upon a good result.")

I shall be at the office soon after 10 o'clock on Monday"—that referred to paying me another week's salary—I got this letter of the 8th (<hi rend="italic">a similar letter</hi>)—I stayed in the prisoner's service till November 1st—on the 18th October I wrote to him giving him a month's notice—I received this reply: "I received your notice to leave at one month from above date, and for withdrawal of security"—during the whole time I was in the defendant's service I only received 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in wages for about 15 weeks although I was entitled to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—on the 1st November I went to the secretary of the Young Men's Christian Association in Aldersgate Street (City Branch), who put me in communication with Mr. Haywood, their solicitor—acting on my instructions Mr. Haywood communicated with the defendant. (<hi rend="italic">letter read from Mr. Hay wood to the defendant stating</hi> "unless the deposit was returned by 11 o'clock to-morrow morning he should go at once to the Mansion House for a summons.") I was very anxious to get my money back—15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was my own money; a friend lent me the rest—I did not get my money back—an application was made at the Mansion House before I parted with my money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I received this letter from the defendant of 5th November (<hi rend="italic">Stating</hi>: "Referring to your letter of the 18th ult., if you will make an appointment for Monday, November 14th, say 2 o'clock, I will keep same, and shall be prepared to complete my part of the agree<lb/>ment, and pay over guarantee money")—I had written in October to receive back my deposit—I waited for my deposit in pursuance of my notice, and then applied to the Magistrate—before 14th November I had two interviews with the defendant—he showed me his father's will to prove his stability, but I was not satisfied as to his business stability—seeing the will only influenced me so far as it applied to himself—it proved that he was something of a man privately, and then I believed his word as a business man—I should have parted with my money if I had not seen the will—I wanted more references, but if I could not have got them I should have paid my money—that is why I said I was not satisfied—Mr. Haywood has conducted this case for me—I was a great deal out of the office in the daytime—a public-house broker usually is—the notes in the list produced are my writing—they represent the work done upon a particular day—when I went to the defendant's I did not understand anything of the business—I had acted as book-keeper—what</p>

I am a manure and seed merchant, at Nankee, near Barnstaple—before 5th August, 1886, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>, in consequence of which I wrote, and received a reply, and two days afterwards I called at 70, Fenchurch Street, where I I saw the prisoner—he said he was in a large way as a broker, hotel and business agent; that he was the sole partner, and had been established over 30 years—he showed me his old books, and said it was all cash transactions then—he told me a few years ago he had done 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day—he said he wanted 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit for security, as I should take about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day; that I was to receive 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and commis<lb/>sion and that the two together would amount to over 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week anyhow—the next day I paid him at 70, Fenchurch Street a cheque for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Dingly, Pearce, and Co., Okehampton—that cheque was passed through the bank and the money received—I parted with it from his account of the business he was doing—I believed the representations he made to me—there were a couple of <hi rend="italic">loafers</hi> in the office that helped me out—I signed this agreement at that time; it was already drawn up, and was all ready but the filling in. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 5th August, and was similar to the other</hi>.) My cheque was the receipt for the money—on the day I paid my money and signed the agreement I commenced business for the defendant—I stayed with him altogether about four months—for the first few weeks I got my salary all right—afterwards I did not receive it regularly; I got it in 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that sort of thing; in fact I hunted him up for it, but I did not get as much as 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in any one week—there was no business whatever done there—when I could not get my wages I stopped in the office to see what was done—the prisoner did not come; I had to hunt for him—I left the prisoner about November 15th or 16th—before that I asked him for my deposit and back wages, and he said he would pay me if I would give him time; he was an honest man—I had not hinted he was not an honest man—he gave me this bill for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at six months—I paid it into my bankers; it was dishonoured, and he did not even pay the costs—I did not get a <hi rend="italic">red cent</hi>—at the same time he gave me this other bill at three months for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 15th November, the same as the other—he gave me a bill for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because</p>

               <p>there was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. owing for salary as well as the deposit—he said he had a wife and family, and asked for time to pay, and said he was an honest man, and I said I would let him off for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to settle the amount of my salary and deposit—I was willing to take it in settlement of my claim—the other bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for another man named Davis, who had been deceived in the same way as myself—I saw him then after I had been there two weeks—I had conversations with him, and smelt a rat—the day the bills were drawn I and Davis spoke to the prisoner together—the prisoner owed Davis more salary than he did me—Davis said he would give the prisoner time to pay, and the prisoner said he would pay; he was an honest man—Davis said he had not any banking account, and the prisoner said he would give me the bills as I had a banking account—I drew out the bills on November 15th, and the prisoners accepted them—I sent them to the bank—they would be due last February and May; they were dishonoured—I have not had a cent of my deposit from the prisoner—I was communicated with by Mr. Stafford—I don't know where Davis is now.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a grocer's assistant; I left on Saturday, and am now out of employment—I now live at 5, King Street, Deptford—about 25th July I entered the prisoner's employment as a junior clerk at 70, Fenchurch Street—I did not see the prisoner when I went, only the manager—I was to go for two months for nothing on trial, and after that I was to receive a small sum as salary, he did not say how much—I entered the service the same morning, and remained about six weeks, and I saw there was no business done, and I spoke to my parents—during the whole time I was there no business was done whatever that I saw—I had nothing to do—I had no one to help me—Gear was the manager—I left—I only saw the prisoner once in the six weeks I was there—he was there about half an hour—he locked himself in when he came, he locked us both in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Alexander Cowan and Sons, of Edinburgh and London, paper and wholesale stationers—the prisoner has been in our employment 32 years—I entered the firm as a clerk in 1878; at that time the prisoner kept the books and the cash—I then took over the superintendence from the prisoner of the cash-book and the cash, and have kept them ever since except in my absence on holidays—the prisoner's salary lately was 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—looking in the cash-book at the date of 21st April last year, I can say that I was not in the office on that day—in my absence it was the prisoner's duty to keep the cash-book and cash, and on 21st April that book is in the prisoner's handwriting—there is no entry in the cash-book on that day of the receipt of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Eldridge—in the town ledger under the date of 13th April there is an entry of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the gross amount is entered in the ledger, not the net amount—there is no entry in the cash-book on 13th April of the payment on that day of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if I was absent and the prisoner kept the cash-book and cash, it was his duty on my return to hand over the proper balance to me—he has never accounted to me for this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and there is no one else in the firm to whom he could account—on 10th July I was in charge of the cash-book—I and the other clerks usually go out to our lunch about 1 o'clock, and in my absence the prisoner would take charge of the cash-book and when I returned he would hand over to me any sum he might have received and give me the name of the customer—he might enter it in the cash-book—I should see his writing there when he handed me the money—there is no entry of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 10th July, 1886, and the prisoner has never accounted to me for that sum—in the ledger account of Mr. Todhunter, under the date of 10th July, there is a credit to him of 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a marginal reference to the cash-book thus, "Cash folio 149," which signified that on turning to the cash-book the corresponding amount would be found there to the customer's credit, but there is no corresponding entry—on 13th July the cash-book is also in my writing, but I find no amount of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. entered there as having been paid by Miss Frost, nor do I find any entry of that sum on 19th July—on 19th July in the ledger account of Miss Frost I find an entry of 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and there is a reference to a corresponding entry in the cash-book, but there is no such entry there—he has never accounted to me for that sum—about October in this year I discovered that some entries in the ledger had no corresponding entry in the cash-book, and that a sum of money was deficient—I told the prisoner what I had discovered and asked him to make a clean breast of the whole thing, and I said that we had found out about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and asked him if there was any more—he said there was no more—I continued my investigations,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120056"/>
               <p>and as a result I communicated with the police, and the prisoner was arrested.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was arrested at our solicitor's office, Pancras Lane, City—I knew that my solicitor had written to him asking him to call—he had had several interviews with him before that, and I had had two or three interviews with him—we wished to get the prisoner's assistance to find out the extent of his defalcations—he came voluntarily in the first place to find out whether we were going to prosecute him or not, and we declined to say—we never had these interviews with him for the purpose of seeing what security he could give for the defalcations; there was no conversation about that—he was asked to sign a deed relating to a former robbery, I mean that 10 years ago he was not right in his cash by 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but my father kept him on then and reduced his salary to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner deposited with us then a lease of his house, and on the first day we discovered these robberies we communicated with our solicitor and he advised us as we had no security about the house to ask the prisoner to sign this mortgage in order to give us power to sell—his salary 10 years ago was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and we then reduced it to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said at first that he would not sign without seeing what was in it, but after having read it he signed it this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the mortgage that he executed; it pro<lb/>fesses to cover 270<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which the prisoner was short in 1878—the reduction in his salary had nothing to do with his deficiencies, it was because he broke his trust; it was not to repay ourselves; he did not do such respon<lb/>sible work afterwards—he was arrested about a month after the execu<lb/>tion of this mortgage—I kept the books when he went to lunch, he had to wait till I came back—he occasionally made entries in the cash-book, but he need not; if he did so I should see the entry and he would hand the amount over to me, but he generally wrote on a piece of paper and handed me the cash afterwards—his general rule was not to enter it in the cash-book—the cash was kept in a box in the safe—I did not give him the key of that box when I went out, and he would either put the money he received on his desk or into his pocket—he would have to ac<lb/>count count to me for any sums he had received when I returned—he never went to the end of the day—the ledger was also kept in the same office as the cash-box—we used to compare the cash-book with the ledger; the prisoner did that—the cash-book was open to my observation every day.</p>

I am a tea broker of 39, Mincing Lane—I followed Endine when he went out with the letter, and saw these two men at the bottom of the stairs going up to the next floor—to the best of my belief the prisoners are the men I saw—nobody was left in the sale-room when I left it, but there was some one in the office adjoining.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journalist, of 45, Clarence Road, Kentish Town—on 1st December, about 2.30 p.m., I was at the corner of Clarence Road coming from an omnibus and was making my way to my lodgings—I had a top-coat on, which was partially buttoned, and an umbrella in one hand and a bag in the other—I saw a great crowd and I was hurtled and knocked about by the crowd, and I found myself in the middle of the street with my top-coat torn open and my hat knocked over my eyes—a hand then snatched at my gold albert chain, but did not succeed in removing it—I was hustled again and tripped up, and then a hand forcibly got hold of my chain and tore it away—Smalley tripped me up—the other two prisoners were there then, but they did not do anything to me at that time—the party who snatched at my chain is not to be found—other snatches were also made, but I could not say whether it was by the same party—I could identify the party who took my chain but he has disappeared—before he disappeared he was in momentary contact with Whales and Smalley, he went up to them and Whales I believe took the chain—Whales also made a snatch at my watch—there was a very large crowd moving up the street, and as they moved I followed, calling out "Police!" and a man, who afterwards turned out to be a police officer in plain clothes, asked me if I had lost anything, and he followed up the crowd—I could not point out the individuals, but I afterward saw Whales and Smalley in the company of the officers—I never lost sight of them from the time this occurrence took place—I was not much hurt, but exceedingly knocked about—I was only down on the ground once, but nearly twice—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my chain—I next saw it upon a desk at the police-station, before which the prisoners were.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an insurance agent, of 27, Lime Street, Camden Town—on 1st December, about 2.30 p.m., I saw Mr. Henderson coming from the middle of the road on to the pavement, and saw Smalley knock his hat over his eyes; the prosecutor then struggled with Whales and two or three others—I then saw another man not in custody snatch his chain—his hat did not remain over his eyes a second—I saw his umbrella up, and I suppose he was adjusting his hat with it—I saw the chain in the other man's hand, and directly he got it he ran away up Clarence Buildings—I ran after him and caught him, and another man who got away then came up and struck me at the back of the head—I did not see a second snatch at the chain—Smalley then ran up to me and lifted his stick, and called on me to let the man go and when I let him go I saw him pass the chain on to Whales—I followed Whales into the Kentish Town Road, and Smalley then attempted to strike me with the stick again; he said "What the b—hell do you want?" and Whales said "That is him; hit him"—I still followed him until I got to the Castle in Kentish Town, and I then saw a police sergeant coming up the road, and ran over and made a communication to him—we then went after them, and he spoke to a police officer in plain clothes, and I pointed Smalley out, and he was taken by the detective, and the other police officer took Whales—Bradford then came up and put his leg in front of me and said "What the b—h—are you doing?"—I turned to the sergeant and said "This man is trying to throw me down; I suppose that is another of Them"—I had previously seen Bradford in the crowd before I saw the sergeant, and as I passed him I said "These men have got a watch and chain"—he said "A b—good job too, and I hope they may get another one."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 559). About 2.30 on this afternoon I was at a point close to the top of Great College Street, and heard cries of "Murder" and "Stop thief"—I saw a great crowd coming towards me, and could hear them crying "Stop thief"—I could not discern them, so I took up the chase amongst the crowd, and as I was running in the centre of the road I heard one of the crowd say, "He will get away now; he knows his way about here"—I then saw Smalley turn into Barthole<lb/>mew Road, which is a turning at right angles with Kentish Town Road—I ran after him, and he then turned back into Kentish Town Road, and ran up against a shop window and faced me, and said "What the b—hell do you want?"—I said "l am a police officer," and I went towards him to take him in custody—he said "Well, b—well take that," but I put up my arm, and it struck me across the arm, and bent the brim of my hat; I then caught hold of him, and took the stick away—the mob then hustled me against the window, and shouted "Let him go," but in a moment two uniform officers came up, and I handed Smalley over to them—they had not gone but a few yards when Spurrier came up and pointed out Whale to me, and I took him in custody—he said "You have made a mistake"—a policeman then took him to Kentish Town Police-station, and I was there when he was charged at the same time as Smalley and Bradford—I did not find the chain—I went out to look for Spurrier, and on returning I saw the sergeant find the chain.</p>

When Whales was pointed out to me, Spurrier said "That man coming along in the green coat has got the property"—Whales was then coming towards me, but I don't think he could see Spurrier talking to me, because there was a large mob between us; he was about six yards off when he was pointed out to me by Spurrier—I went up to him, and said "I am a police officer; I shall take you in custody for being concerned with the other man"—he said "You have made a mistake"—I am quite certain he did not say anything else—I don't recollect saying before the Magistrate, "The last witness came up and pointed out Whales to me; I took him in custody; he said 'What are you doing of?'"—I know he said "You have made a mistake"—I took a note of' this, but I have not got it here—it would not be correct to say he was close to any of the other prisoners.</p>

               <p>I saw a scuffling in the road, and saw a gentleman apparently knocked down—I ran towards him, and heard cries of "Stop thief! Police!"—I ran on in the road, and my attention was then called by Spurrier to the three prisoners—I saw Griffin standing at the corner of the street, and as I was running I called his attention—I then saw Bradford running in the road just behind the other two and near to Spurrier, and I saw him put his foot in front of Spurrier, which appeared to trip him up, and he almost fell down—it looked to me to have been done on purpose—I then got up to him, and Spurrier called my attention to him, and I caught hold of him, and took him to the station—he did not go there quietly; he refused to go—when I got to the station I found the other two prisoners there—Whales was leaning on the desk, and Smalley was standing in the dock, and when I went in the room he made back—I then took Bradford in, and he stood in the place where Whale had moved from—about ten minutes afterwards I saw something shining on the desk—there was a book lying on the desk, and I saw this locket lying on it, and the chain was lying down between the book and the back of the desk—this bar of the chain was found next day on the spot where the robbery had taken place, and was offered in pledge next day in Kentish Town, but the pawnbroker gave information, and we obtained possession of it—when I took Bradford he said he should not go to the station; he had nothing to do with it, and he called on the persons around—I said "You must, and if you are not guilty it is all the better," and when I got to the station he was pointed out by the prosecutor as being one of the men who had assaulted him.</p>

               <p>myself behind Chesterton and the prisoner ran up Princes Square, where he was caught—Chesterton ran after him; I fainted and was taken away—I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody—he had on the same, cap on the Tuesday night when he was in the Artichoke as he had on the Saturday night; when he was in custody he had no cap—I don't know what had become of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Maggie and I went out together on this night about 9 o'clock, and went to the Cat and Neptune—I was sometimes up in the dance-room, and sometimes in the bar—it is a house to which a great many sailors go, and there were a large number of Spaniards in the neighbourhood and stopping at the Sailors' Home—I never spoke to any of them before—we were drinking with several of them at the bar for nearly an hour, the Spaniards paid for it—we all came out together—Vega asked Brown for my address and if I would go with him, and I said yes—he went to the Sailors' Home to ask if he could stay out for a few moments, he did not ask to stop out all night—we went to the corner of St. George's Street, and were standing there about 10 minutes when the first Spaniard came along—he seemed to run—he went up Well Street—I did not notice whether he had a knife in his hand—I don't know his name—Pantin was the second Spaniard—Vega was there when the stab was given, and when I screamed he seemed to take me to him—he was near enough to see what happened.

There is a dock gate nearly opposite where we were standing—the prisoner came from the direction of Neptune Street, and gave the stab in this manner (<hi rend="italic">describing it</hi>)—he was between me and Brown; I saw him sideways, and he stood up after giving the blow—Vega let me go as the crowd came up—I did not hear then that Driscol had been stabbed; I did not see Driscol—I saw the prisoner standing in the crowd that came up, looking on—I did not notice whether he was drunk or sober, I was excited—he walked away—he did not seem to make any haste—I saw some Spanish officers at the station; I told the interpreter that they were not the men that did it—I had never seen the prisoner before this night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, of 14, Bishop's Road, South Hackney—in September last I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>: "Traveller. Wanted a gentleman to call on an established connection. Proprietor's own round. Knowledge of trade not absolutely necessary, but applicant must be of good address. Horse and trap found to suitable party who would study employer's interests. Salary and commission, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week. Applicants must be able to invest cash security of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Address," &amp;c.—I applied and received a reply, signed "Ross and Co.," which I have searched for, but cannot find—it was addressed from the Pied Bull Granaries, and stated I had omitted to mention whether I was prepared to invest 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cash—I called the following morning, 20th September, at 172, Holloway Road—I saw the prisoners, and said "I have called upon you in answer to a letter I received last night. I am not in a position to place 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as security with you. I will hand 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to you, and work 12 months for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and commission, instead of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-week and commission, which will leave you of the other 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the year'—they considered for a few moments, and Medlicott turned round to Tame and said, "Well, Tame, what do you think? I like Mr. May's appearance. Shall we take him?"—Tame said "Well, I don't know. I think we might as well"—Tame took off a file two or three pieces of paper which I could not read, saying they were large contracts for supplying forage, &amp;c.—then Medlicott said "We have had to give up the travelling on account of having so much work to do; it is necessary that we should remain indoors to attend to the orders," and that was the reason they engaged a traveller—I said</p>

               <p>"I have 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I will place with you now," and Medlicott imme<lb/>diatly went to his clerk, and had a receipt written out for it"—I said "I will try and get the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I have only got enough to keep my wife and family for the week until I am earning money"—that was all the money I had in the world—Medlicott proposed that the money should be placed in the business, for which they would give me five per cent.—I said "I object to place the money in the business but if you will place it in a bank in our joint names I have no objection to leave it with you," so that neither party could touch it—Medlicott said "Yes, I will place it in a bank but you won't expect any percentage on your money"—I said "Certainly not"—I said "Why do you want this Money?"—I said "Because you will collect bills for us"—the money was to be paid in on the following Thursday—I paid him the money, and this is the receipt, signed "G. Ross and Co."(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I left, and was to go to work on 3rd October—I returned in the afternoon and saw Medlicott, and told him I did not feel safe about my money—he said "Oh, it's all right; we have a large business; your money is quite safe"—we then arranged that I should commence work on the 26th September instead of of 3rd October—I accordingly went at 9.30, when they packed a bag of samples for me, and gave me a list of customers to call upon—I asked Medlicott when he would go to the bank, and he said the following Thursday—I worked for them Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and met with little success—no customers seemed to know Them as being in business for themselves, but there were a few who knew Medlicott as traveling for some firm—I worked on to end of the week, and got about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of orders—I called on the Thursday morning as usual for my list of customers, and said to Medlicott, "Are you going to the bank to-day?"—he said "No I am too busy; I can't go"—he turned to Tame, and said "Can't you go to the bank with Mr. May?" and he said no he was too busy—I said "When are you going to put the money in the bank?" and he said "Oh, we will do it next week"—on Saturday Medlicott said he would be back at 1 o'clock to pay me—I was there till 7, when I got my 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary and commission of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I observed a stranger in the place, and on inquiry I found it was a Sheriff's officer—I said to Medlicott "What is a Sheriff's officer doing here?"—he said "It has nothing to do with our business; Mr. Tame's father has put him in to keep other people out"—I went down the following Monday and returned my samples, and asked for my money, and said if he did not return it to me I should take pro<lb/>ceedings against them—Medlicott said "I cannot give you the money; I have not got it, but I will pay it by instalments if you wish it"—I said "What instalments will you give me?"—he said "I can give you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week"—I said "That won't do; I have a wife and family who are simply starving; I must have the money back"—he said he could not pay me back the money, and I threatened him with legal proceedings—he told me then, as he had told me before, that if I prosecuted him I should get nothing at all—I was thoroughly destitute then, and living on charity—I got back 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in different amounts—I waited four weeks, and then laid an information before the Magistrate at Clerkenwell Police-court, and they were taken into custody on 3rd November and charged.</p>

I had not been in the trade before—I have been out of employment for some time—I was employed in travelling in Plymouth for about two months; before that I did nothing for eight or nine months—ten months previously to that I came from India—I have had experience as master of a ship, in chartering my own steamer, and so on, which gave me an idea of mercantile work—I have not had expe<lb/>rience in selling goods—I insisted on beginning work a week earlier because I could not afford to wait doing nothing, they having my money—the place had the ordinary appearance of a granary, and had the appearance of business—there was a clerk in the office receiving 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I don't know what rent they paid—they did not decline my offer of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I taking 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week instead of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I paid the money as a guarantee of my fidelity, and on the understanding that it was to be put in the bank in our joint names—I cannot say whether such an arrange<lb/>ment would defeat their object—I think my commission was 10 per cent and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for travelling expenses in lieu of horse and trap, the horse being supposed to be sick—an agreement was to be drawn up at the time of paying in—I never saw the horse and trap; there was a horse there but not a gig horse—I found little or nothing there on the Satur<lb/>day—there was a machine of some sort there but I never saw it work<lb/>ing—I was there every morning, and sometimes in the evening—I saw a cert there; I don't know what it was used for, I never saw it loaded—I don't know that they kept two vans and horses—it was not on the Friday previous to Monday, the 26th, that I first mentioned paying the money into the bank in our joint names—I am certain the first occasion was on the 20th—I thought I was dealing with an honest man—I thought the receipt enough to hold him to his word—the contracts they referred to they called Government contracts, not railway contracts—I called on about 16 customers on the Monday at Tottenham, Wood Green, and Stamford Hill—I got an order from Garraway—I am not sure whether I called on Waddington—I returned the book to the prisoners when I returned my samples—I can't remember the names at the customers, it is so long ago—on the Tuesday I called on other customers in the same district—I called on about 100 corn and hay people in the week—I could take you to them, but do not remember the locality—I know it was under 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of orders that I took—on the following Monday I refused to go on with my work because I could not get my money back—there was no agreement to return the money—Medlicott did not tell me he was tem<lb/>porarily pressed but hoped to tide over his difficulties—he offered me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, which I said I could not accept—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in different sums, during which my wife and children were starving and living on charity—he gave me some rice and a fowl—I saw him with a gold chain; I had to pawn mine—I gave him three or four weeks before I applied for a warrant—I have not been round to the customers since—I do not know that Medlicott had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to him—the customers did not know him as carrying on business for himself, but they knew him as a traveller—he told me he had been in business—I can tell you from the list those who did not know "Ross and Co."—Brett of Clapton, Bailey of Upper Clapton, and Gibson or Joslin of Essex Road did not know the name—the list of articles had the name of Boss and Co. on it.</p>

I went on the premises; I did not see crushing implements there, they had not a light—I don't know whether they expressed themselves sorry for what had occurred, I was too excited—I told them I had come for my money which my father had left me—it was in reply to my inquiry why they did not pay the money into the bank—when they said they paid it away ten minutes after I said "Why did you not give it to my husband when he went back a quarter of an hour after<lb/>wards'"—I did not give this evidence at the police-court; no one asked me—I went there every day; I did not break into the premises, but I told them I would—I was leaning against the wall outside, and would have stayed there till 12 o'clock to see them—we had not anything in our house to eat.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">TARGET</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant Y</hi>). I received a warrant for the arrest of the prisoners, and met Medlicott on the 3rd November at Highbury Corner, Holloway Road—I said "Good morning, I have a warrant for your arrest"—he said "What case is it?"—I said "For obtaining 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a man named May; have you seen Tame?"—he said "Yes, I am going to meet him here in a few minutes"—I said "Very</p>

               <p>well, I will wait"—I waited there with him, and we saw Tame coming down the road—I placed Medlicott in a cab with another officer—Tame came up—I told him I had a warrant for his arrest, and I took him into the cab and read the warrant to him—Tame said nothing—Medlicott said "It is a false warrant, I paid him back 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the amount"—they were taken to the station and charged—I went to the Pied Bull Granaries and took possession of the books, which I gave to Mr. Wontner—I found a diamond ring on Tame worth I should say about 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze—on Medlicott I found 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a post-office order, a silver watch and brass chain—I went down to Reading and inquired at the police-station and post-office, but did not find any busmen of the prisoners' there.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">A bought journal, ledger, and larger ledger, pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—I did not look through all the papers—I did not go to any of the people in these lists—I don't know what was on the premises before—I don't know what the Sheriff's officer took away—I saw a cart in Pied Bull Yard with "Ross and Co." upon it—I am not sure about the name being on the stables—there were no horses or traps—I went to Sulhampstead, near Reading, and found that Tame's father had lived there and farmed 50 or 60 acres.</p>

On Sunday afternoon, 13th November, I was on duty in Bridge Street—I headed a procession coming across Westminster Bridge, which was stopped at the end of Par<lb/>liament Street—I was not there for the purpose of dispersing the crowd; my duty was to detect thieves—a struggle was taking place—I had not seen that the police had drawn their truncheons; they might have done; I had none, being in plain clothes—I saw a constable in uniform knocked down about two or three yards from the pavement; his helmet came off—seeing that he looked very white, I went to assist him, to pick him up,</p>

               <p>also his helmet; I picked it up—just as I got him on his feet I received a terrific from behind on the right ear; I staggered round, and caught hold of Sergeant Ward as I was falling, and I saw the prisoner run away—I then became unconscious—I lost a great deal of blood—the blow split my ear in two, and also grazed the back of the head just on the bone—I did not see the prisoner afterwards—I was taken to Scotland Yard by other officers, and was attended by Dr. Farr, the divisional sur<lb/>geon—that was at half-past six—I was about a fortnight under medical treatment—I could not give up duty; I was so busy, I had a long firm case in hand, which is now here in the Court, and I was obliged to go on with that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a deal of confusion going on at this time, but not where I stood—I was on the outside of the mob; I was nearer Cannon Row, in the roadway, about three yards from the path—I have said on a former occasion "a disorderly mob of from 8,000 to 10,000 people passed over Westminster Bridge, many of them carrying sticks"—they did not approach the spot where I was standing; they passed me on the way to Parliament Street—the mounted men then started to dis<lb/>perse them, not till then—that was where the mounted police started breaking them up—I could not say the name or number of the constable I was assisting—before I had time to put his helmet on I fell to the ground—just as I was about to put his helmet on I received the blow, and I dropped the helmet and staggered round—I said at the police-court that I was about to put it on; it is not true to say that I put it on; I was about to do it. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition stated</hi>) "I picked him up and put his hel<lb/>met on.") I saw the prisoner leaving as I turned round, and as I got the man on his feet I had not time to see the constable's number or who he was—there were several policemen knocked down; they came from all parts—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man I saw running away; he had on a shabby light coat—I took him for a mason—I can't say that he was the only person I saw running away; they were running in all directions; a great many were running—there was a disorderly mob there—it was perhaps by instinct that I singled out the prisoner; he singled out me—I did not see who struck me—when I turned round I saw him running away; he had a roll of paper—I thought it was a parchment or something of that—he had some white paper in his hand—I did not say anything about the roll of paper at the police-court—I don't know why, two of the witnesses had deposed to it, I suppose that was the reason—he carried the roll of paper away with him as he ran—I had not much time to do anything, as soon as I staggered round I saw him leaving me; I became unconscious—I have known a man named Bevan since the proceedings at the police-court, not before—I did not search the prisoner at the station; he was not my prisoner.</p>

               <p>purpose—I am quite sure he is the man I am speaking of—he returned in two or three minutes—there was a band, flags, and banners—the pro<lb/>cession went on over Westminster Bridge, joined by other processions—I should say it consisted of about 3,000 persons altogether—I went on with them over the bridge and down Bridge Street; it was stopped at the end of Parliament Street—there was afterwards a very great confusion—I saw the prisoner in Bridge Street; he was rather more than halfway towards Westminster Bridge from Parliament Street—in Bridge Street I saw him run from the mob and deliver a blow at some person, and he turned and ran away—lie ran on To the pavement nearer Parliament Street, and stooped down to get in among the crowd—I ran after him and struck him across the back with my truncheon—he fell down, and I at once caught hold of him and took this weapon out of his right hand; it was then wrapped In paper—I was four or five yards away when I saw him strike the blow; he struck it with this weapon clearly—I did not see the person he struck—I had not lost sight of him from the time he struck the blow till I took him into custody—a constable assisted me, and he was taken to King Street Police-station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I escorted the procession from the Radical Club in Charles Street, Blackfriars Road, to Kennington Road—I should say there were about 150 people when I first saw the prisoner—my attention was attracted to the prisoner by his twisting the paper in a careless manner, and also that he had something underneath his waistcoast—I did not call it a weapon at the police-court—I said "I had previously seen the prisoner in Kennington Road with a pipe in paper in his hand, and another weapon under his waistcoat"—if I said just now that I did not say he had another weapon under his waistcoat I misunderstood your question—I did not know that it was a weapon, but I made use of that word at the police-court—I did not keep my eye upon him, I had no reason to do so; I could not watch one particular man on such an occasion as that—I did not notice whether other people in the crowd had weapons—there were some thousands of sticks there, I have no doubt; I cannot say about offensive weapons, I saw several walking-sticks—when I saw the prisoner in Bridge Street he ran from the mob—we were dispersing the mob, driving them back—I cannot say that the police were in a line, we were across the road, we were driving the people back at the time I saw the prisoner run from the crowd and make a blow, delivered, I believe, at some person; I was not able at the time to say who the person was—I followed the prisoner a very few yards before I arrested him, probably it might have been five or six yards—when I took the pipe from him it was still wrapped in paper—I did not know at that time that it was a pipe—I ran after him because I saw him commit an offence, and I considered it my duty to apprehend him—I sat him deliver a blow at some person; I did not see where the blow fell—I knew that a blow was given, from the fact that he made a running blow and turned and ran away—there was a great deal of confusion at the time, and a great number of persons were present—there were several other blows struck—I did not arrest any of them, because they were fighting against the police and we were fighting them back—several had their truncheon out.</p>

I think it would take a considerable amount of violence to go through those clothes—the prisoner is a com<lb/>paratively short man—Wheelhouse is much taller—the wound was rather below the shoulder joint—I think it quite possible for a man of the prisoner's stature to inflict such a wound—the wound being deepest at the highest point and shallowest at the lower points, to the blow being given above the striker's head and the knife being brought out below—there was nothing dangerous in the wound itself—I should not think it could be caused by the man suddenly rising from a stooping position and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120085"/>
               <p>then coming against the weapon—I don't think the force would be enough, and the shape of the wound would be against it; the wound would have been more of a puncture than incised—supposing the knife was dirty, poison might have been introduced into the wound, that would introduce danger—as to the difference in stature, I should like to see them side by side.

I am divisional surgeon at Deptford—on Monday, 14th November, I saw Wheelhouse at the station—I saw the wound was dressed and did not disturb the bandages that day—on the following day I examined it—the wound was looking very angry and in an unhealthy condition, and not at all inclined to unite or heal—I removed the stitches and dressed it antiseptically; it appeared to be in the condition of a poisoned wound, there was a good deal of swelling about it—Wheelhouse was disabled for a month; he was discharged on Saturday last—the angry character of the wound could have been caused by a dirty weapon—erysipelas set in round the wound—that shows blood-poisoning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Fulham—soon after 10 o'clock on Saturday, 19th November, I was called to 4, Crown Street, and on going there I found a woman lying on the floor of the back room, just inside the doorway, on her left side, with her head near the wall and her feet towards the bed, with her left arm underneath her—the clothes of the left arm and shoulder were saturated with blood, and until I cut off the clothes from the arm I could not find the would—I cut off the clothes from the arm, and found an incised wound at the outer and back part of the arm, an inch long and three inches deep, bleeding very little then—it was apparently from behind forwards, almost horizontal, passing between the bone of the arm and the skin on the inner side of the arm—she did not speak, and she appeared to be suffering from loss of blood—she just moaned and murmured; she did not articulate—I gave her brandy and dressed her wound, and sent her to the hospital in the ambu<lb/>lance—she died on the way to the hospital—I did not go too—I think if I had been called in earlier I could have helped her—on making the post-mortem examination I found several large vessels coming from the main artery and veins were cut through; that, together with the shook, was the cause of death—I found nothing more—the wound could decidedly have been inflicted with the larger of these blades of the clasp-knife—the size of the blade, half an inch wide and about three inches long, would correspond entirely with the size of the wound—great violence would be necessary—at another post-mortem examination that I made I found reasons which would induce me to believe that at the time the woman would be susceptible to shock—on examining the heart I found a fatty deposit of some considerable amount, and the stomach was very much dilated and very full of a recently-swallowed meal, and in addition to that there were eight or nine very large pieces of bolted steak of an extraordinary size; two of the largest that I measured were two inches long, and one inch and seven-eighths thick, almost two inches cube—that would render her particularly susceptible to shock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am at present living at 186, Marylebone Road—I am an American by birth; I have been in England since May last—I knew the deceased, George Michael Graham—he was a fellow countryman of mine, and came over here in October, I think—I have met the prisoner, I believe he is an American—I first met him about June or July in London—prior to the 19th November I had seen the deceased and the prisoner together, and, as far as I could judge, they always appeared to be on perfectly friendly terms—on the night of the 19th November I went to the Churchill Club at 84, New Oxford Street, and there met the prisoner—we played baccarat together, and I won about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from him—after the game we spoke to each other, and I said "I shall see you on Monday"—he has not paid me that money as yet—we parted from the Club about 2 or 3 o'clock in the early morning of Sunday—that was all that was said about it that night—on Monday, the 28th November, in the neighbourhood of 2 o'clock in the afternoon I went to the Bodega in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120090"/>
               <p>Glasshouse Street and there saw the deceased, and about half-past 2 the prisoner came in—Graham was still there—I asked the prisoner if he in<lb/>tended to pay the money, and he said he had not the funds to pay with—I said "Well, if you cannot pay that must end it," or words to that effect—nothing else passed between us then that I can remember—Graham had left the table and returned; he was not there when the conversation took place—he returned directly it was over; the prisoner then rose from his chair, and said to Graham, "Come, George, let us go," and they went out together—I should judge that to be about the neigh<lb/>bourhood of 3 o'clock—on the evening of this same day, about 6 p.m., I went to the American bar of the Criterion Restaurant, and there saw the prisoner—I went up to the bar to drink, and whilst I was there drinking the prisoner came up and said "I cannot pay that money"; he did not say why; I said "Very well, we shan't converse any more about it"—at this time I saw Mr. Graham at the bar, but I do not think he was sufficiently near to hear; the prisoner then mumbled over something, but I did not catch what it was—I walked away towards the grill, which is in the same room—as I was walking Mr. Graham, who was seated at a table, called me towards him and asked me to have a drink and to introduce him to his friend—I then sat down at the table where he was and ordered a drink—Mr. Graham then called Doherty, who came and sat down, and we all drank together—that was Mr. Graham, Mr. Graham's friend, the pri<lb/>soner, and myself—we were sitting down there together probably five or six minutes, the prisoner then spoke to me and said he could not pay the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had not alluded to it in any way whilst we were sitting there—he said it in such a tone that Graham could hear it, and he did hear it—when Doherty opened the conversation about the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said "I hope you will excuse me, gentlemen, I don't wish to have any conver<lb/>sation about this money"—Doherty then said to Mr. Graham, "Come on, George, you are going home to dine with me?"—we were talk<lb/>ing rather loud, and the superintendent of the American bar came up the step and said "This won't do here"—I said "I shan't have any noise myself, excuse me," and I got up and left the table—when Doherty said "I can't pay you the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." I said "I am very much disappointed in you"—I think that was said at the Bodega, when he first spoke to me about it—at the Criterion Doherty was talking rather loud about the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he spoke in a loud voice so that the people round could hear—Doherty left the table when Graham left it, after I left; just before that Graham said to him "Are you not going to drink all your glass?" he had only sipped it, and I think he told him not to talk so loud; he touched him on the shoulder and told him to sit down—Doherty had risen and intended to go, I should judge; he then sat down—that was the first time that Graham had interfered in the matter—after the superintendent came up Doherty ceased to talk so loudly; the superintendent remained by the table; he then got up and walked away—I went to the bar and called for some more drink—whilst I was standing there Doherty came up and we drank together; before that Doherty said to Graham, "You are coming home to dine with me?"; Graham said "Certainly," and they passed out together—that was probably about half-past six, or it might have been a little later—it would be between 6 and 7 when they left the Criterion, nearer 7 than 6—I could not swear whether Doherty was drinking with any one else or not—I know he had two drinks—he seemed to know what</p>

               <p>he was about—I could not say what he had been drinking; it was spirits; his manner was not very pleasant—he did not call me any name that I re<lb/>member, he mumbled something or other, but I walked away, and did not pay any attention to it and did not hear what it was—between 9 and 10 that evening I received certain information which took me to University College Hospital—I there saw Graham, he was conscious at that time—he knew me, he shook me by the hand, and called me by name—I paid him two visits after—I last saw him on Monday morning, 27th November, and was with him when he died, at a quarter to 5 in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the American bar at the Criterion Restaurant—on Monday evening, 21st November, about a quarter to 7 or nearly 7 o'clock, I saw the three men, Graham, Howe, and the prisoner, seated at a table there—my attention was called to them because they were talking rather loud, I was on the other side of the room—I went to them, and as I came to them Graham was sitting on the other side of the table, the prisoner and Howe were on the sofa—Graham said "It's all right, there will be no row here, I will keep them quiet"—I said "Very well, then, I won't say any thing"—there seemed to be some dispute going on between Howe and the prisoner—Howe then left the table—as soon as he did so the prisoner went out, Howe went to the door and the prisoner followed out; I did the same, because I saw that the prisoner was very excited, and I looked at him as he came to Howe—Howe said "You leave me alone, I will not have any<lb/>thing else to do with you, it is quiet enough now, you keep quiet and don't talk to me again"—Howe turned round and went to the bar—the prisoner followed him to the bar, I did the same, and as he arrived there near Howe, the prisoner said "Will you have a glass to drink now?" Howe smiled, and said "Are you getting into a better temper now, how is it you ask me to have a glass now?"—he said "Well, don't let us talk about it now, let us have a glass and everything will be all over," so he asked for a glass and they had a drink together; they were quiet then, and I left them standing at the bar—I don't think the prisoner was drunk; he seemed excited, but not drunk; he walked like a man who was excited but not drunk, quite well—I can't say that the man was drunk, I don't think so, he was very steady in his walk.</p>

I am housemaid to Mrs. Addison, of 47, Woburn Place; the prisoner and his wife occupied two rooms, the drawing room floor, the first-floor; they came there about five months ago—the front room is the sitting room; it has three windows looking on to the street—, the bedroom is at the back, with folding-doors and a curtain as well—on Monday, 21st November, dinner had been ordered for 7 o'clock—Mrs. Doherty was at home at that time; Mr. Doherty came in at 20 minutes to 8 with a friend, Mr. Graham—he had a latch-key, I saw him let him<lb/>self in; I was in the dining room, I saw him walk through the hall—I had seen Mr. Graham there on several occasions, he had dined there with Mr. Doherty—on this occasion I was not certain that he was coming to dine; I had laid the dinner things for three at the table in the middle of the room—I saw Mr. Doherty go upstairs, he walked all right,</p>

               <p>I think—Mr. Graham also went up—I went up about 10 minutes after them—I took up the joint and put it on the table—Mr. Doherty was then sitting on a chair by the window nearest the fireplace, near the writing-table, which is in the furthest corner from the door (<hi rend="italic">referring to the model</hi>), he was not doing anything—Mr. Graham was standing between Mr. Doherty and the other side of the table, Mrs. Doherty was standing between the dinner-table and the easy-chair, the ladies' chair—I did not hear anything said—I put the dish on the table and went out and fetched the plates and vegetables, brought them in and put them on the table—Mr. Graham pulled his chair and sat down by the dinner-table, Mr. Doherty remained in his chair—Mrs. Doherty never moved while I was in the room, she stood where she was when I entered the room—I put the things on the table and then left the room to get the sauce-boat from Wiseman, the page boy, who was assisting in bringing up the things; I went dawn three steps, Wiseman was on the landing ready to give me the sauce-boat—I heard Mrs. Doherty ask Mr. Doherty if he would come to his dinner; that was while I was in the room—he never answered her—I heard nothing more said—when I went down the three stairs I heard a noise, I was not positive what it was, I heard something fired—before that I heard Mrs. Doherty ask Mr. Doherty "Why do you look so strange?"—he made no answer; he did look very strange that night, he had a strange expression on his face; he looked as if he was cross and upset by something—I did not hear Mr. Graham say anything before I left the room—I do not remember anything else that was said before I left the room—after leaving the room the noise was the first thing I heard, and then I heard Mrs. Doherty scream, and she rushed out of the room—I can't remember any word that she used, not then—I had then gone down and got the sauce-boat from the page, he was on the first landing, just at the foot of the first flight of stairs—after Mrs. Doherty rushed out of the room she stood a little time on the landing and then went downstairs—after she rushed out I heard a noise in the room like scuffling, and then I heard another noise, a shot a second time—I heard nothing more, I then went downstairs—I should think there was an interval of four or five seconds between the shots—when I went down I remained in the hall—I saw Mr. Graham come downstairs; that seemed a little time after the second shot, I don't know whether it was five minutes or not, he came down alone and went into the dining room; Mrs. Doherty was there, and Mrs. Addison and some friends who lodge there—I did not hear Mr. Graham say anything when he came down; Mrs. Doherty sent Mr. Edinboro, one of the lodgers, for a doctor—I afterwards saw Mr. Graham undo his trousers, and I saw blood on his shirt—a Mr. Von Angern was there—I saw Mr. Doherty leaning over the banisters by the drawing room door, and he afterwards came down, between five and ten minutes after Mr. Graham had come down; the doctor had arrived then, he had arrived before I saw Mr. Doherty leaning over the banisters, about five minutes after Mr. Graham had come down—when Mr. Doherty came down he went into the dining room where Mr. Graham was—Mrs. Addison was there, and I believe the doctor—when Mr. Doherty came in he said to Mr. Graham "It was an accident"—Mr. Graham said "Yes," he was then taken away in a cab with the constable and Mr. Edinboro—I went up into the drawing room as soon as Mr. Graham went—I noticed the ladies' arm-chair on fire, in front of the back part, there was a red fire on</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined before the Coroner as well as before the Magistrate—Mr. Graham had been several times to dinner, not on other occasions—he always came with Mr. Doherty, and he and Mrs. Doherty and Mr. Graham dined together—Mr. Doherty generally came home to dinner—they all seemed to be very friendly and intimate—I never noticed any quarrel, estrangement, or difference between them—I did not take notice whether they were old friends—I never heard them call each other by their names—when they came in they had their hats and coats on—I don't know where Mr. Graham put his coat or hat—Mr. Doherty always used to put his hat on the fire-screen—sometimes he laid his coat on the sofa or the door—I was at the Coroner's Court when Mrs. Doherty was examined—I did not see Mr. Doherty go into his bedroom—I don't know whether he did or not—I don't remember whether the folding-doors were open or closed—I always look after the bedrooms—I cannot recollect whether the basin had been used for washing hands—I went into the room after Mr. Doherty came down, and the basin had been used, by whom I could not say—after I had seen them seated Mrs. Doherty was standing—I don't remember seeing a paper in Mr. Graham's hand—he drew up his chair to the table with his legs under the table—Mrs. Doherty sat at the end of the table, and Mr. Doherty was facing Mr. Graham—it was I who noticed the chair burning—no one called my attention to it, there was no one else in the room—I saw it after I saw Mr. Doherty standing by the landing, and after he had come down to the dining-room—I was three steps downstairs when I heard the first shot—I think I said four steps before the Coroner—there are 10 steps from the top to the first landing where the boy was—there was a tressel on the landing which I put my tray on—I took off all the covers when I left the room, and left them on the tressel outside—it was as I was walking down to meet the boy that I heard the first report—I took three more steps down when I heard the second report: the second followed the first very quickly—I was down the middle of the first flight when Mrs. Doherty screamed and rushed past me—it was after she came out of the room that I heard the scuffling—it was not like a man rising suddenly from his chair and pushing it from him—it was like two gentlemen trying to take something away from each other—it seemed like a scuffle—I heard no voices or angry words; only some noise on the floor—the drawing-room door was open—if there had been any angry words or</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Addison, and live at 47, Woburn Place we let apartments—the prisoner and his wife were lodging with us since June—on Monday night, 21st November, we were at dinner in the dining room on the ground floor, when the prisoner returned about 20 minutes to 8—Mr. Edinboro was dining with us, and Mr. Von Angern and my daughter—after dinner Mr. Von Angern went up to his bedroom—I heard a noise overhead, it seemed like something falling; I then heard screaming, and then a second, noise—I rushed to the foot of the stairs, and saw Mrs. Doherty rushing down—there was a very short interval between the two noises—Mrs. Doherty fell down the first flight—I caught her, she said "My husband has shot himself," or "has shot his friend," in the agitation of the moment I do not remember which—at that point Mr. Edinboro Went for a doctor—I think Mr. Graham had come down before Mr. Edinboro left—I stayed in the room for a second or so with Mrs. Doherty—I did not notice the boy—Mr. Graham came down directly after the second shot—I had only time to catch Mrs. Doherty—she went out of the hall door and came back again, and by that time Mr. Graham came down—I think he came down before Mr. Edinboro went out to fetch a doctor—I went into the dining room immediately with Mrs. Doherty and Mr. Graham—she said to him "Are you hurt?" he said "Yes, I am hit;" she asked where and he placed his hand on the part, in front of his stomach—Mrs. Doherty then said "It was an accident," he said "Yes, give me pen, ink, and paper," and he sat down in an easy chair—before he sat down he unfastened his trousers and showed Mrs. Doherty where he was wounded—I got the pen, ink and paper for him immediately, they were quite handy, and he sat forward if the chair as if to write; he then felt faint and leaned back—about that time Dr. Garlick came, he lives next door but one—he examined Mr. Graham, and it was arranged to send him to the hospital I went to the door for a cab—a cab was brought—I returned to the dining during that time, or before, Mr. Doherty had come down—I was away from the dining room perhaps a minute or not so long—Mr. Doherty said to Mr. Graham, "It was an accident," Mr. Graham said "Yes"—Mr. Edinboro then returned, and after him a police-constable arrived—with their assistance Mr. Graham was put into the cab; he did not want much assistance, he walked down the hall, and was. taken to the hospital-after he had gone the prisoner and his wife remained with me in the dining room—Mrs. Doherty was very excited and agitated, he seemed to me to be dull and stupid—I asked him where the pistol was—I don't think he replied, but Mrs. Doherty ran upstairs to see if it was in the room; it was all done very quickly—she returned almost imme<lb/>diately, she did not say anything, she looked at me and I concluded that the pistol was in his pocket—she shook her head, as much as to say it</p>

               <p>was not upstairs—in consequence of that I went and sat down by the side of the prisoner, taking one of his hands in mine, whilst his wife sat on the other side of him taking his other hand—I thought he might take it out of his pocket, and that inadvertently it might go off—Mr. Von Angern then came into the room with Mr. Murphy, another doctor—I said to Mr. Murphy, "Would you take the pistol away?"—the prisoner said nothing—Mr. Murphy said it was not his place—I then said to Mr. Von Angern, "Fetch a policeman"—I think the prisoner said the pistol was upstairs—Mr. Von Angern left the room, then Dr. Padmore arrived, the prisoner was still in the dining room, and Mrs. Doherty also—after that policeman Wilton returned, I then left the dining room, when I returned I found that Wilton had taken the prisoner into custody—during all this time it seemed to me that he was in a stupid condition, he said nothing—as far as I can remember, I have given every word lie said—he might have been there a quarter of an hour perhaps, I am not at all certain of the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was at the Coroner's inquest when Mrs. Doherty was examined on oath—I heard the noise, which proved to be a report of firearms, and after the first report, and before the second, I got up and went into the hall, as well as I recollect—it was the second report that alarmed me, and then I rushed out into the hall on the instant of the second report—I found Mrs. Doherty rushing downstairs in an agitated manner—I had just time to catch Mrs. Doherty in my arms—she went to the door, and was coming back to the room when I saw Graham coming down; he was coming quickly after her—she spoke very kindly to Graham, "Are you hurt?"—she then said "It was an accident," not as a question, as a statement—he said "Yes, Mrs. Doherty"—that was some time before the prisoner came downstairs, immediately Graham got into the dining-room—I was there continuously in the presence of Graham and Doherty after Doherty came down until he was taken away in a cab; I was practically in Doherty's hearing all the time—there is no ground for suggesting that Doherty went close to Graham and felt in his pockets or pocket; I am quite positive of that—Graham was quite quiet, and seemed to have his senses under perfect self-command—the prisoner scarcely spoke at all, and when I and his wife stood on each side of him to see whether he had the pistol he was perfectly passive in our hands—I am quite sure from my own judgment that the prisoner had been drinking; I think he was Stupid from drink—I noticed huski<lb/>ness in his voice; his voice was thick, like that of a drunken man—when he came down his manner was friendly towards Graham—he mumbled something about being sorry, in a thick voice; Graham was going off in the cab that was waiting for him—when he first came into the room Doherty said something about its being accidental—he said "Are you hurt, Graham?"—Graham said "Yes"—Doherty said "I am sorry, you know it was an accident"—Graham said "Yes"—Graham did not make any accusation or express any resentment against Doherty in any form of language to me or Mrs. Doherty before or after Doherty came down—I heard Dr. Padmore say he thought Doherty's condition was verging on delirium tremens.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 45, Woburn Place, and am a registered medical practitioner—I was sent for, and went to this house a little before 8 o'clock—I saw Mr. Graham there, and saw he had got this wound in the side—afterwards I saw Mrs. Doherty in the room—when I first went into the room the prisoner was not there; he came down into the room, I should judge, a minute after I arrived, or perhaps a little longer—when the prisoner and Mrs. Doherty were in the room Graham proposed that he should go to his house, and I was against it, and recommended that he should be taken to bed, so that we could have him undressed to examine him properly—Mrs. Doherty then spoke, looking towards her husband as if she were desiring him to come and assist Graham; I could not say the words she said—when they were in the room the prisoner did not assist, but afterwards, when we went into the passage, the prisoner came forward to assist Graham upstairs—when he did so Mrs. Doherty placed herself between the prisoner and Graham, and said something to the effect that the two should not go upstairs together—he was not taken upstairs; he was afterwards taken to the hospital—I saw the prisoner enter the room and walk to the other end, and then I saw him sit at the other end of the table—he did not appear to me to walk in any staggering way, and his step did not suggest to me that he was intoxicated—as he sat at the other end of the table he had a lowering, frowning expression—I do not know that I have much to add to that—he did not move, he sat at the other end of the table—when Graham was seated in the cab the prisoner was not there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was occupied with my patient; that was the prin<lb/>cipal object of my attention—I said at the police-court "Doherty was sitting at the other end of the table, with a dazed expression, lowering expression," and I added "Not as though under the influence of drink"—I had not had it suggested to my mind at that time that he had been</p>

               <p>drinking; no one had told me—the wound was on the right side of the abdomen, not quite so high as the hip-bone; not far off—I should say it was below the navel—I did not see the mark on the other side where it came out—Mrs. Doherty in the room made some intimation to her husband to come forward and assist Graham upstairs, and when he did come forward in the passage to assist she interposed between them, and said something—I did not notice that when the prisoner came forward to assist, Graham showed any resentment in any way to his offering to assist him—I noticed no recoiling from the prisoner; nothing of the kind—I heard the constable put the question to Graham when Graham was in the cab, and I was standing outside at the door, to the effect "Shall I arrest Doherty?"—the answer was "It was an accident"—that was meant as the answer, and that he was not to arrest—during all this time Graham was quite calm and collected; he was not in fact conscious, so far as you could judge, that he had received a serious wound—whether he did not know, or whether he was a man of great courage, he showed no want of self-command, and was completely calm and collected—I should say a wound like that ought to have caused pain after the first shock was over; when I say first shock, I daresay he would not have felt it the instant he was shot, but almost immediately after he would—I know he was not suffering considerable pain at the time he was put into the cab, because I asked him the question—he was not under much prostration at the time—one would not have said he was wounded unless you had known it, I think.</p>

On Monday, 21st November, Mr. Edinboro spoke to me at the corner of Russell Square and Woburn Place, and in consequence I went at once to 27, Woburn Place; I got there about 10 minutes past 8—I saw Mr. Graham in the hall—after<lb/>wards a cab was sent for, and I and Mr. Edinboro took him to Univer<lb/>sity College Hospital—on the way there he said "I feel myself bleeding in the stomach"—it took us five or six minutes to drive to the hospital—I and Mr. Edinboro assisted him out of the cab there; he gave me some directions—I left him just at the entrance of the door—I afterwards returned to 47, Woburn Place, where I saw the prisoner—I took him into custody and detained him there in consequence of what Graham had said to me when he got out of the cab at the University College Hospital—I went back to the house as quick as possible; the prisoner was sitting in the dining room—I said "Mr. Doherty?"—he said "Yes"—I said "A revolver, sir?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You had better give it to me, sir, before there is any further mischief done"—he then took the revolver from his waist-belt under his waistcoat in' front of the trousers—I had not seen it before he took it from there—his wife said "You had better give the constable the revolver," and then it was I saw him take it from his waist-belt—this is the revolver produced, a five-chambered revolver—three of the chambers were loaded and two empty—"Smith and Wesson, Springfield, Mass." is on the top part of the barrel—when the prisoner gave me the revolver he said to me "Is my friend hurt much?" (I made this note directly afterwards) "I hope he is not; I did not mean to hurt him; I am very sorry"—I told him I should detain him till the arrival of the inspector—I remained with him till Inspector Pinhorn arrived—I then handed the revolver to the inspector—I should think the inspector came five or ten minutes after—the prisoner</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could see he had been drinking—just before we started for the hospital Graham said "I have been shot, bat if was quite an accident; call a cab"—I put no questions to him on the way to the hospital—when I came to arrest the prisoner he said "Is my friend hurt much; I hope he is not; I did not mean to hurt him; I am very sorry "—I charge my memory that that is what he said—he had been drinking; I don't think he was drunk—I said at the police-court "Doherty was not exactly sober; he had been drinking, but was not drunk, bat I cannot say whether he knew what he was about"—that presented my view of the matter at the time—I was present at the hospital when the prisoner was brought into the presence of Graham—I knew there had been an operation performed by Dr. Barnes about half-past nine that evening, I believe—I think it was between 12 and quarter-past at night when this statement was read over in the presence of Graham to the prisoner—Pinhorn said "You must not ask him too many questions; he is in rather a dangerous state"—I believe those were the words or words to that purpose; I don't know the exact words—I don't remember Pinhorn say<lb/>ing "If you have a question to put to him put it through me; I will put them to him; it will disturb him less if I put the questions for you"—Doherty put no question but the one I have mentioned—I am quite clear about the words used on this occasion, "Had I any wrong words with you?"—the deceased said he was right, meaning to assent, that he had not had any wrong words with him, as I understood—when the prisoner was told he might put a question he appeared to me to be about to make a lot of questions, and the inspector said "You must not ask him too many questions; he is in a dangerous state."</p>

About half-past eight p.m. on the 21st November, in consequence of certain information, I went to 47, Woburn Place—at the dining-room door I saw "Wilton, and in the dining room I saw the prisoner—Mrs. Addison spoke to me, and in consequence of what she said I said to the prisoner "l am an inspector of police; I am told you have wounded a man, and shall have to arrest you"—the prisoner replied "Yes"—I left the constable in charge of him after the constable had handed me the revolver that has been produced—accom<lb/>panied by Margaret Reed I went up on to the drawing-room floor, where she pointed out to me an easy-chair—I noticed the spot on which the chair stood at the time she pointed it out; it is correctly shown on the model; this is the easy-chair—I noticed a hole in the front of the back and a hole at the back of the back of the easy-chair—the hole at the back was between three and four inches lower than that at the front—at the same time my attention was called to the carpet of the room immediately at the back of the chair, and to the floor boards under the carpet—I noticed a hole such as would be made by a bullet in the carpet and could</p>

               <p>feel it in the boards—I have brought the floor boards away (<hi rend="italic">the piece of board was produced</hi>)—there was no bullet in the board when I saw it; it had been taken out by the girl Reed—the hole did not go very far in; it went in transversely—at about the same time this bullet was handed to me by the girl; it has been somewhat flattened—I have since fitted that bullet in its present shape in the hole in the floor board—the bullet is 38 calibre—the revolver was handed to me by the constable—I examined and found it contained two empty cartridges, and three chambers had full cartridge cases—the bullet corresponds with those cartridges as far as I can see—while I was in the drawing room I believe Mrs. Doherty came up from downstairs—she returned from the dining room to the drawing room, and then handed me this box containing 45 full cartridges—I saw she took them from a chest of drawers in the bedroom leading out of the drawing room—the cartridges corresponded exactly with the full cart<lb/>ridges in the revolver—I then returned downstairs and took the prisoner to the station—I left him there and went to University College Hospital, where I saw the house surgeon, Mr. Jecks—in consequence of what he told me I went in search of a Magistrate with the idea of taking Mr. Graham's deposition—I returned to the police-station, and there later information reached me, in consequence of which I returned at once to the hospital, taking the prisoner with me—about quarter to 12 I told him I was about to take him to the hospital to see Mr. Graham; that I was about to take a statement from him as to what had occurred—he replied "I wish I was in his position"—I then took him to the hospital with Sergeant Leake and Constable Wilton—I left him there in charge while I went into the operating theatre—I saw Mr. Graham there lying on the operating table—he was drowsy; he kept his eyes closed for a while—I put certain questions to him, which had the effect of somewhat arousing him—I then continued my questions, and he answered them, and I took down in writing the substance of the answers as he gave them—I believe Dr. Jecks was present and others—the notes I made are attached to the deposition; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are they—I took the notes into an adjoining room, and from those notes and my recollec<lb/>tion of what the man had said to me I wrote out this statement—I took the statement into the operating theatre and read it over to Mr. Graham—he was then fully aroused; he did not suggest or make any alteration—I then went to the prisoner and brought him with the officers into the operating theatre, and said to him "I have a statement here made by Mr. Graham, I am about to take you in to him and read it in his presence, and you will be able to, ask Mr. Graham any questions you choose upon it"—I then read it to him in the presence of the two officers—he was virtually in their custody—I then told Mr. Graham that Mr. Doherty was there, and that I was about to again read the statement to him—I did so; I read it slowly so that the prisoner could hear it—he stood by my side—Graham did not then suggest any alteration or addition—after I had read it I asked him to sign it, and he did so—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I met Mr. Doherty at 4.30 this afternoon at the Bodega, and was with him until we went to his house; we went there in a cab, and on the way had some conversation about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had lost. He said he should not pay it. I said he ought to. In the room his wife said he had been drinking and was upset. Whilst they were talking I picked up a newspaper, and thinking that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120101"/>
               <p>dinner was ready, sat down. He went into the bedroom, and coming out again fired at me. I cannot say he pointed the revolver at me, because I had the newspaper. After he had fried he said to himself 'Fire, fire, fire. I said 'You have hit me.' He did not attempt to assist me. I went downstairs, and he then felt in my trousers pocket as if to see I had a revolver. I then said it was an accident for fear he should fire again")—this is signed George M. Graham, and by three witnesses—after that I told the prisoner that he could ask Mr. Graham a few questions if he pleased—he commenced to talk in a rambling, confused kind of manner as to their former acquaintance, and I then said to him "Please put your question through me, so as not to disturb Mr. Graham," and he said "Have I ever had any wrong words with you before?"—I commenced to repeat the question, when Mr. Graham answered "He is right," without waiting for my repeating it—I then wrote down the question and answer—I then said to the prisoner "Have you any other question to ask?" and he signified by his action that he did not wish to ask any other question—he shook his head, and turned to go—we then left the room, and he was afterwards taken to the police-station—he was there charged with shooting with a revolver at George Michael Graham, with intent to slay and kill—he made no answer—this was about half-past 12—I had seen the prisoner, and had him more or less under observation from half-past 8 in the evening—when I first saw him he struck me as being sober—he appeared to have been drinking, but he seemed fully to know what he was about—he spoke plainly—there was nothing peculiar about his walk—his condition afterwards was much about the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The pistol is a new one—I should think it had never been fired before—it has the modern improvements—one, action of the trigger serves the two purpose of discharging one chamber, and bringing the next chamber in its place—it does not require two pulls at the trigger—I found three cartridges in the pistol, and two recently discharged, and I found 45 cartridges making up the packet of 50—one of them was a difficult make, and had no name on it; the others are Kynoch's—they are all the same size—the fact of having injured his friend should have a sober effect on him; it would upon me—when I arrested him I did not tell him that I believed his friend was seriously hurt—I think I never expressed any opinion to him as to the extent of the injury—he said "I wish I was in his place"—I am not prepared to say that he said it regret<lb/>fully—when I went to the deceased I found that he had just gone through a serve operation, and he had not recovered from the effects of ether that had been given him—I asked him some questions, and took notes—these are the notes in pencil on the side of the paper—I afterwards wrote out the statement on the same sheet of paper—I did not read the notes to Mr. Graham—these are the notes. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "I told him he must pay the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he then shot at me.

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at University College Hospital on Monday evening, 21st November, when about 8.15 I saw Mr. Graham—I at once proceeded to examine him—I loosened his things, and at once saw the wound in his side; it went right through—I saw from the trousers that there was a hole in front, but not behind—the clothes were searched, and I found the bullet in the coat—I saw no burning of the trousers at the place the bullet had entered—there was a very slight discolouration of both sides—there was some blackening round the wound, probably from powder; I could not say for certain—I attended to him; he was operated on—about half-past 9 I had him carried into the operating theatre—he had ether given to him at that time—I was present about 12 o'clock at night, when the inspector came and saw him—I heard the inspector ask him questions, and afterwards read the statement over to him—at that time Mr. Graham was perfectly conscious—the prisoner was brought in, and the statement was read over again, and signed by Mr. Graham, myself, the inspector, and the police officer—after that the inspector said the prisoner might put one or two questions to him—the prisoner seemed to try and push his way past Inspector Pinhorn to get to Graham to ask some questions or make some statement; then Pinhorn suggested that any question should be put through him—I heard the prisoner put the question, but I could not remember the exact words of it; it was to the effect whether they had ever had any quarrel, and Mr. Graham answered "He is right"—Mr. Graham remained in the hospital under my care and that of the other surgeons there—he was not in a dangerous state all the time he was there; he did as well as we could possibly expect for some days—on Friday he got rapidly worse; he was there five days—he had been seen from time to time by his friends—after he died, I was present at the post-mortem—the cause of death was peritonitis, resulting from the wound—one of the intestines had been injured—at the post-mortem I found an old bullet in his chest—he said we should I find it there, and we did—there was a scar, and embedded in the chest was an old bullet that had probably been there for years, I should say certainly for months—that was a small conical bullet, smaller than this, a pistol bullet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This is my signature—the first operation was a very mild one—the severe one was after his statement, at 1 o'clock in the morning—we thought the first bullet had not penetrated the abdomen—we put him under ether—he had recovered from the ether; he was drowsy, but conscious—that was a shock to the system.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE STEPHEN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">said that the rule he had laid down was that if a prisoner was desirous of making a statement he must make the state<lb/>ment before his learned Counsel spoke, and that the result of the statement was that it gave a reply to the other side.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner then made the following statement</hi>:—I have known Mr. Graham the deceased, personally for 15 years; we have always been the best of friends, and have never had a word to mar our friendship in any way. I have always lent him my money. We have always befriended each other in every way; he has dined at my house six or seven different times, and since his arrival in London we have been in one another's company nearly every day. I met him at the Bodega on Monday, the 21st Novem<lb/>ber, by appointment, a little after 4. I met Mr. Howe, a gentleman, a friend of mine. Mr. Howe got up and left for a moment, and went to the W. C.; after he was gone Graham said, "How about that 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?" I said "I am not in a position to talk to you now about it." I said to him "Come, let us go." I did not wish to speak to Howe. We went to the Criterion bar. We met Marshall and Stratton and a gentleman from the Moore and Burgess Minstrels; we had a drink there, and while we were there Mr. Howe came in and drank with us. Then Mr. Graham and I went down to the Leicester bar at Leicester Square; we had a drink there. We had a conversation in the Leicester bar about horses. He was going to Manchester, and I advanced him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go to the races. I had advanced him money. He owed me when he died about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. We went back again to the Criterion, where we met the same party we had been talking together with, Mr. Stratton and Mr. Marshall, and we had a drink again. Then Mr. Howe came over and said, "I did not think it of you. I don't think you intend to pay that money." I said "I am not in a position to pay it." I walked away from him and sat down at the table to have a drink with Mr. Graham. He called a friend of his over, I think a gentleman named Hyams, interested in some way with a New York paper; he introduced me to him; we all three had drink. Howe came and sat next to me and made some remark to me, I have forgotten what it was. That passed all off. He still kept talking about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so I remember getting up and calling Mr. Graham. It was, I suppose, a little after 7. We went then downwards to Leicester bar again; we had a drink or two there and came back and took a cab, I think it was in front of the Piccadilly Restaurant. Coming home in the cab our conversation was of horse-racing, and if he saw anything that was good while he was at the races he was to send me a wire and I was to lay in the pool. We were talking about the riots in Trafalgar Square. He remarked that no more people were killed, I remarked that the reason why no more people were killed was because policemen don't carry firearms. There was talk of firearms. He said he had one at home. I said I had one I would show him. When we got home I remember coming in the house—I can't say exactly when I did get in the house, but when I got in the house I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120104"/>
               <p>taken my clothes off, and my wife was talking to me of being in liquor. We both sat down to table, he on one side and me on the other, and Mr. Graham and me were laughing about my wife speaking to me about being drunk, and then I got up and went into the bedroom to wash my hands. I cannot say how long I was in the room, but the pistol was lying on the mantel-piece; I picked it up. As I stood at the door it went off; how it went off only One can tell, and that is God Almighty. I had no more idea how the pistol went off; the farthest from my mind was to harm my friend; we never had a word whatever. I was beside myself; I stood in that position. I cannot say how long I remained there. I got to the door. I found myself standing at the door. At the time I recovered myself I heard my wife talking downstairs. I went down<lb/>stairs; I saw Graham and my wife and some people in the room. I remember my wife asking me for the pistol and me going with the police<lb/>man; they took me out of there and brought me to the station; I remember going there in a cab. I don't know how long I stayed at the station-house; they did not lock me up, they put me in a room. Mr. Pinhorn came to me and said "You will have to go to the hospital, Mr. Graham is going to make a statement." We waited downstairs in the hall with Mr. Leake and the constable about 20 minutes. Then Mr. Pinhorn came and the constable read the statement to me in the room. When he had read the statement over to me, I said "This is not so, it is a mistake. I want to talk to my friend." He said, "He is very low, you must not ask but one or two questions." I went in; when I got inside I started to talk to him about how the thing occurred, and Mr. Pinhorn said "You have got to ask your questions through me." Then I said "George, have we ever had a quarrel or a misunderstanding in our lives?" and he said" He is right." Then I started to put the next question. I said "Have not I always been your friend?" and he did answer the question. Graham said "Yes." Just as he said "Yes" Pinhorn pushed me into the hall and brought me in a cab back to the station-house. While in the cab and station-house I talked and told my story to I don't know how many policemen there. While in the station-house I asked the ser<lb/>geant for my counsel, Mr. Roupell. They told me he would be in plenty of time in the morning. That is all I have got to say.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Broadway, Stratford, and am a registered medical practitioner—on Tuesday night, 15th November, about 10 o'clock, I received some information, in consequence of which I went out of my front door on to the doorstep, and I saw the prisoner with her baby in the area—I heard the baby cry previously to that—the prisoner got out of the area carrying the baby—I spoke to her; she made no answer, but went obliquely across the road to the side of the churchyard—I followed her, and then Police-constable Berkin came along—I spoke to him—he took the prisoner and the baby to the West Ham Police-station—there I discovered a strong odour of phosphorus, which appeared to come from the child's mouth—the child's clothing in front was wet—I had the mother and child placed in a dark cell; I found the outside and the front part of the clothing luminous, showing that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120111"/>
               <p>some kind of phosphorus had been used—the wet on the child's clothes was as if the child had vomited—I smelt the child's mouth; I have no doubt there had been phosphorus in the mouth; I found no phosphorus actually in the mouth, I examined it for that purpose—the prisoner said "I come from Kensington, and was going to a Mrs. Smith, Market Place, Romford," to leave her child there—it was nearly an hour from the time I first saw the child to the time I left it—during that time the child was crying, but otherwise appeared all right—the constable has pointed out to me the place near the railings of the church; that is where I gave her into custody—this is a bottle labelled "James's Phosphor Paste," for destroying rats, mice, blackbeetles, &amp;c.—phosphorus is a poison; this is a preparation of phosphorus, and is a poison; it would be poison for a child three weeks old—the result of this going into the stomach would be, in all probability, death—no ill effects resulted; the child was perfectly well afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I followed her across the road—as soon as the con<lb/>stable came up I gave her into custody—I kept my eye on her the whole time—I am perfectly certain of that—I did not see her throw away anything—phosphorus, or any preparation of phosphorus, has a strong smell of garlic—I do not suggest that the child actually swallowed any part of the phosphorus; I take it the phosphorus was so pungent in the child's mouth as to produce vomiting; I think the child did not swallow any—I found traces of phosphorus on the child's clothing and round outside the throat—I saw a luminous appearance and one or two small particles of something—if a child vomits without anything of this sort there is very often a sour smell—if milk turned sour on the stomach it would be of an acrid smell—I know the difference between phosphorus and the other smell—phosphorus has an acrid smell, but it is pungent—the child had a pink head-square and white clothing—the door of the dark cell was shut completely; light may have come in—if the child had vomited milk curdled, you would not have got the white luminous fumes coming from it—there was luminosity with white fumes—I saw nothing in the way of luminosity with white fumes from the child's mouth—I should not have expected to find traces of phosphorus in the child's mouth if the child had vomited immediately—I should think the child had vomited immediately—phosphorus paste is put down because rats and other animals eat it readily; death is the result, I believe—I have no experience if they do eat it readily—I suppose that is the object of getting this stuff and laying it down—they experience nausea immediately, I believe—I do not know if the immediate result is pleasant—the vomit was ordinary child's vomit.</p>

I live at 21, Cambridge Square, Hyde Park—I am a member of a local branch of the Charity Organisation Society—by that means I became acquainted with the prisoner in February last; she wanted a letter for a hospital—I made arrangements for her to enter a home at Mrs. Harrier's, 7, Pope's Road, Brixton—she entered that Home on 4th March—I visited her there twice before her baby was born, which was on 28th May, and I visited her once afterwards—I saw the baby when it was 10 days old—she asked me to arrange for the child to be taken care of by a nurse, and I did so for a week, and then to be taken by Mrs. Remnant, of West Grove Cottage, Walton-on-Thames—before it went away the prisoner behaved to it most affectionately—I have used the expression "She was tremendously fond of the child"—before it went to Walton I told the prisoner that I thought I knew of a lady that would adopt it—she said she would rather work for it; keep it herself—the child went to Mrs. Remnant's about 29th June—in the meantime the prisoner went on 21st June to a lady in Eaton Square as wet nurse—I afterwards received a letter from her in which she spoke of the child with great affection—about the beginning of August I went abroad—I received a letter from the prisoner while I was abroad—I have not that letter; I lost it—this letter (<hi rend="italic">marked G</hi>) is similar to the one I lost.</p>

               <p>from abroad, I think about the second week in September, I saw the prisoner at a friend's house, having made an appointment—she then told me that this cousin was going to adopt the baby—I said I haw written to the cousin, and she had said she was no cousin of hers, and she would not think of adopting the baby—I asked the prisoner what she would telling me one story and telling Mrs. Remnant another one—she then said that this man Frank would marry her if the child was taken to a home; that he would see about the home—I said I would give the child up to the cousin myself, or not part with it—she did not suggest the name of any home—she then asked me what she should do—I said that she might work for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. too, and give me the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that the young man Frank might give 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. too, and I would give 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to make up 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and Mrs. Remnant would adopt the baby—she then said she would try to find a Place, she would think about it and write to Frank—that interview took Place about the middle of September—between that and 21st September I received two letters—that was the next I heard of the prisoner—I was at Sunbury then. (<hi rend="italic">The first letter, dated from 27, Nursery Road, Brixton, stated that she had succeeded in getting a place with Mrs. Seymour, of 1, Mandeville Place, where she would have to see to all to begin with, and that If she got on in two months she would get</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">that she had said she had Been a nurse, not daring to say a wet nurse, and that she had written to Mrs. Sewell asking her not to say anything about it, but to speak as well as she could for her, and that she</hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>) <hi rend="italic">wished Miss Mocatta would see or write to Mrs. Sewell asking her to do what she could for her, and also to write to Mrs. Seymour; that she had been to see Mrs. Morgan, but that she was out; that Miss Mocatta would be surprised to hear she was at Brixton, but that she did not like to go back to her cousin so she had written to her, and should stay there till she got something to do, which she should do at this place; that the lady there was very nice, and that there was one dear little baby; that she should be pleased to hear from Miss Mocatta what she thought, but that she was almost sure she would approve of what she had done. In a postscript she added that she did not intend going near Mrs. Harrier although she was in Brixton.</hi>) Two or three days after I received this letter "B." (<hi rend="italic">This was dated from the same address, saying that she had not got a place; that she had not got the one in Mandeville Place as she had not old enough, but that she was going to try again that day; that she would not be able to pay Mrs. Morgan</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">as she had had a quarrel with her sweetheart, and should not see him again, the fact being that she could not settle down and marry; that she had no doubt she could manage somehow, and if Miss Mocatta would not let her have the baby she could not help It; she could not pay for her, so that would Miss Mocatta please let her know what was to be done at once; she could not be guided any longer; if she could have done as she wished at first she should have settled to something before; that she did not know how Miss Mocatta could think she could get</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">weekly to send to Mrs. Remnant, as she was not earning any<lb/>thing, and that she must either have baby herself or put her away somewhere where she would not cost her much; but that if Miss Mocatta insisted on keeping her at Mrs. Remnant's, she could not pay anything for her; and a postscript requested Miss Mocatta not to come to see her as she was hardly ever at home during the day.</hi>) After receiving that I wrote to Mrs. Remnant, and on 21st September I received a telegram, in consequence of which I went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120124"/>
               <p>to Vauxhall Station, where I met Mrs. Remnant, who had the baby with her—I went with her to Scotland Yard, where I saw the police—I ex<lb/>pected to meet the prisoner at Vauxhall Station at 6—after I returned from Scotland Yard I saw her in the waiting-room at Vauxhall Station with Mrs. Remnant—I asked the prisoner what she was going to do with the child—she said "l am going to Brixton to get some one to look after it while I go out to work"—Mrs. Remnant said "I shall go with you"—the prisoner said "I shall take the child to its father at Brighton"—I asked Mrs. Remnant to keep the child for a day or two, and then I or she would give it up to the aunt—Mrs. Remnant said she could keep it no longer without having money—I think she said three weeks were in arrear at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I spoke to Mrs. Remnant alone and she went outside—then I tried to frighten the prisoner in several ways; I said a certain policeman was coming in and would sign his name to a document, and would take a good look at her, and if she dared do any<lb/>thing he would be able to follow her up, and some words like that—Mrs. Remnant came in with a constable, and the document "E" was written—I saw the prisoner sign her name to it. (<hi rend="italic">This document was read as follows</hi>:—"September 21st, 1887. I, Ada Remnant, deliver up the child Ada Norah Scott, aged three months, to Annie Scott, the mother, in per<lb/>fect health, in the presence of the following witnesses—Annie Scott, cook, Vauxhall, Ada Mocatta.") The prisoner then turned round and said to me, "Where will you take me to?"—I turned to Mrs. Remnant and said "Is she mad?"—I then took the prisoner and the baby in a cab for the purpose of finding lodgings—I took them to Mrs. Russell, 24, Molyneux Street, and left the prisoner and the baby there in the lodgings—next morning, Thursday, September 22nd, I went there—the prisoner was not there—I saw the baby—the same evening I received from the prisoner a letter, which I burnt—in that letter she complained of Mrs. Russell, said she was drunk, and that was chiefly why she left during the day, and that she would return the same evening or the following morning—on the following morning, Friday, 23rd, I saw the prisoner at Mrs. Russell's—the prisoner said to me "I have received a letter from a lady and am going into a situation next Thursday"—she did not give me any particulars that day as to where the situation was—she said she could pay for the baby if she was in a situation—I offered to pay the first month—I then went with her to Mrs. Fleming's to get other lodgings until she should go to her situation, and for the baby to be taken care of there—I was going to find it another nurse up to the Tuesday—it was arranged between us that I should have to find a nurse for the baby when the prisoner went to a situation—I then introduced the prisoner to Mrs. Morgan, who lived in the neighbourhood, with whom she might spend part of her time every day while waiting for a situation with the baby—on Saturday, 24th September, I went to Mrs. Morgan in the afternoon and saw the prisoner and her baby there—in the prisoner's presence Mrs. Morgan said that the milk had been drugged, she thought—I don't think anything was said as to where the milk came from—Mrs. Morgan said in the prisoner's hearing that she had tried the milk and had felt very sleepy after it—the prisoner said "Mrs. Russell may have put aniseed into it"—I left then and went back later in the day—I saw the prisoner alone with the baby—I said "Of course I believe in you, but it would look very black for you if the baby became worse,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120125"/>
               <p>because Mrs. Remnant would say that you had drugged it"—next day, Sunday, the 25th, I saw the prisoner again twice, first at 10 o'clock in the morning—I made an appointment to meet her next day at 10 o'clock at a photographer's in Molyneux Street, Edgware Road, in order that the baby might be photographed—that Sunday evening was the last time I saw the baby alive—on the Sunday morning I told her that she could get the child into a home at no expense to her or into a workhouse after it was 12 months old, and it would be well looked after—in case of its going into the workhouse she would have to keep it at her own expense till it was a year old—that would not apply to it if it went into a home—if she kept it at her own expense till it was a year old it would then be well looked after at a workhouse, and could be boarded out—she could get it in the workhouse before it was a year old, but it would not be well looked after, and I thought she had better not put it into the workhouse till it was a year old—they take them into the workhouse at any age, but they are not looked after very well when quite young—after they are 12 months old they are boarded out—I said "If you will give me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or even 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will keep it altogether"—she said "I will go into a situation and work for it"—on the 26th, Monday, at 10 o'clock, I went to keep the appointment in Molyneux Street, but could not find her—she was not there at Mrs. Fleming's, nor the child—was unable to find her—on Tuesday morning, the 27th, I received this letter "F" from her. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that she had taken the baby to Brighton, and had seen its father, who she would almost swear was married, as he seemed much put out at seeing her; that she told him he must do something for the baby, and that he said he would pay for it if she would put it where he wished, with an old woman whom they both knew; that she had consented, as she had had enough of paying for it herself; that it was settled, and she was going into a place to-morrow, and that she hoped Miss Mocatta would not think her ungrateful.</hi>) I tore the envelop up; I did not notice the post-mark—after receiving that letter I went with Mrs. Morgan to 27, Nursery Road, Brixton, about 10 o'clock or shortly after—I saw the prisoner there—I said "What have you done with the child?"—she said "I have taken it to its father at Brighton"—I said "I don't believe a word of it"—I lost my temper, and called her murderess, and said she made away with her child—she only looked insolent—I then charged her with taking Mrs. Morgan's shawl and brooch, and said I would have her taken—she for that—she then gave the brooch to Mrs. Morgan, who was there—she said "The shawl is with baby, and I will return that another day"—I begged her to let me have the baby, and I would adopt it altogether, and she should not be bothered with it again, and I gave her a copy of the rules of the Founding hospital—she said she would keep them and show them to the baby's father—to my proposal to adopt she said "It is too late; you should have told me so before"—I again threatened to send for a policeman—I said I must go to Brighton with her, and that it I saw the baby in anyone's care I would not worry her for it again—she agreed to go with me to Brighton, and we three took train from Brixton to Victoria station—she tried at Brixton to get us into a Hammersmith train—at Victoria she went on ahead; I called out a cab was coming, and she came back again—ultimately I took two return tickets to Brighton for Mrs. Morgan and her—next day Mrs. Morgan wrote to me; in consequence I went to Scotland Yard to have her boxes</p>

                  </hi>, F. R. C. S. I am surgeon to the Westminster Hospital—on 1st October, with Dr. Kempster, I made, a post-mortem examination of the body of a female child—the last witness was there, and pointed out the child—the body was well nourished, and was that of a child about five months old—I found no marks of injury externally or in<lb/>ternally—there was externally a good deal of hypostatic condition at the back of the buttocks and legs, and other parts of the body—the body was of a pinkish red colour, from the blood having gravitated to that part—that would occur after death—on opening the skull I found a good deal of veinous congestion of the brain, and membranes of the brain; the brain was otherwise quite healthy—I found the lungs congested, and especially were they congested at the base and the back part of the lungs—I found the right side of the heart full of blood, and also the veins leading to the heart turgid with blood—the left side of the heart was empty—I found all the other organs of the body perfectly healthy—I examined the mucous membrane of the stomach, it is perfectly healthy; it was stained from congestion—there was no food in the stomach, but about two teaspoonfuls of mucous fluid—I gathered the contents of the stomach and also the stomach, and put them in a bottle—I also took parts of the intestines, and liver, and spleen, and put them into a bottle, and they were sealed in my presence and handed into the custody of the last witness—I considered the death was due to exposure—it might have been caused by narcotic poisoning, but the pupils were normal; I should have expected to find contracted pupils in death from a narcotic; I should also have expected to find food in the</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I was present when Dr. Bond made a post-mortem examination—I agree with what he says—Mrs. Morgan handed me a bottle containing a fluid—I gave it to the Coroner's officer, having previously sealed it—I handed the bottle containing the contents of the stomach to him after sealing it up.</p>

I am one of the official analysts at the Home Office, and I also occupy a position at Guy's Hospital—on 6th October I received from the Coroner's officer two sealed bottles; the first contained three portions of the viscera of an infant and three teaspoonfuls of fluid—on analysis they did not show any unhealthy or unusual appearance; there were no remains of food or any special odour; I could detect no trace of morphine or poison—the second bottle contained seven ounces or a quarter of a pint of fermented milk—on distillation I discovered about a tenth of a grain of alcohol, and it had a peculiar spirituous odour—it contained traces of morphia, about a tenth of a grain in the seven ounces, no aniseed—a dose of a tenth of a grain of morphia would be a dangerous dose for a child of five months if it had not been accustomed to it—if given several hours before death it would be possible for me not to find traces of it in the interior of the stomach.</p>

I got there about 12, and strolled about, not knowing where to put it, when I saw a woman sitting on some stones</p>

I said 'Yes, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;' she said 'Give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I will put it down for you. I will leave it where it can be found, and if I cannot do that I will take it to the workhouse, and if it is put on the steps they are bound to take it in.' Then I gave it to her, and went straight to the pier and took the boat to Westminster, and then the train to Brixton. After I left Mrs. Morgan in Brighton I walked about all that night, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs<lb/>day; on Friday an old gentleman, a German, took me home. I got work on the following Wednesday, and on Thursday I left him and took the lodgings at 63, William Street, where I remained until the policeman took me on Saturday, as I was going back to work after dinner. On the Monday that I took baby away I pawned some things at a pawnshop in John Street, Edwards', I think, and got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them. The things pawned were a red pelisse and child's bonnet, and, I think, a dress, in the name of Ann Sweetman, John Street." I cautioned her before she made that statement—I went to 11, Victoria Road; I could find no Mrs. Fox there; no one of that name was known there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not been resisted by force by the defendant since September 26th—the agreement was not prepared by him but by him, but by me, it is a form printed by the Company—the date of the Inquisition is September 21st, and the alleged forcible entry took place on the 26th—I did not in the interval write to Robinson informing him that there had been an Inquisition, nor did I see him or inform him—on 26th September he told me that he had the premises under a three years' agreement which was still running—he did not say that he had never been lawfully ejected or deprived of the use of the premises—I was aware of the pro<lb/>ceedings against him by the Sheriff—I acted under the orders of the Company's solicitor in taking possession—I charged Robinson with an assault on me, and after that while he was going with the constable, he continued to threaten me—I made no complaint to the first constable of any assault, but I did to the second, and he said that it was a civil action—he was called at the police-court—I do not know his name, but there were only two—I have seen him here to-day—I do not think I made any complaint about the threats—I was seized by the throat—I was not hurt or frightened, but it was not a pleasant position to be in—I told the first constable that I had been put out of the house—I saw a woman named Wadey, who I believe is a lodger there, at the police-court—I saw nobody in the house that day looking at apartments which were to let—from the way in which the door was opened, if anybody swears that she opened it from the inside, I swear that that is untrue—I said "to the best of my belief it-was not," before the Magistrate, but of course I could not see through a wooden door—I say that it may have been opened from the inside, but it is very improbable, because I saw it forced open—I base my judgment on the way the door flew open.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The force used was a violent push by Robinson and his two men, and the door flew open to the widest extent with a bang, and it was then closed against me—I notice that in the agreement there is no power of re-entry for non-payment of rent.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ventriloquist, of 156, Walworth Road—Robinson lot me the kitchen and ground floor as a lodger—I was there 18 months, and left the first week in November—he never occupied any part of the premises, but I made him sleep there one night—he had no property there—three floors were let to lodgers—he called every Monday for nine or ten months for his rent, and I paid him regularly, but some<lb/>times Maitland called, that is Irving—on a Saturday in September Burton called, and showed me an Inquisition, he explained what had occurred, and on the Saturday afterwards I agreed to pay him my rent—I afterwards told Robinson so; he said "You will have to pay me; when is Mr. Burton coming again?" I said "Monday, at 10 o'clock," he said "I will be here, and go downstairs after him, and give him a d—d good thrashing, and if I get six months it will not be the first time"—I had kept a few weeks' rent in hand, and he said if I paid Burton he would <hi rend="italic">broker me</hi>—Burton came first on the Monday, but he bad another place to go to, and was away 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour, and when he came back I was in the kitchen, and saw a crowd coming up the front garden—I went up and opened the front door and let Robinson in and three others—Robinson asked me if Mr. Burton had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120136"/>
               <p>called, I said "Yes, he will be back very shortly"—he went upstairs, to Mrs. Wadey, and the other fellows stopped in the passage—Mr. Burton came back and Robinson came down and put the chain on the front door—I said, "Mr. Robinson, you must not lock me in my own place," and he put his arms round my neck and held me—I got my police whistle, and he ran to Burton and got hold of him by his throat—as the door was locked I ran up to the window and blew my whistle—I then heard Mr. Irving say "That will do <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, leave him alone"—I am sure Robinson assaulted Mr. Burton—something was said about authority, and he said "I will show it to a policeman"—they went out, and I locked the door and put the chain up—I went into the front room and saw Robinson and the gang come up the front—I heard two blows against the door, and the second blow broke the lock and the catch, and the chain was forced through the slot—I saw that and paid for repairing it—it is not a fact that Mrs. Wadey or anybody else opened the door to Robinson—Mrs. Wadey never came down lower than the landing—three fellows came back with Robinson and used most filthy language, and forced open my inner door and hurt my wife's thumb—a policeman came and I went outside and told him I would give Mr. Robinson in charge—he said "I cannot do anything, it is a civil action"—Robinson stayed about half an hour—I remained in the house a week or a week and a half, and each time Robinson came he threatened to bleed me and knife me—he came the following morning for the rent and I was advised to Pay him, and he allowed me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. payment for the repair of the lock of the front door—I said, "Will you put it in the book?"—he said "You don't want me to incriminate myself; I shall have you up for criminally assaulting a child," and then he threatened to sue me for keeping a writ back—there is no truth in either—before the repairs were done I saw the woodwork broken away and the bolts also—the locksmith had to take the lock away for a day, and in the interim I had to use the large lock—I repaired the door of my own room myself.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at 131, Royal Road, Kennington Park—I know all the defendants except Hawkins and Chapman—I have only known Whitehouse since last December; Hayes, May, Simon, and Haydon about three years; Gosling since last year, and Ledicott only the last year to be friendly with him; Brown four or five years, and Hancorn only through connection with the others—I used to meet them at the Wine Shades, Dowgate Hill, last year, but not Ledicott or Hawkins—before January, 1886, I was traveller to Mr. Woods, a jam manufacturer, of Swanley, to whom I introduced orders from May and Miss White, who is not here, to whom Simon was manager—Simon is Harper—the goods were supplied on that introduction—I left Mr. Woods in January, 1886, and went into the employ of Wright and Ashbridge as traveller, to whom I introduced Ledicott, Simon, Hayes, and Gosling, and Brown in the name of Maltby, to all of whom goods were supplied—Ledicott gave an order for goods value 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which were supplied—I owed Ledicott 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and signed a receipt for the full amount—I did not hand Wright and Ashbridge any of it—goods were supplied to Hayes by Wright and Ashbridge to the amount of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., for which Hayes paid me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I signed this receipt in full (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not hand any of it to Wright and Ash<lb/>bridge, but I wrote and told them I had collected the account—they discharged me at the beginning of December, 1886, on account of my orders not being satisfactory—during 1886 I used to meet several of the defendants at the Silver Grill, Hart Street, Mark Lane, and also at Ledicott's house, the Antelope, which has an off and on licence; it is a dining room as well—I have seen a man there who has been discharged, also Perks, and Farrington, and Price, and Barnes—I knew Simmonds as Baxter and Hamilton and Sinclair and Seymour, and he was generally known as Shylock among his friends—he said to me that when any new</p>

I am a provision merchant, of 26, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden—we advertised for a traveller in December, 1885, and Haydon came and said that he had a good connection round London among paying men, and could do a large trade—among the people he introduced was J. W. Lowden, who was known to us unfavourably—I asked Haydon if Lowden was the person we knew; he said "No"—I asked if he was quite sure; he said he was positive, he was travelling for him, and he was a very respectable man and well connected, and he had known him many years—in consequence of that I supplied Lowden with goods to the value of 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has not been paid—Haydon also brought me an order from Henry Simon, of Farley Road, Peckham—he said he was a good man doing a good trade, and would pay short—I supplied Simon with goods value 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. t but have only been paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Haydon also introduced me to Alfred Ledicott, of High Street, Peckham, and made the same statements—I supplied him with goods to a much larger amount than 74<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. but that is the sum he has not paid—I have made repeated applications for it—I did not go to High Street, Peckham, but I saw him at the Antelope and other houses, and asked him for the money—I afterwards found out that Lowden was the person I had known unfavourably—I then discharged Haydon.</p>

I am a manufacturer, of Stanley Works, Plaistow—in January this year I engaged Haydon as traveller—he gave me references, but I did not apply for them—he was with me about three months—he introduced orders amounting to 137<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we recovered 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, and some goods have been returned, leaving 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. still unpaid—on July 16th we received this order in the name of Osborne, alias Hayes, amounting to 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Haydon said that Osborne was a very reliable man; he had known him many years, and he was a refresh<lb/>ment contractor—I supplied the goods, and they were not paid for—on July 13th Haydon brought me an order from H. Wright, 134, New<lb/>ington Causeway, for goods, value 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said he had had many transactions with Wright, and he was a very reliable man—I supplied the goods, but received no money—on 19th August I had a second order from Wright for goods, value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I only supplied part of them, amounting to a little over 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that has not been paid—I went to Newington Causeway three times, and saw Mrs. Wright, but I never saw him—the third time the shop was shut, and I heard that the brokers were in—I saw some of my goods there and one ox two hams—I told Haydon that it was a "very unsatisfactory sort of business—he said that Wright had had some goods from the country, and there had been some bother about them, and he had been sold up in consequence, but it was all right.</p>

               <p>my books had not been posted while my partner was away—it happened about the time of year when one partner is resting—the order-book was not posted into the ledger—if we applied ourselves before going to Stubbs we should be doing nothing else but being about on foot; we have too many customers—I am in my business from 8 o'clock to 7 o'clock at night, and am fully occupied—on this occasion I took the opportunity of looking after these accounts—I did it at the wrong time; I should have done it before I sent the goods—if you were ready to pay the money you could have explained to Stubbs about the discount.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Simon.</hi> Whitehouse spoke of you; I had no other reference—he said it was not necessary to inquire of Stubbs; he said he had known you many years; that you knew pursers, and were able to sell your goods on board ship—he told me you were a grocer; both grocer and purser, I think—I have heard all these sorts of things since—I presume he said you were a grocer—you were supplied with goods in the name of Edwards on 26th August—the account would be due next day in our way of dealing; that is to say, cash within a month—I should think myself entitled to have my money next day—that may not be on the invoice; there may be other things not on the invoice either—if he were dealing honestly I don't think our traveller would give three months, because his money would be pending then for three months—I don't know the day you were arrested or appeared at the police-court—very likely you were arrested on 24th September—I placed the matters in the hands of Stubbs all at the same time—I went to the police-court and swore an information after I put it into Stubbs's hands; I cannot give dates—it was before your arrest—goods have been found at Chapman's; other goods than those of Haydon, Hamilton, and yourself must have been found there; we only recognised the goods by the names being on the perfumery.</p>

The name of our firm is Alexander and Company—I have heard Simon had two or three names—Chapman told us he heard Simon had married Miss Harper, and used that name at the beginning of this year—this is part of the goods that came from Chapman's premises belonging to me—on that is pasted "Lot 63"—on several boxes among the goods delivered up to the police was "Lot" so-and-so—when we discovered them at Chapman's place we saw them—this is a sample of our pumice soap—it is not damaged; it is in the state it would be in three or four months after leaving our premises; it is in the state in which it loaves our premises, we send it out more or less like this—pumice soap has the peculiarity of not having a special finish in appearance; that is not detrimental to the soap nor to the appearance of the soap—retail dealers are not guided in the purchase of a speciality of soap by its appearance—you can scarcely call this soap—I do not suggest that, in the transaction with Rose, Chapman was doing anything wrong—he sold him certain pumice soap which appears on my list at 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; with my assent it was invoiced at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I should not give my</p>

               <p>to sales"—that was a long time afterwards; he did not say it in those exact words, but that is the exact meaning he conveyed to the man—I didn't know Thorpe's name—I don't know that he said "men that have gone to sales," he only referred to one man—he first said he had dealt with Brent, and then he referred to Simon afterwards and that Hancorn—I cannot remember if certain names were read over to Mr. Champion by the detective; I was there all the time—Chapman did not say "I cannot remember any of them except Simon and Harper, and that is only one man"—he only discovered the two men because he found a receipt on his premises—he found a receipt of Harper and said "This is one and the same man"—he may have gone on to say "His wife has a shop in the name of Harper, the name she married his in"—I have only seen two receipts produced, one signed Simon and the other Harper—I believe those are the only two I saw—I came away and went back on 23rd September—I think all the goods were produced on the same date, because we kept saying that was not enough—we found all the goods there on the 23rd—I pledge myself that the whole of the goods I saw on the second occasion were produced to me on the first, because they fetched them from another shop afterwards. when we said there were more—that was an ironmonger's shop—it may be a shop now where they sell soap and candles and oil, it was not then because I saw it, I swear that—he afterwards referred to buying of men who attended sales—afterwards he mentioned one or two names—he said "I bought currants from a man named Brent, and if I had not bought them at the price I should not be able to buy them at all"—the whole of the goods were given up to the police, and have remained in police custody up to the present time—I keep an order book; it is posted—it is not here—I post that into the ledger; it was neglected during the time my partner was away, during September; one portion of the posting of the order book—Chapman has a very large shop and a very large business; I believe it is a ready-money business—I should have no hesitation in executing his orders if he gave them to me—these are the only two invoices I recognise as produced by Chapman on my first visit, while he was looking for them he mentioned Brent as the man he bought the goods of, but he did not name Harper or Simon—he went up and down the file two or three times, he said he had heard in the summer that Simon and Harper were the same, that was late in the interview—some perfumery was exposed for sale in the shop, and then we asked to go to the cellar, and found some soap there, damaged by damp; I saw some cheese there, and a lot of other articles; the pumice soap was found in a private part of the house, upstairs—there were over 160 boxes of it, and also some perfumes, and besides that, Chapman's man brought 10 or 12 boxes of universal soap from the ironmongery department on the other side of the road—the detective said he was a detective officer, on going into the room where Chapman was.</p>

Hancorn had a brown bag or sack in his hand—I did notice any letters in it—when I went to his shop before he was arrested the shutters were all up but one—the sun was shining; the shop is on the sunny side, and it was afternoon—the door was half open; I could not see the whole of the shop, but I was satisfied there was very little there—I put my head in, and saw nothing but two small bottles of sweetstuff; they were not boxes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer L</hi>). On 15th September I had a man named Rose in custody—he had been employed by Mr. Delaspie, to whose premises I went and saw Henry Simon—I went again on 17th September, and saw the prisoner Whitehouse—Mr. Delaspie had a list in his hand which he read out to Whitehouse—it contained all the prisoners' names except Chapman—Whitehouse spoke of them all as men of good standing, who he had known, some of them, for 10, 12, and 15 years, and who had always paid, and that he knew Hamilton as a shipping agent—I had to go to Ledicott's, the Antelope, Bermondsey, half a dozen times between September 1st and September 22nd—it is a small beer-house with a general shop attached—it is a very low neigh<lb/>bourhood, where the demand for perfume is not so great as the necessity for it—I have seen Whitehead, Haydon, May, Simmonds, Hancorn, Ledicott, Simon, and others there—when I went on September 1st Whitehead and Simon were quarrelling about dividing their shares—Whitehouse, who was the worse for drink, said "I have done five years</p>

               <p>already, and if that fellow doesn't brass up I will do 10," alluding to a man who is not in custody—"brass up" means "pay"—Ledicott was present—there was a general conversation between them, which wound up with "Don't forget dear old Alfred's fourpenny supper"—I was there as a commercial traveller—my second visit was September 20th; Whitehouse and a man not in custody were transferring orders from one to the other—they had books in which to enter the names of customers, and Barnes, said "How many have you got for me?"—Whitehouse took the names out of his book, and the man who I believe to be Barnes put them into his book, and then the other men gave Whitehouse names, which he entered in his book in Ledicott's presence—Barnes said "How about <hi rend="italic">Alphie's</hi> order?"—Whitehouse said "Oh, yes; we must cake one from <hi rend="italic">Alphie</hi>" (Ledicott)—on 24th September I saw Whitehouse leave Milton Street, Camberwell, and join Simmonds in the street—I followed them half a mile, and took Whitehouse on a warrant, which I read to him—he said "The accounts are not due yet; I let the people have three months' credit"—I found on him at the station a pocket-book and a card of Messrs. White and Ashbridge—on the same day I took Simon, who made a statement to me in reference to Chapman, and gave me the address, 33, Barchester Street, Poplar—I went there and found he occupied two small rooms at the back without carpets; a bedstead, bed, table, and two chairs were the only furniture—on 6th October I took Hawkins at 8, Blue Anchor Lane, Fulham, on a warrant, which I read—he said "I have obtained no goods by fraud; I intended sending them back; I only ordered a box of soap, and they sent me all this lot"—I asked why—he did not send them back to the firm—he made no reply—he sells bread, and I saw two or three boxes of sweets; it is a small general shop—I found there a number of things identified by Mr. Delaspie, Mr. Sewell, and other prosecutors—I found some hydrocene, and this tip-top tea—they are all costermongers in the neighbourhood, and it is not a likely part to have a demand for such things—on 10th October I took Wright in the New Kent Road, and read the warrant to him—he said "I have had the goods, and the brokers have taken them off for debts; Whitehouse pressed me to take the orders"—he gave his address 67, Elms Road, Clapham Park—he had before given it as 39, New Kent Road—I made inquiries there, through which I went to 67, Elms Road, which is a 10 or 12 roomed house—the windows had apparently new curtains—I knocked at the door, which was opened by a servant in a cap and apron—I went all over the house—I saw his bed and a child's bed on the floor, and the servant had a bed in the next room—a large trunk in the kitchen was used as a table, and there were two or three chairs—I found 24 boxes of soap, some tea, and a quantity of other things which have been identified, locked in a cupboard—on 13th October I saw Hayes in the street at Fulham—I had a warrant against him in the name of Osborne—a milkman pointed him out to me—he ran in at his door, No. 5, Cranmer Terrace, and I got there just in time to prevent his closing it—I said "Mr. Osborne, I am a police officer," and read the warrant to him—he said "I don't know what you mean; my name is not Osborne"—I said "Hayes"—he said "No, not Osborne or Hayes; I am a baker; what should I want with soap or perfumery?"—it is a very large baker's shop, a shelf was full of flour bags; I looked into them, they were full of sawdust—on the way to the station he said</p>

               <p>"There has been something sent to my house for a man who lives with me"—two men stopped him in the street and said "Mr. Osborne, when are you going to pay that bill?" he said "I have not got a penny in my pocket"—I found on him at the station a cheque book on the London and South Western Bank Hammersmith, a pocket book, and 12 pawn-tickets, one of which relates to a box of soap, pledged with Mr. Jones in August, and identified by Mr. Delaspie—on 26th October I took Haydon at 17, Worlingham Road, Peckham; his wife opened the door, and I gave my name loudly as Purks, on which Haydon called out "Come in, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—I went into the kitchen, saw Haydon, and read the warrant to him; he said "No more than I expected, but they cannot harm me, I will pull my master to pieces for this"—I asked who his master was, he said "Mr. Nagle"—I kept observation on Hancorn's shop for four or five hours from a beerhouse opposite, and I passed through the street several times, and only one or two shutters were down—I afterwards went in, some scents were found there—on 21st September I went with Mr. Delaspie to Chapman's shop, 242, Edgware Road, which is more premises than shop, it is very large, and he has premises on both sides of the way, butter and eggs on one side and ironmongery on the other—on entering I saw some scented soap and perfumery, with the name of Alexander and Co. on it, in a glass case—I put a tablet of the soap into my pocket—we went upstairs into Chapman's office, and found him alone—I said "Good afternoon, sir; I am a police officer, will you give me the names of the men who you have bought fancy soap and perfumery from?"—he said "I have bought no fancy soap or perfumery, I have only bought currants"—I said, "I have not come about currants," and showed him the tablet of soap which I took out of my pocket, and asked where he got it—he said, "Oh, yes, I bought that from a man who I know as a respectable tradesman, who comes to my shop with a pony and cart, he visits sales"—I asked him for the receipt, and to show me his books—he said "Those are my books," pointing to these two files (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) "I only buy it from that one man, and his name is Brent"—as he went over the file I noticed that he passed over a receipt signed "Harper"—I stopped him and said, "Here, that is one of the men who has had goods"—he said "I have known that man for 10 years"—he then showed me a receipt signed "Simon," for perfumery value 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated August 23rd—I asked him if those were all the receipts he had; he said "Yes"—I said "Now, look here, Mr. Chapman, if you act straightforward with us we will with you; where is the receipt for the perfumery we saw in the shop?" he said "I will go through the file again"—he then found this receipt signed "Simon," on one of Hancorn's cards, for perfumery amounting to 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I could not understand it, and he said, "That is for perfumery and soap"—I again asked, him if that was all he had, referring to property of different firms; he said, "I will call my store-keeper, and have all the soap and perfumery up here"—he called out, Bring up all the soap that man brought, also the perfumery"—I then went with Mr. Delaspie and the storekeeper to the cellar, where we found a great quantity of soap, which Mr. Delaspie identified, and it was brought up to the shop, and then to the office, from which a door leads into the living part of the house, into which we went, and in a cupboard in a private room there we found some perfumery which Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188712120171"/>
               <p>Delaspie identified—we then returned to the office, and I said to Chap<lb/>man, "Are you sure that this is the lot?"—he said "Yes, that is all" Mr. Delaspie then showed him a tablet of soap lying on a box in the office, and said, "I have sent out a lot of this universal soap on Whitehouse's orders"—Chapman said, "Oh, yes, I have some of that," and told his storekeeper to fetch the soap from the other shop—the man went over the road, and brought over 10 or 12 large boxes of soap, similar to this, from the ironmongery shop—I said "Have you any receipt for that?"—he said it must be in the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lot, as it was a job lot—the receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. signed H. B. Simon, is for 10 dozen of perfumes; it has no reference to soap—Mr. Delaspie said, "No wonder my cus<lb/>tomers complain when they see my goods sold so cheap"—Chapman said "That is nothing, there are some boxes of stuff there which cost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I can buy them for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." pointing to some bottles in his office, "I never deal with travellers, I always deal with those men who visit sales; I have some currants there, if I bought them through a traveller I should have to pay twice the money for them"—he then went down with us to the shop, and told his storekeeper that if we called when he was out he was to give us every information—we then left—on 21st September I saw some essences exposed for sale in the shop which Mr. Cory, the representative of Sardou and Co., has since identified—they were two-ounce bottles, and were marked 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Mr. Delaspie's larger tablets of soap were exposed at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on September 23rd I went there again; Chapman was not there—I examined the place and came across three boxes which have been produced—they had the name of Edwards written on them, which is an alias of Simon; another had the name of Hancorn, and another Henessey, which is an alias of Simmonds—I went there again on 26th September with Mr. Cory and Inspector Chamber<lb/>lain.</p>

My real name is Henry Bagram Simon—I have passed by the names of Harry Harper, Henry Edwards, and Thomas Edwards—I lived as Thomas Edwards at 33, Barchester Street, Poplar; as Harry Harper ar 11, Arthur Road, East Dulwhich; and as Simon at 62, Thirley Street, Peckham, and also at 53, Green Hawkins used to Peckham—I know most of the prisoners—some time ago Hawkins used to serve me, but I have not had to do with him for the last six years—I did not know Wright, Brown, Hayes, or Gosling to do business with them—independently of doing business with them I know them all except Hawkins, Wright, Brown and Hayes—I have heard Stevenson's evidence; he has said that there was a commission paid, but I paid Whitehouse nothing—I can't say as to the other arrangements he spoke about, because I was not always with them when they gave orders—Whitehouse asked me to give him an order, and said "Now, you will be sure and pay for them at the end of the time," and I agreed to pay at the end of three months—the goods were sent to me at my address at Poplar. and I sold them to Chapman, who I have Known for a number of years—I first knew him when I was in business in Edgware Road—he only knew me as Simon and Harper; he may have known me at three shops at one time—I sold Chapman all the goods for which the police found my receipts—I used to put the goods on my shoulder and carry them, 12 dozen perfumes at a time; it is some time ago—I can't give you the exact</p>

               <p>quantity—I took as much as I could carry—the lowest was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen; the next half-a-crown, and the highest 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the soap was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross, and the essences 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—I never got more for them—that was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a gross—this receipt of July 26th is my writing; it repre<lb/>sents the price at 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—I received that money on that day; that was the price paid—this other receipt of August 24th is for essences which I sold to Chapman; it is very likely marked at more than 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen—I was paid 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. altogether—this other bill is for a gross of essences; a small amount of discount has been taken of—I did not receive 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that day; I only received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no discount on, the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made out the bill on one of Chapman's printed billheads—I saw Chapman that day, but I did not sell the essences to him; I left them in the shop—my conversation was with him—that was not my first transaction with him in essences—I proposed to make the receipt out for the full amount, taking off 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. discount—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be the gross price—I entered it as 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because I thought it better to put down the actual cost of the goods rather than the amount actually took, the invoice price—I thought it would be well to have the invoice price on the receipt instead of the sum paid me—Chapman was present when I made out this receipt; the whole of the writing is mine—he paid it, at least he gave me an order on the cashier for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this was neither the first nor the last transaction I had with him for essences—after I took him the first lot and made arrangements it was understood that I was to be paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen for essences, and I gave receipts for the amount agreed upon, but sometimes I took off more discount than at others from the invoice price—the receipts were to be made out at the invoice price, subject to discount, quite apart from the sum paid to me—on 26th August this receipt for six dozen of essences, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., is my writing—I was only paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. allowed was the same as was allowed on the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have given receipts for soap—I can't say that I put in the word "Soap," unless you show me the receipts—I can't say whether this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is for soap; I fancy not—my receipts for soap were made exactly under the same arrangement, and the same as to profits—this receipt for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is in my writing, but I did not receive it—it is on the back of one of Hancorn's cards, which I happened to have in my pocket—I think I got 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of that—when the goods were paid for Chapman brought me an order on the cashier except on the first occasion, which was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I got from a boy who gave evidence at the police-court—as to the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Mr. Chapman and I went to the desk, and he said to the cashier "There you are, Miss, pay that"—he took the whole amount and went to the provision counter, gave me about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and kept the balance—that was because the receipt was made out for the full amount—I took the goods to him because I knew he was a man who could do with that class of goods—I had a similar parcel of goods from Simmonds—after taking goods to Chapman I kept 10 per cent, as my share, and handed the balance to the party to whom it belonged, Simmonds, Winter, Thompson, Hancorn, or Littlewood—I never handed Whitehouse any money—I have sold goods on commission for six, seven, or eight years—I have taken goods to Chapman for some years—I sold him some goods, and then I left off going there, but the making out the receipts in this way commenced in July—as to the word "Lot," Mr. Chapman said something about his men thinking it rather</p>

               <p>suspicious that I should bring goods in that way, presuming they had came from sales, and then I put on the word "Lot" and a number, and laughed and said "You see these things have been bought under the hammer"—they had not been bought at any sale—I cannot remember whether he made any remark.</p>

Some time ago I had three large shops, and did business to the amount of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—Haydon knew me then—he has only sold me me one lot in recent years, coming to 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from Mr. Barringer, and on that account I paid 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and promised to pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week if he would give me time, as I had an execution in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. I never had any business transac<lb/>tions with Gosling—he lives in Peckham, and I have lived there—he bought a bedstead of me 12 months ago, that is the only transaction between us—I have reminded him of that since I have been in the dock—I frequented the Shades, but I never saw him there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. KEMP</hi>. I do not call myself a thief—Chapman knew that the goods were not going to be paid for—he did not know it from my general character—I did not tell him they were stolen goods, because I did not think they were, nor was there anything to lead him to suppose so—I have pleaded guilty to obtaining goods by fraud—I do not call it fraud, but not being in a position to obtain legal assistance I plead guilty—I am morally guilty—when I was taken in custody I did not apply to Chapman to assist me in my defence, I only asked him for bail—he did not decline to have anything to do with me; I sent for Mr. Dent for bail—I told Mr. Brighton that Mr. Chapman ought to have found me money or bail, but I did not say "I will swear anything so as to get him put away"—he is here; he did not bet me 2 to 1 that I should get off—I do not think I ever went to more than one sale in my life—I know Mr. Izzard, an auctioneer, I never attended his sales; I know him as a trade valuer—I said to the police that I was in the habit of attending sales to deceive them, and make them think these things had come under the hammer—I did not tell that to Chapman to deceive him, because he knew—he knew me carrying on business as a respectable man as Harper and Simon—I swear that the word "lot" was not on the first lot of boxes Chapman bought, nor did I tell him that I had bought them at sales—he said "Don't bring me any more of those goods, for I am sure they will never be paid for"—he said that from the price he was paying for them—I did not say "What do you mean by aspersing my character"—I was an honest man, not legally guilty, I fell in with anybody's views I was getting money out of—I should fall in with anybody's views who would lighten my punishment, that is only natural.</p>

When Hancorn opened his shop 21, Richardson Street, he told me he intended paying for the goods supplied to him by money coming from the executors of his mother's will—I was frequently there; he employed me to fetch bread from the baker's, and while I was there Whitehouse asked him to give orders for goods; I cannot say whether the terms were mentioned—he had a fair business for the size of the shop, and he might have done better if he had more money—I have brought him sweets in boxes from Messrs Pink, but I never saw a bottle of sweets in the shop—I was not regularly in his</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have been to Ledicott's and to the Antelope—Chapman said all through "You keep quiet and I will find you bail," and I dare say the police know the name of the bail—before my statement was made to the prosecution I was told distinctly that no bargain or terms could be made with me, and I must make my statement if they chose to call me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUTTON</hi>. I went to Ledicott to get refreshment—the ale was the attraction—I never saw him at the Shades.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Whitehouse, in his defence, stated that he had known Ledicott 20 years in the provision trade, and had taken hundreds of thousands of him, and when he gave him these orders they were on three months' credit, and that Haydon, who he had also known 20 years, gave him similar orders; that lie gave a similar order for soap, and May and he had tendered the money and it had been refused; that he had known Simmonds many years and believed he would pay for the goods he ordered, and that he only took one order from Gosling; that he believed Haickins to be an honest man, or he would not have trusted him; that he could have given Hancorn an order for </hi>16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. instead of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">if he wished to swindle his employers, and his commission would have been larger; that Osborne had a fine shop, and he took his order believing he would pay, and the same as to Brown and Wright, and lie contended that he ought not to, be held responsible, and stated that he gave information to Mr. Sardou, upon which he stopped one order, which was a proof that lie was acting honestly; he stated that he had never done business with Chapman, and never saw him till lie was in custody, and that he had reported himself regu<lb/>larly to the police since his liberation, and had always lived in one place, en<lb/>deavouring to get his living honestly.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">May, in his defence, said that he never described himself as a commercial traveler, and had had shops at Croydon, Mitcham, and Northfleet, after which he became agent to Van Hagen, of Rotterdam, and obtained orders from him which he gave to Hancorn, but afterwards revoked them; that lie believed Brown to be respectable as he was an old customer, and that after he had given other orders he could not obtain payment; that he met Whitehouse and told him lie was going into the hopping district, and offered to obtain orders for soap, and took samples there with him; lie complained that the perfumes were unsaleable, being so bad as to be worth less than the bottles, and stated that Stephenson's evidence was not to be trusted; he produced a large file of cheques to show the amount of business he had done.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Simmonds, in his defence, stated that Whitehouse called on him and he gave him a small order; that on 24th September Stephenson called on him and induced him to take a walk with him, saying that he wanted to call on White-house, which he did; and Whitehouse came out directly. Stephenson then went into a urinal, and Williamson came up and arrested him; he said that he went to the Shades to get orders on commission from Simon, who he met there, and that there was not a traveller in London better known them himself.</hi>

Sardou's prices at that time, not till I saw the price-list about a for-night ago; I did not know it on 26th July—when I paid over the money Simon made out the receipt and I paid him the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen; that was what Mr. Chapman told me to pay—I remember Simon bringing 12 dozen essences on 24th August; they are carried out at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot say that I handed him the money, but I was there; he delivered the things to me—I will not pledge my oath that they were not brought in a sack—I have bought goods from people who bring them themselves—it did not strike me that I was paying on 24th August 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen for the same things which I had purchased on 2nd August for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am 18 years old—I am not the principal storekeeper, Sarjeant is the principal, and I am second warehouseman—Mr. Chapman instructs me to check all goods—on 22nd August Simon came and brought six dozen of Mr. Sardou's essences—they are carried out at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen, but I did not notice that at the time, and it did not strike me as peculiar; my attention was not directed to the figures—nearly a cartload of goods were put into the van—it was a small pony cart—Simon had brought them all to the shop in about seven visits, during two months—I saw him with the pony at the door once, but whatever he brought he always brought it in his hand—I only remember his bringing goods in a sack once; I think that was when he brought the essences in a box—he</p>

I am warehouseman to Mr. Chapman, at 402, Edg<lb/>ware Road—I remember Simon calling with some soap some time before this prosecution was commenced—this lot of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; is the lot I finished checking—Arthur Thorpe was called away, and he called me up to finish taking these goods in, and I then paid Simon the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I swear that I paid him every penny of it; he gave me a receipt, and I took it up to the office and handed it to Mr. Chapman—I did not take much notice of it, but I am positive it was for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the desk, but they had not got money enough there, and I then went to Mr. Chapman and got it—I have not seen that receipt since—the goods which I took in stood in front of the grocery counter till the next morn<lb/>ing, and then they were packed away, and, as occasion required, the shop was replenished from the store.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Chapman was not in when Simons called, he waited till he came in; I cannot say how long he stayed—I never saw Simon come with the goods, but he was there when I was called up from the cellar about 4'clock, and Mr. Chapman came in between 4 and 5 o'clock, that is his usual time—Simon waited in the shop where the goods were; he did not go up to the office, to my knowledge, to see Mr. Chapman, nor do I remember Mr. Chapman coming down to see him, I could not say he did not—Mr. Chapman did not go to the desk with Simon and ordered them to pay the money; I went upstairs for it, I did not count it, I handed what money had been given to me over to Simon—this was about a fortnight or three weeks before Mr. Chapman's arrest—I did not see Simon write the receipt, I suppose it was already written—I paid him the money and he took the receipt out of his pocket and said "Here is the receipt," and I took it up and handed it to Mr. Chapman, and that is the last I saw of it.,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the amount of the receipt was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that I can swear to, that is all I looked at—Mr. Chapman arrived just as I came up from the cellar—it took about a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes to finish checking the goods, and then I went to the desk for the money, and there not being sufficient I went to Mr. Chapman—Simon at that time was in the shop—I could not say how much I handed to Simon, but I asked Mr. Chapman for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I know he gave me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, I can swear to that—I do not know what became of Simon after that, I went into the cellar then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, in partnership at 147, Cannon Street—I act in grocers' sales for the Official Receiver of the Bankruptcy Court—I have acted as grocers' agent eight or nine years, and have had experience with their books—I do not usually find a proper bought book—the receipts are kept on a file, and in making up the account I have had the use of the files—I sometimes sell salvage stock—I have known Chapman about five years, and have known him buy lots at my sales—the last time was about three years ago—he has generally been at our sales, but I only speak to one sale where he actually purchased—dealers make their money by purchasing at the sales, and taking them round and selling them retail—I know Furber; he used to attend sales frequently, but lately only once or twice—I know Brant; he attended sales frequently, and so did Haywood and Jesse Clark for many years, but not of late—I once saw a man outside one of my sales at a general store, who, I believe, was Brant, delivering goods to Chap<lb/>man—those men only buy when the goods go cheap—I have seen them go away with sacks and barrows, and with pony-carts—if the goods are not cleared we move them to some other auction, or sell them to some of the buyers at the same sale, and generally at considerably less price, and those goods could find their way into the market at all sorts of prices—we do not give invoices; we give a delivery order which the buyer leaves when he takes the goods—I have never heard of Sardou's essences before this case—these bottles would be very unsaleable; this is not full; it is what we term an ullage bottle; some has come out by evaporation or leakage—we might get half-a-crown a dozen for them at a sale, but it is more likely we should not get a bid—I never saw essences put up like these, and I have seen the principal makers—I have heard of Alexander's goods, but have not sold them to my knowledge—their name would not be mentioned in the catalogue—these perfumes, the sixpenny size, would fetch about half-a-crown a dozen by auction—the celebrated Johan Farinas would be sold at half-a-crown a dozen at an auction—this transparent soap is damaged; it is rather old, and has shrunk very much—I have been told that the quality affects the shrinking—they would fetch about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen undamaged, but we sold some at an auction at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a dozen, similar soap but different boxes, and damaged about the same—this universal soap is old and shrunk, and very damaged and faulty; it would fetch about 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound at a sale; there should be four of these to the pound—the quality is very bad—men who attend sales retail them to shops, such as Mr. Chapman's—I have Been goods removed in sacks.</p>

I am one of the firm of Yateman and Company, manufacturers of flavouring essences, in Denmark Street—we have supplied Chapman for about two years with essences and corn<lb/>flour and baking powder—the price of the essences as far as I recollect was 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he is a very keen buyer—these bottles of Sardou's are of an unusual shape, and entirely out of keeping—I never heard of Sardou's before this business—this is one of our 1 oz. bottles, liquid measurement—our 2 oz. bottle are 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by the list price for the very best—Sardou's is not clear, and from being put in a bottle like this leads me to think it is an indifferent article, and that it would not be saleable—we only sell to the West End trade; no small shops—Chapman also bought cornflour, baking powder, yeast powder, and a job lot of jellies—they had faded a good deal in colour, and we wanted to sell them to a man to whom the colour made no difference—he would push them and dispose of a large quantity, I thought, so I took them to him—there is nothing the matter with the quality of these jellies, but they have faded in gas light, and we could not send them to our customers.</p>
