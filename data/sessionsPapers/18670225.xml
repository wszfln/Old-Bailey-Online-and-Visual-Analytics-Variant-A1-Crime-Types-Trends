                  </hi>. In May last I was in the employment of Messrs. Taylor and Stokes, of 45, Friday Street, Cheapside, silk manu<lb/>facturers—I hare been in their employment a little over three years—I am just gone eighteen years of age—I know Brown, he is a marine store dealer in George Street, Langham Street, near Portland Place—Newman is a publicau, and keeps the Swan public-house, in George Street—I don't know what Cuthbert is or where he lives—I have known Brown some months, I first saw him at the Swan—about October or November last I sold him six or eight moire" antique dresses—on Thursday, 22nd November, I sold him two dresses, there were eleven yards in each dress; they were worth 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he had bought some of me before, and he asked me to get these for him—I got them from a cupboard of Messrs. Taylor and Stokes, I stole them—at the time I sold them to Brown I was in front of his shop—there were a lot of old things in the shop, bills about rags for 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and that sort of thing—I was just inside the shop—I believe Brown gave me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two dresses—I had first seen him in the morn<lb/>ing—he had asked me before to get him the two dresses and when I saw him I said, "I have got those two dresses of moire for you"—after he</p>

               <p>had paid me the money we went round to the Globe public-house: that was in the morning, when we had something to drink; and as we were coming home he asked me if I could get him eleven dresses, I told him I would let him know—I saw a bar-woman at the Globe; it was not there that he asked me, it was as we were coming along home back again he said ten or eleven dresses—I said eleven, because I got him eleven—I said I would let him know, and I did let him know next day, Friday; I said I could get them—I saw him on Friday morning at his own house, and in the evening at the Swan—I then told him I would get them, and he told me to bring them at half-past two next day, Saturday—I don't think any price was mentioned by Brown to me at that time—on the Saturday I took the eleven dresses from Messrs. Taylor and Stokes—I went there at half-past eight in the morning; my proper time was nine o'clock—Mrs. Woolner, the housekeeper, opened the door to me—I had to get the keys from her—I took the eleven dresses a little after half-past eight, I took them to the Golden Last public-house, in Cannon Street—I left no one in the warehouse when I came out—I locked the door and took the keys up again to the housekeeper—the parcel I left at the Golden Last was packed in brown paper—the colours were packed in sheets of brown paper, and then wrapped up in another parcel of brown paper—there were three dresses of black, three of brown, three of bine, and two of violet—I took them from a large quantity in the warehouse—I left them with the bar-woman at the Golden Last, and went back to the warehouse—I went again to the Golden Last about one or a little after, and took away the parcel and took it to the Portland Stores, at the corner of Marylebone Street and George Street—I left it there about half-past one or twenty minutes to two till I called for it—I then went to see if Brown was in—I went to his house, he was not in; I heard that I should see him in the evening at the Swan, about six or seven—I went there about five—after a time Brown came in, and went down to the skittle ground—I went there and saw him; there were other persons there, but neither of the other prisoners—I said to Brown, "I have got these moires for you"—he said, "Well, I have not got the money now; I shall see you bye and bye"—he was to give me about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dress, I put it down on a piece of paper for him; that was arranged on the Friday evenig, I be<lb/>lieve—I left the paper with brown—I did not stop long in the skittle ground—I went up stairs, and had a game of bagatelle—I saw Brown occasionally during the evening—before seven was the time I saw him and spoke to him—he said, "I have been disappointed, I cannot get any money to buy these moires, but I have a man here that will buy them, and that will do as well, I suppose"—he pointed to Cuthbert—at that time the dresses were at the Portland Stores—Brown and Cuthbert had been speaking together before; and when Brown said, "Here is a man, that will do as well," pointing to Cuthbert, Brown asked me to get the goods, and took them into the back kitchen of the Swan—I did so, and Brown brought Cuthbert out there; Brown did not remain, he went away, leaving Cuthbert with me—he first said, "Is that the parcel?"—I said, "Yes"—I was going to undo it—he said, "You need not undo it, I will take your word for what is in it"—I did not undo it, he did not see the inside—I told him what there was, eleven dresses—I told him there were three dresses of black, three dresses of brown, three of blue, and two of violet moire antique, making eleven in all—he then said, "How much do you want for them?"—I said, "16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the lot;" that would be 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dress—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250005"/>
               <p>he then said, "I suppose you will take 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them"—he made me that offer without seeing them, he took my word; at least, I suppose somebody had told him before—when he offered me 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I said I would take it—he then said he had not got the money with him, but he daresay he could borrow it of Mr. Newman; "at all events," he said, "I can borrow 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him; if you will write me out a receipt for the money, I will get it from Mr. Newman, and I will give you an I O U for the remainder"—he went to Newman at the bar, and said, "Lend me a tenner, will you, Bill?"—he said, "I have not got it, but I can spare you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if that will do"—he asked me if I would take the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and have the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Monday between six and eight—I said yes, after a little while—Newman gave Cathbert 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Cuthbert wrote out a receipt for a stamp, and signed for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the receipt—it is Cuthbert's writing, and this is my signature—(<hi rend="italic">read;</hi> "London, November 25th, 1866. Received of Mr. Cuth<lb/>bert the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of silk received. <hi rend="smallCaps">G. MORELL</hi>.") I saw Cuthbert write that, and I stamped and signed it; I then handed it to Cuthbert, and he gave me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he brought the parcel from the back kitchen and handed it over to Mr. Newman, and he put it behind the bar—I then went away—I saw Cuthbert again on the Monday between six and ten at the Swan—on the Sunday I saw my master, Mr. Taylor—I was taken by him to the house of his brother—on the Monday evening following, close upon eight, I went to the Swan, and he was gone—I saw Newman, he asked a barman or potman called Tom to fetch up a note that Cuthbert had left for me; he brought it to me—I handed it to one of the detectives almost directly, when I left the Swan—I read it and gave it to the detective—I went to Wormwood Street at eleven next morning, at the corner of Bishopsgate Street, and there met Cuthbtrt—I first spoke to him, and he said, "I have not got the money for you, but I shall see you this evening at the Swan—I said, "Can't I meet you at your house or somewhere else? I don't like always going to the Swan"—he said no—he asked me if I would have a glass of something to drink, and we went into a public-house at the corner of Wormwood Street and Bishops<lb/>gate Street, and the police came and took him into custody—when Cuth<lb/>bert and I were in the back kitchen with the dresses on the Saturday he did not ask where I got them from, he only said, "I do not wish every<lb/>body to know my business outside, I want it kept dark"—Cuthbert was alone with me at that time—I said, "Nobody knows anything about it but Brown and you"'—he said, "All right"—I once sold Newman two dresses, that was some time before the eleven dresses.</p>

               <p>out—I did not refer to it to see the price which the articles came to—I did not have the prices marked down—I don't recollect referring to the book—I won't swear I did not—I did not, when Brown was doubtful, try to per<lb/>suade him—he never was doubtful—I have not said that I did try to persuade him—I meant to say, if he appeared doubtful I should have tried to convince him it was all right, but he did not appear doubtful in anything—I meant that he should not suspect I had got the things wrongly—if it had been necessary to produce the book I should have done so—I might have offered to write Brown out an invoice if he wished it—I don't believe he ever asked me for one—I did not say, "You may have an invoice if you like, I have only got to go to my principal for it—I might have offered an invoice—if I had I should have written it out for him—nothing was said about It—I never said anything to Brown about an invoice—I don't recollect ever offering to write him out an invoice—I won't swear I did not—I did not sell any articles with the authority and on the behalf of Mr. Cushway, the foreman of Messrs. Taylor—I have bought things of Cush<lb/>way and sold them again on my own behalf—I did not sell any silk that I bought of Cushway—I did not sell anything for him on commission—he asked me a price—I paid him the price and then put something on and sold them for myself—that was the way we did business—the things I sold were at the Swan, and sold about the neighbourhood, and sold at their proper value—I never said I was selling those goods on commission—I did not describe myself as a commissiou agent—you have asked me that several times before, and I have always said I never recollected saying to anybody that I was a commission agent—I might have said I got something on the goods I sold—that is much the same thing—I don't believe I ever said I was a commission agent—I don't know anybody of the name of Reeves—I know the Portland Stores—a Miss Botwood, the daughter or sister of the former proprietor, was going to buy a shawl—I offered it to her—she de<lb/>clined to have it—I did not tell her I was selling on commission—I told her I had got out several on sale or return—I told her I should get a trifle on them, that she could buy cheaper than at a shop, because I had not to pay taxes—I don't recollect saying anything to her about silk—I might have offered her a pattern—I did not tell her the goods I had to dispose of were part of an old stock—I never said so to any one about the shawls—I might have said so about the satins—I sold some satins to Sylvester—I have not said so on other occasions—I might have said they could get them cheaper than going to a house—I know Shakespeare—he is a fret cutter in Nassau Street—he was before the Magistrate as a witness for the prosecution—I would not swear that I did not state in his presence that I sold silk on commission, but I believe I did not, but if anybody said I did I would not wear I did not—it is possible, but not probable—I know Thomas Sanderson—he has charge of the Portland Stores, a beer shop—I never offered him any silks for sale—I asked him at one time if he would buy any, and he said no—I did not tell him I was a commission agent, or anything to that effect—I said I could get them for him—I said nothing to him about having to make up an account monthly, or anything about my accounts—I remember Sylvester's arrest—I did not at that time go to Sanderson's in false whiskers and moustache—I went to the Swan so—I don't know why—I had had too much to drink that day—I did not sit down—I stood there, and went out almost directly—I did not go into the back kitchen then—I could not be in the house without looking at the bar—I had no motive for going there—did not know what I was doing</p>

BELEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at those pieces of silk (<hi rend="italic">producing some</hi>); are those the kind of things you call "patterns?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they are the weaver's patterns, with the stripes on each side; they had not been cut off a dress—they are useless in the warehouse, they would make up into a tie—those are the things I had my master's permission to take some of—I don't know how many of them I sold—I gave away a great many more than I sold—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them—I include in the sixteen or seventeen persons to whom I sold things those to whom I sold these patterns; they were mostly young men about my own age—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are moire antique dresses of the same kind that I took and sold, the same sort as the eleven dresses—I stole some thirty dresses altogether—the satins were folded in handkerchiefs—they were not severed; they could be made into dresses—I should say I took from fifteen to twenty dozen of those—Edwards had two or three of those to sell; with that exception no one but Sylvester and the prisoners had any satins or silks—the highest price I got for the silk was from Sylvester, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one dress—the first trans<lb/>action with Brown was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and then 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Newman gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for two dresses; they were not quite so rich as those I sold to Brown—I had about half a dozen shirts from Cushway to sell, and two or three shawls at from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was what I gave for them—I sold two or three; I don't remember how many—I always paid Cushway for them before I took them away—the shirts were 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece; and there was a knitted Cardigan jacket at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not sell any sheets; I had some—I made about 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. profit on the sixteen or seventeen trans<lb/>actions</p>

               <p>with those goods that I had on sale or return, I mean on the lot—I never sold as much as 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth to any one person—I have men<lb/>tioned all the transactions I had in reference to the sale of goods—the excuse I made to the housekeeper for being at the warehouse so early in the morning was, that I had to go and see somebody off by the railway by an early train, and then I went there afterwards—whoever was there first, Cushway or me, or any other, had the keys—I represented that the satins Sylvester bought were part of an old stock, not the moire antiques; any one could see they were new.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it not usual in selling old stock to sell at a large discount from the wholesale price? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I don't know; not when goods are of any value—in this case the old stock was worth a good deal more than new, because silk had risen a good deal—I did not represent to the prisonen that I was a commission agent, or that I had these or any other goods on sale or return—I did not represent that these were job lots.</p>

Morell—I had a note which Morell gave me—I believe I gave it back to him, but I would not be positive—I have not searched for it—after taking Cuthbert into custody I went to Newman's house on that same day—I told him I was a police constable, and that I came to charge him with receiving a parcel of silk last Saturday night from a young man named Morell—he said, "What do you mean?

I am principal clerk and cashier to Mr. George Evans, a needle and hatband manufacturer in Cannon Street—the prisoner has been in his service about six years, first as a cutter—he was afterwards ap<lb/>pointed town traveller, his duties were to solicit orders and collect moneys—he was paid wholly by a commission after 6th September; before that he had a salary—the commission varied according to the articles he sold, 10, 12 1/2, and 15 per cent.—he was paid his commission at the end of each week, if he wished it; I have the books here—he did not pay me these three sums or account for them—the last day I saw him was 5th January, and the last payment I made to him on commission was on 1st December.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250026"/>
               <p>as the terms would be cash—I said, as the order would be about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I should require a reference, and ho then gave me as a reference the Reverend Alfred Stokes, the Rectory, Hatfield—I made a memo<lb/>randum of it at the time—I showed him some designs of couches and chairs, and he chose them, and he also made some alterations in the car<lb/>tains—he was alone on that occasion—he then left—I went to the station, for the purpose of going to town to go to Hatfield, I overtook the pri<lb/>soner on the way and got into the same carriage with him—on the way I took out a time-table and opened it for the Great Northern, and I asked him if he knew Welling, near Hatfield—he said, "No;" and he said the Hatfield he had given me was not that Hatfield; it was Hat<lb/>field, near Doncaster, and I made a note of that in my pocket-book—when I came to town I wrote a letter, directed to the Reverend Alfred Stokes, the Rectory, Hatfield, near Doncaster, and posted it at the General Post Office—on the 23rd I received an answer—I believed it to be true, and that it came from the Rev. Alfred Stokes—after receiving that letter I proceeded to execute the order at once—I had seen Lawrence on 21st or 22nd at the house in Gresham Road with the prisoner—Lawrence spoke about my letters, and said he thought I was rather sharp in writing respecting the reference, as I might have offended many gentle<lb/>men, the terms being cash, and they would come down and settle as soon as the order was completed, which would be on the 24th—he spoke then of being a large landowner in the north of England, also that he was trustee of Mrs. Coleman, and that she would come into a large fortune; he spoke to Coleman about altering the stone staircase at the side of the house, and also about having a coach-house and stable built—I saw Sophia Knott; she came to Staines about the 20th or 21st, and I saw her most days after that until the 28th, she was acting as servant; she came down to look after the house, light fires, and sweep the house and look after the furni<lb/>ture—on Monday, the 24th, Lawrence came to look over the furniture; Coleman was not with him then—on Wednesday, 26th December, Cole<lb/>man introduced me to a lady as Mrs. Coleman—she came down to look at the furniture, and she seemed satisfied with it—part of it had then been moved into the house in Gresham Road; some was moved in on 24th, some on 26th, and we finished moving in on 28th—a workman, named Alexander, was attending to my business—by the 28th about 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of furniture was delivered—on the 29th, in consequence of information, I went there and found all my furniture gone, and the people as well—I at once com<lb/>municated with the police—on 31st January I received a telegram, and went with the police to 2, Blantyre Street, Chelsea—I went in and there saw Sophia Knott; she was then acting, not as servant, but more as the lady of the house, she had all the keys of the house, and was dressed as the mistress, in a silk dress, a gold chain, and jewellery; she acted the part of mistress, she showed us over the house, and showed us the furniture—Mrs. Coleman had just been confined—I identified part of the furniture as mine, I should think 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—Knott pointed out the different articles, and said, "This is your furniture," and "That is your bed," and so on—while I was there the prisoner came in, about eleven at night, or half-past, I was in the parlour—the sergeant asked me if that was William Coleman—I said, "Yes"—he said his name was Wood—I am quite sure he is the man that ordered the furniture of me—I gave hin into custody—I did not give his wife into custody—I don't know what became of Sophia Knott, she was in the house all the while we were there;</p>

               <p>I don't know what became of her afterwards—on that same day, 31st January, I went to the house of a furniture dealer at Chelsea, named West, and saw about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of my furniture that I had supplied to the house at Staines; that remains there now—the police took possession of that in Blantyre Street—that does not make up all the furniture I supplied, the damask curtains were gone and two or three small things.</p>

I have been in England ten months the last time—I was an officer of the <hi rend="italic">gens d'armes du Papa at</hi> Rome—I have known Ciocci four months, but I used to know him pre<lb/>viously—I never knew him abroad—I never had any relations with him till four months before this affair—I met him in Tottenham Court Road—I was then in queer circumstances—I told him I had no occupation, and he said it would be a very difficult thing for me to find a situation in England, not knowing the English language—he gave me his address, 7, Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road—we did not go anywhere then, but the day afterwards we went to a public-house, and he said that there would be a thing to do in the house of an Italian gentleman, and there would be found several precious stones and cameos—he gave me the address on a piece of paper, which I cannot find—it was "M. Votieri, 24, Upper Park Street," and also the address of M. Soldi, somewhere in the Blackfriars Road, which I have forgotten—he told me that I might do the thing, and that I should take myself out of the position in which I was then—he said I was to enter the house, knock at the door, and ask for M. Votieri; and if the answer was that he was not at home we were to ask to be permitted</p>

               <p>o write a message, and after we were in we were to tie the servant, and on; of the others was to open the door, for the third person, who was outside, in go up stairs, and that up stairs, in the back room, was the studio of M. Votieri, where we should find the cameos, and all the utensils and tools after that we were to go into the front room, M. Votieri's bedroom, and under the bed was a trunk, inside of which we should find some jewellery, and that if we searched the books we should find some bank notes of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and then we were to go into the room on the third floor, occupied by the daughter of M. Votieri, and take all the small jewellery belonging to her—I told him it was a thing I could not undertake to do by myself, and he said that I was to try to find some audacious or courageous person; he pointed out a person named Leoni, but said that I was not to employ him, as he was known to the police—I said that I did not know where to find, one, and during a month we used to meet very often, and he used to ask me whether I had found anybody who would undertake it—some time afterwards I was going up Charles Street, and saw a small shop, at the door of which were Galioni and Rossi talking together in Italian, I believe—Rossi is a barber, and Galioni a shoemaker—I went in when Rossi left, had my shoes cleaned, and told Galioni I was an Italian from Rome—he knew nothing then—I afterwards saw Ciocci, and mentioned that I had had a conversation with Galioni—he told me that Galioni would be a good man for undertaking the business—I told Galioni that I remem<lb/>bered his name when I was in the <hi rend="italic">gens d'armes</hi>—I ascertained that he had been in prison, and mentioned that to Ciocci, who said that he was the man who should do for him—Ciocci went to Galioni's and spoke to him; I saw him there the day after—he told me that he took Galioni a pair of boots, but I saw nothing—I cannot say how long he remained at Galioni's, as I went out—I went to Galioni's the same evening, and saw Ciocci there, and after that he used to go there now and then, and then he used to meet at Barriloni's, in Brook's Market, Leather Lane, a very short distance off—I first saw Decola at Galioni's house; that might be two or three days after I saw Galioni—he was there when Ciocci went, and Galioni spoke to him—they continued meeting in that way till the last day of the busi<lb/>ness—the first time I met Galioni was three months before the robbery—his wife, I believe, lived with him; I only know her Christian name, Martha—she has been present when we were all four there—I have seen Rossi, the barber, at Galioni's door—on the day of the robbery Decola, Galioni, Ciocci, the wife, and myself were there, and I believe the wife went and borrowed a saucepan to cook some maccaroni—after eating it we talked about the robbery; it was first said that we were to ascertain whether M. Votieri was out, and if he was out Ciocci said we were to ask to be allowed to write a message to him—I was to be the person to knock at the door—Decola was to go in with me, and Galioni was to remain outside—we agreed not to see each other for four days after the robbery—we hod agreed the day before, at the public-house, that the time to commit the robbery was about half-past five or six in the evening—I had been to Barriloni's that day, before I went to the public-house—on the same day Decola went to fetch a bag to put the things in; Galioni was to take it to Park Street—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sort of bag—when we had made these arrangements I started by myself and Decola to Isling<lb/>ton, to Upper Park Street, and we watched till M. Votieri and the family came out of the house, at about half-past six, and after they came out Galioni arrived, and after that we knocked at the door—a boy answered it and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250033"/>
               <p>was asked him whether M. Votieri was in; the answer was, "No;" Decola said that he was desirous of writing a message, and the boy admitted us into the saloon; he was then gagged, I opened the door, and Galioni came In and went up stairs—I threw a stone down and made a signal to the police, who came and took Decola and Galioni on the premises—when Galioni came in I went outside the house and held the door—this was on Wednesday—I had communicated with M. Votieri the Saturday before; that was the first time I had given any information to him or to the police—I again communicated to M. Votieri the day for which the robbery was agreed upon, and was aware when I went there that I should find the police on the premises—I knew that M. Votieri was going out that night, and Ciocci knew it also—I have seen Rossi at Barriloni's when I have been there, he was there the night before the robbery—I do not remember whether Martha came to Barriloni's that evening, but she has eome to fetch Galioni at times when we have all been together.</p>

Votieri on the Saturday before that there was a conspiracy concocted to rob the house—I told him that he had a great enemy—he told me that it could only be Bendi or Ciocci, and then I said that it was Ciocci—he said that it was not marvel<lb/>lous for him to do this, as he had committed other misdeeds—he did not say that he should be very glad to punish Ciocci—he told me be should be very glad if he could have him taken by the police—he made no arrange<lb/>ments for that purpose—it was not by nis desire that I went on with the robbery, but he knew it because we used to watch nearly every night—he told me to acquaint him in case the robbery should be committed—I had known Rossi some time, and also Galioni—I deny that it was stolen from Victoria Station; I had it from a man named Brentini, who is in London—the first time I heard of it being stolen was at Clerkenwell Police-court—I did not take it to Rossi's—I did not sell some shirts or any of the things to Rossi, or to Decola—I do not Know the contents of it, because when I had it it was empty—I am acquainted with these little documents (<hi rend="italic">four bills</hi>)—they went through my hands—I cannot say that they are forged—I have been examined before—I stated that Rotini gave them to me—I found out fifteen days afterwards that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250034"/>
               <p>they were forgeries—I did not after that obtain money on them; it was a loan—I did not leave them as security—Jacomeli gave me some money, and I left the bills with him one evening because I was a little inebri<lb/>ated—he gave me the money before I left the bills—I cannot say the date that I left them—I did not know they were false, but I had some suspicion that there was something, otherwise he would not haye left them with me—I had the money before that—I left them after this little suspicion entered my mind—there is none of my writing on the back of these bills—I do not know, this "Saffi"—it is an imitation of my writ<lb/>ing—this is one of the papers that I left at Jacomeli's—this writing was on it at the time—I did not represent to Jacomeli that I was Count de Saffi's nephew—I do not know a Count de Saffi, and have not been to his house—I have been to Signor Saffi's—I did not represent myself to be Signor Saffi's nephew, or that that was the endorsement of Signor Saffi—I never said anything—I did not represent that Signor Saffi had given me documents payable to his order—to tell you the truth, I cannot say exactly that there was all this writing on it at the time I left it it Jacomeli's—this country credit was also among the documents I handed over to the gentleman from whom I had the money—I obtained it from Rotini, for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., payable by the Union Bank of London—these are papers that are worth nothing—I found that it was valueless when I went to the Union Bank, and saw plenty of similar papers on the ground—I never got any money on this.</p>

You must come your<lb/>self. This person writing to you would like to help your husband."—I did not tell her to write the last words, "to help your husband"—I cannot read English—the girl might have misunderstood me, and might have written them—I told her to add, "My respects send by bearer"—she is an Englishwoman—I did my best to make myself understood—we were together some time, and we spoke to each other every day in my house—she visits me, but not now, because she is ill—she has been living with me two or three weeks in her own place—after this letter was written I sent it by a man to Covent Garden—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to carry it—I do not know his name—I found him near Newport Market, at the corner—he was one of those shoeblacks who speak Italian—I sent it the day after or a day or two after Ciocci was examined at the police-court—he came out on bail—I do not know of any person going on the part of Votieri to visit Galioni in Newgate.</p>

I live at 24, Upper Park Street, Barnsbury Road—I have known Ciocci about four years—he is married to a daughter of a Mr. Berni, whose executor I am—I have had occasion to see Ciocci several times on business matters—Mr. Soldi is also an executor—he lives in Stamford Street, Blackfriars—Ciocci has been at my house several, times, and in all the rooms—I keep my cameos and stones in my bedroom, and he saw them there once—there was a dispute about some property between Ciocci and me, in consequence of which Chancery proceedings have been taken—my daughter lives in my house, and has certain jewel<lb/>lery, and I have jewellery also—on 19th January I received information from D'Angelio—I had never seen him before—he called on me again after that, and in consequence of his information I gave notice to the police, both on 19th and 23rd January—on 23rd January, about six o'clock, I left the house with my wife and daughter, leaving Stammers and two police officers in the kitchen—the boy Morgan was also left there, but nobody else—I afterwards found Galioni and Decola in custody—I had never seen them before—Ciocci has used threats to me; he said that he wanted to kill me—he said something to Soldi, but not in my presence.</p>

               <p>custody he was taken before a police inspector, who refused to take the charge—he was taken again some days afterwards and taken before a Magistrate—D'Angelio was not called then, and Ciocci was discharged—a warrant was afterwards applied for—he was again taken in custody, and D'Angelio turned up and was examined—I did not employ a lawyer till the third time—I employed Mr. Wakeling the second time, but I did not tell him about D'Angelio, because I thought he was gone; but he afterwards wrote me two letters, which I have not got—I gave them to my friend Soldi—I employed Mr. Wontner on the third occasion.</p>

Votieri was in, and I said, "No"—I let them into the parlour, and got a pen and ink, as Decola said he wanted to write a message—Decola then took me and sat me down in a chair, and then I saw Galioni pass the parlour door with a bag in his hand—D'Angelio had then gone out—Galioni went up stairs—I saw the police strike Decola because he tried to get away—they took them in custody—my arms had been tied, but Dutton loosed me—after the other prisonen were taken to the station I opened the door and saw a horse and cart there, and Ciocci walking along past the door about two yards from me, he asked me what was the matter—it was then about five minutes past seven—I described him to the police.</p>

I said, "Yee"—there was never a trunk there, only this bag—D'Angelio never brought a trunk there; I am out sometimes, but I never saw one there—I did not see a trunk go from our house to Rossi's—I did not see Galioni take a trunk away.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Whittlesea, in Cambridggeshire, and am a solictor—my London agents are Messrs. Nethersole and Speechly—for the last two years I have been working a brickyard, which has been managed by my foreman—about the 13th November I received a letter, in consequence of which I came to the Charing Cross Hotel—on the 26tb November this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was given to me there by the porter—I had previously received one like it in the letter—when the porter gave me the card I saw the defendant—he said, "Mr. Bradshaw"—I asked him if he had seen the bricks—I bad sent him some samples—he said he had only seen two of each sort, but they were both alike, and there was no pretence for making a difference in the price—we afterwards fixed upon a price, which was 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per thousand, and he was to pay<lb/>the carriage—he said he was a man of business, and it was his practice to pay on the first of each month for goods delivered, and he asked me whe<lb/>ther he should send me a cheque on the 1st of December for the few bricks I was going to let him have—I said, "As the amount would be so small, it had better stand over till the next month"—I then told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250041"/>
               <p>him I should require references—he said, "Of course; I shall be able to give you very satisfactory ones, one of them a gentleman with whom I have done a large amount of business, and who was carrying on a brickyard under circumstances similar to your own, and whom I have paid many hundreds of pounds"—I told him I was a solicitor—after that interview bricks were sent to the defendant almost daily, amounting in all to 110,000—that was from the 28th November till the 12th December—after I received the letter dated 10th December I wrote to Mr. Charles Boss, of 119, Englefield Road, and also to Mr. John Layland, of 14, De Beauvoir Road, Kingsland—in the course of post I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Ross in reply—I did not get a reply from Mr. Lay<lb/>land—I received a contract note from the prisoner in a letter dated the 26th November—it was in duplicate—I signed them both, and sent one back to the prisoner, at 1, Regent's Canal Basin, Limehouse—I had sent the prisoner 104,000 bricks before he sent me the references, and after<lb/>wards I sent him 6000 more—what induced me to part with the bricks was, that I believed the prisoner to be a respectable man, carrying on a legitimate business as described, and in the manner named in his cards, and at the addresses in the lithographed circulars—after I received the answer from Ross I caused further inquiries to be made, and in conse<lb/>quence of those inquiries I did not supply the prisoner with any more goods—an appointment was made to meet the prisoner at the office of my London agents on the Saturday before Christmas Day—he attended, and another appointment was made for the following Monday, which he did not attend—between the Saturday and Monday I had caused farther in<lb/>quiries to be made—I did not see anything more of the prisoner until he was in custody—I have received no money from him in respect of the bricks—I have never seen Charles Ross.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the interview at the Charing Cross Hotel, where do you say the prisoner said he was carrying on his business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> During the conversation he said he had just driven up from his place of business at Stepney, and he wished he could let me see it—his card says that his place of business is "1, Regent's Canal Basin, near Stepney Railway"—there was not much dispute about the price—he first offered me one price and then another—I asked him what quantity he wanted, and he said he could get rid of any amount as commission agent—I won't swear that he did not offer to pay me for any bricks that had been sent up—I won't swear either way—I spoke first about references—he did not say anything about Five Bells Wharf then, but he did at the interview at Messrs. Nethersole and Speechly's office—I have no doubt that Five Bells Wharf being on his card had something to do with my sending him goods—I have not made inquiries about Ross and Layland personally—I have been to, 1, Regent's Canal Basin, but not to Five Bells Wharf—I am not aware that it is the custom of people who have goods landed at a certain wharf to put the name of that wharf on their card—I should not do such a thing myself—I think I wrote to Mr. Ross on the 11th December, and I received this letter in reply:—"Sir,—Your letter is to hand, and I do not hesitate to say that I should not be afraid to trust the firm you mention for the amount you name. I have done a considerable trade with them, and have always found them prompt." I believed the prisoner was a commission agent for every description of goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the prisoner's service—before that I was in the service of Messrs. Williams, in the Kent Road, for some time—after I left Williams I was out of employment about a fortnight, and then I went into the prisoner's service as clerk—I believe that was about three months before Christmas, and I continued in his service until the first week in the new year—I attended at the office, 1, Regent's Canal Basin—I was there almost every day—the prisoner came there, sometimes every other day, and sometimes every day—Mr. Puttock entered his service after I did—I introduced him to the prisoner—his duties were out-door—I know nothing of Mr. Charles Ross, and have never seen him—the prisoner told me he did business with Ross, and he gave me his name to give as reference, and his address was 119, Englefield Road, Essex Road—he told me he had bought bricks and timber of him—I understood him to say he was a commission agent—I have seen nothing of a man named Layland, but the prisoner also described him to me as a commission agent, and that I was to give him as a reference—I know a person of the name of Lowe, as the prisoner's father-in-law—I have never seen him at the office, but I have very often at the prisoner's house—during the time I was at Regent's Canal Basin no goods came there, but some bricks went through the docks—a few samples of bricks, iron, and different things used to come;—also samples of glue, sandpaper, and geese—five geese came at Christmas—there were some chains from Mr. Edges, <hi rend="italic">but no</hi> tiles, slates, sash-weights, grease, stair-rods, or jewellery—I kept a petty cash-book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it dates from the 26th of November, 1866, down to 9th January, 1867—there were other payments made besides those put down here—this book is only for small office expenses—I made no entries at all of other payments—I took the receipts to the prisoner—I cannot say how much I paid—I remember paying one account, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think that was for barge dues—I did not pay anything for goods, as I had nothing to do with that—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all in my hand<lb/>writing—I wrote them by the prisoner's directions—the majority of the letters in this letter-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are also in my handwriting—they are press copies of original letters written by me—this contract was written by me—I sent the original to Mr. Peed, by direction of the prisoner—this list of "matters in hand" is not in my handwriting, but Mr. Puttock's—I supplied the materials from which it was written on the 17th December—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are in my handwriting—I could not swear to the prisoner's writing—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is written on the same paper as the others, and it has the lithographed heading—I cannot say whether it is in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">A letter, dated the 15th November, from the prisoner to the prosecutor, was read; also one dated the 19th; also one of the 29th, a portion of which was as follows:</hi>—"On Mr. Bradshaw's return from Manchester he will take the first opportunity of replying to the other portion of your letter.)" The other portion of your letter" alluded to there, was as to references—I did not know that the prisoner was in Manchester—I had not seen him for two days. (<hi rend="italic">A letter of the 10th December from the prisoner to the prosecutor, was read, in which the names of Charles Ross, of 119, Englefield Road, and John Layland, of 14, De Beauvoir Road were given as references, with whom the prisoner stated he did a large amount of business. Several other letters were read, among them a letter to Messrs. Edge and Co., in which the names of Charles Ross and John Layland were given as references.</hi>) Messrs. Edge and Co. are the people from whom we had the chain—I do not know whether that was ever paid for. (<hi rend="italic">Two other</hi>

Andrews and Taylor, and the other to George Penn, in which the names of Ross and Lay<lb/>land were given as references, were read.</hi>) This is, I believe, the original list of "matters in hand"—it is a list of correspondence standing over—we went through the letter-book, and all correspondence that was open we put down—where contracts were open or negotiations were going on they were not in reference to any sale of goods by the prisoner to any one—I do not think there is any reference in the letter-book to any sale of goods by the prisoner—there were no ledgers or day-books kept at Regent's Canal Basin—no books at all, excepting the letter-book and a small book I entered invoices in—I have not got that—I have not seen it since I left.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 58 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>). I was employed in this case previously to the Saturday before Christmas Day—on the Saturday I went to Messrs. Nethersole and Speechly's office, for the purpose of seeing a person that was coming there—the prisoner came—he was told that I was an officer—Mr. Peed was present—he was asked whether he had any objection to answer some questions—he said, "No"—on the Monday a warrant was granted, and I went to the office at Regent's Canal Basin about twenty times; I also went to the house at Pigott Street, but I was unable to ascertain where he was until the 30th January, when I found him in Randolph Street, Camden Town, under the name of Sibley—I found a letter-book there—everything I found I have given up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Torquay, and am the brother of Miss Albinia Martina Dendy—my father died in April, 1846—after that time my sister Albinia continued to live with my mother till about the year 1850—about that time she went to live at the defendant's, at Rose Cottage, Feltham—my mother died in September, 1858; she had been living at a house called the Hollys, at Feltham—I had a sister named Ann Alicia Julia—shortly after my mother's death, in September, 1858, she went to live at Rose Cottage, and she moved the furniture that had belonged to my mother, or the greater portion of it, to Rose Cottage, and that was her permanent residence up to the time of her death, on 19th February, 1866—up to that time, and up to January in the present year, my sister Albinia had continued to live at Rose Cottage—when she first went to live at the defendant's his wife was alive; she died in March, 1865—the defendant had been a footman in my father's service, and some time after my father's death he acted as coachman to my mother—his wife was also a servant in my father's family; she was housekeeper and nurse—up to February, 1866, when my sister Ann Alicia died, I did not interfere in any way with the arrangements under which the defendant had charge of my sister; after her death I saw him with regard to my sister Albinia the alleged lunatic—I first saw him on the same night that I received the intelligence of the death of my other sister, but I had no conversation with him on the subject of any pecuniary arrangement; it was on 5th April, 1866, that I first spoke to him about the arrangement with regard to my sister; I saw him at his cottage, I paid him the arrears that were then due to</p>

               <p>him for the maintenance of my sister Albinia, which sums had been paid at the rate of 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum (namely, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum under my mother's will, and 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum), and, in consequence of his representing to me that since the death of his wife he could not afford to keep her with so small a payment, and that he wished to have 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year paid to him, I under<lb/>took to pay him that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and it was paid up to the removal of my sister on 7th January last—nothing was said specially about its in<lb/>cluding medical attendance, although I believe the 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had included it—since my sister's removal I have had a charge of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. sent in for medical attendance—I always considered my sister Albinia to be imbecile as far back as I can remember; she never could converse or utter a sentence, and she has since been certified to be of unsound mind—she was decidedly not able to manage her own affairs.</p>

Q.</hi> I understand you are a member of the legal pro<lb/>fession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have practised as a conveyancer—I am a barrister—my sister Albinia is one year younger than myself—the defendant and his wife were not in my father's service as far back as I can remember—his wife came at a period within my recollection; I can't exactly say when—she was nurse to my sister Ann Alicia from her infancy—Alicia was three years younger than Albinia, she was forty-two when she died—the defendant was for a short time in business for himself, and at a later period he came back to the family, and remained till my father's death—after his death my mother went to live first at Southend and then at Feltham—I believe my mother and my two sisters lived for two or three months at Rose Cottage before they could find a place suitable for them—I never saw them there, but I have no doubt about it; that was in 1855—the Hollys was about 300 yards from Rose Cottage—after my mother's death my sister Alicia went to reside at Rose Cottage with her sister, and remained there till she died, by reason of an accident last year—my mother's will contained this request:—"I declare it to be my wish that Albinia should remain with the said Mary Ann Harris as long as the said Mary Ann Harris shall live"—a niece of the defendant, named Emma Harris, lived with him, and acted as assistant or servant, and attended on my sister until her removal—I have not given any information at all to the Lunacy Commissioners about my sister being under the care of the de<lb/>fendant—I engaged Dr. Tuke to go and visit my sister, with a view to her removal—that was on the 23rd December, 1866—I did not take any other medical man to see her previous to that—I saw Mr. Kingsford, who was in attendance upon her—my mother's will had been proved at the time I went to see my sister Alicia, on receiving the telegram about the accident—after Alicia's death a will of hers was handed to me by Mr. Harris, of 1857—by that will I inherited the freehold property—in April, 1866, another will, dated 1859, was alleged to have been discovered, and it was handed not to me, but to another person—it was before the discovery of that will that I agreed to allow the defendant the additional sum to make up 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—if the will of 1859 is established I shall be in a very different position, but it is in dispute—that will has been pro<lb/>pounded, the cause tried in the Probate Court, and a verdict given against me—I have applied for a new trial, and the motion is now pending—it was the day after the verdict was pronounced against me in the Probate Court that I took Dr. Tuke down to visit my sister Albinia at Feltham—the verdict was on Saturday, and on Sunday I took Dr. Tuke down—the defendant was examined as a witness on the trial—I have</p>

               <p>not noticed any violence of any kind in my sister Albinia—she would get into little passions occasionally; that is all—she is perfectly quiet.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a member of the Royal College of Physicians, and reside at the Manor House, Chiswick; I have also a house at 37, Albemarle Street, Piccadilly—I practise at both places—my practice is almost entirely confined to nervous affections—I saw Miss Albinia Dendy on 23rd December last year, on 30th December, and on 7th January this year, and I have attended her regularly since—the 23rd December was my first visit—I wish to state that my present attend<lb/>ance is under the Act of Lunacy, which compels a medical visit once a fortnight—upon my first visit I was not perfectly satisfied as to the state of the lady's mind, inasmuch as I was prevented from making an examina<lb/>tion, by Mr. Harris; he desired her not to answer any questions, and I could not tell until I had seen her again whether that was effectual with her or not—I went alone, I was a stranger to her up to that time; it was at Rose Cottage, Feltham; I stayed about ten minutes only—the defendant's niece, Emma Harris, was present besides the defendant and myself—on the 30th I went with Mr. Dendy, the last witness—I was also accom<lb/>panied by Mr. Kingsford, the medical attendant—I and Mr. Kingsford saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250051"/>
               <p>her then alone, in the absence of Harris; I had very little doubt before as to the state of her mind and intellect, bat there could not be the slightest on the second interview, because she could not understand who I was or why I came, or her own position, or what she was doing at Rose Cottage, or the bearing which the death of her sister had upon her own fortunes, or in fact comprehend apparently any but the most simple possible pro<lb/>positions, and that very imperfectly—I tried her upon the usual subjects, as to the value of money, as to the day of the year, the time of the month, as to her own name; she could not answer her own name, unless it was put interrogatively, "Is your name Albinia?"—on that occasion I should think we were there nearly forty minutes or an hour, a long time—her state was imbecility in the first degree; she was imbecile; that certainly must have lasted many years, from childhood certainly—I saw that she was amused with a bundle of rags, and I have since seen her pleased with a doll and a toy, and that kind of thing—her age is about forty-two or forty-three, or a little older—she looks at pictures with amusement, and seems to know the subjects of some of them—I have since seen her once a fortnight—I do not hold any appointment under the Commissioners of Lunacy, I have seen her simply as visitor of a single patient; a medical mail must be appointed as a visitor, he is appointed by the committee of the person or the signer of the certificate or order of seclusion—I took upon myself to visit her, being the medical attendant; the Statute requires whoever is the medical attendant to go once a fortnight and to make, an entry ia a book—having chosen the place of Miss Dendy's residence, and being her medical attendant, I simply did my duty in going, and I have gone since with Mr. Dendy's knowledge—I told him it was necessary, and I had his tacit per<lb/>mission to do so—that is since the patient's removal from Rose Cottage to another establishment, the house of a clergyman near London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When were you first requested by Mr. Dendy to go to Rose Cottago to see this lady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the day that the trial ter<lb/>minated, after the verdict upon the trial as to the sanity of Alicia when making the will of 1859—I was a witness on that trial on behalf of Mr. Dendy—I don't think I ever spoke to Mr. Dendy in my life before that occasion, I mean till the occasion of speaking to him about his sister, the alleged lunatic; that was on the 22nd or 23rd, on the last day of the trial; it lasted many days—I was a witness, but I was not in communication with Mr. Dendy; I was instructed by the solicitors—Mr. Dendy made no application to me to visit his sister until the jury pronounced a verdiet against him on the will—I was a witness on the trial in the Probate Court, at the request of Mr. Dandy's solicitors, for the purpose of giving evidence as to the soundness of mind of Alicia—I had been consulted on that sub<lb/>ject; I had not seen Alicia—I had been consulted on the subject of docu<lb/>mentary evidence—the communication on the subject of Albinia came from me—I went to Mr. Dendy, he did not come to me; we had never spoken till then, except to say "Good morning" in Court—on the first occasion I went alone to see her on the Sunday morning—on the second occasion I asked him to accompany me, because I could not get an entrance, I was not allowed to speak to Miss Dendy—I was present when Mr. Harris was examined as a witness in the Probate Court—he saw me examined, and knew me perfectly well, and when I went down to his place I sent in iny card; he said, "This is not a proper day to come down and inter<lb/>fere with my family on a Sunday"—I was present when Miss Dendy was removed—she was not in the lightest degree affected, not the least, she</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250052"/>
               <p>could not be made to understand what her brother wanted to do, but when she was in the carriage she was perfectly pleased, happy, and delighted—her brother took her up in his arms and carried her out of the house like a child; I have described it that force was used to get her out; her bro<lb/>ther took her up in his arms and carried her out by force.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MAULE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Let us understand thoroughly what occurred, which you have described as the use of force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The brother begged the sister to come with him—he described that he had got a nice house for her, and she should have a drive with him—nothing had been said or done by her to provoke him to make that remark—he asked her to come out with him—she did not say she would not, but she evidently did not want to go—she made a noise, a sort of grunting noise, and Miss Harris said she was very angry—it indicated dissent—no one was with Mr. Dendy and myself when the was removed—Miss Harris was there—Mr. Dendy had the order for her removal in his pocket—I may explain that, not knowing how a lady in her state of mind and health might bear a removal of that sort, even with her own brother, I volunteered to Mr. Dendy to go down with him, in order to see that no harm happened to her—the order for removal is in effect a request to the party who is to receive a patient, to do so, under the hand of a person described as having authority to make the request—I suppose as much feeling was expressed at going as a woman in her state of mind could indicate—it was alarm—she was frightened—she could not make out whit her brother wanted—it was evidently a new thing to her, because the instant she found she Was sitting in the carriage she smiled and laughed—we stopped and spoke to a friend of hers within fifty yards, who shook hands with her in the carriage, and who noticed how smiling she looked—it was a pleasure trip for her—I was a witness on the issue of the sanity or insanity of Alicia, with regard to some will that was said to be her will—I had never seen her—it was the documents in question then that led to my going to Mr. Dendy and saying to him that some medical man must at once be sent down to see Albinia—I had read the documents—it was entirely upon the basis of those documents that I gave my evidence, professionally and scientifically, and of course upon the evidence I heard in Court—after I had given that evidence I went to Mr. Dendy upon my own mere motion—it was in consequence of my seeing him and suggesting something that I visited Rose Cottage on the Sunday—I sent in my card and explained who I was—I saw Miss Harris first—Mr. Harris at first said he was ill, but he afterwards came into the room, and when I had been there about five minutes he desired Miss Dendy not to answer any questions, and said I was a witness who had been talking of what I knew nothing about in the witness-box, and he frightened her—he said that Miss Dendy was quite rational, that I was coming down to injure her in some way or other, and she was not to answer any questions, and I left.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Sunbury—I am a fellow of the Col<lb/>lege of Surgeons—I went to visit Miss Albinia Martina Dendy, at Rose Cottage, Feltham—I first saw her professionally in July, 1865—I bad seen her previously at various times, I should say from the year 1856, from the time I first attended her mother's family—my first attendance upon her per<lb/>sonally was in July, 1865—she was then imbecile—I considered her almost an idiot—she was unable to comprehend very simple questions—she was not able to feed herself, not able to read or write, in fact she had much the</p>

               <p>appearance of an idiot—I believe she did feed herself, but she was unable to cut up her food—she did not know the value of money, and was not in the least capable of managing her own affairs—the defendant was often in the room when I saw her—I saw her constantly since July, 1865—she remained in the same state the whole of that time—in January this year I saw her under a certificate for her removal to another place—from the first time I saw her I concluded that she was of unsouud mind—I believe the first time I saw her was accidentally as I was passing, I saw her in the garden—when I had the opportunity of seeing her professionally I formed the opinion that she was imbecile.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you have said that she was undoubtedly of weak mind, but perfectly harmless? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perfectly harmless, as far as I observed—I saw her constantly—she used to amuse herself with sewing, and little diversions of that kind—she was docile—I should say decidedly that the Harris's behaved with the utmost kindness to her during the whole time I observed her with them—they treated her as if she was their own child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to Burgoyne, Burbage, and Squire, wholesale druggists, of 16, Coleman Street—the prisoner was their clerk, and used to be supplied with money in advance for the purpose of buying stamps, which he kept in his desk under lock and key—it was his duty to give them out to the different persons in the establishment as they required them, and to cause them to be entered in this book, which I added up every week, aud struck a balance, giving him credit for the stamps which he represented by the book that he had given out—he would have money to go on with from week to week—I find here an entry on 8th January, "329 at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. A.

A.

P</hi>., but perhaps seven months, the book begins in June, 1866—here are no initials at the beginning—it is my duty to check the amounts every week, I do that before <hi rend="largeCaps">A.

I wanted Mr. Oliphant to get some respectable person to take them back to Messrs. Powell's, but since his death I should be glad to get rid of them for what I could get." I afterwards, on the same day, went with the prisoner to a coffee-shop in Old Street, by his desire, where he asked for a parcel he left the night before, and the landlady brought this roll of cartoons and gave him, saying that there would be 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for his bed—I took the cartoons—there is an adhesive label on each with Messrs.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Five witnesses have been called, and none of them proves that I received the drawings knowing them to be stolen. They were left in my keeping by Mr. Oliphant. I told the officer where I got them, but I did not know the number of the house. When I heard that they wore Mr. Powell's I said I would give them all up. They are of very little value now, as they have been used, and new cartoons are always made for a fresh order. I called at Mr. Oliphant's before his death, but, as the servant opened the door, Miss Stanley did not see me. I have been frequently in the house; his study was on tho right-hand side. I had no occasion to call except to know whether, during his illness, he had left any notice what I was to do with the drawings, which are so similar to his own style that I would defy anybody to tell which was which, and I fancied that they were his. He had twice asked me to sell tho drawings which were sold to Watts; that was about December 10th, and he died on 17th January. His death was sudden, and, as he owed me money, which I lent him when he was not fully employed, I sold the, smaller ones. I believe mental excitement from fear of discovery was the cause of his death. We had known each other from youth, and he left them with me for fear of his effects being kept back for his rent. I heard the Clerk of the Court tell the solicitor on the third occasion that the evidence was insufficient, upon</p>

The reward runs in their heads, but to get it there must be a conviction, which they would not get without inventing that conversation. When I went to Messrs. Powell's, in answer to the advertisement, I gave my name and address. I am well known as an artist throughout the trade.</p>

I am a clerk in holy orders, and live at 14, Colebrook Row, St. Mary's, Islington—on Tuesday, 8th January, about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I was called up—I went down stairs and found the whole of the lower part of the house ran<lb/>sacked, and the window in the back door broken, so that a person from the outside could undo the bolts; there is a second door leading from the back kitchen into the front of the house, an inner door; that was fastened with sheet iron and on the opposite side to the place where the entrance was effected, it was protected by an iron bar three feet long, two inches wide, and a quarter of an inch thick—I found that bar, which was let into iron grooves from the sills of the door, bent nearly double, at an angle of about forty-five degrees; then the door was easily opened, and an entrance effected into the front kitchen, and the property, plate, linen, boots and shoes, and fifteen or sixteen coats were all taken away—the linen for a fortnight's wash was placed at the foot of the stairs in the hall ready for the laundress, and that was all taken—I have since seen all the lines in that bundle just as it was tied up at the time it was taken, amounting to fifty-two pieces, besides boots and shoes—it was produced to me by the con<lb/>stable Gully—I had heard considerable noise during the night, but there was a hurricane blowing that evening, quite a gale, and my house is large and old—there was a good deal of rattling of windows and doors, and I conceived that all the noise was caused by the wind—I heard those noises at a quarter to five—I first heard them at hast-past four, but distinctly at ten minutes or a quarter to five—I know the time, because I had to get out of bed—after getting up in the morning I went into the garden, and found traces of persons having been there during the night—they had got through an iron railing that I had put up to prevent my poultry going into my neighbour's garden—I went into the next garden and there found traces of how the robbery had been committed, and found my plate basket in the middle of the garden; the plate was gone—the wall into Alfred Street, over which the burglary was effected, is over sixteen feet high on that side—I have had the place pointed out to me where the cabman took up his fare, I have measured the distance from there to the place where the burglary was effected, and it is under thirty yards—to my door it is further.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabdriver in Leather Lane—on the morn<lb/>ing of 8th January, about five o'clock or five minutes past, I was on the cab-stand near the Eagle Tavern, City Road—the two prisoners came up to me, Arnold first; she asked if I would go up to River Terrace, and take up—at that time Gibbons was standing a little distance off, on the pavement—they both got into the cab—they pulled me up at the corner of Alfred Street—I have since seen the prosecutor's house; it was a few yards from there—Gibbons got out of the cab first, and was then followed by Arnold, when Gibbons met Arnold on the pavement with a bundle; they put it into the cab and got in, and I drove off—Arnold told me to drive to Church Street, Shoreditch—when I got to Church Street Arnold looked out of the cab window, and told me to pull up at Turville Street; she then got out of the cab, and went into a house—at that time the police constable came up, and took them into custody—I did not see any men with the prisoners.</p>

On the morning of 8th January, about half-past five o'clock, I was in Turville Street, and saw a cab drive up—I followed it till it stopped at 16, Turville Street—I saw Arnold get out of the cab, and Gibbons was in the act of getting out; I told her to stop there, and asked what she had got there; she said they were Arnold's things, that she had left her place that morning—Arnold had then gone into the house—this is the bundle (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—several of the things have since been returned to Mr. McCarthy—it was tied up in this cloth, and contained five sheets, five pairs of boots, two dresses, two night dresses, two sheets, and several other articles—when Gibbons said the things were Arnold's I directed the cabman to fetch Arnold; he did so,</p>

               <p>and I asked her where she got these things—she made no answer—I then told them both to get into the cab, and directed the cabman to drive to the station—I was present when the articles were delivered up to Mr. McCarthy; they were articles that had been in the bundle.</p>

They said they would make me a hand<lb/>some present, and, being an unfortunate girl, not knowing where to get a breakfast, I went for the sake of the money to get myself a breakfast in the morning. They gave me half a crown to get a cab. Arnold called for the cab, and we went to River Terrace. I do not know the name of the Street; we stopped the cab at the corner of the street. There were three men, two stood outside, and one went in, and the little one gave me the bundle; but where he brought it from I can't say, because he came up the street with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Arnold's Defence.</hi> On 7th January I left my home to go to work in the afternoon; instead of going to work, I went to Gibbons's house to have some tea. We went out and went to the play. It was too late for me to return home, and she said I could come home with her. I stayed with her all night. At four in the morning she woke me up; there were three men in the room; they asked her would she go and carry a bundle. She went, and I did the same as any other girl would do, because I would not stay there by myself. She did not ask me to go.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot upper manufacturer, and live it 1, Angela Gardens, Columbia Square, Hackney Road—on 2nd February, about five minutes to nine at night, I was going along Chiswell Street, from Finsbury Square; I had to pass Milton Street—soon after pawing Milton Street I saw a crowd, but I saw the prisoners first, standing with two other men at the corner of a public-house—I observed them—there was light from the large gin palace where they were standing with their backs to it—I could see the faces of each of them as I passed—I observed these two men, and am positive they are the two men I then saw with two others—I passed them; directly I passed them they turned towards me; they were not standing more than eight or ten yards from the crowd; they came after me, and the moment they got close to me they made a rush; I turned round and faced them, so that they might pass me if they wanted—there was a fire nearly opposite; there was plenty of room for them to pass me and to go outside the crowd—when they pushed me one of them went past me, the other three kept behind me, between me and the shops; the one that passed me kept close to my side to the front of me, and the others from behind made another rush forward; one of them appeared as if he slipped; I directly felt myself clutched by my left pocket, and found my elbows fixed so that I could not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250067"/>
               <p>move; the one that picked my pocket was behind me, on my left side—it was the one that had first passed me, a short man—he held my pocket I should think several seconds—I tried to move my legs, so as to release myself from him, but could not; I could not move either my arms or legs, I was regu<lb/>larly pinioned—I should think it occupied about fifteen seconds, sufficient time for me to think about what they were doing; the man who clutched my pocket held on for about fifteen seconds, then he made a dreadful jerk, and pulled out my purse; directly he got it out, he moved and forced himself back from me to get away, which gave me an opportunity of putting my left hand down—the jerk he gave me was so great that it was almost like pulling the leg of my trousers off—he tried to get away, and worked himself a little distance from the crowd—I know who that man was; he is not in custody—I did not remain pinioned an instant after I got my hind at liberty; I did not feel in my pocket, I felt the purse go; it was a large lump, and I felt that my pocket was empty—I tried to get hold of the one not in custody, but the others prevented me by closing and getting between me and the man; each effort I made they foiled in that way to keep me back—eventually I got loose, and got right out into the road—I am quite sure the prisoners are the two men that were pushing me behind—after getting away from the crowd I pursued the one that picked my pocket—he went in the direction of Milton Street—when he found I was pursuing him he returned back to the crowd and whispered; the moment he said something to his companions they looked at each other; something was said, and away they passed from the crowd, and he went into the crowd—I then turned as if I was going to pursue him, but immediately afterwards I followed them, I followed them for about seventy yards, I should think, from where the crowd was; they turned into Milton Street, and then into an entry in Milton Street—I followed them, and saw the two prisoners there—the nearest I was to them was within a yard; they were dividing the money, Nagle had got my purse in his hand, counting the money into Whelan's hand—I approached them, and said, "That is my money"—they seemed quite astonished for the moment; they never spoke a word for a second or two, they looked at me, and then Whelan recovered himself and made a dash at me, and said he would knock my b—skull in, or my bones, or some thing like that—my seeing them in this entry or court was within two minutes of finding the man's hand in my pocket; it was done almost instantly; one thing followed the other as quick as could be—the alley was lighted from the shops opposite—there was sufficient light to see on the ground—I looked to see if I could find the purse after<lb/>wards—they were only about a yard up the entry, one step—there was light in the street and in the shops—they gave a light as far up the entry as I bad occasion to go—I could see their faces distinctly—I told them so—when Nagle aimed the blow at me I threw up my left arm and stepped back and said, "Mind, I know you both; I shall remember you again"—they then ran away into Chiswell Street—they ran past me, as I stepped out of the entry they rushed out—I followed them—they went into a public-house in Smith Street—I went to find an officer, and when I came back they were gone—a little delay ensued—I had about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the purse, there might be a shilling or two over or under, it was in gold and silver, fourteen or sixteen postage stamps, and a gold chain with the swivel broken off, and a few memorandums—on 9th February, seven days afterwards, I went with Elliott the constable to a beer shop in Whitecross Street, about ten o'clock at night—there were people sitting there—it looked like a</p>

               <p>concert room—there was no singing—I saw Nagle there and five others, I think—I recognised him at once—I had seen him an hour previously—I am quite sure he is the man I saw on 2nd February who was behind me in the crowd, and who I saw counting the money—I charged him with robbing me—he said nothing; he got up at once—before he got to the station-house he said to Elliott, "Tell me what time, and I will tell you where I was."</p>

On Saturday, 9th March, about a quarter to ten, I was called by the prosecutor, and went with him to a beer shop in Whitecross Street—that is a short distance from Milton Street—we went into a concert-room there—there were six persons there—the prosecutor pointed to the prisoner Nagle and said, "That is the man"—he did that directly, as soon as he entered the room—I took him into custody—the prosecutor charged him with robbing him—he</p>

I am a dealer in jewellery and watches, and live at 9, Granby Place, Drury Lane—the boy at the bar is my son—he lived with me—I travel about London with my jewellery, calling at different shop, and he used to carry the bag for me with the jewellery in it—on 31st Janu<lb/>ary I put my stock in the bag to try and do some business, calling at different shops—my son told me to put the things in the bag, but I did not think anything of that—I went to Skinner Street, Snowhill, and went into the shop of Mr. Lindsay, leaving my boy outside with the bag, con<lb/>taining twenty silver watches, four gold watches, one metal watch, eight or more gold Alberts, a quantity of gold lockets, rings, studs, brooches, and other articles, of the value of 370<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was in the shop about ten minutes—when I came out my son was gone—I found out that he had been</p>

               <p>in the habit of playing with the prisoner Smith's boys nearly a month before, but he was acquainted with them fifteen or eighteen months before, when they lived in our street—I went and called at Smith's house, I think on Sunday evening, 10th February—I saw Mrs. Smith, and asked if she had seen my son anywhere about there—she said she had not seen him for six weeks, and the last time she saw him he had a black bag with him, that he shook hands with them, and said he was going off to America—I told her I thought she was mistaken, for he never carried a black bag, except when he was along with me, till he had robbed me the Thursday before—I said, "If you can possibly find where he is, and send him home to me, I will reward you"—she said she would if she could—I did not say any more to her, as she was not well—I came away, and as I was coming from the house I saw Mr. Smith—I asked him if he had seen anything of my son—he said he was there on the Thursday evening, I think, before he came home from work, and that he went away on the Sunday follow<lb/>ing, and he carried his bag down to the railway station, and the boy went off to Ayrshire, in Scotland—I took him into a public-house, and called for some ale, and told him I was very sorry for what had occurred, and I wondered he did not send word to me, seeing he was but a young boy—he said he did not know my address—he said if I would come in with him he would give me some things, that he saw a great deal of jewellery knocking about, and he was very sorry to see it—I went with him, and he gave me a gold watch and a letter from Ayr<lb/>shire to Mr. Smith, written by the boy's uncle, as he cannot write himself—the watch had been in my bag—I told him, if he had any pawn tickets or other goods, to give them to me—he said if there was anything they would give it up, and he asked Mrs. Smith to bring them—she said the boy had taken the tickets and all the things with him to Scotland, and she had nothing but the watch—I told her that her two boys knew my address, and it was a pity they did not send to me—next morning the officer and I went to Mrs. Smith's again—she said her husband was not in, and she thought perhaps he might have some pawn tickets—we then went down to Mr. Smith, and he delivered up to us four or five; I also received four or five from a young man, who is a witness—I don't re<lb/>member receiving any from Mrs. Smith—we said to her, "If you have not got the tickets tell us where you pledged the articles, that we may re<lb/>cover them"—I think she said she pawned a string of beads at Mr. Folkard's, a brooch, a coral snap, and earrings—I have recovered about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of my property—my son is just turned fifteen.</p>

I should not have thought it was you; come and see what you have done"—he said, "I should not have run, only I thought it was the policeman"—I took him back to my mother, and the constable, who was standing by her, said, "When I left the old lady in charge of you she had the rings on her finger, and you said you would take charge of them: what hare you done with them?"—he said, "I do not know"—the constable said, "Will you give him in charge?"—I said, "No; I will leave it till morning, to see what mother has lost"—I saw the prisoner frequently afterwards, and said, "Mother has been to the station and told the police<lb/>man to lock you up when he sees you, and if you go and make her some recompense perhaps she will not lock you up"—he said, "I have not seen the other man since."</p>

I am a medical student, and reside in Camden Road—about half-past six on the evening of 29th January I went into a public-house in Mercer Street, Long Acre—just before I got to the door the prisoner, with three others, asked me something about the way to the Strand—I did not give them any direct answer, but passed on—a few minutes afterwards I returned, and was crossing over Mercer Street to Long Acre when the prisoner and three others hustled me, and the prisoner put his hands over my mouth—I tried to get away, and struck him—he threw me on my side, and cut my knee in two places—he ran down Mercer Street, and I pursued him for about forty yards, when he was stopped by a policeman—I do not know where the other three ran to—I gave him in charge—I was about seven or ten minutes in the public-house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of the C jetty, Victoria Docks—the <hi rend="italic">Thomas Snowdon</hi> was discharging her cargo there on 5th February—I engaged Biley and Fitch about 9 a.m., and White about 12.30—I saw them up to 5.30, they were then sober—I went into the hold soon after seven, and found White lying quite insensible on some loose grain—I turned him over, but could make nothing of him, I sent for a constable, and on further search found Biley forward, standing on some cases of brandy, and near him were two cases which had been broken open—he was drunk, but not insensible, we had to lead him up the ladder—Fitch was also drunk, but not so bad as Biley—three cases were broken, but the third not enough to extract the bottles—I missed ten bottles of brandy from one of the cases—I saw a broken bottle of brandy near where White was lying, the neck was off and could not be found—we were at work till eight, the regular hours are nine to four—the men leave for dinner at twelve o'clock, and return at twenty minutes past—no beer or spirits is allowed in the docks after two in the day—I produce another broken bottle.</p>

               <p>doctor—the others were not so bad—when I went to the vessel it was closed, but next morning I went into the hold as soon as the hatches were off, and found two cases broken open, and nine bottles missing from one, and one from the other—I found several bottles broken to pieces, and three others with the necks off, and a portion of brandy in each of them; also the neck of a bottle with the capsule on and the cork in it near the broken bite.</p>

               <p>

I went to the ship, felt giddy, and sat down. I never had a drop of drink in the ship. If there were ten bot<lb/>tles of brandy missing, there were forty or fifty men there, and some of them were drunk. I have worked in the docks since 1854, and should not be likely to take brandy and get my living taken away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Fitch's Defence.</hi> I was no more drunk than I am now. I got up the stancheons of the boat, because there was no ladder, and when I got ashore they took me in custody. This capsule may have been thrown on my coat; ray pockets are very large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Biley's Defence.</hi> My jacket was thrown up to me, and I caught it, put it on, got over the ship's side, and, stepped ashore, the ship being two or three feet from the side. I said to one of the officers, "Can you call me drunk? I can walk as well as ever I could, being lame." At the station I heard Mr. Grigg say, "I do not know what to do about locking Biley up." Cowcutt said, "Lock him up, now we have got him here; we may learn some information from him."</p>

I reside with my mother, the prosecutrix, and manage her business—I left home on Sunday, 10th February, about half-past two in the afternoon, and returned home about nine—I examined the door at the top of the kitchen stairs, leading to the parlour; it had been broken open: two panels had been forced out—next morning I examined the kitchen window: I found it had been forced open with a screwdriver; I compared the marks with this screwdriver, and they exactly corre<lb/>sponded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter carrier, of Russell Street, Sydenham—I was present when the prosecutor's cart was upset—the contents went on the ground, and I saw Terry pick up a parcel and put it under his arm—he stood by my side about a minute or a minute and a half, turned quickly round, went across to Francis, who was in a cart, and gave it to him; he put it in the back of the cart and covered it over—I made a communication to Potter, went with him, and called Terry twice—he turned round and said, "What parcel? I have no parcel"—I said, "That will not do for me: you have a parcel in that cart"—he called to Francis, "Heigh! give me that parcel"—Francis then handed the parcel out of the cart to Potter, and said to Terry, "You knew the parcel did not belong to you"—Terry said, "I was going to take it to the owner"—when Terry found that Potter had got hold of his arm he owned to it at once—a con<lb/>stable came, and he was given in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, of 8, Eaton Place, Dover Road—on 2nd February the prisoner came with another woman, who asked for 31b. of potatoes (the prisoner only came about a foot into the shop)—she gave me a shilling—I had no halfpence, and went to Mr. Carter, at the Sir John Falstaff, who gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers—I went back to the shop, and gave the woman her change—the prisoner was still at the door—they went away together, and had only got next door when Mr. Carter's servant, Ellen Lee, came across and gave me the shilling, which I found was bad—I went out and said to the woman with the prisoner, "Give me another shilling, for this is bad"—she used fearful language, and the prisoner snatched the shilling away—the prisoner used the worst language—she snatched the tenpence and shilling out of the other woman's hand, and said, "It is my money"—they ran away, and I followed the prisoner into the Dover Road, met a constable, and gave her in custody, with the shilling I received from Lee—I have not seen the other woman since.</p>

Q.</hi> What is the actual value of the cash-box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It cost me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less than that—I sell pistols—the prisoner had a room to himself—I did not afterwards let it and put him into a back kitchen to sleep, or into a little back room—I put him into a large place—it was a counting-house, and before that it was a sitting-room—it is parted off from the shop—my wife and I used to dine, breakfast, and sup in it, but when the prisoner was put in we went out of it—he did not complain of it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186702250100"/>
               <p>particularly—I do not know that he complained—since Christmas for two or three nights he lodged out—if he had come to me he would have had something to eat and drink, or money to buy it—I have a neighbour named Payne, who sells the same things as me—I did not ask the prisoner to break his windows, and chalk his shutters, "Gone back to Woolwich"—I did not tie something to my chaise and carry it across the heath—it is quite untrue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the prisoner bringing home a little dog and saying that he found it, and a reward of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. being offered for it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the dog was given to my daughter by Miss Stephens, next door—the prisoner afterwards brought me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I said that, as the dog was given to my daughter, I would divide the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. between the prisoner and my daughter, and I did so—I did not give him an old watch instead—he bothered very hard for a watch, which I valued at 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and teased my wife to let him have it; I let him have it instead of the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and two or three days afterwards he parted with it—it was gold—I do not know that all he could get for it was 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not know that if he is found guilty I shall get rid of him and keep the 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not make him clean my pony and cart, and drag a truck—there were a great many complaints between his father and me—the father did not say that he thought it was a bed of roses, and it turned out to be a bed of thornt—nothing of the kind—the father is an oil and colour merchant—I believe he is very respectable—his eldest son, Alfred, carries on business with him—Alfred had reports from the prisoner, and came down and found them to be false—he dined with me each time he came, pretty well—the prisoner has asked me to forgive him, and I have forgiven him four-fifths—he has been twice before a Magistrate, and I have his father's letters directing me to take these steps, pressing me to do so—before going before the Magistrate I intimated my intention to his father, who came to me—his father knew that I had charged him before a Magistrate before—I have his letters telling me to do so—I forgave him four-fifths, and the fifth time I took him before a Magistrate, and then begged him off, or he would have been sent for trial—he did not come back too late when he went for the holiday at Christmas—I found him living with two women in the Lee Road, Lydia Thayes and another girl—I told him to go to his father, who wished to see him, and to bring me a letter from his father, but instead of that he brought one from his brother, and then went back and brought one from his mother—I do not know that his father had gone a long journey, but he ultimately brought the prisoner to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the reason you removed him from his bed-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he used to boast to the female servants that he was going up stairs to lie down with his mistress, and one Sunday afternoon I was out on the heath, and saw a light at my bedroom window, I was afraid he was with my little girl, and hastened home and removed him—one Sunday I dined in London, and he had to feed my horses in my absence—I afterwards found that he took them out and drove them seventy miles in nine hours, they having done a week's work, and another Sunday he drove them to Foots Cray and Croydon, when I thought they were having a rest—on three other occasions he nearly smashed the van, and on 19th February nearly killed the horse—he was drunk—he is seventeen or eighteen years old.</p>

I am barman at the Old Antigallioan public-house, in Tooley Street—on Thursday evening, 10th January, I was in Duke Street, Tooley Street, going home, something after eight o'clock—I was in the act of putting my top-coat on—the male prisoner came up and asked me to let him help me on with it—I offered him a glass of ale for doing it—we went into the Green Man and had some drink—while there another man came in—I called for some brandy for them and treated them—I was not drunk—I had been out on a day's leave, and had had a couple of glasses along with a friend—as I came out of the house I did not mind which turning I took, I got under the railway arch, after which I could not tell where I went—I remember at last being at a public-house where I had a glass of wine—I don't know the name of that house—when I came out of there I did not know where I was—I looked to see if I could get a cab, and saw the prisoners coming after me—the male prisoner put his foot before me, gave me a push, put his knee in my back, and threw me down in the gutter—he held me down, and the female prisoner came up—I had my top<lb/>coat on my left arm, and she knelt on my left arm on the ground while I was down—my watch was in my breast pocket; she made several attempts to take it while I was on the ground, and in rising up she snatched her hand at the ribbon guard, and I had my watch no more—it went—when I was knocked down there were four persons round me—the female prisoner was there at the time I was knocked down—she was coming up behind</p>

               <p>me—she came up at the time the man knocked me down—I saw the prisoners both together on my left side when I was on the ground—the female was within a yard or so of me when I was knocked down—I could not say exactly who took my watch, but the female made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at the ribbon that was attached to it, and broke it—that was while she was kneel<lb/>ing on my arm, and as soon as I got on ray feet I missed it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About nine—when I first met the male prisoner it was between eight and nine—that was not far from my home, but I took a wrong turning—the place was strange to me, and I did not know where I was—I meant to go home—I am quite certain the male prisoner knocked me down—I fell on my face—I said before the Magistrate that the prisoner pushed me down, and I thought another man took my watch—I said nothing about the woman, because she was not taken then—the male prisoner helped me on with my coat when I first saw him, but I took it off again in walking along and had it on my arm—I only went into two public-houses with the prisoner—I could not say how long I was walking with him; it was a good while—there were two or three women in the second public-house—there was no singing there—I have not said before to-day that both prisoners came out after me—I said the male prisoner came after me—the female came up a few minutes afterwards—she was there at the time I was knocked down, but she did not leave the public-house till a few minutes after I had left it—I have not said I had three or four glasses of wine at that public-house—I meant three or four through the day—I had no gin—I was not drunk—I knew very well I was in a strange place, and I wanted to get out of it as well as I could—I was out on a day's leave, and my time was not up till ten o'clock—the female prisoner kicked me at the back of my head before she knelt on my arm, and the man not in custody held me down and kicked me, and both their hands were on my breast together—I got home before ten, and did business after I got home.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi> 13 <hi rend="italic">M</hi>). I received information of this robbery, and on the Saturday after, the 17th, I met McCarthy in Newing<lb/>ton Causeway—I told him I wanted him for being concerned with three others in violently assaulting and robbing a young man of a silver watch, in Kent Street—he said, "I was with the young man, and I had something to drink with him; we were in company together. We took a walk from London Bridge, and I took him into Kent Street. He wanted to hear a song. We had something to drink at a beer shop, a public-house just as you enter Kent Street. There was <hi rend="italic">Curly Poll</hi> (that is the name Sidebotham is known by); <hi rend="italic">Carry</hi> Kenrick and George Basty were there, and I will not be put away for them. We all went out together. The prosecutor went on ahead, going towards the Kent Road. I turned aside to ease myself and within a minute or two after that I saw him all covered with mud, and blood trickling down his face"—I took him to Stones'End Police Station, and placed him with five others, and fetched the prosecutor, who deliberately picked him out, put his hand on him, and said, "That is the man."</p>

               <p>the female prisoner into custody on 30th January at the Royal Oak, in Kent Street—I said, "Annie, I want you"—she said, "What for?"—I said, "For being concerned with others in robbing a man in Kent Street"—she said, "Mr. Marsh, this is got up for me"—on the way to the station she said that she was in the house with them, but she took no part in the robbery—the prosecutor saw her at the station, pointed her out, and said, "That was the woman that robbed me"—he told the inspector in my presence that the woman knelt on his arm, and also attempted to drag his coat from him as he was down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a haddock smoker, and live at 7, Walker Street, Long Lane—about half-past twelve in the night or morning of 14th February I was drinking with John Kendall—when we left the public-house we stood talking at the top of Sweeps' Alley; we were sober—as we were returning home we saw the prisoner sharpening a knife on a door-step, and as we passed by he made use of some bad language, and said he would cut the first man's throat that he came <hi rend="italic">anigk</hi>—I said nothing to him, but as I took two steps past him he ran at me and plunged the knife into my throat; he then turned round and ran away—I saw that he had a knife in his hand—I had never seen him before.</p>
