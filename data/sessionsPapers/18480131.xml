                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Jacob Isaacs, of Dor<lb/>set-square. On Monday, a week before I was before the Magistrates, I was in the pantry down stairs, at one o'clock in the afternoon—the window looks into the front area—I saw the prisoner come down—I am sure it was him—he looked in at one pantry window, and then into the other, then lifted up the window which had been shut close, and took a spoon from a tea-cup and saucer which stood in the window—I saw the spoon in his hand—I asked him to give it me—he asked me if I had any old bottles to sell—I again asked him to give me it—he did not, but put it into his right pocket, and turned to go away up the area steps—I went to the front door, but no person was passing at the time, and he escaped—I am positive he is man—I saw him again at the Police-station—there were several other persons there, but I knew him immediately, and pointed him out.</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am the son of last witness, and life with him. I was in the tap-room about twelve o'clock—Burrows told me something about half-past twelve, and I went out and saw King—he went round to the back of the house with me—we saw nobody—I returned to the house, and after some time the two Smiths came to the club-room door, and tried to go in, but were not allowed—I afterwards saw Samuel Smith and Toms sitting in the tap-room singing—the other two had left—they returned, and there was a disturbance between all the prisoners and several of the club, and the house was cleared—when I got up stairs I found the first-floor win<lb/>dow, which looked out on the back part of the house, had been broken—it is about seven feet from the ground—I missed a writing-desk, containing a gold brooch, a ring, and other things, and a small box, containing some brushes, handkerchiefs, and two bottles, one containing gin, and the other some kind of spirits, I do not know what—I found a pocket-knife on the</p>

               <p>table in my room—I looked round the house, and found these six spoons immediately under the broken window—I went with a constable, between seven and eight o'clock next morning, and searched Smith's cottage—in going up stairs I found part of a broken bottle of exactly the same sort as mine—I found the other parts of it under and alongside the bed—it had a very faint smell, I could not tell of what—I found three of my handkerchiefs in the garden, on the premises, about thirty yards from the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lithographic artist, and carry on business with my father, in king William-street. I have had put into my hands a stone bearing the reverse side of a Russian note—the impres<lb/>sion was then scarcely perceptible—it had been washed out with turpentine or oil, I cannot exactly say which; both would do in lithography, and covered with a composition to preserve it, as occasion might hereafter require—that is the ordinary course adopted to preserve an impression—if the stone is wanted for another purpose, the lithographer must grind the impression off before he could put another on it—if it was not entirely ground off, there are means by which he could revive it—after a critical examination of the small stone, I found it had gone through that process, for the purpose of pre<lb/>serving that which was under the composition—I removed the composition with a piece of flannel and a little turpentine; with the aid of the prisoner's roller, rubbed the stone with it, and brought up the original impression in the state in which it now is—I afterwards proceeded to take impressions from the stone, having taken it home for that purpose—it certainly was not a worn stone—I suppose the composition was put on to reserve it—that is the rule—I produce some of the impressions I took from it—I took about half-a-dozen on paper, and more on parchment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Friedeburg's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written.</hi>) I am a furrier by trade, and was carrying on the same in Bury-street, St. Mary Axe. Five weeks previous to my being arrested on the present charge, a man came to me named Beek, residing at 5, Ebenezer-square, and recommended a man named Max, as a worker in my trade. I wanted a man at this time to assist me. I went to Hounds<lb/>ditch with Beck to see Max, and engaged him to come and work. Max commenced work with me the next day, and continued in my employ ten days. During his being with me, he was visited every day by two persons named Rochelt and Kauffman; I inquired of Max who they were, he answered me, <hi rend="italic">"One (Rochelt) was a partner of his, and Kauffman came with him (Max) and</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801310032"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">"Rochelt together from France to form a lithographic establishment in this coun<lb/>try;</hi>" I took little or no notice of this. Every day during the time of Max being in my employ, he and Rochelt were continually saying that me trade of a furrier would prove far more lucrative in France than in this country, and Kauffman promised to give me numerous recommendations to respectable houses there, and tried to persuade me to accompany them to France. Being anxious to avail myself of any honourable way of bettering myself. I thought it might prove advantageous for me to follow their advice. A difficulty how<lb/>ever presented itself, my passport was only good for Holland, not for France; I showed them the passport, and they answered me, <hi rend="italic">"Never mind, Mr. Friedeburg; we have travelled many times between France and London, and we have many friends in France, and if you will wait a fortnight, till we get let<lb/>ters and money from our friends, we will certainly take you to France with our passport.</hi>" I finished the work I had on hand, and not having any more to go on with, I went and took a room in Newton-street, Holborn. At this time Max and Rochelt were living in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. The day before I took the lodgings in Newton-street, Kauffman came home and said he should be much obliged if I would take lodgings so that he might come every night and sleep with me, as he was badly accommodated where he was, and he would pay me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for the accommodation; Kauffman seeming a respectable man, and having promised to give me recommendations for my work in France, I agreed to the proposal. I occasionally visited Max and Rochelt, and Max and Rochelt visited me. I asked them every day when we should go to France, as I was anxious to be working at my business again, having nothing to depend upon but my labour. He answered, <hi rend="italic">"Don't hurry, we shall soon have letters from France, and then we shall go immediately.</hi>" I asked Kauffman what business he was following in this country. He said, the same as Max and Rochelt had told me; that he was trying to form a lithographic establishment in this country, and that he expected his presses from France, and as he could not speak English, he asked me to go with him to a lithographic printer and borrow a press for him for a fortnight. I accord<lb/>ingly went with him to a lithographic printer in Holborn, and he borrowed one, agreeing to pay him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the loan of it for a fortnight, and agreeing to leave 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as a deposit. I bought of the same printer a stone for Kauffman, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I asked Kauffman if he had the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him; he said he had not, but he had a friend, a gentleman, who would come with him to-morrow and pay the deposit. <hi rend="italic">I then</hi> said to the printer, <hi rend="italic">"I will come with this gentleman and pay the deposit.</hi> " The next day Kauffman came to me with a gentleman whom he called Aaronson, a countryman of mine, who had resided five years in Paris, and had only lately come from thence; Kauffman then said, <hi rend="italic">"Mr. Aaronson will pay the deposit if you will go with us to the printer and see it paid.</hi> " I went with Messrs. Aaronson and Kauffman, and saw it paid. Kauffman took the press to the lodgings of Max and Rochelt, in Short's-gardens. Kauffman was there the whole of every day, and came to sleep with me at night. I called several times to see Max and Rochelt, and asked if they had received the expected letters, and when I should go with them to France. At those times I did not see Kauffman, he being, as I understood, engaged in his own room. I asked Max and Rochelt, <hi rend="italic">"Where is Kauffman?</hi> " He replied, <hi rend="italic">"He is very busy.</hi> " I did not take any notice of this, thinking he was earing money for himself in his own business. The fortnight which Max and Rochelt wished me to wait, passed away. I then began to be uneasy, as I wanted to be working at my business again. One morning, Max and Rochelt came home, and said, <hi rend="italic">"Mr. Friedeburg, we have received letters from</hi>
               </p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801310033"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">France, and our wives say they cannot send us the money now; but in twelve days or a fortnight we shall have it for certain. Now, Mr. Friedeburg, if you will wait that time, we give you word of honour that you and us will surely go to France; and in order that your expenses in waiting that time may be less, it will be better for us three to live together for the next fortnight.</hi> " Having waited a fortnight already, and being without work, and depending upon their promises, I consented to wait the time they mentioned, and went and took two rooms (one on the first floor, and one on the third floor,) in War-dour-street, Soho. We lived there together. Sometimes I slept on the third floor with Max, and sometimes I slept on the first floor by myself. During the time I lived in Wardour-street, Kauffman came every day to see Max and Rochelt. Kauffman, at this time, had left the lodgings in Short's-gardens, where he had lived with Max and Rochelt, and had taken others in Queen-street, Soho. I sometimes called at his lodgings there, having spare time on my hands, and found him unemployed, at which I was surprised, and asked him if he bed not any work to do. He replied, <hi rend="italic">"I expect work every day.</hi> " When I had lived a week in Wardour-street with Max and Rochelt, they gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to which I added 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went and paid the landlord the rent, taking a receipt, and at the same time giving him notice of my in-tention of leaving the lodgings at the end of the week; it being my design to go back into the City to obtain employment in my trade, should Max and Rochelt fail to fulfil their promise of taking me to France at the expiration of that time. On the Friday following (the 15th Oct.,) in the morning, Mr. Aaronson came to visit me. I was at the time in the third-floor room, with Max and Rochelt, where I had slept that night, Max having slept on the first floor. Max and Rochelt said to Mr. Aaronson and me, <hi rend="italic">"Mr. Friede-burg and Mr. Aaronson, the Frenchman, who lives in Queen-street, Sohe, would deem it a favour if you would call upon him this morning, as he has something very particular to say to you.</hi> " I was not dressed at the time. Mr. Aaronson, said, <hi rend="italic">"Go and dress yourself, Mr. Friedeburg, and we will go and see what the Frenchman wishes to say to us so very parlicular.</hi> " I went down to the first floor to dress myself, and while I was doing so Max came in and brushed his clothes. I finished dressing, and went up stairs to Mr. Aaronson, leaving Max in the room. Shortly after I came down stairs with Mr. Aaronson, to accompany him to see Kauffman. Passing by the first-floor room, I saw the door open, and no one inside, the key being in the door. I locked it, and took away the key with me. When we got to Kauffman's lodgings, I said to him, <hi rend="italic">"What is it you wish to say so particularly to Mr. Aaronson and myself</hi> " He seemed very much surprised at my question, and said, <hi rend="italic">"I never told Max and Rochelt to say anything of the kind.</hi> " When I got into his room I saw lying on a table many papers, having <hi rend="italic">some resemblance to</hi> Russian bank-notes. I took up one sheet, and said, laughingly, <hi rend="italic">What fool has been spoiling paper in this way?</hi> " and asked Kauffman where he had got so much rubbish. He answered, <hi rend="italic">"I got it yesterday, from</hi> Max and Rochelt, <hi rend="italic">to cut it for them.</hi> " He then requested that I would not tell Max and Rochelt that I bed seen the papers, as they had requested him not to let me see them, and said, that if Max and Rochelt asked him if I had seen the papers, he should tell them that I had not. We remained in conversation about ten minutes, when, to my surprise, Messrs. Forresters burst into the room, and declared us to be their prisoners.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the General Screw Steam Shipping Company, in Mark-lane. On 31st Dec. I was in my office, on the first floor, at five o'clock in the afternoon—I had my cash-box out, and was making up my money for the day—(I had before that seen a man named Hillier—he had come to our office frequently—I had seen him on the pre<lb/>vious morning)—a person, whom I firmly believe to be the prisoner, came in—he stated in Dutch, which I do not fully understand, that he wished to go to Corunna—he had an opportunity of seeing my cash-box and the money, and he might have heard it chink at the door—I told him we had nothing to do with Corunna, and referred him to another place in the street—he went out, came back in about five minutes, and said he did not want to go to Corunna, but to Rotterdam—we have vessels go there—I took him to another office, on the other side of the landing—Mr. Galley and some other clerks were there—I left my cash-box in the safe—it is an ordinary safe, with the doors standing open—I locked the cash-box, but not the safe—this is the cash-box—there was 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it, in gold and in silver—when I went across to the other office, I closed the door of my own office, but did not lock it—no one was left in it—when I got to the other office, there was an inquiry made by the prisoner in Dutch—he speaks very little English—we remained there three or four minutes—while there, the prisoner shot the bolt of the door inside—that fastened the whole of us in—it made no noise—he was referred to the Rotterdam broker, Mr. Rahn, opposite—a clerk came and opened the door, and the prisoner went out and went down stairs—I immediately went into my room, and found my cash-box gone—when I looked down the stairs, I saw some one, and my impression si that it was Hillier—he was about two stairs before the prisoner—the prisoner was between him and me.</p>

The bearer, my sister-in-law, will take any message you have to leave. John Byron."—"Dear Sir, The doctor strictly forbids me yet to go out. I yesterday experienced a relapse in fever, and am now in bed, suffer<lb/>ing very severely. I am to be bled in the arm this morning, if I am not better by twelve o'clock")—the signature is gone—they were thrown into a rubbish-paper drawer, and there may have been something gone—this check is not my writing, nor was it written by my authority—I knew nothing of it till I found it had been paid—the date and filling-up of it are written by the prisoner-the usual part is printed—the signature I believe to be his writing, but I cannot swear that—it is a very good imitation of mine—it is the sort of check I use—it purports to be drawn for duty on tea, per <hi rend="italic">Boyne</hi>—I always express the subject in my checks—the prisoner would know that—this is the check-book I had in use at that period (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is marked to contain 150 checks—I have counted it, and find it now contains 146—I miss four—those I used I took from the usual place, and left the margin—in those I miss the margin is gone also—I see my name and address written on this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—it is in the undisguised writing of the prisoner—he did not return to my service—I did not see him again till he was in custody, in the beginning of January—I had two or three other clerks in my employ<lb/>ment at the time</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. I knew William Ives—on 24th Dec. I was at work with him in the Cambridge-road, scraping the road with shovels—the prisoners and another man came up—they were not sober—the other two <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> Kemp on Ives, who said, "What do you do that for, I would not hurt you?"—Crudgington said, "You b—y fool, if you grum<lb/>ble at that, I will give you something to grumble for," and struck Ives in the face with both fists—Ives had not struck either of them—he put up his shovel before his face to shield it from the blow—he had one hand in the han<lb/>dle, and the other on the iron part—I was close by—he made no attempt to hit Kemp or Crudgington with the shovel—Kemp rushed into him, pushed the shovel out of his hand, and struck him an open blow on the side with the edge of the shovel, with a swing—he staggered, but did not fall—I spoke to him, but got no answer—I believe his breath was taken away with the blow; he was quite bent up putting his hands to his side—Crudgington then struck at him his fist—I cannot say if he struck him in the face or not—he then said, "Don't hit him any More"—Kemp threw the</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">BENJAMIN CLARK</hi>. I am a surgeon, at Hackney. I was fetched by Cobley, on Sunday evening, 2nd Jan., and found lves almost in a dying state, labouring under an attack of small-pox—he complained of an injury in his side—I administered such remedies as I thought applicable, and attended him every day till he died, on Monday morning, the 10th—I considered it a favourable case of small-pox, though very severe, but it declined—there is a crisis in small-pox; it reaches its highest point, and recedes—that had com-pletely passed before his death—I should say, when I saw him on the 2nd, it wanted about forty-eight hours to the crisis, which was on the evening of the 4th—he passed it remarkably favourably—I said, that as the small-pox declined, his side would be affected—I heard that he was suffering from violent paroxysms of pain in the side, and before I could reach him he died—the small-pox would act as a counter-irritant to assuage the pain in the side—as it approached the crisis, the pain in the side diminished, and as it declined, the man complained—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and finding none of the marks which we usually find on death from small-pox, my opinion is that the disease, in its inflammatory stage, prevented inflammation going on in the stomach, as the result of the previous injury—four ribs were fractured, and the spleen immediately under them was contused—there was inflammation of the membrane lining the cavity of the stomach—the inflammation and contusion of the spleen were clearly referable to the fracture of the ribs, which appeared to have been done a fortnight or three weeks before; but the disease had prevented union—there was very little attempt at bony union; that would be checked by the small-pox—there was nothing during life, or after death, to induce me to think death was caused by small-pox—I should say he died from extreme exhaustion, by the shock he received from the injury in the side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you swear the small-pox had nothing to do with his death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The combined effects of the small-pox, with its ex-hausting influence coming on that which had previously exhausted him, would of course accelerate, or rather produce death—the exhaustion was the com-bined effect of the two causes—it is more than probable he might have rallied from the effect of the injury, if there had not been small-pox—in saying it was severe, I mean the eruption was extensive—Mr. Bull assisted me in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—in my opinion, death was caused by the com-bined effects of the injury and the small-pox.</p>

Hewlett laughed, and made some kind of re<lb/>mark, and told us to be comfortable; we went into the liquor-vaults and had some gin, when we came down Goswell-street; and he turned round to Hewlett, and said, 'I can get her <hi rend="italic">monkey</hi> up at any time, I'm going to meet a little wench;' we went down Fann-street, and into Golden-lane; we went into the Duke of Bedford; I lost him there, and never saw him again, not till this day; he has been the cause of all our misfortunes, him and that woman there."</p>

On the morning of 9th Jan., I saw the prisoner Lee in front of his house, about a quarter-past eight o'clock—I went into the area of 79, and watched, and saw Reardon open the door of 80—Lee was against the door—there was no knock—Lee stepped just inside the door, and I saw Reardon give her a bundle, which did not appear bigger than a peck measure—it looked like a bundle of clothes, it was tied in an apron—Lee went with it down the street—I followed her, and round the next turning I stopped her with it—I said I must know what she had got—she said, "What I have got!"—I said, "Yes; I must know what you have got"—she began to beg and pray, and said it was only a few coals she had from the servant—I said if that was all she had got. she should not hear any more from me at present—there was a hole in the apron—I saw what was in it—I went home and told my master—he sent me for a policeman, and Reardon was given in charge—she said she was very sorry, she had only given a few coals away, and she would pay for them—after she was taken to the station, I went with the policeman to Lee's lodgings—Reardon gave me the direction—I did not see Lee there—I found there nearly half a hundred weight of coals, some of them of the same sort as my master was burning—there might have been about twenty pounds of coals in the bundle—next day I found Lee was in custody—I am sure she is the person.</p>

On 19th Jan., the prisoners came together into the tap-room, and had some beer and bread and cheese—my master went out, and after he was gone, the prisoners asked me if they might go up stairs to play at bagatelle—they went up to the play-room, the first-floor front room—I had been there ten minutes before—the balls were all safe, and there was an odd ball in a box on the mantel-piece-Elson afterwards came down for half-a<lb/>quartern of gin—he took it up stairs—in a short time he came back with the glass—he went up again, came down, and went up again—he at last came with Elderkin, and they both went away—I went up stairs before they had hardly got out of the house—I missed nine balls off the board, and the odd ball also—I have not seen them since—the prisoners were not up stairs above a quarter of an hour—no one went up stairs but them.</p>

I went to the prisoner's lodging on 26th Jan., and saw him there—Mr. Cook said he had come to see what quicksilver he had got there of his—he said he had not got 1lb. of quicksilver in the place—Mr. Cook put the question more closely to him, and we made known what we came about—I told him that that boy was my son, and I was determined to have justice done—I asked if he had received silver from that boy—he sad, "No"—Mr. Cook then sent for the policeman—the prisoner then acknowledged receiving one bottle of quicksilver, and said, "Mr. Cook, do forgive me, I will pay it you back again"—I asked what business he had to make a meeting with my son—he said he had borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the stone-yard, at St. Pancras. I missed two shovels on 12th Jan.—they had brand-marks on the handles—they never came back—the prisoner Bushell was at work that day in the stone-yard, and so was Nathan—Jennings was employed in bringing stones into the yard, and so was Tolliday, I believe, by the wharfinger—I went to Tolliday's house on the following Saturday—I found him in possession of this shovel, but by reason of the brand-mark being erased, I would not swear it is ours—our shovels are marked in this way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bushell. Q.</hi> Had I no use for a shovel in the yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he last load of stones did not go out on 12th Jan.—I did not say, "Take that shovel and load the cart"—there was no cart being loaded that day.</p>

               <p>shovels in the yard—I missed two when I took stock, on the Wednesday night—I have no doubt that it belongs to the parish—those which are in my care I have under lock and key at night—the yard is attached to the workhouse in the King's-road—the foreman of the road may have some shovels, but I cannot say anything about them.</p>

The prisoner is one of his apprentices, and had been so for about two years—he had been living with us three years—my husband had one other apprentice, and a journey mas, who worked for him, and who had served his time to his—he did not life with us—the two apprentices, my husband, myself, and three gentleman lodgers, lived in the house—there was no servant—on Sunday evening, 5th Dec., I am my husband went out soon after six o'clock, leaving the prisoner in the house—the other apprentice was out for the day, and the three lodgers, who were friends, had just passed down the street before us—there was no<lb/>body left in the house but the prisoner—my husband goes to Falcon-street Chapel, and I go to Church—while at Church, about seven, a neighbour gave me some information, which induced me to go home immediately—I found a crowd there, and I believe an engine—I think the prisoner was in the passage, but I am not quite certain—I immediately went up stairs to the bed-room, and found a policeman and fireman there—I had left the room door locked—when I got back, the catch of the lock was turned down and hanging by one screw as if it had been wrenched off—the bed-furniture was nearly all</p>

About half-past six o'clock, on the night of the fire, I saw the prisoner at the door of the house—it was almost momentarily after the alarm of fire—he had a dark japanned hand oil-lamp in his hand—it was alight—he said the fire was there—I asked how it occurred—he said he supposed it was by his mistress' taking a lamp up stairs, to dress for chapel; that the wick had fallen or blown off the top of the lamp, and set fire to the bed-curtains—I left him at the door, and went back to my own house, as I had left my door open—I saw several persons going in to the house at the time—I left him standing at the door.</p>

On this Sunday I went to the house between seven and half-past, and found the prisoner there, with Mr. Hanaford, in the back parlour—these two boxes were produced—I asked if there was anybody to send for Mr. Hanaford, and the prisoner went—I went with the firemen into the top back bed-room—I noticed the door—there was a slight indent between the door and the wood-work, as though a screwdriver, or something of that sort, had been pushed in—there were two marks, one about six inches below, and the other about six inches above, the lock—I went to the cupboard door; it was wide open, and on one of the shelves, where the cash box was, close against the wall, and in front of the cash-box, was a quantity of paper—this burnt paper and pitch was by the side of the cash-box—a quantity of loose paper had been on fire, and this pitch was between it—the paper was very wet with turpentine and water—there was full half a bushel of paper, beside that which was burnt—the lock of the cash-box appeared to be towards the wall, and immediately over the cash-box, on the next shelf, was this hare's foot—the paper was on the shelf where the cash-box was, and on the shelf above it—there was an indent on the cupboard door, as though a screwdriver or some instrument had been used to force it open—it was near the lock, but more towards the door, so as to release the lock from the door, as if by being <hi rend="italic">prised</hi>—it had been forced back—the bolt of the lock had been released from the hasp—the bolt was shot when I saw it—I compared the marks with a screwdriver which Mr. or Mr. Hanaford gave me out of the back kitchen—it appeared that the same instrument had been used to open both doors—I have brought the cupboard door here, but not the room door—the marks on the bed-room door cor<lb/>responded with those on the cupboard door—the cash-box was on a shelf, and above that was another shelf, on which there was a quantity of loose paper, and just projecting over the shelf above the box was this hare's foot, quite saturated with turpentine, and the whole of the paper on both shelves was sprinkled with turpentine—the shelves were burnt a very little at the edge—at the top part of the bed-room door the paint was blistered by the fire, as though the fire had escaped after the door was opened—the bed furniture and some part of the things were burnt, and the chimney-board—I saw pitch in the cupboard and on the papers—the centre part of the paper was much more burnt than that above and below—that was n the shelf that the box was on—the edges of the paper above were burnt—some of the papers which were not burnt had stains of turpentine on them—I did not notice any marks of turpentine on the cupboard door—when his master came home, the prisoner and he went with me into the bed-room—I asked the prisoner how the fire originated—he said he did not know—I asked how he first discovered it—he told me he thought it was on the first floor, that he went there, and found it was not there, he went to the second floor, and found it was in his mistress's bed-room—I asked if the door was open, and he said it was shut—I asked bow he got it open—said he got a pair of tongs, and gave it a blow, it then gave way a little, and he pushed the remainder open with his hand—I examined the door—there were no marks of tongs on it—the prisoner was given into custody about eleven o'clock—he said, "It looks very black against me; I am innocent I not care for myself, only for my poor</p>

On 28th Oct., between seven and eight o'clock, a communication was made to me—I went down and examined my premises—I found the flap of the coal<lb/>cellar open, and a hole had been cut sufficient to allow a large hand to be put in, and the bars inside to be removed—I returned into the house, and found a large panel taken out of a partition in the side of the wine-cellar—I entered the cellar through the hole, and found it was empty—I missed between 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property—this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is mine—I saw it safe the day before.</p>

I saw this book (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) at Mr. Stibbs', in the Strand—it was one which I had care of for Miss Levy—it was sent to be bound in 1842—I had not missed it—I am positive of it—it must have been in my possession at the close of 1845, because I built some workshops, and this book was stowed away there—I produce a tool which fits the orna<lb/>ments in the corners—I bound it myself—a man robbed me formerly, but it was in my possession after he left—I know I moved it when the workshop was completed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Lower Brook-street, Grosvenor-square—I have some race-horses. On 4th Dec. last I received this letter, marked "A"—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—" Mr. Kirtons', 3, Peerless-place,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184801310115"/>
               <p>City-road, 4th Dec., 1847. Sir,—Understanding you are the confederate with Mr. Mostyn, in the Bea<lb/>tinck stud, I take up my pen to disclose the whole affair relative to the horses belonging to the Goodwood-stables being got at this last racing sea<lb/>son, more <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> in reference to <hi rend="italic">Planet, Redhcart</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Glentilt</hi>; and if we can come to terms, as I can prove the facts, the of <hi rend="italic">Planet</hi> and the other horses, <hi rend="italic">was</hi> got at, and a certain drug given to them so as to ensure their losing any race they starts for, and likewise injuring the constitution of the horses. I hear that it has been hinted, in some paper, this last week, that the trainer, Kent, knows all about it, and the stable likewise; but this I can prove to be false, and likewise that the same parties will again, if possible, get at the Goodwood Derby horses again next year, as one of the parties engaged in that affair is busily engaged in laying long odds against a horse called <hi rend="italic">Surplice</hi>, in the stable. If, Sir, you choose to come to my terms, the parties all concerned in the affair shall be given up to you, and likewise some of the stuff that was given to the horses, with every proof of the same, and no surmise, but all facts. My terms are as follow: that you shall send me, per return of post, on the receipt of this letter, a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I will then meet you on Thursday; it cannot be before, as one witness will have to come from the country, and I must send him some money down to pay his expenses up to London, at any place and time you choose to appoint; and I will bring all the witnesses and proofs against the parties engaged in it; and after I have done so, and have proved to your satisfaction that what I state is true, and the parties are in your possession, that you shall further remunerate me with a sum of not less than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. If you agree to this, I shall thank you to let me hear per return of post, so that there be no delay in the affair, and that the parties engaged in it may be thoroughly exposed. Awaiting your answer, I remain, Sir, your obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY HALFORD</hi>.')—In consequence of receiving that, I wrote a letter addressed to Henry Halford, 3, Peerless-place, City-road—I have no doubt that letter was posted—(<hi rend="italic">the prisoner admitted that notice had been given him to produce this letter, but denied having it</hi>)—it was to the effect that I should be happy to hear anything he had to say if he called on me, but I should decline sending the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till I heard something more—some days after the prisoner came to my house, and represented that he had been sent by his father, who was unable to come himself—he asked me whether I had not received a note from his father, Henry Halford, promising to give me some information with reference to a conspiracy, which he alleged had existed, and did exist, for the purpose of drugging or poisoning race-horses; and if his father had not undertaken to produce certain witness, if 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given him for the purpose of paying their necessary expenses up to London—I told him that I had heard from his father to that effect; and upon his further statement I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave his own name as Alfred Halford—he said he was to take he 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his father; that he had sent him for it; that he was going to Manchester, for one place, and was to fetch up three witnesses, named Wood, Thacker, and Phelps—I do not know such persons—before I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he produced to me this letter, signed "Williams"—he said he had it from his father—he said his father had been implicated in these conspiracies for some yeard, and he had received large sums of money at different times—this is a letter purporting to come to his father, from Williams, the head of the gang—(<hi rend="italic">this letter was dated 13th Dec.</hi>, 1847, <hi rend="italic">from the Prince of Wales, Clarence-street, Brighton, in which several parties were named as connected with the supposed transaction, out of which the writer hoped</hi> 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">would be realized</hi>)—he said that his father did not intend to disclose the names of all the partied engaged, but only those certain partied who had behaved shabbily towards him upon some oc<lb/>casion; that he himself had not, up to that time, taken any part personally in the conspiracy, though he was aware of what had been going on; that he had no desire to take any part in it, but that his father and brother had not behaved well towards him; and as he knew they meant to deceive me, he would, if I would reward and protect him, work on his own account, and get me information which they intended to deny me—upon the strength of this statement, I gave him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give to his father—I took this receipt from him—I wrote it, and he signed it in my presence—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my father, Mr. H.

                  </hi>. I am one of the superintendents of the detective police. In consequence of a representation that the prisoner expected to be poisoned, I accompanied Lord Henry Lennox, Mr. Lloyd, and the prisoner to Marlborough-street Police-court—the prisoner made a deposition, in consequence of which, on Tuesday, 11th Jan., I obtained a warrant, which I have here—I set out with the prisoner to find the parties named in it—we walked about from twelve or one at noon till midnight—we went to a great number of places—I at last gave up the pursuit, being satisfied he was telling me an untruth, but I sent another party on—I was regularly <hi rend="italic">knocked up</hi>—I told the prisoner to be with me to breakfast at nine o'clock next morning—he did not come—before I saw him again I learnt his name, and who and what he was—I had been to Castle-street, Finsbury, to Mr. Henley's—next evening I went to Mr. Lloyd's, and the prisoner was sent for—I asked him the reason he had not met me—he said he had been to see Mr. Lloyd, at eight o'clock, and was coming to see me at nine, but he had met his father in the Quadrant; that from there he went to Oxford-street, and afterwards took a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and went with his father to various places about town, which was the reason he did not meet me; his father was to see me and <hi rend="italic">put me on</hi> the persons men<lb/>tioned in the warrant—I then said that everything he had been telling me was an untruth, and he must consider himself in my custody—I charged him with obtaining 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Lloyd under false pretences, and told him that his name was not Henry Halford, that I had found out his name—he after<lb/>wards admitted that his name was Thomas Harris—I told him where his father lived, and who he was, that I had found out all about him; that his father used to keep a public-house; that he said his father lived at 13, Castle-street, which was untrue; that I understood he had been dead four or five years—he admitted it—he had said he had a brother and a father, who had got one of the parties named in the warrant safe, for me to apprehend him—I told him that was untrue, that he had no father, only two sisters and a mother—he admitted t, and then begged for mercy of Mr. Lloyda I have seen the prisoner write—he wrote me a letter, to meet him at the prison—I met him, and be afterwards admitted having written it, and the wrote a letter in my presence—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I told him I believed all the letters to be in his writing—he did not acknowledge it, but I saw four of his letters—I also saw him sign his name—I believe all the letters which have been produced are his writing.</p>

I was in Calremont-mews on 23rd Dec., and saw George there, who was intoxicated, and asked the prisoner to move the b—<hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, which were about fifteen yards from his door—he fell on the shaft through intoxication, and as he got up he fell again—the prisoner them put the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> back into their place—George then put the trussel on Ram's toes—Ram shoved him on one side, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the trussel across the yard, in a contrary direction to that in which George was standing—George ran to the stable and brought out a fork, and worked for upwards of an hour—George offered to fight the prisoner if he would reduce himself to his weight—Ram pushed George down in his own defence.</p>

               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">ARNOLD</hi>. I am the wife of George Arnold, a horse-keeper, in the mews. George came home at half-past twelve, in a very intoxicated state—I saw him fall twice in moving Ram's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he moved the trussel up by the corner of a coach-house, and then ran up to the prisoner, who gave him a push, and he fell on his head and cut it against a stone—Ram put the trussel on one side—he did not throw it at George's head—he was not hit with it.</p>

George was drunk and lying on the ground—I saw him get up and fall again—he went and caught hold of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and in trying to pull it away he fell again over the shafts, and the trussel fell against his own coach-house door—I do not know who put it there—it was standing against the door—I saw George move it, and put it against a pair of wheels belonging to Ram, who was five or six yards away—I did not see it put on Ram's toes—Ram caught hold of it and threw it one side—he did not throw it at George's head—I saw his head bleeding—he was lying with his face on the stones, and I think it was the stones that gave the wound—the trussel never touched him.</p>

I have known Walker about two years—I saw Walker on Thursday evening, 6th Jan., about seven o'clock—he asked me to try to get some money—I said I would try, and the next day, when my mother came down stairs, about eight, I went into her bed-room, took the key out of the drawer, unlocked the chest, and took out a gold watch, two pairs of earrings, a brooch, two finger-rings, and a gold pin—these are the earrings (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Walker was at this time at the corner of Helmet-row, in sight of the house—I saw him there when I came down after breakfast—I beckoned to him—he came to the door, and I gave him the watch and jewellery—I told him I should be out in half and hour, and to wait for me at the corner of Helmet-row—my mother gave me this hand<lb/>kerchief to blow my nose with—I went out in half an hour, found Walker there, and went with him and another boy to Holmes's, in London-passage, Whitecross-street, and then to Hine's house, in the Vinegar-ground—Walker gave Hine the watch—she went out, and returned in three quarters of an hour with three others—Jones is one of them, and Hawkins another; the other was a man named Mitchell, and Hine asked me if it was right—I said yes, and they all went out but me, Walker, and Holmes—they came back in about a quarter of an hour, and Hine said they had sold the watch for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was produced—Hine went out for change—I had a sovereign, and Walker another—they kept the rest—Hine and Mitchell said they should keep that for their <hi rend="italic">regulars</hi>—Jones was there and heard that—as soon as they came back I asked Hine if they could sell the jewellery—they were all there then—she said, "Let me look at it"—I gave it her, and she said she should keep it for her <hi rend="italic">regulars</hi> as well—Walker showed the handkerchief to Jones—she snatched it out of his hand, and said she should keep it, as all</p>

Atten<lb/>borough's—I went straight from there to Debenham's (no one was with me from the time that I left Messrs. Attenborough's) when I got there, Quelch remained in charge of the van, and I carried the box and the other things from the van up stairs of the warehouse—I left Quelch by himself with the van for two or three minutes, from time to time—the box was not locked—I cannot say whether it was taken in first, or some other things, or whether I left Quelch and the with the box while I went in with something else.</p>

I saw Quelch in Drury-lane; he came as if from Broad-court—I saw him hand a small brown-paper parcel to Carter—I had known Carter before, but not Quelch—I am certain he is the boy—I went up Drury-lane—I after<lb/>wards saw Carter higher up—I saw her call Kelly across the road, and give him a small brown-paper parcel—it seemed to be just the same that I had seen Quelch give to her—Bell was at that time on the opposite side of the street—Kelly went and showed it to Bell, and I saw it was a small yellow watch—I could not see who opened the parcel—it was opened when it was in Kelly's pocket, I suppose—it was open when Kelly showed it to Bell—I was passing by at the time—it was similar to the watch now produced—Kelly and Bell went straight up the lane towards Holborn—I do not know what became of Carter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, in partnership with my brother, and live at West Ham. On Thursday evening, 27th Jan., I went into my chaff-house, between six and and seven o'clock—my brother called my attention to it—I found the lock on the chaff-house door, but not locked, which it ought to have been—it was in Newman's charge, he was the chaff-cutter—I opened the door, and found a bag of beans hid under the clover—it ought not to have been there—he ought to have mixed the beans up with the chaff he had cut that day, and given it to the carters for the horses' food—I mixed some wheat with it, cut up some green willow rods, and put them with the beans, to identify them—I left the sack where I had found it, and shut the door—Hewett was in my employ—it was his business to drive my horses to</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and live at Chislehurst. I have a shop at Deptford—in Nov. last the prisoner was my shopman there—I gave him notice that I would discharge him, and gave him till the Saturday week to find other employ—on 16th Dec., in consequence of information, I went to a place which I found to be his residence, in Victory-street, Deptford New Town—I there found four iron rods, some brass rod, some remnants of cloth and cotton, some counterpanes, skeins of silk, buttons, lining, and some show-tickets—I know them nearly all as mine—I found two of these iron rods under his counter, and one over the counter with a lamp suspended to it, and one out<lb/>side with goods on it—two or three of them had been altered to fit that shop—this is a portion of a brass rod, about eight feet long, which I had suspended in my window—it has been broken to fit his shop—he had no authority to take any of the fittings of my shop away, or anything else belonging to me—the book is here, in which he made entries of anything he sold or bought, there is no entry of his having bought any cloth of me—I never sold him any—I gave him in charge—when I went to his shop, I said I had been given to understand he had property of mine-there, and I had come to see what he had got—he said he had nothing of mine there, and it was a paltry notion of, me coming to his place to search—when the officer took this cloth out of the cupboard, the prisoner said he had purchased it on Holborn-hill, that it did not belong to me, and that he had bought two of the irons from a man named Myson, who had worked for me, and the other two were put among his things by mistake—I had never parted with them to Myson, or authorised him to take them away—here is about one yard and seven-eights of this beaver cloth; I miss about three yards and a quarter off the corresponding piece, which I have here—I have missed from a piece of lining, eleven yards and three quarters; here are about eight yards and a half—it was in the shop a few days before he left—here is a trowsers' length of buckskin: I can<lb/>not tell how much is gone from the piece it was cut from, as the ticket is gone, but I have the remainder of it, which corresponds with the cut—these are the two pieces he said he bought on Holborn-hill—here is another piece, two yards and a half of buckskin, I am two yards and a half deficient of the same colour and texture, and I have the piece to match it—this counterpane has got the register mark on it—I have lost five of them—this bears the ticket which it bore when it was in my possession—this book, which I saw at my house, bears the name of every customer he has been serving for eight months, since he has been in my house—it is his writing—he sent me a copy of it before.</p>

               <p>prisoner came into my service in March—he loved in the house with his wife and family—he had his own furniture—I gave him notice on a Monday, in Nov.—I told him he must get out by that day fortnight—I did not tell him on the Saturday that he must go then—I did not tell him when he came for his wages on Saturday night, that if he opened a shop near me I would soon put a stop to that—he has opened a shop near me—it is not a grievance to me that he has got my customers; I should be glad to see any one do—on that Saturday night he was very abusive—he did not then tell me to come and see if any thing of mine had got away in his things: he did on the Saturday week following—I did not go then—I have brought nearly all the books connected with my business—he had to keep them all, to serve cus<lb/>tomers, and cut out garments, and dress the windows—when we found the counterpanes in his house, he said that they were put round his own tables to prevent their being scratched, and that the person who moved the things for him, had moved the four pieces of iron and the brass without his know<lb/>ledge, or something of that sort—I occasionally have taken the books to Green<lb/>wich, to make them up—while they were there, things could not be entered in them, but I never took the sale-book away—me nephew was in my service—he has left six or seven months—it was not then that I took the books away to make them up—I have twice sent my father-in-law, Mr. Coltman, to the prisoner for the cash, when I have been away for a week—the prisoner used to put it down on a slip of paper—he had a balance-book to enter it—I was throws out of a gig, and was away eight or nine days; I was confined to my bed for a week—I do not remember that when the prisoner came for his wages he said he would come if he was sent for—I asked him one or two questions on the Saturday, but he was very loath to tell me anything—I never au<lb/>thorise the persons who serve in my shops to make abatements—it was my wish for them not to do it if they could avoid it; but they have done os. I have not the least doubt—I cannot remember the exact time I took away the books—it is very likely I took the prisoner's stock when he left—he left on a Saturday, I think on the 10th Nov.—I took the books away two or three days before he left, and I sent them back I think on the follow<lb/>ing day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wool-dealer, at Marlborough-place, Old Kent-road. I have a warehouse and premises in Grange-walk, about 150 yards from a public-house—there is a bottom floor, and a second and third floor—there are two doors to it in the yard, and steps leading up to another door—a person outside could get into the bottom-floor by opening one of the doors. but I understood they were closed—the wool was on the ground-floor—I had not given orders on 23rd Dec. for the delivery of any wool—on 24th Dec. I missed two bags, one larger than the other—they weighed 42lbs., and were worth from 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I went out with Quincey, with his wagon—I assisted him to load it with barley, at Shott's wharf, Rotherhithe—I went up to the stable at six o'clock that morning—he had fifty quarter sacks in the wagon, three new empty sacks, and some horses' food in one of Mr. Shott's sacks—there were three nose-bags—I filled them—Quincey put the food into sack—I hung the nose-bags on the wagon, and Quincey told me to put the horses' victuals at the top of the gateway till he came round with the wagon—I then went down to the warehouse, and he had eleven sacks of flour in the wagon—he then came up to the gateway, took the horses' victuals, and we went to the Saxe Coburg—he took the sack of horses' victuals and the three new sacks into the shed—he wanted me to get up into the wagon and get them out—I went to the privy, and when I came back I saw the two prisoners talking together—I did not hear what they said—we then went to the Brighton Railway and to Deptford, with the flour,—we delivered the fifty sacks of barley at the New Cross-station.</p>

Newton was in my service about eleven months—on the evening of 5th Jan., I was induced to watch him closely—I saw him go towards the slaughter-house between seven and eight o'clock, and heard him say to my brother, "I have just met Mr. Gillespie's cook, and she told me to bring a paunch down"—I knew he had taken one there the night previous—I thought it was false, and followed him down the yard, and when he had got into the slaughter-house I was just at the bottom of the garden, ten or twelve yards from the slaughter-house—I listened and heard him unbolt the back door of the slaughter-house, which opens to a passage leading to my slaughter-house, and to my neighbour's next door—it is opened occasionally—shortly after, he came out, and came past me—I said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "A paunch," and he told me the same story he had told my brother—I went into the slaughter-house—the back door was then fastened—I unfastened it, and went out—the passage was dark—I could not see anything—I felt about, and found a sack</p>

               <p>of fat a yard and a half, or two yards from the door, further up towards the end of the passage—I shut the door, and held it in my hand—I stopped a minute, or a minute and a half—I heard some one walk past the door up to the corner—I waited a minute or two till I thought he was ready to start, and then opened the door—it was so dark I could not see anything—I said, "Halloo! you are just the man I am waiting for"—I immediately felt Mat<lb/>thams—he had moved the sack from where it had been before—it was not a foot from him, close to his feet, and close to the door—it had been moved a yard and a half, or two yards from where it had first been—I am positive no one else had passed up the passage—I took him by the collar, and led him into my kitchen—I wanted him to bring the sack of fat—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I said, "I know, and I will let you know shortly"—he said he had come up the passage for a necessary purpose—his clothes were not undone—I gave him and Newton into custody—a sovereign, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. were found on Newton, and four sovereigns in his box.</p>
