               <p>I came from Covent-garden Theatre on the 16th of December last in a hackney coach, at about 10 at night, to Henrietta-street; I had a box upon the seat before me, containing a silver hair pin set with diamonds, 14 hair pins set with soil stones, a white sattin jacket, and a gauze veil; it was a large box and filled the seat. I dropped one of my clogs as I was getting out of the coach, and desired my servant to look after it, but forgot to give him charge to take care of the box; I enquired after it the next morning, when my servant told me, that he had forgot to take it out of the coach, but that he knew the person of the driver and the number of the coach.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner the person who drove the coach? - I believe so.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mrs. Barry. I put the box into the coach. I forgot to take it out of the coach when my mistress was set down. I am certain the prisoner is the coachman, the number was 101. I went to him the next morning: I asked him if he remembered carrying home Mrs. Barry the preceding night, and asked him about the box; he denied knowing any thing about it. I told him when he thrust his whole body into the coach to look for the clogg, he could not help seeing the box. Upon that he grew very angry. I told him he must know of it, and if he would deliver it that afternoon, I would give him half a guinea. I went afterwards by my mistress's order, and offered him 3 guineas; he said I must go to the lost and found office and get bills printed, and he bid me get the three guineas of my mistress; he went with me to the lost and found office to order bills to be printed; when we came out into Chancery-lane, he asked me if it would make any difference if he brought the things? I told him he might send a child with them, or send them to the lost and found office. I saw him again afterwards; he said then, he dared to say the things would come. I went again to him on the 18th of December. He asked me if the bills were out? I told him no. He asked again what reward my mistress would give? I said three guineas, and I would make it four. He said they must be advertised in the Daily Papers, and possibly they might be heard of. But they have never been heard of.</p>

               <p>After I set Mrs. Barry down, I took a fare, a man and a woman, to Basinghall-street; I observed when I set them down that they took a bundle or something out of the coach. The servant says he put the box into the coach. I had no charge of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish his person? - Yes, his face, which was not covered, was close to the coach; he held out his hand and I gave him a guinea and half and sixpence and some halfpence; I observed he dropped something out of his hand; I was also robbed of a stop watch, which is in the hand of a witness. West was afterwards taken at Bellfont; I saw him there at the sign of the Cock; I knew him immediately to be the person; I am very certain he is the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>When West was taken what money was found upon him? - He was not searched directly; I saw about eight or nine shillings when he was examined, which was the next day.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Staines. I was in the coach with the prosecutor; the coach was robbed opposite Mr. Cooper's house, by two highwaymen; one came to each door and demanded our money. I sat opposite Mr. Boult. West came to our side; he was dressed in a brown coat over a light coloured one; I could perceive something of his face, and his voice. I could see enough of his face to distinguish him among twenty persons when I saw him again.</p>
               <p>What expressions did he make use of? - He d - d his eyes and limbs if we did not deliver our money he would blow our brains out; the coachman looked at him; he told him that unless he turned his head he would blow his brains out. I saw Mr. Boult deliver his money; when he had robbed us he went towards London; Mr. Boult and I jump'd out of the coach and pursued him; we told the turnpike-man that we had been robbed; we went to Mr. Cooper's and got firearms, and got two horses and pursued them; we came up with Green; he swore he would not be taken alive; he snapped his pistol at Mr. Boult or me once or twice; it did not go off; my gun burst in my hand; then he rode off; we pursued after him as fast as we could; West jump'd off his horse, or fell off his horse; the horse went by us without a rider; the horses were afterwards stopped and restored to the owners; they had been stolen from Long Mead; we continued to pursue Green, but did not take neither of them that night.</p>
               <p>When Green nicked his pistol was you near enough to discern his person? - Yes, I could discern what sort of man he was, but not to swear to his face; I was almost close to him.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to say that Green is the man that you pursued that night? - I really believe so, I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Green was not taken the next day? - No, he was taken at Hereford.</p>
               <p>Did you take any notice of the face of West that night? - No, I did not; I was sent for the next morning about ten; West was at the Cock at Belfont.</p>
               <p>Was you in the room at the Cock as soon as Mr. Boult was? - No, but I heard him say he knew him before.</p>
               <p>When was Green taken? - On the 6th of last month, I pursued him to Maidenhead with Mr. Boult; we heard of him all the way down; we got a warrant of the mayor at Maidenhead; when I came to Maidenhead he was gone before some hours; I got intelligence of one of their boxes at the Rose and Crown; they told me there that he had lodged there a night or two, and they shewed me a box; the box belonged to Davis who was tried yesterday; we found a brace of horse pistols in it.</p>
               <p>Did Green lodge there as well as Davis? - One night he lodged at the Bull before Clack took Green and Davis at Hereford. I saw Green the week after before the magistrate; he pulled his cloaths off; we examined his back; he was very much shot.</p>
               <p>Did not your piece burst? - Yes, but Mr. Boult's went off; he was then about fifteen yards before us. Mr. Boult's pistol was loaded with shot No. 1. Green declared he would not suffer any body to dress his back; there were about thirty marks of shot; Davis said in the presence of Green that he picked three shot out of one hole himself.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect him there? - Not sufficiently to swear to his face. I thought he was the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150007"/>How near were you to West when you shot at Green? - I cannot say, they were both together when we came up; Green rode a black horse with a bald face, West rode a brown horse with a bald face.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough to distinguish the black horse from the brown? - We could see they were both dark horses.</p>
               <p>How did you know which was West's horse? - We shot Green's horse behind; there were 100 holes in him; he was killed the next day.</p>
               <p>Was Green's horse disabled by being shot? - I think he went faster after than before; we examined the horse that night, and picked a great many shot out; it was a very bad horse.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When you got out of the coach was it wet or fair? - I believe it did rain when we got out of the coach.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOULT again.</p>
               <p>Give an account of what happened after you were robbed - Immediately after we had been robbed we jumped out of the coach, and ran till we came within fifteen yards of the turnpike; we called to the turnpike man to shut the gate for we had been robbed by two highwaymen; then the robbers turned off to the right over the common, and so went a back way, as we suspected, to come again into the Staines Road; I believe they were within thirty yards of us when we called to the turnpike-man; we then ran back to Mr. Cooper's, and desired they would help us to fire-arms to pursue them; I got a blunderbuss, and Mr. Bridger got a gun; I loaded the gun with large Bristol shot, No. 1. there might be a slug among the shot, I cannot say; I put my hand into the bag and loaded it in a hurry; we asked for a couple of horses. Mrs. Cooper sent her servant to fetch two horses; my horse had a bridle but no saddle; Bridger's had only a rope, we went down to the corner of the road that goes towards Richmond; we had not rode down there but about five, six or seven hundred yards before we perceived they were coming towards us; we could see the bald faces of the horses; the one was a brown, the other a black horse; Green rode the black one.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive the horses had bald faces when you were robbed? - Yes, I called out to Bridger here they come, mind them; West turned aside, and Green came by us; I bid him stop, or I would blow his brains out; he swore he would not be taken alive; he turned his horse short round and came on the other side of me; then I bid him stop again; he swore again that he would not be taken alive, and then I heard his pistol nick; he was then about a yard from me at my side; I desired him to stop afterwards two or three times; he kept swearing he would not stop; I took aim at his back and fired at him; I imagine I might be about a dozen yards from him when I shot; fourteen was the outside.</p>
               <p>Did you hit him? - I believe so, I thought so then; West was coming up, but he got off his horse, or his horse threw him, I do not know which; his horse passed us without a rider; we pursued Green but did not take him, but we took his horse; he had got from his horse and made his escape.</p>
               <p>What became of Bridger's gun? - It burst all to pieces; it was double-loaded; he loaded it thro' a mistake, not knowing that it was loaded before; we thought Green had concealed himself; we alarmed the neighbourhood and went in search of him, but could not find him; when we came to the town we examined the horse, and found him wounded a great deal on both sides his hips, by which we were certain we must have wounded Green; we were informed on the Friday following that a man had lain with such a kind of a man who was wounded and could scarce stand upright, and who was gone to Maidenhead; we went to Maidenhead, and were informed by one Davis that he was gone to Hereford; we heard Sir

            's men were after him, and therefore did not go any further.</p>
               <p>Did the man describe how he was ill? - Yes, he said he could not stand upright, nor walk ten yards hardly without sitting down; I saw nothing more of Green till I received an express to go to Maidenhead. I am certain Green is the man I shot at, I took a deal of notice of him while he was robbing the other side of the coach.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150008"/>The way you met them then was the way they must have gone round the common, and the way they must have gone to Richmond? - Yes, there is no other way out of the common, unless within ten yards of the place they went in.</p>
               <p>Question from Green. What do you know me by? - By his face, by his clothes and every thing; I saw his face very plain then; I believe he had the same coat on he has now, and another coat over it almost of the same colour; it was a brown coat like that, it is not the same. I was at Maidenhead, and saw him strip'd.</p>
               <p>Green. When you was asked if I was the man, you said it was a dark night and you did not know me? - I did not say I did not know him, I said he was the man; there were a great many marks upon his back.</p>
               <p>Green. When I went into the room he came in and said Green how do you do, God bless you, and gave me his hand, and said he would never hurt me. - I went into the room and asked him how he did, and said God bless you; but I did not say I would not do him any harm.</p>

               <p>I know Green; he came on Wednesday the 3d of December to the George at Sunbury between nine and ten o'clock at night, and asked for a lodging; I have lodged there these nine months. I never saw him before to my knowledge; when he came in he said he was distressed for a bed, that he had fallen from his horse and hurt himself; the landlord said he had not a bed for him; I said if it was agreeable as he was in distress, and it was a wet night, he should lie with me, which he did; he called for some rum and water, and went up stairs; he put the candle out before he pulled his cloaths off; I heard the top of the measure go two or three times, but what he did with it I cannot say; he had the rum in a measure, and the water in a quart cup. I went to sleep, and slept till about four o'clock. He was very restless; we talked at four o'clock; I told him I had no work to do that day; he asked me to go with him; he said he had two bundles to carry; I told him I would, and went with him.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed? - He had a dark brown coat on, and a buff waistcoat. I went with him to Hanworth in the way to London; he was on foot; he said he was in great pain about his back; he said he was afraid it had hurt his kidneys; I did not see any wound he had; we went to Mr. Smith's at the Half Moon at Hatton, and drank a glass of brandy and water, and a glass of gin and water; we staid there about three quarters of an hour; it rained very fast then; I went with him across the country to the Coach and Horses, just on the other side of Cranford-Bridge.</p>
               <p>That is in the Bath and Oxford road? - Yes, he had no great coat on then; he got into a return post-chaise; I left him and the chaise, and went on to Colnbrook.</p>

               <p>I am Bridewell-keeper at Reading; I heard of this robbery at Staines; I was informed one of the men was shot and wounded in the back; I went in pursuit of them; I found Green and Davis at the King's-head at Hereford. I believe I had seen Davis before; I do not know that I had seen Green; I had such a description of Davis I could not mistake him; when I had searched Davis I went to Green; he said you know nothing of me I am sure; I said if I do not know your face, perhaps I may know your back.</p>
               <p>Had you any arms with you? - Yes, a long horse pistol in my hand.</p>
               <p>Did they see that? - I imagine so; Green made answer and said, be you up to that, old one? I said, yes, and a good deal more; he said do not use me ill, and I will give you no trouble; this was on Wednesday the 10th; I made a mistake yesterday when. I said the 7th. I searched him, and found a metal watch in his pocket; I put my hand down his breeches, and asked what he had got there; he said nothing that would hurt me, and put his hand in his pocket and gave me a brace of pistols. I did not see his back. I brought him to Maidenhead, where he was examined before the mayor. I went to Wickham to see after another of the party, and while I was gone he was taken to Reading. I found the prosecutor's watch on Davis.</p>
               <p>[The watch was produced in Court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>

               <p>I lodge at the King's-head at Ashford. West slept there on the 3d of December; we heard of the robbery next morning; we took West and carried him to Mr. Read's the Black Dog at Bellfont; there being nobody up but a post boy in the stable, we took him to the sign of the Cock opposite. Mr. Boult saw him there, and said he thought he was one of the men that robbed him; he was afterwards brought up to Clerkenwell. West had a kind of a light coat underneath, and a Bath coat over it; they were rather of a brownish colour. I clap'd my hand on him, and said he was pursued; he said be I by G - d? where are they, when are they coming? then he asked me to put him over the wall; I took hold of him, and told him he must come along with me; he asked me what for; I said he had not paid his reckoning; he said what is it, I will give it you; I will give you all I have got if you will let me go. I told him the landlord was coming, I would not let him go; he was searched at the Cock, but I was not present at the search.</p>
               <p>West. When he came after me he caught hold of my shoulder, and asked me where I was going; I said to London; he turned round and said there was somebody pursuing me; I was afraid it was a press-gang, I had been pressed before; they took me before the Justice and searched me, and found nothing upon me. He came to me when I was in prison, and gave me something to drink, and said he would not hurt me; he said afterwards d - n the dog, I will hang him; instead of 40 l. we ought to have 50 l.</p>
               <p>Baston. I went to him in Newgate, and gave him a glass of wine, and gave him a shilling. I said I would be as favourable to him as I could; it was not in my power to hurt him. I mentioned nothing of the money.</p>
               <p>West. When I was taken at Bellfont, he said I was come to the worst place I could, for that they always took them. - I said no such thing.</p>

I went at six in the morning, and bid the girl call the man I was with over night; he was called up; I went a little way with him to put him in the way to Hounslow; he told me if any body enquired after him to tell them that he was gone to Kingston or some other way, and bid me leave word at the public house the same when I went back again.</p>

               <p>I keep the Old White-horse public-house at Maidenhead. I have seen both the prisoners. Green lay I believe two nights at my house; I don't remember the time; he came as an acquaintance of Davis's, who lodged constantly at my house. Bridger came and enquired if Green had been there. I never heard of the robbery till he told me of it.</p>
               <p>How long before Bridger came might it be that he lay at your house? - I believe it might be a fortnight before. Green came on the 5th of December, and enquired if Davis was up; he went up to his room, and was there a considerable time; then he went away and went the road that goes to Maidenhead; and Davis went with the Oxford coach. Davis not lying there that night, my wife did not make the bed; when she went up the next day, she found a coat all wet and dirty in Davis's room; she gave it me; it is said to be much shot (it was produced in court) there were a brace of pistols found in Davis's box when the Justice broke it open. I expected Davis to return; he said he had a brother dead, and had asked his master to let him go into the country about a house.</p>
               <p>Had any body been in the room after he left it? - Nobody to my knowledge, but my wife; I took the coat and hung it out to dry; there was a yellow purse in one of the pockets.</p>

I bolted the lower part of the door (the door is divided), but I am not sure that I bolted the upper part; the door was shut; I had brought down three guineas, and put it in the till in a letter, just before. When I came up stairs the till was taken away: there had been a dozen pen-knives I had to dispose of in the drawer; I believe the children had had two out; there was likewise an old knife that was very remarkable, and which I can swear to; I have had it about six years. When I missed the drawer, two young men came in, and asked me if I had been robbed? I said I had lost my till. They said I must go directly with them to Justice Gretton's.

               <p>I am a constable. I took the prisoner up the last day of the old year at a puppet-show, between eight and nine at night. From the information of the master of the puppet-show to the Justice, that they had changed a guinea to see the show, and he thought they could not come honestly by it. I took them there; there were three of them; one was admitted an evidence, but we cannot find him now. This remarkable knife and four others, I found in Harvey's pocket; I found in his pocket a guinea and eighteen good and two bad shillings; when I charged them with it they denied it; the paper the knives were wrapped up in, and this letter (producing it), were found in the puppet-show room.</p>
               <p>[The knife was produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix.]</p>

               <p>Mrs. Giblet's son wanted to lie with me; I refused; he said if I would consent, he would give me these things, and would get me a place in the country; upon which I went up stairs with him; after he had done with me, he gave me the things, and then he got me a lodging: but he never came to see me from the time that I went away.</p>
               <p>Court. Where is the son?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. At home; he was at church with me. I am confident what she says is false.</p>
               <p>Court. Was your son at church with you all the time? - He came a little after eleven o'clock; our church is done about a quarter before one o'clock. I went out at about eleven o'clock, when the bell rang for church; he came to church in twenty minutes after; I believe it was not more.</p>
               <p>Was your son present when she was taken? - He was not there.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear this story before? - No, my son carries himself at a much greater distance than that.</p>
               <p>But did she ever pretend this before? - No.</p>

I saw a pair of new shoes; they said we need not trouble ourselves about the shoes, for they bought them; I said then, I suppose you stole the boots: Thomas made answer, d - n your eyes, that you may find out if you can. I told him I fancied we should find it out; accordingly they were advertised and owned by Mr. Robson on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Question from Thomas. Did I say d - n your eyes, as you said to his Lordship? - Yes. - Did not you take two other men into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150015"/> custody? - Yes, they were going up to see the prisoners; we let them go, and waited till the prisoners came home.</p>

               <p>What were you to give her the 6 d. for? some gallantry to pass between you? - Yes; then she robbed me of my watch. I felt her hand in my pocket, and I could not recover it; when I got up, I asked her for it; she said she had not got the watch, nor had she seen it. Cummins came in and asked what was the matter; I told her I had lost my watch; she said I never had a watch; I said I had, and would not go out without it. Smith struck me, and bid me be gone for a dirty dog; I said I would not go out without my watch; she pulled out a knife, and said she would cut my liver out if I did not go, and Cummins shoved me out and shut the door upon me. I never found my watch.</p>

I saw no watch.</p>

               <p>I went out between three and four o'clock on the 5th of January. I was not above twelve minutes before I returned and found my door unlocked. I went up to my room on the one pair of stairs, and I saw the shadow of somebody going up stairs, higher up than my room. I went into my room and saw a hat box, in which I had a gauze-cap open, and the cap gone. The prisoner was stopped in coming down stairs; I taxed her with the robbery; she had no apron on; Mrs. Waterloe called out, that she had dropped the things at her door. When she was in my room, she was shuffling her cloaths, and she dropped a key which would unlock my door; the constable came and searched her, and found five more keys upon her, and a piece of iron, fit to open small locks; the things were in her apron.</p>

I felt the prisoner pulling my watch out of my pocket; I got hold of her wrist; my watch was then quite clearly out of my pocket; I saw her hand it to a little boy who ran away with it, upon which I secured her.</p>
               <p>Was you perfectly sober? - Yes; I drank only a pint of ale; I had come from a benefit club, but I had drank nothing there to hurt me.</p>

I told him it was too early, therefore I would stop him; upon which his partner ran one way, and the prisoner the other. My brother watchman went after the prisoner, and I pursued the other, and secured the pigs. Ruddle came up on the 12th and claimed them.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of June in the evening, as I was coming into my lodging, I was assaulted by the prisoner and robbed of my watch: I stop'd to make water in the court; she came up and asked me if she should assist me; I said I wanted no assistance; she came forward and thrust her hand into my left hand breeches pocket; I was buttoning up my flap, and she drew her hand across my breeches and laid hold of the chain of my watch; I clap'd my hand to it, but could not prevent her taking it; I laid hold of her; there was a man behind her, who immediately made off; she cried out that I held her so fast; I said she had taken my watch, and desired her to deliver it; she said she had not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150025"/> taken it; I asked her who the man was that was with her; she said she did not know. A person that I knew happened to come up, and we took her to the watch-house; they told me to attend at Justice Durden's in the morning; I went, but the prisoner was not there; then I went back to the watch-house, she was not there; I went again to the Justice, and he said, perhaps they might have taken her before Justice Smith; I went to Justice Smith, and found she had been before him, but for want of evidence was discharged; she was not taken again till six months after. I am sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

Mr. Wright said he should know the man he bought them of if he was to see him; he came over to my house; I shewed him the prisoner; he said he would swear that was the man that brought them to him; I went and got a warrant and took him up, and he confessed that he was the man before we came before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Did you promise if he confessed he should not be punished? - No, he took me aside, and said open confession deserves open punishment; Master I am the man that took the skins; I hope you will not hurt me.</p>

               <p>Did you go to another bawdy-house? - No, to a public-house. I went to Justice Durden in the morning for a warrant, and went in search of the prisoners. We took them together; the officer found my buckles on Davis, and my watch on the other prisoner. I was present when they were searched.</p>
               <p>[They were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.]</p>
               <p>Was you accosted by one or two? - By two; I cannot swear to the other.</p>

I left my house on the 24th of December, at about eleven o'clock. I fastened up all the windows, and double-locked the door. I left no one in the house. On Saturday morning a neighbour came and informed me that my house was broke open; I went home, and found the parlour window shutter cut; there was a hole big enough to put one's hand through, and the bolt of the shutter was almost wrenched off, and it was wide open; two panes of glass were broke, and the inside shutter forced off, and it lay in the middle of the room. I missed the things mentioned in the indictment (repeating them) I found a tinder-box, a hammer, and a small iron crow in the room; I also found half of a twopenny loaf, and likewise a leg, a sidesman, and another small bone of a goose, that had been broiled.</p>

On Friday, the day after Christmas-day, I was fast asleep upon my box, having got a little liquor, it being holiday-time; Stevens came to me, and asked me if it was agreeable for me to go with him three or four miles; I said it was; I asked him where; he said to Chelsea; this was between eight and nine at night. He ordered me to drive to the George, Little St. Andrew's-street, Seven Dials, and call for a pint of beer, and he would come to me; I went there, and called for a pint of beer, and Pugh came in and took part of it, and paid for it; then he said we are ready; the company came, and got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Who were the company? - I could not see them then, it was dark, nor could I see what number there were; Griffiths got upon the box; the coach was full. Pugh went into the coach; at the end of George-street Stevens got out; he ordered me to drive to the Fighting Cocks in Dartmouth-street, Westminster; when we came to Dartmouth-street they all got out of the coach but Green; I was asked in with them.</p>
               <p>Did Stevens come there? - Yes, they were all there when I went in.</p>
               <p>Did you see Green in the coach? - Yes; they had a cold goose, not quite done enough, they had some of it broiled; when they had supped they all got into the coach except Griffiths, who rode with me on the box. I was ordered to drive to the top of Church-lane, Chelsea; I went there; they got out of the coach, and Griffiths got off the box, and they ordered me to wait; there were six of them; one they call Bob is not taken. It was between eleven and twelve o'clock when I got to Church-street; I waited between two and three hours; then they all came back together with bundles; they got into the coach; Griffiths got on the box; I don't know how many bundles there were; I was sleepy, as I had been drinking; I drove them to the end of Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury; there three of them, Griffiths, Bob, and Green got down, and a woman, whom I don't know, got into the coach, the other three stayed in; then I was ordered to drive to the end of Petticoat-lane, Whitechapel; there they took the bundles out, and discharged me, and Pugh said he would see me the next day, and pay me for my trouble; I saw no more of them till Monday night,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150028"/> then I saw Harvey, who they call Bob, and he paid me 15 s.</p>
               <p>You say you had been drinking that day, was you sober enough to know the circumstances you have related? - I had been drinking, it was holiday-time.</p>

               <p>Did you know upon what errand they were going to Chelsea? - No; they never said a word to me about it; they asked me to go to Chelsea; I said I would.</p>
               <p>You had been drinking that day, and was very sleepy? - Yes, I was asleep when they spoke to me on the box.</p>
               <p>What size were the bundles? - I did not take notice of them, I was on the box.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice how many there were? - No.</p>
               <p>Neither when put in nor when taken out? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not you taken up for this? - Yes, and have been in custody ever since; I never heard of the robbery till I was taken up.</p>

               <p>I keep the Fighting Cocks, a public house, in Dartmouth-street, Westminster; I have looked at the prisoners, but I don't remember them; I remember a company coming to my house the day after Christmas-day; they had all great coats, silk handkerchiefs, and flapped hats on; they asked for a room to eat some supper in; I told them I had no room, there was a good box in the taproom; they sat down, and asked for knives and forks, and a plate to put a goose upon; they began to cut it up, but they cut it up very awkwardly; I bid them cut it in the middle. I said it was very badly done, if they would give it me I would take it into the kitchen, and my wife should cut it up and broil it for them; they said they were very much obliged to me. While my wife was broiling it they ordered a pot of beer; I brought it, and asked for the money; they asked if it was the custom to ask for the money first; I told them it was in holiday time.</p>
               <p>Do you know how many there were? - Not the exact number; I thought there were eight or nine, my wife said six or seven. I can remember none of their faces, nor none of their persons, nor could I remember any of their faces before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they eat all the goose? - No; while I was taking money for some beer, I saw them wrap some of it up, and put it into their pockets, but what part I cannot tell.</p>

That is the prisoner Smith; it was a very light night, and besides there were two lamps near the place where I was robbed; there had been a fall of snow, which lying upon the ground, made it very light; he ran from me as soon as he had got my cloak, and the others likewise ran away. I immediately cried out, stop thieves; upon which a number of people came up, and before my brother came, they had brought him back; the cloak was brought to me.

I replied, if you say he is not the man, you must know something about the robbery. I secured them both; my sister came up and charged them with this robbery; he was in a lock-up house, which either is part of Justice Wilmot's house, or else adjoins to it: my sister charged Smith before Mr. Wilmot. Godfrey said in Smith's presence, that he had been with Smith that night at the White Horse in Wheeler-street, and from thence to the White Hart in Webb's-square; and that Smith came back again into Wheeler's-street and crossed over, and robbed my sister.</p>

I live in Tooke's-court; about one in the morning of the 4th of January, I met the prisoner; she wanted to entice me to her lodgings; then she proposed to go to my lodgings. I complied with neither of these propositions; then I found her hand in my breeches pocket; she took something out of my pocket; I saw her put something into her bosom, upon which I held her hands, and called the watch; the watch came up, and she was secured; I charged them to take care of her hands that she did not convey out of her bosom what I saw her put there; she was conducted to the watch-house by this man. The constable searched her, and found 4 s. upon her; I proposed that her stays should be taken off; upon taking off her stays and shaking her cloaths, there fell down a guinea, a half guinea, a half crown and a shilling, which with the 4 s. that were found before, made up the money that I missed.</p>

               <p>I had been very ill a great while; I sent to my parents in the country; they sent me up a couple of guineas that very day; I had been and redeemed my stays for 3 s. and that was the change; I had a hole in my stays, and I put the money into my bosom for safety. I was coming by the court and the gentleman laid hold of my hand, and pulled me up the court; he said he would not detain me long; I said I did not know any thing of him, and I did not chuse to stop in such a place to speak to any one; he lifted up his hand and was going to give me a slap in the face, and then said I robbed him; when they found the money they pushed me away, and should not let me say one thing nor another I had not any money to send for any friend.</p>

The prisoner came to our house on Thursday last at about two o'clock in the afternoon; she asked to look at a cotton-gown; I was busy serving another person; I saw the prisoner take seven handkerchiefs up, and put them under her arm; I saw some of them hang down under her cloak. I shewed her some goods to amuse her, while I considered what was best to be done. I went round the counter, and said she had some of my property about her, and took up her cloak and took these seven silk handkerchiefs from her.</p>

            ; I said to him, d - n you, you are my prisoner; you shall go with me to the watch-house. We had a struggle together for near five minutes; he held a pistol up to my head and snapped it; it struck a light, but did not go off; he d - d my blood, and said I was a dead man if I did not let him go; I let him go upon his saying that; then he stumbled up the two steps of the Monument-yard. I made a blow at him with my staff, but missed him; Lyons was near; I called out, Watch help me. Lyons ran down Fish-street-hill; I pursued him, calling out, stop thief. At the corner of St. Martin's-lane, Lyons fired a pistol and said, d - n your blood, I have another for you. I said, d - n you fire. He still ran on, and I kept crying out stop thief, knock him down. He made an attempt to fire another pistol off, when a watchman in Candlewick ward seized him, and knocked the pistol out of his hand, I said, that is the man I want; bring him back to our watch-house; the fact was done in our ward. They said no; he was catched in their ward, and should go to their watch-house; they took him to their watch-house; the officer came and searched him, but searched him very slightly, only on the outside of his pockets; he found nothing on him but the pistols. As they were taking him from the watch-house to the Compter, when he had got about four or five yards out of the watch-house, he dropped an iron crow. I had hold of the flaps of his coat.</p>
               <p>Was the iron crow such as he could have concealed about his cloaths? - I imagine it must, it is small.</p>
               <p>Who were in company then? - Two watchmen besides the officer?</p>
               <p>Then it must be one of that company that dropped the iron crow? - Yes; I heard it, and thought it a bunch of pick-lock keys by the gingle of it.</p>
               <p>Do you swear you knew the faces of the men when you saw them come out of the house? - No, not till I came up to them; but I swear the men I came up to, are the men I saw come out of the house; I never lost fight of Lyons from the time that he came out of Mr. Smith's house, to the time that I lodged him in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You struggled with another man for five minutes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not the other man endeavour to run away? - No, he stood still three or four yards from us.</p>
               <p>He never attempted to run away? - No; he stood still by the Monument.</p>
               <p>What time of night was this? - Two in the morning.</p>
               <p>The man might in five minutes have got a great way from you? - Yes; but he did not.</p>
               <p>When Lyons was at the watch-house not only you, but every person there searched him I believe? - No; the officer of the night, when he was first taken into the watch-house, only made a slight search.</p>
               <p>But a crow is a thing easily felt?</p>
               <p>Court. Produce the crow.</p>
               <p>[The crow was produced in court; it was about nine inches long, with a very strong purchase.]</p>

Do you apprehend that Lyons stood by when you was struggling with Miller, with an intent to aid and assist him to get out of your custody? or did he merely look on as an innocent spectator? - I know him to be one of the men that came out of Mr. Smith's house. At the time I had Miller by the collar, I kept my eye upon Lyons, left he should come and give me some fly blow, or do me some mischief.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>He did not say any thing to you? - No.</p>
               <p>You was struggling with a man whom you thought to be a bad man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not you at all afraid of that man's hurting, or doing something to you? - When I had Miller by the collar, I said, d - n you, you are my prisoner, you shall go to the watch-house with me. After I had struggled five minutes with him, he held a pistol up to my head and snapped it at me: Lyons stood two or three yards from me at the time.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say, you were as clear then about it as now? were not you at all agitated or frighted? - When he snapped the pistol at me and said, d - n your blood, you are a dead man, I let him go, and directly holloa'd out, Watch help me, knowing Lyons to be one that came out of the house; I called out directly, That is one; upon which Lyons jumped off the pavement, and ran down to Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Before this Lyons had not said any thing to you, or interfered in the least? - No; but I all along knew him to be one who came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you sober at the time, because I observe you swore a good deal? - I was sober.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>You have not informed us what became of Miller; you quitted him to pursue Lyons: was Miller taken that night, or did he get off? - He ran across Monument-yard, and got off that night.</p>
               <p>You did not know Miller before? - No.</p>
               <p>You now swear to him from having laid hold of him at two in the morning, and during the time you had hold of him, you kept your eye upon another man? - When I had Miller by the collar, I looked wistfully in his face; I then turned and looked at Lyons for fear he should give me some private blow or other.</p>
               <p>Have you heard that there is a large reward depending upon the conviction of these men? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You never heard any thing about it? - Not till after Miller was apprehended.</p>
               <p>When was he apprehended? - An advertisement in the papers came out the day after Christmas-day, and he was apprehended the Friday following.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there light enough to enable you to distinguish the faces of these two men? can you swear to the person of Miller? - I do swear to Miller; and as for Lyons I never lost fight of him.</p>

               <p>The prisoner Lyons was brought into the watch-house at about two in the morning, between the 18th and 19th of December last; I asked the watchmen of our ward, what he had done; they said that he had fired two pistols off; there were several watchmen of Bridge ward came in and said, they believed he had broke open a house; I did not immediately search him, but taking him out of the watch-house I heard something drop; when he was about two or three yards from the watch-house, I said he had dropped something; I turned about and picked up that iron crow; I am certain it was dropped by him; I had hold of him on one side, two watchmen had hold of him on the other, and one had hold of his coat behind: the crow was not dropped more than two foot or a yard from me; I picked it up; there were none but him and I and the watchmen present, and the crow was warm when I picked it up.</p>
               <p>Who were the watchmen? - Radford and Goodall were two. I took Lyons to the Compter; then I went to Mr. Smith's house with some of the watchmen, where I observed a mark upon the door like the mark of a crow: the door was broke a little, and the screws to the box which the bolt of the lock shoots into, were forced out.</p>
               <p>Did you take the crow with you when you went to Mr. Smith's? - I did. I tried it. I thought the marks on the door corresponded with the claw of the crow; the door was a little broke.</p>
               <p>[The two pistols, one a small pocket one, and the other a horse pistol, were produced in court.]</p>

               <p>I am porter to Mr. Neale. On Friday the 19th of last month I got up at about seven o'clock in the morning; I found the warehouse door fast; I unlocked the door; going down the yard, I saw some dirt on the lower part of a window frame in Mr. Smith's house; it had been painted but the day before, and some paint was rubbed off. Then I went towards the gates; I saw a bale had been cut open which was safe in the evening; the rope, which was about the bale was cut off in two or three places, and at the top of the bale the mats were cut open; one piece of Russia was taken out and flung into the kennel. I went and informed Mr. Neale of what I had seen; he came down and saw what was done; then I went to the gates and found them locked fast, so that there was no other way, all the gates being shut, of getting to this place, but through Mr. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Smith. You have removed no furniture into this house? - I have some there to the value of 10 l.</p>
               <p>Did any of your family sleep in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>There was no servant, or any servant appointed by you to sleep in the house? - No I intended to go in myself in three days.</p>
               <p>Were the goods you had in the house what you had bought with the house, or new ones? - New ones.</p>
               <p>Lyons. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Miller. I leave it to my counsel.</p>

               <p>I am a cabinet-maker; I have known Miller five years; he is a <rs id="t17780115-69-deflabel370" type="occupation">shoemaker</rs>

On the 18th of November he brought me home two pair of shoes which he had mended for me; we went to the ale-house to drink; we sat there a considerable time, as there was pastime going on; the landlord of the house was going out, and it was half after eleven o'clock before Mr. Wright the auctioneer had done the business for him, and when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150043"/> they had done the business they gave us some beer to drink, and about one o'clock Miller was very drunk; I went to see him home; I came back again at about a quarter before two, and went to bed. I saw him the next morning, and have never seen him since. I went to see him to his own house, because he was so drunk. The public-house is about three hundred yards from where he lives.</p>
               <p>What street did Miller lodge in? - He kept a house in Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>The reason why you saw him home, you say, was because he was very much in liquor? - Yes, we had the liquor given us; he was not able to walk when he came out in the air, but he was pretty well whilst he was in the house. I knocked at the door; his wife opened it; he went in, and there I left him.</p>
               <p>Was he in a condition, to your view, to have walked near a mile without tumbling? - No; I was in liquor, but I was better than he was; it is not usual for the house to keep up so late as that.</p>
               <p>Court. On what day was it that you say you went home with Miller at half past one o'clock? - It was on Wednesday; O no! the Thursday night.</p>
               <p>What made you take particular notice of the day of the month? - On account of the landlord's going out of the house.</p>
               <p>I suppose the landlord is here to confirm this? - No.</p>
               <p>You swear you was with Miller till one o'clock on Friday morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that he was then as drunk as you was? - He was drunker than me; when I went out at the door along with him, the watchman was crying past one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where was the public-house? - The Dial in Long-alley, Moorfields.</p>
               <p>You think you could not have walked to Gracechurch-street yourself at that time of night? - I don't think I could, and I was the most sober.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>What character has this young man born since you have known him? - I never knew any thing amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Court. If you was so very drunk how do you recollect the time? - The man that worked for me recollected the time; we have searched into it since the man was taken: I recollect too the time that I was with him.</p>
               <p>Is the prisoner your journeyman? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Because at the Mansion-house the prisoner was very insolent; he said he was neither a master nor a journeyman, but something between both, a chip; you see he says his trade is something like your name. Where do you live? - In Long-alley Moorfields, next door the to Dial.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a house-keeper? - I keep a part of one house, and have a shop over the Dial.</p>
               <p>Court. From what time was you there with him? - From five in the afternoon till one in the morning.</p>

I turned about; the prisoner was the next person to me: and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177712150044"/> saw a watch and chain in his hand. I seized his hand, but he conveyed the watch away. I had him secured, but nothing was found upon him, nor did I expect there would, he having conveyed it away. I made a grasp at the man next to him, thinking I might get my watch, but could not catch him.</p>

               <p>I was in the croud; the prisoner was not next to the prosecutor; there were three more between them; the prosecutor charged two other men before he charged the prisoner with it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never was in any doubt about the prisoner; but I charged another man at the same time, because I saw him receive the watch of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Question to Parrott. What are you? - A soldier in the guards.</p>
               <p>A common soldier? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you not inlist men for the East India company? - No.</p>
               <p>What trade is the prisoner? - I don't know, I had but a slight acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He interposed a great deal in it, and was taken up with him; he said the prisoner was his friend.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

I was there about two hours; the prisoner got up and went down for a light; they contrived to put the light out, and the other woman bid her go for a better light; she went and staid a good while; then the other got up and went for her, and left me in the dark; they never returned.

One was on a grey horse, and the other on a dark brown; the prisoner was on my side; one of them ordered the coachman to stop; one shot at the coachman first; the prisoner held a pistol to me, and the other held a pistol to Mr. Stanley; they demanded our money; I believe I gave the prisoner seven or eight shillings, or more; then he demanded my watch; I would not give it him, but jump'd out of the chariot, and struck at his horse, upon which he fired at me, and shot me in the arm.</p>
               <p>Was that man taken? - He was taken three or four days after.</p>
               <p>Could you swear to that man? - Yes, very safe. I am positive the prisoner is the man by his face and his size; he had a furtout coat on; I believe it was rather of a brown colour. I did not see him for four or five days, or a week, after he was taken; I was sick at home; when I saw him, I recollected his face immediately; I believe I had seen him before at Whetstone; he rode the grey horse; he had taken Mr. Stanley's watch, but I did not choose to give him mine.</p>
               <p>On Mr. Bishop's Cross Examination he said, it was light enough for him to discern the face of the prisoner from any other man; that he did not observe his dress, but believed he had a round flap'd hat, and that he (the witness) was perfectly sober.</p>

               <p>Did you observe the man on Mr. Bishop's side? - No; I had enough to do to take care of the man on my own side.</p>

I said no, he had offered me bad money; he then offered me another sixpence, and that was bad; a gentleman coming in said, we had better send for a constable and examine him; we sent for a constable; before he came, he offered me twopence for the crank, and wanted his bad sixpence again; I would not give it him.</p>

               <p>I live at a pastry-cook's in Newgate-street. On the 12th of January, about three in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our house and brought a tart; he offered me a bad shilling, and then another, and then a third, and then a bad six-pence; I told him if he offered such money he was liable to be taken up; he then put his hand in his pocket and paid me in halfpence, and went away.</p>
               <p>[ - Duncastle, a constable, produced four bad shillings which he deposed he found on the prisoner, and a bad six-pence which he received from Clarke; he also deposed that he also found on the prisoner thirteen or fourteen pence worth of halfpence, and two tarts.]</p>
