Mr. Carpenter's house—saw Ringham go down the lane—I then saw Lucas and another come over the hedge that parts the lane from Mr. Carpenter's garden—it is ata the back of the house—they joined each other, and all three came out of the lane together—Lucas had something under his arm—I went to tell carpenter—I found him in Mr. Webb's field, about a quarter of a mile off—I re<lb/>turned with him to his house—he opened the door with the key—I notice the window of the ground-floor room—all the iron was broken down, and a piece of wood broken off from the bottom of the window was a little open—Carpenter sent me for the police—I made inquiries of persons I met, in consepuence of which I went along the road till I got to Goodall's-corner, which wasa bout half a mile off—I there saw the prisioners standing—when I was about 100 yards from they went in-doors, into Lucas's house—I went to Dodd the policeman's house—he was at home, and I told him what had happened—I went back with him after the prisoners—I did not meet with them—I am certain the prisoner are the men—I knew Lucas before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Lockwood's-gardens, Clerkenwell. On Tuesday afternoon, the 31st of Dec, I was passing along Red Cross-street, from half-past four to a quarter to five o'clock—I stopped at Mr. Williamson's to ask the price of a pair of Blucher boots—whilst speaking to the boy belonging to the shop I saw both the prisoners—it appeared great deal of notice of me—after I priced the pair of boots I looked round and saw them close to my arm—I saw Lovell touch Davis, who imme<lb/>diately went'away, and went to the corner of Jewin-street, to the chemist's shop—they looked at me very hard—I had suspicion, and went a little further, and stood looking in the shop of Mr. Reeve, a pawnbroker—I saw Davis come by and look into a currier's shop, a door or two beyond Mr. Williamson's, and imme<lb/>diately go back again—Lovell then went by, and came back again—they went backwards and forwards several times, sometimes together, and sometimes alone—five or ten minutes after first noticing them the prosecutor was engaged taking his shoes in from outside the shop—at last only one parcel was left hanging on the line—I saw davis go by, and, as I thought, untwist them, but when I went up I found part of the string on the nail, and it had been apparently cut—he placed one hand on the boots, and the other on the top—immediately went and said to the prosecutor, "You have lost some boots," and called, "Stop thief!"—Lovell was about fifteen yards from Davis when be went up and touched the boots, about three doors off—he could see what Davis was about—he made motions with his hands to him, and shook his head—when I gave the alarm they both ran away—they turned down Jewin-street, and into Jewin-crescent—Davis was stopped in Aldersgate-street—I</p>

               <p>did not see Lovell till the policeman had Davis in custody it another shoe-shop in Aldersgate-street—we turned down Long-lane, Lovell fol<lb/>lowed on the opposite side, and when we got near the station he went away in the direction of St. John-street—next day I saw him at Guild-hall, lurking about the outside of the office—I mentioned who he was to the officer, and he was taken directly—I am quite certain he is the same man who was with Davis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Davis.</hi> I did not take the boots, and had nothing to do with them; I was running down Aldersgate-street, when the mob collected and took me; I was never in Red Cross-street at all.</p>

On the 28th of Dec., at five o'clock in the morning, I was passing in High-street, Kensington, and saw the prisoner Garlick walking up and down in front of Mr. Oak's shop—I lost sight of him for about two minutes, and then saw both the prisoners leave the gateway, two doors from the prosecutor's shop—Garlick had a large bundle tied up in a blue handkerchief—Laws went into the prosecutor's shop, and Garlick turned up Church-street—I stopped him, and asked what he had got—he said meat which he had bought at Newgate-market—I said, "That won't do for me"—he resisted very much, but I took him to the station, and found it contained a leg and a saddle of mutton and two pounds of beef steaks—I then returned to Mr. Oak's shop, and said to Laws, "I want you about that meat"—he said, "I don't know anything about it"—I called up Mr. Oak, who was in bed—he came to the station, and claimed the meat, and compared another leg of mutton, which he brought from the shop, with that leg—there is no communication with the gateway to Mr. Oak's shop the back way—Laws is Mr. Oak'i servant—I saw him open the shop that morning—nobody could get into the shop without his assistance.</p>

At half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 81st of Dec. my brother came to see me, and I was showing him over the house—I showed him into the front parlour—when I came to the back parlour I could not open it—I pulled it a second time, and got in—I found the pri<lb/>soner there standing by the side of the door—he was holding the handle of the door till I opened it, and then he stood quite still—I said, "You villain, what do you do in my room?"—he begged for forgiveness, and said it was the first time he had ever done anything—my brother seized him, and said to me, "Look at your drawers, they are all open, and that black bag is half filled"—I saw a black bag on the floor, and my brother held the prisoner till the policeman came—we then took the prisoner and the bag into the front parlour—I saw taken out of it a dress, a mantle, two shirts, three waistcoats, some bed furniture, some stockings, two handkerchiefs, a flageolet, and a pair of trowsers—I afterwards missed my watch from my dressing-table drawer—the value of all the things is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—they were kept in my room—I had been into the room about twenty minutes before, and it was all safe then—these articles (<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>) are what were found in the bag—they are all my husband's property—the shutters were not shut when I left the room, but he had put them to, and placed the looking-glass before them—the window was fastened—I have no idea how he got into the house—the street door was fastened when I went to let my brother in, and also when I let a person in who lives in the house twenty minutes before.</p>

On the 23rd of Dec. last, in consequence of information I received, I went to No. 1, Bath-court, Bath-street, Shoreditch, between nine and ten o'clock at night—the bouse consists of two rooms, one above and one on the ground floor—the outer door opens into the lower room, without there being any passage, and then there a staircase, which takes you to the upper room—I found the outer door fastened—I knocked, and the child (the female prisoner) opened the door—I proceeded to the staircase, without saying anything to her—she rushed to the staircase before me, seized me round the middle, and called, "Father, Father!" loud enough to be heard some distance—I pushed her away, and proceeded to go up stairs, leaving her below—as I was going up I met the male prisoner coming down—I was about half way up, and he was about four or five stairs-above me—on seeing me, he endeavoured to return back, and said, "Brannan, you have not got me to rights yet, sergeant Brannan, you thief"—I seized hold of an apron which he were, and partly turned him round, as he was going up stairs again—he then jumped at me, struck me with both his feet on the chest or stomach, and knocked me down—the back part of my neck came against the edge of a chair in the ground-floor room, and he placed his knee on my flank—the injuries which I sustained then I feel now, and shall for life—at that time the officer, Cole, who was in the room at the time, took the male prisoner off me, and I directly saw a dog seize Cole by the leg I saw the little girl proceed up stairs, and directly I recovered myself, I followed her up, and partly pushed her up stairs into the upper room I pushed her up I noticed her bending herself, as if to ease something</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. I have examined all the coins produced—there are sixty-one half-crowns, all of them counterfeit—when I first saw this paper it contained six half-crowns, one of them I handed over to Mr. Smee for the purpose of making some experiments upon it—all the six had undergone the process of electro<lb/>silvering—the surface of the coins is silver, produced by the electro<lb/>gal-vanic process—I am sufficiently familiar with that process to be able to state that—here are thirty-eight counterfeit shillings—there were forty when I first saw them—I gave two of them to Mr. Smee—I believe the half-crown was given to him by Brannan—one of the coins produced by Cole is in the state in which it first comes out of the battery, as the apparatus is generally called—a great number of the coins have not un<lb/>dergone the process—they are composed of Britannia metal, which is gene<lb/>rally a mixture of tin and antimony—the whole of the coins are counter<lb/>feit, and are all in different stages of the process—here are two galvanic batteries, made after the construction recommended by Mr. Smee—when first saw these batteries, each of them contained fluid—these are what Cole pointed out as jars—by my direction the fluid was taken out of these two jars and placed in two bottles, which I afterwards numbered "1" and "2"—the other bottles produced by Seward also marked "3, 4, 5, and 6"—they were delivered up to me at the office of the Solicitor of the Mint, on Saturday, the 28th of Dec, for the purpose of having experiments made on them, and on the Monday following I placed them in the hands of Mr. Smee, who, in my presence, made experiments on the fluids contained in the bottles "3, 4, and 5," and we found that they con<lb/>tained what had the appearance of silver, by the test—I also saw two basins containing what I believe to be sand and water, the contents of which, by my direction, were placed in this quart bottle—I do not know what experiments Mr. Smee made on the contents of No. 1 and No. 2—the whole of the articles produced I believe to be complete for the purpose of performing the process of electro-silvering—the electro<lb/>silvering would</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended the deceased, and attended the Coroner's inquest on his body—the prisoner wait present during the proceedings—he was not sworn nor examined as a witness—I believe the coroner's clerk took down all that passed—the prisoner came forward to the coroner and said, "I admit I have committed an error"—there was an adjourned examination—this was at the first examination—the de<lb/>ceased's wife was examined that day, but I was not—I cannot say whether the coroner or his clerk took down what the prisoner said—he said, "I cannot deny having sold the tartaric acid by mistake, and I am sorry for it"—I do not recollect his saying how it happened—his brother said he could not deny its having come out of his shop—I was called to attend the deceased on the 7th of Dec, and attended him till he died, which I think was on the 10th—there was a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, but I was not present; but from his symptoms my impression is, if tartaric acid was taken in such a quantity as an ounce it would cause death—the symptoms were such as would arise from an over dose of tartaric acid—I do not, know the prisoner—his brother keeps a chemist's shop in the neigh<lb/>bourhood.</p>

The intestines were inflamed, congested, and red; the liver and kidneys enlarged—judging from the appearance of the body, from the throat down to the rectum, I should say decidedly he had taken some inflam<lb/>matory matter, which had given rise to those appearances, and which caused death—an over dose of tartaric acid would produce that effect—I was be<lb/>fore the Coroner when the prisoner made a statement—I think the Coroner did not take down what he said—after the depositions were taken on the first day he came forward, and said he had committed an error, he had given tartaric acid instead of tartarate of soda—they are both the same in appearance—his brother produced two bottles in his presence—there were two small labels on them, one marked "Acid tart." the other "Sodae tart"—the prisoner said he had taken the powder from the wrong bottle.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Sewell and Co. There are four partners; Mr. George Drake Sewell is one; we carry on business as haberdashers and warehousemen in two or three houses connected, in Compton-street, Soho. The prisoner was in our service as principal clerk. On the 18th of Dec, I delivered to him this check—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—this is my signature—when I gave him that check I knew that Mr. Sewell had some rent to pay to Mr. Gardiner his landlord—I did not know them exact amount at that time—the prisoner told me that he had an appoint<lb/>ment with Mr. Gardiner at eleven o'clock to settle the rent—he presented the check to me, and I signed it—I put the name of the house to it—he had the check from me for the purpose of paying the rent—I do not know that I told him what to do with it—he said it was for the purpose of pay<lb/>ing Mr. Gardiner's rent—it was in blank as to the sum—it is the common printed form of check—no date was filled in—it was crossed "and Co." when he gave it to me, and the number was filled in—we draw our checks by numbers—on his presenting it to me I signed it, and gave it to him again—I have no recollection of saying anything to him, or he to me—the amount of rent had not been ascertained between the parties—the check was for the special purpose of paying the rent.</p>

I will due to him—Mr. Sewell asked him what he had done with the money—he said he had spent it all, he had not a shilling; and said to Mr. Sewell, "I hope you will forgive me; I will give you all my furniture which cost me 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you will forgive roe"—I have since looked through the books, to ascertain what is due to him—I have the books here—they are in the handwriting of a clerk named Anderson, who has left our employ.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Charlton-street on the night of Christ<lb/>mas-day between eleven and twelve o'clock, and saw the police taking a Spaniard into custody in that street—the two prisoners, and a great many more, were ill-treating the police—they were hitting them with sticks and bludgeons, and attempting to get the other away that the police had got in custody—I went to the assistance of the police, and took hold of a stick that one of them had got to hit the police with—I wrestled with that person, and prevented him from hitting the police—we struggled together, and went down—he said something in Spanish, which I did not understand, and three more came to his assistance—I was fighting with them I dare say for pretty nearly twenty yards, fighting among the four of them,</p>

               <p>trying to sure them—they came to drag me off him, and I got up again—we were fighting together for nearly twenty yards up Charlton-street—I hold of the two prisoners—we struggled and went down together—the other two went away—while I was on the ground with these two I received different cuts, one on the right side of the head, and another on the left, which divided the ear—my coat collar was cut through, and part of the breast—this is the coat—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—they were deep cuts—finding I was cut, and the blood beginning to run down my face, I said, "Good God! is there never an Englishman among you; to see me used in this way, and render me no assistance?"—a voice replied, "Yes, here is one"—it was the policeman Madden, who had got another of the Spaniards in custody—Garcia struggled and got away from me, and Madden came and pulled Assension away, and I assited in taking him to the station—I am sure that I received the cuts from one Or other of the prisoners while I was on the ground—they both struck me while we were struggling together, and I received the cut from one or other in the course of the struggle—I showed the cuts to Mr. Parker, a surgeon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Assension.</hi> He did not take me to the station, I was taken by the police; he was the first to strike me; I fell down; I had no knife, or any weapon to cut him; I never used any sharp instrument, and especially a razor, because I am not a barber; I was under him when I was taken by the police, and not over him; if I had been over him the police man would not have caught me; I should have gone away and saved myself.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 186.) I was Charlton-street on Christmas night, and Was called to the Victoria public-house by Mr. Viles, the landlord—I found there from twelve to fourteen Spaniards—they were drinik—they called for liquor, he refused to serve them, and he called on me to take one of them into custody for' assaulting him with this stick winch I produce, and creating a disturbance in the house—I took him into custody—if was neither of the prisoners—the other Spaniards struggled very much to get him away—When I got him into the street one of them spoke to the others for their language, which I did not understand, and they all surronded me to rescue tne prisoner—police-constables Manser and Relly came up—five of the Spaniards struck Kelly, and pushed him into a doorway—I struggled with my prisoner 100 yards down the street, and when I had got that distance, or it might be more, heard Thurman cry out "Murder!' and say, "Is there never an Englishman that will come to my assistance?"—I said, "Yes, here is one"—I struggled with the I prisoner I hadf in custody, and got him across the road—I found the prosecutor on his back, and Assension on him—I laid hold of Assension's collor with my left hand and rose him up—Thurman's face was all over blood—Assension's shirt was torn, and tere was blood on it and on the cuffs of his coat—I could not see where</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184501060040"/>
               <p>Garcia was at that time—he was taken afterwards—with Thurman's assist<lb/>ance I took Assension and the prisoner I had in custody to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Assension.</hi> They must be mistaken, or they have sworn falsely about I my being over him; it is true that his face was over blood, but that was I from a blow I had received in the struggle; it was my own blood from my I nose, and the blood on my cuffs was from wiping my nose; I was first I taken prisoner by Madden, who held me by one arm, and another police-man came and took charge of me; I never thought of saving myself, but I went straight to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not let him go after taking him off Thurman—I kept him all the way to the station, except about a minute, when the reserve policeman came up, and held him while I got my breath, and then I took him again—I was out of breath—that was in Phoenix-street, only a few yards from the station-house door—Thurman had hold of him at the same time, and never let loose of him.</p>

I am a wholesale cheesemonger, and live in Newgate-street—the prisoner, James, was in my service—from what my son told me, I had a communication from James, and from what he said, I went to Foster's residence, in Clement's-court, Milk-street—I inquired of the woman who keeps the shop, if Mr. Foster was at home—she said, "Yes"—she came out and called, "Foster"—he looked out at the three pair of stairs window, and answered to the name—I believe he saw me—after keeping us some time at the door, it was opened, and we went into his room—his wife was sitting there, and she declined saying where he was—I turned, and saw a light n ar a trap-door—I went up there, and in a gutter behind the trap-door, I found Foster—the policeman who was with me came up. and said, "Foster we want you"—he came, and we came down into his room—we searched, but found nothing—we went up the trap-door again, and searched along the gutter—the policeman got over the roof of the house, and said he saw something, but he could not get it—I got a pair of tongs from the room, and he got it with them—it was this ham—he brought it up, and I identified it—I came down, and gave Foster in charge—this is my ham—James had no authority to take it away—there was time enough between our going to the house, and Foster looking out at the window, and our finding him in the jgutter, for a person to have thrown the ham where it was found—this is a real Yorkshire ham.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Ayres; we live at No. 5, Union-street, Hackney-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—on the 3rd of Dec. I left home about six o'clock in the evening—I left no one at home—I shut the doors, and left the house safe—I returned about twenty minutes before eight o'clock—I found the street door fast, as I had left it—on going into the house I found everything in disorder, and I missed the property described in this indictment—if any one got into the house it must have been by a key—this (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) is my property—the whole of it was safe when I left—on the 19th of Dec., in consequence of a dream I had the preceding night, I went to Mrs. Asher's shop in the Minories, and found my Cashmere dress lying on the counter—Mrs. Asher showed me a satin shawl which I had lost—I went and gave information to the police—I then accompanied Dubois and Holland back to Mrs. Asher's—I saw the same articles which I had seen there before, and the officers took possession of them—I then went with the same officers to Mrs. Davidson's shop in Russell-court, Drury-lane—she showed me a velvet scarf and a dress which were mine, and which I had lost on the 3rd of Dec—the officers took possession of them—she then produced a black silk dress of mine, which the officers took—they are here to-day—we then went to the house of the prisoner Miers, in Harrow-alley, Houndsditch—we saw her there—the officers searched the place—they found a black silk dress there, a worsted shawl, and some fringe—they are all my property—I then went with the officers to Mr. Josephs, in Rosentary-lane—I there discovered a black satin dress, and a blue silk dress—the value of what I lost was about 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—what I have found is worth about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I went with Mrs. Ayres on the 19th of Dec. to Mrs. Asher's house in the Minories—I saw Dubois take the Cashmere dress and the satin shawl—from what we heard there, we went to Davidson's, in Russell-court—we got some things there, and from what we there heard, we went back to Asher's and then to Miers's house in Harrow-alley, Houndsditch—we saw Miers there—I produced the property I had found at Asher's and Davidson's on the table—I said to Miers, "This person's house has been opened by skeleton keys, and pro<lb/>perty stolen; Davidson says you sold her this property, which is part of what was stolen,—where did you get it?"—she said she bought it of a man whom she knew, but did not know his name, nor where he lived—Davidson said to her, "You know you sold them me"—Miers said, "Yes"—I said to Miers, "You are the last person found in possession of the property, I shall be obliged to detain you"—she seemed very much agitated—some time after her husband came home—I told him the same tale about the house being entered by skeleton keys, and property stolen—he said to her, "Tell me who you bought it of"—they looked at each other for some time, and then she said, "I bought it of <hi rend="italic">Ben</hi> Harris"—Miers said, "I am an honest man, for God's sake, let us go, and look after Harris, for if he gets scent of it, he will be off"—I said, "You shall have the same facilities that other persons have; you shall go and find Harris"—I said to a City-officer who was there, "Go, and search for him, but don't part with Miers"—they went, and in a few minutes returned with Harris—I said to him, "Is your name Harris?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him to sit down, and I told him the tale, and sh wed him the property on the table—Mrs. Miers said she bought it of him, and gave him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—Harris said, "So help me God, she never did, it is a pretty thing to get me into"—I said, "Sit down, you shall have justice done you"—about half-an-hour Dubois came back, having been to Joseph's and got more property—I then said to Mrs. Miers, "Have you bought other goods of Harris besides those now produced?—she said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "I must search the house," and we all went up stairs—that was in consequence of something being said about more stolen property being in the house, but I cannot recollect the words—when we were up stairs there was a good deal of shuffling about, and going from one part to the other, and saying, "There is nothing here, and nothing here," and so on—Mrs. Ayres said, "Here is another gown and shawl of mine," she took them off the sofa and gave them to me—she then said, "Look how they are shuffling at that end of the room"—I went there—Mrs. Miers and her husband, and Mrs. Ayres were there—there was a table, the flap of which reached nearly to the floor, and I found under it a bundle—I took it out and said, "What is this?"—Mrs. Miers said, "Nothing"—I said, "Let us look what nothing is"—I found in it a pair of trowsers and a shirt, which Miers said were his—there were some table-cloths, napkins, and other things in the bundle which are not in this indictment—I had Harris below in custody—I brought Mrs. Miers down, and I said to Harris, "We have found a bundle of things under the table; I think it is only justice and fair to you to tell you that Mrs. Miers says she bought them of you along with the other lot of goods"—he said, "She will say anything, the</p>

Mrs. Carter"—I replied, "Yes, Mrs. Carter"—he then showed me a paper stuck on the wall, that I might see that he had charged correctly for the letter—I replied, "Very well"—he requested me to come round the counter to look at it—I said I could see it—I told him the lady seemed very particular, or anxious, to know whether the letter was gone or not, and asked him which collection he sent it by—he replied he sent it by me—I replied, "No, you did not"—he then said, "I sent it at the right. time, by Reeves"—I was about to leave the shop, and he said, "Please to tell the lady that I have added the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on, or else she will think I have been robbing her"—that is all that passed at that time—I carry the letters to Whipp's-cross, in the parish of Walthamstow—I did not have any letter such as is described—when I receive letters and money, the prisoner himself makes the bill, and hands the bill to me with the money—I had no letter on that day addressed to Calcutta—I had made only one collection that day, which was the half-past three, and had no such letter at that time—I delivered at Whipp's-cross all the letters and money I had, to Thomas Cox, the charge-taker—this is the bill I delivered—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—there are thirty-four unpaid letters, and fifteen paid letters, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was one 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. letter—on Monday, the 16th, I did my duty in the same way—I received this bill and the money—there were twenty-four paid letters, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was no Calcutta letter—the prisoner puts his paid letters into a drawer under his counter—I have seen him put them there—it wai a drawer peculiarly appropriated for that purpose—I communicated what had passed to Mr. Cox, at Whipp's-cross.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the Post-office. In consequence of directions which I received on the 17th of Dec. I went to Walthamstow with Mr. Hill from the Solicitor's office, and Peak the officer—we arrived at Walthamstow about three o'clock, and went to the prisoner's house there—he came in shortly after our arrival—I told him who I was, and asked him whether a letter had been posted there on the Saturday before for Calcutta—he said he recollected there was a letter posted that morning, the 14th—I asked him what time he sent it to London—he said he had sent it by the twelve o'clock despatch—I produced the letter bill of that hour, which I have here, and asked him whether those figures were in his handwriting—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "How could you have sent the paid letter, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at this hour, there being only nine paid letters, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the bill?"—that appears on the face of the bill—he said, "Oh, I recollect now, I sent my son back to the party who posted the letter for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more; my son returned with the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. too late far the letter to be forwarded to town by the twelve o'clock despatch, but I sent it by the three o'clock despatch"—I had with me the bill for the half-past three o'clock despatch—I turned to it immediately and showed it to him, and asked if the figures were in his handwriting—he said yes they were—seeing there was only fifteen paid letters, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., entered on the bill, he immediately said, "Dear me, I must have sent it without adding the postage"—I said, "I am sure you did not send it to London"—he said, "Can you prove that I did not send it?"—I said, "I can"—he then said, "Oh dear me! I recollect now, I gave it to Holmes the postman, and forgot to put it on the bill; he said, "Oh, I recollect now, I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half-a-crown, and he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out"—I said, "That would not make it right, for there is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the bill, and the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the postage of this letter, would make it 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there fore he thought to have given you 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out"—he then appeared quite confused—while this was going on Peak came into the room, and I asked the prisoner whether he had any objection to be searched—I directed Peak to search the boose—before he returned to the room the prisoner's wife came into the room, and said the letter was found in one of the drawers—the prisoner said, "Oh dear me!
