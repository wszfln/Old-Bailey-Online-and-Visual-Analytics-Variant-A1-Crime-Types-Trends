The better way will be to enter one of the other con<lb/>tests, and no doubt you will be better pleased"—I then wrote this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Insisting on the clock being sent.</hi>)—I never got the clock, but I held the ring at their disposal—I got a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Woman's World</hi> for May, 1901, but thought nothing of it—I was charged 5s. 10d. for it per annum—I did not get another number—I complained to the police, and sent up the correspondence.</p>

               <p>me somewhat, and he immediately gave me employment as an advertise<lb/>ment clerk at 30s. per week, and eventually proposed that a new adver<lb/>tisement agency should be open, he saying that the Imperial Type Foundry at Brentford was run out. He then brought out the European &amp; Colonial Advertisement Company, 144, Fleet Street, and appointed me secretary at the same salary, viz., 30s. per week. I was not allowed by Nicholson to be at 144, Fleet Street, he placing a girl there instead. When the company was formed I became a signatory at Nicholson's suggestion in the name of Dalesford. The witness's signature named Dalesford is, however, not mine, but I believe was written by Nicholson. He <hi rend="italic">also</hi> was a signatory in the name of Wilson. I have never benefited in any way by this apart from the salary he gave me. I told him on one occasion that he would get into trouble over the <hi rend="italic">Woman's World</hi> affair it he did not watch it, as he was promising to send clocks, but only sent trumpery rings, but he laughed and pooh-poohed the idea, and said, 'Never fear.' Had he taken my advice and carried out his promises he would not now have been in this trouble; he treated all his clerks with contempt and merely as fools. All he did was to bank the money and stick to it; he simply opened the letters and took the money out, and divided the letters among the clerks for attention. I make this statement voluntarily, and desire that it should be given in evidence in my defence"—I read it over to him, and he signed it and initialled each sheet—I found at Longcott the three receipts produced for rent, and the notice from Rogers, the landlord, that the rent was due at 144, Fleet Street.</p>

After I married Miss Dow I discovered she was already married under Scotch law. The witnesses can be found to prove this. Sergeant William Ballen is still alive, and is at the front in South Africa. When I went to India in 1896-1897 I received a letter from the mother of the first wife, asking for the support of the children, and saying she had not seen her daughter for months, and it was quite possible she was dead. She did not say she was dead. I wrote promising money, and asking certain news if she was dead. I heard nothing since from them. In 1898 or 1899 I had a letter written to the Rev. John Simons, asking for the woman's address if alive, and for particulars of her death if dead, also enclosing a letter to her sister, Jessie Dow, asking the same thing. That letter came back through the Dead Letter Office, marked 'Deceased.' I did not know Dow's address. I made up my mind she was dead, otherwise I could have taken proceedings in the Scotch Courts for nullity on the grounds of her previous marriage with Sergeant Ballen. I have a letter expressing the opinion that my first marriage was null. The reason why I did not take proceedings for nullity was because I thought she was dead.

I have never bought or owned a lady's gold keyless watch. I have never been in the witness's shop, and, in fact, do not know exactly where it is. On Tuesday, July 30th, I was in a financial bad way, and I went to see my brother-in-law in the evening to borrow some money till Saturday; he had none then, but he let me have 1s. to pay my morning fare, promised to send me on some before dinner time next day. Next morning (July 31st), as it did not arrive by 12 o'clock, Mr. Gregory, who also had no money, and I, discussed how to get lunch, and he borrowed some somewhere; we then went to lunch together, came back early, when a telegraphic money order for £1 came for me about 1.45 p.m. I at once borrowed 10s. on it from Mr. Lochler, our petty cashier, and lent that to Mr. Gregory, and then went to the Fleet Street office, cashed the order and repaid Mr. Lochler the 10s." <hi rend="italic">And on another date:</hi> "I wish to say that I quite acknowledge giving that ring to Miss Tyler. I think I can produce the person from whom I bought it. I wish further to say that this throws some light to me upon the previous charge against me, and I should like to ask for a remand, with power to communicate with the police to have the person from whom I obtained that ring brought here to say, if the same ring, how he obtained possession of that cheque."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, on oath, said that he bought the ring of Cooper for 30s.; that when he knew Bucknall's cheque was traced and cashed in Stratford, he attended as usual at the office; that when he was identified on July 21st his eye was black from an accident, and the plaister not removed from his face till July 31st, when he received a remittance from Jefferson, but otherwise was in monetary difficulties, and had no money for lunch; that Jefferson often came during working hours, and must have taken the cheques.</hi>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Vauxhall Road, Lambeth—on Sunday, September 29th, about 7 p.m, I was with my uncle, the deceased, by Vauxhall Cross, waiting for a tram car to go in the direction of Wands-worth—the tram came up and was standing still in the road; we were close to it—a short distance behind the tram there is a public lavatory—my uncle went towards the hind part of the tram on the left side—I was just going to put my foot on to the step of the tram—my uncle was standing sideways—I saw a two-wheeled cart coming towards us in the same direc<lb/>tion as the tram was pointing; it was going fast; it knocked my uncle down; it caught his right shoulder; it nearly hit me—my uncle fell down straight along by the tram—the man who was driving did not pull up but whipped the horse and drove on quicker than he had been driving before—I ran after the trap—I left my uncle in the road—I called out to the man to stop, then I went back to my uncle—he was taken to St. Thomas's Hospital—he died on the following Tuesday morning at 12.15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We were there before the tram came up—I did not notice a lady trying to get into the tram—I saw the trap before it reached us—I did not think it would come so close as it did—I had not got hold of the rail of the tram—when I looked to see where the trap was after my uncle was knocked down it was more than the length of the tram away; it had passed the tram horses—I am quite sure the man whipped the horse—I saw a woman in the cart—I did not see that she had a baby in her arms, or that there was a little girl in the cart, and a boy kneeling in the front—the man was holding the whip above his shoulder—when the trap came back I did not notice that the whip was in the socket, with the strings of a straw basket round it—I do not know that my uncle had a bruise on his right hip—he had his head towards the tram horses when he was knocked down—I should have noticed him step back if he had done so before he was knocked down; he did not step back.</p>

I am a tram driver, of No. 5 Block, Victoria Buildings, Battersea Park—on Sunday, September 29th, about 7 p.m., I was in charge of the tramcar by Vauxhall Cross, going in the direction of Wandsworth—my attention was attracted by a trap coming along—on looking round the near side of my car I saw it was driven by the prisoner—I saw the off-wheel of the cart knock down the deceased—I thought it was going about 10 miles an hour—I called out for the prisoner to stop; he drove rapidly away—I jumped off my tram into the road, and blew my whistle—I did not see the prisoner stopped—I saw there was a woman and a child in the trap.</p>

                  </hi>. I am independent, and live at 93, Suther<lb/>land Road, Watford—in June, 1899, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph,</hi> and went to 44, Bloomsbury Street, and saw Lyons and Hardinge (<hi rend="italic">Fuller</hi>)—Hardinge was the secretary—I asked him how many horses he had—he said 200 horses and 100 cabs—he assured me that everything was correct, and offered me an order to go round the pre<lb/>mises—he produced a bundle of deposit notes, one from a captain, who had deposited £400, and taken it out and deposited £600—on June 6th I went again and saw Hardinge, and said that I would invest £500—he suggested that if I left it subject to three months' notice it would be 16 1/2 percent.—I paid him a £500 note, and got this receipt, signed "B. T. Lawrence," and this deposit note, signed "R.S. Hardinge, Secretary"—I put it in subject to 20 days' withdrawal—I agreed that the interest was to be paid monthly, but the document says weekly—Igot this circular, stating "Our trading for the past six months has been of a very lucrative character"—on July 10th I sent a further £200 in a registered letter, and got this receipt and deposit note, signed by Lawrence and Hardinge respectively, and a letter—in August I went again to Bloomsbury Street, and took another £100 belonging to Miss Straker—I paid it to Hardinge in 19 £5 notes and £5 in gold, and got this deposit note (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—Hardinge said that trade was somewhat quiet at the present time, but he had sold 10 horses to the London General Omnibus Company at £20 each—I received this paper in September—(<hi rend="italic">Enclosing the balance-sheet.</hi>)—I believed that the assets were</p>

               <p>£4,495 more than the liabilities, and that the amount for which they were liable to depositors was £12,000—in January I got this circular referring to an approaching audit—(<hi rend="italic">This mentioned frequent sales of horses to the War Office.</hi>)—on January 5th I got this circular—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that the deal<lb/>ings with the War Office had opened up business, and offering 22s. 6d. per annum for deposits.</hi>)—I then determined to deposit another £200, went to the office, and saw Hardinge, who said that the business was in a flourish<lb/>ing condition, that everything was insured, and that they were buying horses at £22 and £23, and selling them at £45—I paid £200 on January 10th, and got this receipt—about January 23rd I got this balance-sheet and letter, stating "We beg to send you a copy of our balance-sheet, show<lb/>ing a surplus of £7,700 over our liabilities"; I believed that—about March 15th I got this letter, giving notice that the rate of interest will be reduced, except as to subscribers, before the end of the month—in June, 1900, I got Exhibit 23, "A word of warning to our depositors against dealing with property of mushroom growth"—I then received this: "July 14th, 1900. In consequence of the 
death of one of our old depositors, the executors of his estate have applied to us for the amount, and we give you the oppor<lb/>tunity of increasing your investments"—I also got this in July; it is signed "T. S. Huntingdon," and is an attack on the London Cab Co-operative Society, also this letter signed "Browne," 44, Bedford Row—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that Mr. Brinkworth had called upon them and threatened pro<lb/>ceedings, and that it was an attempt to blackmail.</hi>)—on August 3rd I gave this notice (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) of the withdrawal of £900—I also gave a similar notice for Miss Straker for the withdrawal of her £100—I got a communication promising me a cheque in due course, and on October 10th I got a cheque for £3 15s. 10d. for interest; I paid that in and it was dishonoured—I had given three months' notice, which had not then elapsed—on October 28th I got this long letter—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had resolved to form their business into a limited company, to insure con<lb/>fidence in the trade.</hi>)—I read it all through, and replied, stating that I had no desire to enter into other arrangements, but wanted my money back—about that date I went to Rutland Yard, and saw Pindar, but he did not speak to me; he slipped out of the way—I went into the office, and saw a man, who I found out was Brinkworth, managing the business—I made another appointment, and called and saw Pindar and Hantke—Pindar assured me that every thing was right, and that everybody would be paid eventually, but that they were a little pressed at the time, and I went up<lb/>stairs, and saw the books—on November 12th I went and saw Lawrence, and asked him if he would settle with me—he said that they had no money, and could not settle—I asked him to give us some security—he offered me some bonds in the new company which I did not accept—I received some circulars about a grocery and provision shop in the name of Lascelles—I mentioned it to Lawrence; he said that Hardinge had sold the name—next day, the 12th, I got this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that it was understood that the com<lb/>pany was to give him three months' notice.</hi>)—it was not true that I had agreed, and I wrote and repudiated it—I once asked Lawford how it was that they did not issue a balance-sheet for six months; he said that they could not do it—my solicitor began an action for £1,000, my £900 and Miss Straker's £100, and got judgment for £1,060 with interest, which</p>

Hardinge; Solicitors, Brown and Com<lb/>pany, Bedford Row"—I then got this letter: "As requested, we beg to forward you particulars of our investment. * * * * Our books are duly examined every half-year by Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, of 39, Holland Road, Brixton—in May, 1898, my husband showed me an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> referring to a cab company, and I went to the office in Blooms<lb/>bury Street, and saw Hardinge—I asked him about the cab company; he gave me a reference to Mr. Browne, a solicitor, of Bedford Row—I asked Evans's address, but he did not give it me till the end of the week—I went to Browne, and asked him to give ma the particulars, and to tell me the truth, as my husband was anxious to invest what he had, for the benefit of myself and children; he assured me that it was all right—I believed that, coming from a solicitor—I then saw Hardinge, and deposited £400—the interest was payable weekly—in September I saw something in the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> newspaper, and gave notice to withdraw the £400—about January, 1899, Hardinge called at my house—I said I was very much sur<lb/>prised to see him; he asked to see my husband, who said, "Let him come up"—he went up, and they had a conversation—he said that the com<lb/>pany had an agreement to bring out a certain number of Taximeter cabs of the best quality, and asked if we would invest; again in the company, and said that we were not to believe anything which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi>—my husband died nine days after that—Hardinge said that we had a thoroughly safe investment, and had nothing to fear, and he would look after me and my children's interest in the company—I believed his statements, and on Feb<lb/>ruary 1st deposited £550 with the company—we had promised £600—this deposit note is signed, "Hardinge, Secretary," and the receipt, "Lawrence, Cashier"—I went to 4, Bloomsbury Street, to get that—on the day after my husband's 
death I went to see Fuller, and paid him the other £50—these are the deposit note and receipt—in August, 1899, I went again to Bloomsbury Street and saw Hardinge—I was receiving 26 percent, interest, and I asked him if he would take another £100 at the same rate—he said he would let me know—I afterwards went again and took £200, and gave it to Hardinge—these are the receipt and deposit notes—on Septem<lb/>ber 8th I received a letter signed "Hardinge," saying that the interest on investments made before February would not be affected—in December, 1899, I received a visit from Fuller—I had not asked him, but he had sent me a telegram saying that he was coming—he said that he had been doing a good business with the War Office, and asked if I had any more money to invest—I said that I had only £100 or £150 left—he said that the company was splendid, and was flourishing—I believed him, and made a further deposit of £150—this, is the receipt and the deposit note—in March, 1900, I had another visit from Fuller, who said that he had left the company in January—he did not say why they fell out, but called, as he had promised to look after me—he advised me to withdraw my money, as they were misappropriating depositors' money, and he could not stand by and see it, and that 26 per cent, was nothing, considering</p>

               <p>the profits they made out of the war—he said that he had another invest<lb/>ment for the money I was to draw out, but it would not pay so well—I said that I would think it over, and I received a note or telegram saying, "Take no further notice till you see me again"—I next saw him at Marl<lb/>borough Street—at the end of the same year I went to Rutland Yard—in consequence of something I saw in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Leader</hi> I saw Lawrence, and told him so, and that I was going away the next day—they told me I might go away with confidence—about October I went there again with my stepson, and saw Lawrence—Hantke said that they had formed a limited company; that in consequence of what was in the papers they were unable to obtain credit, and they asked me to take shares in it to the amount of my deposit—I said that I would think it over and let them know—they gave me a certain time, and I gave notice to withdraw the£500—I never got it—I stand to lose £950—I got interest up to January.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Arkwrigb.t Road, Hampstead—in the autumn of 1899, in consequence of an advertisement, I communi<lb/>cated with Bloomsbury Street, and got a prospectus stating that the capital was £20,000, not £50,000—I sent a cheque for £500; this in the receipt and deposit note—in October, 1899, I deposited a further sum of £3,000, and got these deposit notes for £1,000 each—at the end of 1899 I got this balance-sheet with the balance of assets over liabilities £75,000; I believed that that was true, and in February, 1900,1 deposited a further £500, and received this deposit note—in the autumn of 1899 I called at Goldsmith Street, and saw Hardinge; he said that it was a very good busi<lb/>ness, and who wed me a power of attorney from Stanley Evans, but did not say who he was—in March, 1898, I asked for £1,200 on a deposit note which ought to have been paid on May 22nd, and got this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that they had sold horses to the value of £14,000, and had difficulty in getting the money from the Government, and that directly it arrived the witness should be paid; and a postscript stated:</hi>"We are looking forward to a much im<lb/>proved balance-sheet to that of December last.")—I wrote again, and got this letter signed "Lawford:" "We are raising a mortgage on Rutland Yard, and expect to receive the amount to-morrow, and will send a cheque"—I never got any of my money back—I had deposited £6,200—I consulted Mr. Jennings, my solicitor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant, of 23, Bread Street—in February, 1899, I was called in to examine the books of the London Co-operative Cab Company, and saw Pindar, Hardinge, and Fuller—I got information from them, examined the books, and prepared the balance-sheet of February 18th, 1899—there were six depositors' lodgers, one for each day of the week, the interest being due weekly, and paid from the day of deposit—this is a copy of the cash book—I have stated that the balance of assets over liabilities on February 18th, 1899, was £277 3s. 2d., including the debt to depositors—the figure just before that is to depositors as per ledger, £8,000 3s. 8d.—that does not include interest—I went into the audit again five months later—Exhibit 94 is my copy draft—I find by looking at the same book that the assets exceed the liabilities by £4,500 18s. 2d.; the assets are £12,000 8s. 9d., and the balance is £4,500, so that the books had improved considerably since February—I was called in again, and this is my copy draft for the period ending December, 1899—I made no separate valuation of the leases and goodwill—the amount is more, and after deducting the amount due to depositors, the amount had almost doubled—I went again in 1900—this is my original draft; I find that the balance of assets over liabilities is only £776; that is a loss of £7,000 in six months—that is arrived at after deducting the amount due to depositors—the amount I have inserted in each balance-sheet is what the books show was due to depositors at those four periods—I had nothing but the books to rely on, but they did not show the totals; that was simple addition—I believe those balance-sheets were circulated except the last one—I had a conversation with the defendant about it, and said that it seemed very unsatisfactory trading; he said that it was simply through their having moved from Bloomsbury to Rutland Yard—Inspector Bower showed me a number of books of the Co-operative Cab Company; they were different books to those I had seen before—Mr. Cowley, a clerk, assisted me in the mechanical part.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the Rev. Frank Shergold, of Luton—in February, 1898, I saw an advertisement of the cab company in the <hi rend="italic">Daily News,</hi> to which my husband replied, and received an answer for<lb/>warding a reference—he then wrote to Mr. Davies, and received this reply—(<hi rend="italic">This stated:</hi> "I have every faith in the concern, and, having satisfied myself that the proprietors are able to pay what they undertake to do, I invested a considerable sum with them, for which I have always received my regular interest. In fact, I hope shortly to still further increase my deposit, as I consider it a very remunerative and safe invest<lb/>ment.—<hi rend="smallCaps">T. DAVIES</hi>.")—on the receipt of that letter my husband sent £100 of my money to the company, for which I received this document (<hi rend="italic">Produced.</hi>)—in April I went with my husband to Bloomsbury Street, where I saw Mr. Hardinge, the secretary—we asked him about the company and the invest<lb/>ment—he said that the comqany was quite safe—we then went to see the solicitor at Mr. Fuller's suggestion—we went to Browne in Bedford Row</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210052"/>
               <p>with Fuller—he left us in the office to meet Browne, and said, "You can put any question you like to Mr. Browne"—my husband put several questions to him—Browne assured my husband it was safe, and said he had a client at that time for whom he was trying to invest a con<lb/>siderable amount of money in the company, a loan he was calling in, or something to that effect, and his client was going to invest somewhere else, and he was persuading or asking him to invest it in his company—we then went back to the office in Bloomsbury Street, and saw Fuller, and invested another £100 in the company—they were then paying 52 per cent, to us, I think—my husband is a Nonconformist—in May we invested a further £100, still relying on the statements made to us—the interest on this deposit, too, is stated to be 52 per cen'.—we got our interest and on October 6th, 1898, we invested another £200 at 52 per cent.; we still received our interest regularly—on October 19th, 1900, we invested a further sum of £200—this is my cheque, "Pay to Mr. V. T. Lawrence," and it is endorsed "V. T. Lawrence"—the deposit note shows 26 percent. payable weekly—since that payment of £200 we have not received any interest or any part of our capital back—we invested all together £700.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. MOYSES</hi>. I do not know how much we have received back in interest; perhaps it would be £500 or £600—I believe my husband at times, when remitting further deposits, deducted the amount of interest which had become due—there was always a balance owing—I saw Pindar last November, I think after the crash—I had seen Hantke before that time—I had not had conversation with him—neither he nor Pindar made representations which induced me to put my money in—I saw the yard before November, and so far as I could see it looked like a flourishing business.</p>

I am an advertising agent, of Avenue Road, Westgate—in or about October, 1898, I was introduced to Fuller in the name of Hardinge, who wanted me to do some advertising for the com<lb/>pany—I asked for a reference—he gave me a banker's reference, which happened to be another branch of our own bank—I generally got my orders from Fuller—the advertised interest went down from 26 per cent.</p>

               <p>to 13 per cent., or 10 per cent.—I also saw Hantke and Pindar at the office latterly—I continued to put in advertisements up to October, 1900, up to which time I received £3,108 5s. 1d.—in the summer of that year I began to have difficulty in getting my money, when some proceedings were going on—I cannot say exactly how much was owing to me then—in October it was £1,382 4s. 8d., of which I have received some since—I had a second mortgage on Rutland Yard given me as security for £1,400—at the bankruptcy I stood to lose, with legal costs and things, about £1,500—I had some back on account of the mortgages—on August 19th I noticed an article about the company, about which I spoke to Hantke and Pindar—they said the news was all wrong and garbled, that Fuller had given them away, that a lot of the information was wrong, and that several of the depositors had written to the papers denying the facts.</p>

I said at the Police-court that they explained that there was a conspiracy on the part of Fuller and Hunting<lb/>don to damage them, and that all the information in the papers was the outcome of spite on their part—I went to the head office in Rutland Yard pretty often, where I sometimes saw recruits for the Yeomanry being trained—I was told that the reason of their <hi rend="italic">hard-upness</hi> was that the depositors were withdrawing their money, and they were pressed.</p>

Fuller took me round regularly to the yards, and showed me the cab business that was going on—I had a Taxameter cab from them myself for a time—Fuller left about January, 1900—when I wanted a cheque I sometimes asked Fuller, and sometimes Hantke—they were always signed "V. T. Lawrence"—I think the first time I asked for a cheque Lawrence was called in, and I always looked to him for my cheques afterwards—after Fuller left, the style of advertisement was changed, and Lawrence told me to put their name in as the pro<lb/>prietors.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Balham, and was in the employ of the cab company for three years, from 1897—Sleeman showed me a list of cheques drawn to Thomas Davies, and I went through the original cheques—they are endorsed "Thomas Davies," in his writing—these cheques. (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are endorsed by me, from Hantke's instructions—they are open cheques—I have been through the original cheques referred to in this list—they are drawn in favour of H. Baldwin, and purport to be endorsed by him—I endorsed them by Hantke's instructions—they are open cheques—this cheque is in favour of Davies for £25, dated Septem<lb/>ber 14th, 1898—it purports to be endorsed by Davies, but it is Pindar's writing, I think.</p>

I induced them to turn their business into a limited liability company, and to give depositors 5 per cent. As to the execution by Davies, I did not act for Davies in it. I knew the solicitor who was acting against the company, and I saw him about it, and they (Pindar and Hantke) have property worth about £1,500. They did not want to have a forced sale."</p>

                  </hi>.In September last I lived at 12, Whitfield Street, Tottenham Court Road—two months before I gave evidence at the Police-court I met the prisoner at a club in Old Compton Street, Soho—he came and had meals at my house sometimes—he had no money, and I fed him; he first came about eight days after I met him—he used to come when he had no money—he used to run on errands while he was coming to me—I have never known him do any regular work; I never knew him as a waiter at the Cafe Monico—whilst having his meals with me he used to use this knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he carried it in his pocket—on September 3rd he was at my house between 12 and 1 p.m.; he and my wife quarrelled, and she told him to go away—I asked him to have something to eat, and he de<lb/>clined—he had a pair of trousers, a vest and two or three shirts, besides the clothes he wore; he kept them at my house—I had an old valise—I gave him some shirts, and he packed them in the valise, which I told him to bring back—on September 3rd he had no money—I gave him 3s.—he went away about 1 p.m.—that was the last time I saw him till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the widow of the deceased, and have lived with him at 4, Lower Charles Street, Clerkenwell, nearly 14 years—we were married 14 years ago on January 13th next—I have two children, a boy and a girl; the boy will be 13 next November; the girl was four years and two months when her father died—my husband was a watchmaker—he was 28 years older than I am; he would have been 65 on October 18th—we occupied the whole of 4, Lower Charles Street, with the exception of the two top rooms; we had the basement, kitchen, the ground floor, and the first floor—my husband used the front room on the ground floor as a workshop; we called it the front parlour—the disposition of the room and articles in it is shown in this plan, as my husband was accus<lb/>tomed to have them—the room under the workshop was the kitchen—my husband was a most methodical man—as far as I know, I have been in his complete confidence all our married life—he spoke five language; his nationality was Swiss; he spoke German, French, English, Spanish, and Italian, which he learnt later—he was visited from time to time by foreigners of different nationalities—he used to help them to get work, and would give them money until they got work—he had done so all our married life, and I understood it had been so for many years before—he belonged to the Swiss Society for illness, which gave aid in case of illness—so far as I know, he belonged to no other society except the Horological Society, which was connected with his own trade—his confidence in me extended to allowing me to open his letters, which I did occasionally—I have never seen anything in his corre<lb/>spondence to lead me to think that he was connected with any dangerous political society, or with any political association—his days were parcelled out into different working hours—he generally went into his workroom about 10 a.m., and worked on and off till one—then we had dinner, and he would start work, and work till a quarter to half-past four—then we had tea, and he would work till seven—on Saturdays he left off at one—he was very regular in taking his ease and in doing his work—from 1 to 2.30 he devoted to enjoying himself—he had a habit of going to the front door—he almost invariably did so even when wet, and he very frequently engaged in conversation with passers-by—part of his work was to regulate timepieces given to him—his particular time for that would be when he was getting them ready for sending home, which was at 5 p.m.—I always took them—the stool in the workroom, which is imme<lb/>diately in front of the bench, is my husband's working stool, and he would sit on it doing his work in the ordinary course of things—in the front of the bench is the window—the drawer in the bench ordinarily contained the watches he was engaged upon—when he was seated at the bench at his work the drawer would be closed—that drawer would generally contain the watches which he was going to send out that day—I know there were some watches in that drawer on September 3rd, but I cannot say how many—I did not know of a small oxydised watch in a manufacturer's big being in it—I know my husband had a small troublesome watch which</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210063"/>
               <p>belonged to one of the manufacturers—the proper place for deposit for that watch, if he was engaged upon it, would he in that drawer—it belonged to a Mr. Schneiter—my husband had another watch from him, but it was finished, and would be in another drawer—this iron (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is called, I think, a boot last—we kept it to knock na ls out of boots, or to put on little pieces with—it was for casual purposes—it was not used by my husband in his business—it was kept under the bench, farthest away from the door, on the left side, under the window, as you look towards the window from the door—I used to assist my husband in his work when he was busy, and when doing so I would sit by the bench, and rest my feet or foot on that last, the way it is standing now—the last time I sat there was several weeks before September 3rd—between the time I had assisted my husband and September 3rd the iron had remained under the bench—so far as I know, it had not been moved—the greater part of the window of the room is above the bench, and the smaller portion is below it—it looks into the street—in the daytime light is thrown under the bench from the street through that part of the window below the bench—the room is quite small—I think anyone coming into the room and crossing to the bench could scarcely fail to see what was under the bench—my husband had been previously married, and had had a family by his first wile, all of whom are grown up—he loved my children passionately—about 1.30 p.m. on Tuesday, September 3rd, I was in the front kitchen under the work<lb/>shop—my husband was standing on the doorstep leading to the street, as was his habit about that hour—I could hear two voices distinctly; one was my husband's; I did not know the other—they were speaking in French—it was a friendly conversation—it went on till about 2.20, when they both went into the workroom—they remained there till about 3 o'clock—I went to the door and spoke to my husband—he said, "I cannot come now, I am engaged"—I did not go into the room; I looked in, and saw the prisoner standing on my husband's right, and leaning on his elbow on the bench—my husband was sitting at the bench on his usual stool—they both turned in my direction when I looked in—my husband was sitting close up to the bench, working—he had a watch in his hand—the drawer could not be opened while he was sitting in that position—they seemed quite friendly towards each other—I only begged my husband's pardon; I said another time would do as well, and left the room—a short time after I wished to saw a shelf down out of a cupboard—the saw was in the workshop by the side of the regulator, which stood in the left hand corner as you went in—a regulator is a large clock, which is used by watchmakers to regulate their watches by—I went in about 3.20, and took the saw—my husband and the prisoner ware in just the same position as they were before—my huband was still working—they seemed quite friendly—my husband said, "Well, what is it now?"—I said, "It is all right, I only want a saw"—I then went out—a little while later I went to the area, because I heard our milkman—there are two who have a cry very similar—the area door is underneath the street door—I called up to my husband, "Is that our milkman, dad?"—he replied, "No, it is not ours"—I then went into the back kitchen, aad about 10 minutes afterwards, which would be about 3.56, I heard a scuffling of feet in the workroom—I ran up, and saw the prisoner just going out of the</p>

               <p>street door, which was open—I went after him, and screamed out to stop him—I passed the door leading into the workshop—it was closed to within about 6in. or 8in.—I followed the prisoner—he was running very fast—I followed him to the middle of St. John Street Road, where I saw a policeman take up the chase—I then returned to the house, and went into the workroom—the door was still closed—I had no difficulty in pushing the door open, but when I opened it it just touched my husband's back—he was lying with his head close to the chest of drawers, his feet pointing towards the window; his left arm was up to his face—I do not re<lb/>member the position of his right arm—he was bespattered all over with blood—blood was also on the floor—there seemed to be a great amount—I cannot say if he was alive—I had to step over the body to get into the room—a doctor was sent for—the drawer containing the watches was open when I went into the room—under the bench I saw this knife (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), which I picked up and put on the bench—it seemed to me to be covered all over with blood—it was open—I did not see the slightest indication of a struggle having taken place—after a short time the prisoner was brought back in custody—that was before the doctor arrived—he did not make a statement then; he remained there about 10 minutes before he was taken away—the doctor came and attended to my husband—a policeman came, and took charge of the room—the Coroner's officer came, and my husband's body was taken away at 8.30 p.m.—the room was locked up, and the key given to me—up to that time nothing was moved in the room except my husband's body, and my moving of the knife from the floor to the bench—I took two watches from the drawer in the bench, and two from another drawer on the opposite side of the room—that one opens with a spring, and nobody knew of it except my husband and myself—I went into the room again on the 4th; all that was moved then were the watches in the drawer in the bench, some coppers, and a few sixpences; nothing else was done—there is a shutter to the window; it had been put up on the evening of the 3rd; it is an inside shutter, and has to be put up over the bench, and slid down into two grooves—I noticed some blood on the stool on the 3rd, and also in the working bench drawer—there were also blood-marks upon the watches in the drawer—I did not notice blood on the window then—the police visited the room again on September 6th; I went in with them—I was there when the boot-last was found in its usual place; I think I went into the room almost every day after it—I did not look into the chest of drawers, which is opposite the working bench, where my husband kept some papers—on September 18th I took some newspapers from the floor, which had been placed round my husband's body, so that the doctor should not step in the blood—I found under the papers this watch in a white cotton bag, which was very much stained with blood (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) it lay at my husband's back among the papers—I handed it to the police—the watch is one of the two belonging to Mr. Schneiter—except the scuffling of feet, I did not hear any other sounds from the workshop—I did not hear any sounds which would be occasioned by this piece of iron falling—the floor was of very old boarding; if the iron had fallen, I should have heard it; it is such a small house—I saw blood-stains on the window from the outside; I did not see them from the inside, because the shutter was not taken down for two or</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe the window of the workshop was open 3in. or 4in. from the top—the front door was open during work hours, but not during meal times—the door of the room leading into the passage was wide open—this iron was never used for any purpose connected with the door—it is not necessary to move the bench in order to adjust the shutter of the window—I understand French—I cannot swear that the prisoner was in conversation with my husband on the doorstep for an hour, but nobody else came to the door while they were there, and I heard two peoples' footsteps, while they were still in conversation, go into the workroom—I heard a word or two now and again, but not enough to know what they were talking about—those members of my husband's first family who are not married work for their living—the floor of the workroom is very dusty—I used to clean it, but not very often, because the dust which was raised was very injurious to the watches, and my husband would not have it done often; the dust ac<lb/>cumulated very quickly—a new floor has been put down now as nobody would take the place as it was—the floor would be very dusty in a couple of days—I do not think the prisoner and my husband were talking on either occasion that I went into the room, but I cannot swear to it—I said at the Police-court that they were on friendly terms, because my husband was working; if they had not been friendly he Would not have been work<lb/>ing—if I said at the Police-court that they were talking in French at 3.30, it is correct—when my husband was working he sat facing the window—when I went in he was not annoyed with me—he helped all the needy, whether they were old or young, but he tried to find work forthe young ones before giving them money, because he thought it best to do so—my husband was a Socialist—I am not particularly clear what a Socialist is, but he cer<lb/>tainly was not an Anarchist, as the prisoner's statements seem to indicate—I was at the funeral—there were many persons there; I saw very few of them—I only knew a few of them—there was a Mr. Bernard there, and Mr. Hymer, a German; Mr. Watts, a Socialist; Mr. Burrows, a Socialist; Mr. Lasassie, who is a member of the Old International Club; I do not know any others by name—there were three mourning carriages, and, I believe, one cab—Mr. Bernard is a very old friend of my husband's; he is a French<lb/>man—I think he is something in the French Government—Mr. Hymer is a bookbinder, I believe; I think he is a Conservative—when I went into the room the conversation between the prisoner and my husband ceased, because my husband spoke to me—when I started to go up the stairs after the commencement of scuffling I heard what I thought was a fall, but it finished up the scuffle—it was not quite a fall; it was like a push against a partition—it was not more than two minutes between the scuffling, and my running after the prisoner—I cannot say from what part of the room the sound of the fall came—I ran after the prisoner, because I thought he must have stolen something, and if he was allowed to get away it would be lost—when I returned I thought my husband was dead—I did not move the body; I only shut his eyes—as far as I remember, his right arm was down at his side—I am quite certain his arms were not</p>

This man has been specially sent by Jung to await the arrival of the Czar, and another man, a Swiss, was to go and join him. I did not know the name of the Swiss, but he is the father of two children, and lives in Soho. Jung used to pay for the lodging of <hi rend="italic">Dotts.</hi> I do not know the name of the street, but it is on the other side of the water, and I have shared his lodgings for six days. The fourth man is known under the name of 'Gustave, the Anarchist', and he lives in a street, No. 40, of which I do not know the name, but it is near to Victoria, on the other side of the water, and they change the omnibus horses almost next door to it. There is another Anarchist whose acquaint<lb/>ance I have made when frequenting the house of Jung. He is a native of St. Malo, and is a watchmaker by trade, and the deceased has, or had, his tools, as he was going to send him away also. On the morning of the murder the deceased made out an invoice for £10 10s., and said that he was going to cash it, and give me the money in order to dress myself decently for the job he wanted me to do. He said to me, 'All the misery of the Transvaal War is due to Mr. Chamberlain; we must make an example of him. You are going to wound him seriously, though without taking his life.' I made the acquaintance of Jung through <hi rend="italic">Dotts.</hi> One day, after I had left my work at the Cafe Monico, I was talking to a girl opposite the Swiss Cafe.

I wish to state how I made the acquaintance of the deceased. About six weeks ago I was standing in front of the Cafe Suisse, near Piccadilly. I had been out of work for a few days then, and I met there a woman whose acquaintance I had made in France. While I was speaking to her another man, who happened to be acquainted with her, joined in the conversation. After a few minutes the woman went away and left us. The man with whom I was left took me for a walk for about half an hour, and then we came back together to the Cafe Suisse, where we had a drink. I told him I had just lost my situation at the Cafe Monico, and I should like to find some work. He said, 'What do you want to work for? You can live in London without work; I can take you to a house, where three of us are in the habit of going, and which we are in the habit of calling "God's House." There you will find everything you may possibly want, provided only that you promise its owner to do as he directs.' He left me then, but made an appointment to meet me there on the morrow at 2 o'clock. I met him at 2 o'clock next day, but he was not alone; he was accompanied by two others. He said to the other two, pointing me out, 'This young man I am going to make acquainted with the president of our society.' The two newcomers left me after some time, and I started with my new acquaintance, and we came by'<hi rend="italic">bus</hi> to a spot near the house of the deceased. When we reached the workshop of the deceased I was introduced by my companion, and the deceased said he was very pleased to make my acquaintance. He asked me where we came from, and I said, 'We Came from the French quarter by '<hi rend="italic">bus.</hi>' He pointed out to me that it was absurd that some people should have their pockets full of gold, whereas others had no money at all, and he added, 'There must be equality for everybody.' He asked me if I could read or write, and on my answering in the negative, said, 'You must come and see me often, when I will teach you a good many things.' Then, in order to show his pleasure to <hi rend="italic">Dotts,</hi> the man who took me to the house, he gave <hi rend="italic">Dotts</hi> £1, and gave me 15s. He saw us to the door, and then told me, 'Come here as often as you possibly can; you can also come of a Sunday, but if you don't see me at the workshop don't knock at the door.' I have been to his house five times in all. The third time I was there a youngster came and called the deceased; he excused himself by saying he was wanted elsewhere, and I must go back to him the following day. Every time I used to go to his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210071"/>
               <p>house he spoke to me always in the same station. The last time I was there, last Tuesday week, the 3rd of this month, I met him standing at his door. After remaining on the doorstep for five or ten minutes at the very outside, be asked me to come inside his workshop, and said, 'Either this will be the last time you come here, or you will be able to come as and when you please.' When we were inside he asked me not to speak too loudly, and began mentioning the name of Chamberlain and the Transvaal War. He said, Don't you think all the misery of that war is due to Chamberlain, and that he deserves to be stabbed, just to feel a little of the misery he inflicts on others?' He added,'I am not rich myself, but I will undertake, through intermediaries, to guarantee a fortune to the man (<hi rend="italic">un brave</hi>) who will do that deed.' He then took bold of my hand, and pulling out a drawer, he showed me that he had made out an invoice for £10 8s. or £10 10s., and he said, 'This amount will be placed at your disposal, so that you may dress yourself decently, in order to accomplish the end in view.' On that he sat down and said, 'It is wonderful bow I have changed within the last three years. Nevertheless, don't be afraid, you won't be alone in that business; you will have the help of a Swiss who is the father of two children, You won't see <hi rend="italic">Dotts</hi> any more, because he has left last night, in company with another, to go and accomplish their duty, and I hope you will do the same, with the help of the other man I am going to give you.' He said, 'I mentioned Chamberlain to you; what do you say to that?' I answered, 'I could not do it.' Then he said, "I must have handed you about £5 in money since you have been in the habit of coming here; give me back my £5, and then we will be as good friends as if nothing bad happened. 'I told him that I had spent the money, and he knew that I had no money. The de<lb/>ceased then said, 'You must give me the money, or you won't leave this place.' The deceased then went towards the door, to close it, and in the meantime he armed himself with a piece of iron in the form of an anchor. He then said that he was quite old enough to kill somebody, considering that his children were grown up and were working for their living. He thereupon threw the piece of iron, towards me, and while dodging the blow I slipped on something and fell under the counter. When I was on the ground he came threateningly towards me, and it was then that I pulled out my knife with my left hand, opened it with my teeth, and gave the blow. When he was approaching me the second time he said, 'A good many others like you have done me before, you rascal,' and these were the last words he spoke. I say that I committed the crime, and I plead guilty to it, but I add that when I committed the crime I was on my legitimate defence; I never intended to kill him. Unfortunately I gave him a blow on a vital part. I regret it very much, not for the deceased, but for his family. That is all I have to say, and, according to my idea, I have rendered a great service to Europe."</p>

               <p>by the inspector, and I interpreted it to him; he made no reply—while I was interpreting the charge this white-handled knife was produced by a police constable, and the prisoner said in French, "That knife is mine"—I was present at the inquest—Mrs. Jung gave evidence, which I interpreted to the prisoner as she gave it—she said in English that she saw the prisoner run out of the door; I interpreted that to the prisoner, and he said, "Yes, it was me who ran out"—after the inquest I was in the yard out ride the Court at Clerkenwell—the prisoner was in a room in charge of two warders—I went in, and the prisoner asked me if I knew when he would appear before a jury—I told him that before appearing before a jury he would have to appear once or twice before the Magistrate—he then said, "I wish to let you know how I became acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">defunct</hi>"—he began the statement which has been read—I asked him if he objected to its being taken down by the police—he said, "No; I wish it to be taken down in writing; I will sign it and swear to it"—I translated what he said word for word, and I saw Inspector Green taking down from my dictation—on September 11th, before the Magistrate, this small knife was produced—the prisoner disclaimed proprietorship of it—he said, "The one with the white handle is mine; the other does not belong to me; I never saw it before"—he was then asked if be would make a statement in the usual course—he did so, and I translated it sentence by sentence while the Magistrate's Clerk took it down—the statement just read is the one—on September 3rd, at the station, I asked the prisoner whether he had been for a long time in England—he said for about two months only, and that he had left the military service in France only a short time ago; that he had served in the Marine Artillery; that he was a hairdresser by trade; that he came to London to find work in that line, failing which, he accepted the offer to act as under-waiter at Monico's Cafe; that he lost his situation there after four or five weeks, and he was looking for work when the occurrence in question happened, and that he had been running errands and frequenting railway stations in order to obtain jobs—I asked him where he had been sleeping—he said he had had no domicile for several nights, but that the night before, that was September 2nd, he had slept in a lodging-house, where he had had to pay 6d. for a bed—he gave his age as 23.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner—my address is now in North Wales—I used to live at 89, Goswell Road—on September 3rd I was called to 4, Lower Charles Street—in the workshop I saw the deceased lying on the ground on his left side, with his face turned away from the door—his left arm was curled up under his head, his right arm was hanging loose by his side; his body was still warm, but he was dead—there was a very considerable quantity of blood round the upper part of his body on the floor—after pulling away his working smock I saw a wound on the right side of his neck about half-way between the jaw bone and the collar bone, and 3in. in length—I only made a short examination then, which was corroborated by my subsequent examination—it was an incised wound penetrating all the tissues of the spinal column, including the internal jugular vein, the common carotid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210073"/>
               <p>artery, and penetrating the trachea—it was a very severe wound indeed, and must have been inflicted with considerable violence—it could have been inflicted with the larger blade of this knife—I saw blood on other parts of the floor, and also on the stool—I did not notice the drawer or the window—when I got there the room was darkened—I cannot say from the condition of the wound what position the deceased was in when the blow was inflicted—I saw no signs of a struggle in the room—a man who had received such a blow as this would not be capable of standing for long—he might stand or run for, at the outside, two minutes—he could run until he dropped dead—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination next day—the cause of death was loss of blood—there were no other injuries of any kind.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. My own opinion is that the wound was inflicted from above downwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should suggest that the wound was from without inwards—it was below the level of the prominence in the front of the throat—it was the largest artery in the neck which was severed—the blood from that artery would spurt out very forcibly—there was no blood immediately round the wound when I got there, although there was blood in the wound—the blood which had come out had trickled backwards over the back of the neck; that would suggest that that part of the neck was lower than the rest, but the quantity there was very small, and it might have welled up out of the wound—there would be trickling, after the man tell down—there was a clot of blood in the wound; that would not distend the edges of the wound—the wound was deeper towards the inner end—if the skin were tight, the knife would rip it up—I think the edge of the knife was directed towards the inner line—the blood near the window might have been shot out of the blood-vessel—the room was so small that blood spurting anywhere, wherever the man was, might have reached the walls and possibly the ceiling—I did not see any on the ceiling—I think the deceased was leaning over the prisoner when the wound was inflicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think it more probable that the wound was inflicted when the prisoner was standing over Jung, not Jung over the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Sergeant</hi>). I went to Holloway Prison on October 3rd, and saw the prisoner—I took with me the boot-repairing iron, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210074"/>
               <p>showed it to the prisoner—I speak French, and when I showed the prisoner the iron he said, "That is the iron I referred to in my statement before the Magistrate at Clerkenwell Police-court"—he then made this statement in French', which I took down and he aligned—(<hi rend="italic">Translation read:</hi> "Jung and I were in conversation at the bench in front of the window at which he was working, and this conversation continued till about 3.30 p.m., when the dispute arose between us. In the course of the dispute Jung asked me to return to him the money which he had advanced to me at different times to the amount of £4 18s., viz., 15s., 47s., 15s. and 21s., and I told him I had no money. It was then that Jung went to the Workshop door, which he closed and put his back against, and then for the first time I saw this iron, which, as I have before stated, was lying behind the door. We had come to very high words, and Jung was very angry. He then picked up this iron and came towards me as I was standing by the bench, close to the spot where Jung had been working, and he threw the iron at me, and it fell on the floor underneath the bench, close to where he had been working at the extreme corner of the room from the door. When he threw the iron at me, I to avoid the blow, slipped down on to the floor on my right side, with my right arm underneath me, and as he was following me in a threatening manner I took the knife from my outside left-hand jacket-pocket with my left hand and opened the blade of the knife with my teeth, and as he was leaning over me I stuck the knife into his neck. He then fell back on to the floor, the blood pouring from his neck. I then got up from the floor, opened the door, and rushed out into the street, followed by some person shouting, and later on I was stopped, and taken in charge by the policeman. I cannot read either French or English, and I do not know what was on the invoice or cheque to which I have referred in my statement before the Magistrate beyond what Jung told me. Jung had previously opened the first drawer in a chest of drawers near the door, and he took out of it the paper which I have mentioned; he doubled it up and held it, so that I could see it, and said to me, 'I have thought of you,' and I replied to him, 'Then you work for us.' Jung said, 'No, no; it is an advance, and I shall be repaid.' Jung told me that the paper he held in his hand was for £10 8s. or £10 10s., and that if I called upon him at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock the following morning or the afternoon, I should have the money. But when I refused to do what he wanted me to do, he asked me to return to him the money he had already advanced, and, as I have before stated, the quarrel then began. Jung then put the paper back into the same drawer, and shut the door, and commenced the attack upon me. When Jung gave me the sums of money I have mentioned he always paid me in coins, and never at any time any paper. The only person who ever went to Jung's house with me was the man <hi rend="italic">Dotts,</hi> whom I mentioned in my statement before the Magistrate, but I never knew where he lived, and I do not know where he can be found. This has been read to me ill French, and it is all true, and I have signed my name to it as being true."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a captain in the Army Service Corps—since October, 1899, I have been stationed at Hobbs' Point, Pembroke Dock, at the upper end of Milford Haven—at Hobbs' Point there are offices of the Army Service Corps—Davies was employed there under me—he was a corporal, with the local rank of sergeant—there are also offices at Hobbs' Point of the Army Ordnance Department—large quantities of ordnance stores are kept there of every description—there is a wharf attached to the stores for the purpose of trans-shipment of goods—there are a number of forts in Milford Haven for which stores from time to time are required—immediately outside Hobbs' Point there is a place called Neyland—there is a steam ferry between Hobbs' Point and Neyland which belongs to Coram &amp; Co., whose offices are at Neyland—for some years they have held the water transport with the Army Ordnance Department and the Army Service Corps—they had the trans<lb/>port of stores from the Ordnance Wharf at Hobbs' Point to the different forts—I knew Coram and James; I had to see them on matters of busi<lb/>ness—I went to their offices occasionally—I think James might be called Coram's managing clerk—nobody else was in the office, to my knowledge, except Coram and James—they sat in separate rooms—Davies was employed as clerk under me in charge of the office duties—under Davies</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210076"/>
               <p>there was a civilian clerk, named Hopkins—it was the duty of the Army Service Corps to arrange for the transp ort of stores both by land and by water—the requisitions for stores from the forts went to the Ordnance Department, where an issue note was made out—I believe it was the duty of the person making out the issue note to specify the goods, and their weight or measurement—they also made out a carrier's note, and the person making out that, should specify on it the goods, and their weight and measurement—it was not their duty to put in the carrier's name—the carrier's note was then sent to us without the carrier's name—the carrier's notes would come into Davies' hands—he would be acquainted with the contractors who held the various contracts for transport, and it was his duty to fill in the contractor's name—he should then enter in a book, called Army Book 226, the particulars of the carrier's notes—there would be the date of the receipt of the note, the goods, the weight or measurement, the carrier's name, and the destination—he should then bring me the book and the carrier's note, and my duty would be to see that the voucher was entered correctly, and to put my initials into the book—I would take the book, and Davies would call out the particulars on the notes to me—he would then send the carrier's note to the contractor, whose duty it was to carry the goods—I believe the notes were generally forwarded by passing them to Coram's ticket col<lb/>lector on the ferry, to send across by the next boat—it was not Davies' duty to take the notes across—it was no part of his duty to go across to Coram's office without my permission, during business hours—I remember him only going over on one or two occasions; that was with my permis<lb/>sion—the contractor's bargeman, or captain of the steamer, or whoever received the carrier's note, would then take it to the wharf for the purpose of loading the stores, which would be done by the Army Ordnance Department—the carrier's note would tell the contractor's bargemen where to take them—it was his duty to get the consignee's receipt for them—he would get the receipt on the carrier's note, which was kept as a voucher until the account of the contractor was sent in to our department—Coram's accounts were sent in quarterly, and when they were sent in there should be the whole of the carrier's notes making up the items of the account—they would come into Davies' hands, and it was his duty to examine the accounts and check them by the vouchers and to see whether the charges made were in accordance with the contract, and to see if a proper rate was being charged—the conditions of the contract were so much for the ton or 40 cubic feet measurement—the goods would be charged by the weight or measurement; whichever was the most would be charged—if any query arose on a bill it was Davies' duty to bring it to my notice, and also if there was any difference between the accounts and the various entries in Book 226—he would also enter the amount of the account with the carrier's name and date in a book called the bill book—he would then bring the bill book and the account to me, and my duty would be to see that, it was entered up into the bill book correctly, and to sign the account—the bills are made out on forms supplied by the War Office—when I certified the accounts as "correct in all particulars," all I knew was that the bill corresponded with the bill book, and that Davies told me it was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210077"/>
               <p>all right—I did not know if the entries were right or wrong, except as regarded the rate, which I carried in my head—as a matter of practice, I did not look through the vouchers when making out the account; I did now and again—it was not Davies' duty to summarise the vouchers—Exhibit No. 3 is a voucher for some cases of fuses, and underneath their weight and measurement I find a list of 12 other items which correspond with a number of sub-vouchers, which were summarised on this sheet—it was not Davies' duty to do that, but it saved the trouble of looking through the sub-vouchers—I did not look through the sub-vouchers—I think Davies explained that it would save a number of entries in Book 22G, so he lumped them together—that was not light—I did not order him to alter it, because I did not know that it was not right—he informed me it had been done on some previous occasion—the accounts were forwarded to Devonport, and if the accounts were over £100 they were forwarded from there to London—payment would be made by the War Depart<lb/>ment at Devonport if they were under £100, and from London if over £100—I believe payments were made by pay war<lb/>rants direct to Coram—it was not Davies' duty to measure goods which were loaded on the barges—if any stores arrived without any note at all, it would be his duty to measure them and to obtain a carrier's note as soon as possible from the consignor, whoever he might be, to cover the transport—the word "covering" would be written on the note—About the end of April or the beginning of May last there was a query in reference to one of Coram's accounts; it was in regard to a bill for £96 3s. 4d., up to March 31st, 1901—I pointed out certain alterations to Davies in the vouchers, which increased the weights by altering the figures of the stores carried—he could not say whether the whole of the alterations were his or not, but those that were his he had made because the weights given by the Army Ordnance Department were incorrect—he said he had been in the habit of measuring the stores with the assist<lb/>ance of the Army Ordnance foreman, named Law, and had so discovered the discrepancy, and that he had altered the weights, so that Coram should be correctly paid—the alterations in this bill were all in the same direction, to get more money for Coram—Davies said the stores were at the Ordnance Wharf, and that he had measured them there after they had been placed on the barge—to a certain extent I accepted that as an explanation of the suspicion of fraud which was arising—I said a great deal to him, but I cannot remember all I said now—I went through the account for £96 3s. 4d. item by item, after which I went to Coram's office; I think it was in the earlier part of May—I saw Coram there, and called him outside the office into a sort of yard—I had not seen James that morning before I began to speak to Coram—I told him that various alterations had been brought to my notice in the account for £96 3s. 4d., which involved over-payment to him by the Government, the weights in the items having been increased—I said I had seen Davies, and had asked him for an explanation, and that Davies had said that the weights had been altered to include the excess weight which he had found on the barge—I said I was most anxious to get to the bottom of the matter, and asked him if his bargeman could assist me by throwing any light on the matter—he said, "Let us call James; he manages all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210078"/>
               <p>these things for me"—he called James out of the office, and I repeated to him what I had said to Coram—James said the weights were charged as they were received from Davies, and, from what their bargeman had told them, they had carried hundreds of tons for the War Office more than what they had been paid for—so far as I remember, I left them then—I went and saw Coram once wore—I do not remember if it was after the matter of the target had been found out—at a later date I told Coram that his contract was to be stopped—I also had after the bill for £93 3s. 4d., some queries about a bill for £180 7s. 7d., up to June 30th, 1900, in which the target is included—I should think the charge for towing a Richardson Record target from Hobbs' Point to Pop<lb/>ton would be about £2 or £3—when this bill came before me with the queries I asked Davies how he came to pass the charge for towing as a charge for freight—he said it had escaped his notice when he examined the bill—on the bill it is entered as 163 tons 32 ft, which, at 5s. a ton, would be £41—after that I met James casually out<lb/>side the railway station at Neyland—at that time I did not know that the War Office tug <hi rend="italic">Drake</hi> had towed the target—I asked James how he came to make such an enormous charge for towing the target to Popton, and I mentioned the amount—he said he regarded it as a fair charge under the terms of their contract, and that as no query had been raised, he gathered that the War Office had admitted the charge as fair and reason able—the account had been paid then—I do not think I said any more then; I had to catch the steam ferry at the time—I expressed my sur<lb/>prise that he should have done so—in the account for £180 7s. 7d. the charge is made for freight, and not for towing, which would mean that it was carried on board a barge—the targets are frameworks of wood which float in the water and are towed up and down by tugs, to be fired at by the forts—this is a photograph of one (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>); you could not get them on a barge; they are not taken to pieces—I saw Davies again about the matter, and asked him how he came to pass the charge, and he then said he had passed it as a fair and reasonable one under Coram's contract—not more than two weeks elapsed between the time I saw James, and when I saw Davies the second time about it—I cannot remember having had any conversation with Coram about the target—when the questions about the account for £180 7s. 7d. arose Coram's contract was stopped—that was about the middle of May, 1901—I wrote to him about it, and saw him afterwards—I told him I had orders not to employ his firm any longer in conveying stores, in consequence of the inquiries made into his accounts and the discovery of the over-payment which had been made to him—he said he was unaware of any over-payments having been made, but if any had been made he was ready to refund them to the public—I had suggested that to him, and I suggested that he had letter write and do so—I never suggested to him that he had been paying Davies anything—after my conversation with him I heard something about the <hi rend="italic">Drake</hi> having towed the target—I told Divies that I had been informed that the <hi rend="italic">Drake</hi> had towed the target—he said he was confident that the service had been carried out by Coram &amp; Co., and that the other clerks in the office were aware of that fact—in May I called upon Davies to make some explanation of these</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210079"/>
               <p>alterations—he made this report voluntarily on May 30th, 1901—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the toted tonnage shown on each of the vouchers of the account for £96 3s. 4d. from Coram was correct, and had been measured by him; that he had carried out that duty since relieving Sergeant Ashby in 1899, and that he was usually assisted by one of the A.O.D. subordinates; that he was most careful in taking the measurements, folly understanding that upon them the contractor was paid; and that he did not superintend the loading or unloading of the barges, and, therefore, did not know what stores were upon them.</hi>)—a little while after that Coram &amp; Co. wrote a letter to the General Commanding the Western District, Devonport, dated June 7th, 1901—(<hi rend="italic">This dated that Captain Grier had informed Coram &amp; Co. that he was no longer to employ them in conveying by barge any stores to or from the forts in Milford Haven, and that a sergeant had been placed under arrest for falsifying their carriers notes, so as to enable them to be paid for stores in excess of what they had carried, and that the assumption was that the sergeant had received a pecuniary benefit from them for so doing; that they emphatically denied having any monetary transactions with him or any other servants of the Government, and courted the fullest inquiry; that they accepted the carrier's notes, altered or unaltered, and that their accounts were made out according to the weights shown thereon; that they had no means whatever of knowing whether the notes were correct or not; that their bargemaster had repeatedly reported that he believed they (Coram's) were carrying a large quantity of stores for which they were not paid, as he was not getting carrier's notes for them; that they trusted the order would be reconsidered, and that if it was right or wrong they would agree, on a fair adjustment, to refund any overpaid amounts, where it was rightly shown that the alterations or errors were unjustly made.</hi>)—up to that time I had never heard that stores were being carried by Coram for which they were not paid, or that the weights on the carrier's notes were inaccurately shown—it wag no part of Davies' duty to write a memorandum to Coram unless it bore my signature—Exhibit 20 is in Coram's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>) "Bill for hire of steamer. £114 passed for payment yesterday.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210081"/>
               <p>had done so, as they were not for sea freight—he said the stores shown on them were stores for which transport was required, but for which he had received no carrier's notes—he said there was a precedent for the buff forms' use—I also signed them twice more, once as officer in charge of transport and once acknowledging the performance of the above duty—Davies assured me it had been carried out—at that time he was thoroughly trusted by me, and I took his word for it, without making any inquiry—I say the same about Exhibits 52, 53, and 54, which are similar buff coloured forms, except that on 52 and 53 I have not signed as to the service being performed—they purport to be signed by J. Law—in October, 1900, it was my duty to prepare Forts Popton, Hubbertson, and South Hook, for the Carmarthen Artillery Militia; they were going there for practice—it was my duty to see that sufficient bedding was at those forts, and on October 3rd I made a demand on the Ordnance Department for a sufficiency of bedding; it was required very urgently—I found that Coram's barges were not available on that day, and I arranged with them for the hire of a steamer for that day—I cannot say who I arranged it with now; their charge was £5 per day, which was then the usual charge, owing to the rise in the price of coal—Davies knew I was engaged in the transport of bedding—Exhibit 60 is the form made out in his writing for the steamer to be at Hobbs' Point at 2 p.m. on October 3rd—the stores were loaded partly on the steamer and partly on board the department pinnace—the steamer towed the pinnace to the forts—in the ordinary course a bill for £5 was sent in by Com, and Exhibit 59 is the warrant for payment—the bill for the £5 is in Davies' writing—Exhibit 61 is Coram's bill for £127 17s. 11d. up to October, 1900—in that bill I find the particulars of a carrier's note on buff coloured paper; Exhibit 62 relating to 47 tons 10ft of bedding, beds, etc., to be removed from Hobbs' Point to Forts Hubberston, etc., for use of the Carmarthen Artillery—that is in Davies' writing, and is charged for in the bill—Exhibit 63 is another buff-coloured carrier's note for 40 tons 18ft. for carriage of bedding to Fort Popton—that is in Davies' writing—that is the bedding which went down to the forts in the steamer on October 3rd—that bill has been paid and the service charged for the second time—Exhibits 64, 65, 66 and 67 are carrier's notes, and are summarised on Exhibit 64; they relate to beds, blankets, and bolsters from Pembroke Dock to Popton, Hubberston, and South Hook—only one set of beds and bedding went down to those forts for the Carmarthen Artillery in October, and that was the set which went down in the steamer and the pinnace—the total charged is £127 17s. 11d. and paid for—in Exhibit 65 the weight of the beds and bedding is 22 tons 16ft 2in.—the 1 in the 22 has been altered, con<lb/>verting 12 into 22—on Exhibit 67 I find an item of 19 tons 9ft. 7in.; the 1 has been put in front of the 9 making 9 into 19, so that in the third time of charging there is an addition added—in calculating the overcharge in the bill of £127 17s. 11d. I find it is £86.</p>

The work Davies was doing last year was, I believe, formerly done by Staff-sergeant Ashley—he would be a much older and more experienced man than Davies—I went there in October, 1899—I cannot say how long Davies had been there then—he was a lance-corporal when I went there—I do not know if he was receiving 3s. 6d. a day—I never heard of any general order that targets should only be towed by Government tugs—Davies always insisted that, according to his own recollection, this target was towed by Coram—we should not send a barge for a small amount if a carrier's note came from the Ordnance Department—they would accumulate till we got a large load, which would be about 30 tons; in the meanwhile the carrier's notes would remain in the A.S.C. office—when we had got a load the carrier's notes would not be pinned together, and a sub-voucher would not be pinned to them—I cannot say that has never been done, but it is not done as a general rule—we had a lot of trouble with the documents—I know goods were sent off without carrier's notes; I cannot say very often—the 58 sets of tent bottoms would weigh 57 tons—I cannot say if they were sent away without any issue note or carrier's note—I am not prepared to deny it—Davies never took the carrier's notes across to Coram, to my knowledge—he might, perhaps, have done so; if so, it would be in cases marked urgent—it may have happened that the carrier's notes were not sent to Coram, but were handed to the age man by the Ordnance Wharf f reman—it was not a common practice—the poin✗ting of the carrier's notes was done by the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a foreman in the Army Ordnance Department at Hobbs' Point, Pembroke Dock—when one of the forts in Milford Haven' required stores, a requisition was sent in to the Army Ordnance Department, an issue note being sent, containing the weight and capacity of the goods, which are weighed and measured by one of the men under my directions—we took a press copy of the issue notes, which we retain—the carrier's note is made out in the Ordnance Office, and a press copy taken of it there, and in respect to weight and measurement it should be a duplicate of the issue note—if the carrier's note was altered after it leaves our office it would, of course, cease to correspond with the press copy—the duty of providing the transport is the duty of the Army Service Corps, and the carrier's note is sent there; while it is there the goods are taken down to the wharf to be ready for loading, which is then done—the bargeman gives the notes to the wharf foreman, who checks the goods as they are loaded; then the carrier's note is taken away by the bargeman, the foreman getting a receipt from him—we should have no press copy relating to goods coming from Fort Popton to the dock—I produce all books containing press copy issue notes with regard to the ledger stores, as I kept them—I have compared them with the carrier's notes; they correspond, except that one has been altered in relation to the carriage of tent bottoms—on page 524 "57 tons," that has been altered in the press copy to 87 tons in indelible pencil—the carrier's note has also been altered from 5 to 8—at the end of June last year I received a requisition as to towing a Richardson target to Fort Popton; that was lying on the wharf in sections—it was put together soon afterwards—I made out the issue note entered at page 460—the original sheets are kept at the War Office—they go there to vouch the accounts rendered to them—the stock is checked by the ledger to which the issue notes are posted—I delivered neither more nor less than is on the vouchers—we are continually stock-taking, almost every week all the year round—I did not specify upon the note the weight or cubical contents of the target, because the target would be towed to its destination by a Government vessel, as had been done every year before, free of charge—a short time afterwards, in con<lb/>sequence of what Corporal Abbott told me, I caused the target to be measured—we found it to be 362 tons 32ft.—I inserted it on the copies of the vouchers in the office, the press copy, and the original issue note, other copies going to the Ordnance Office, what we call our office: the office of the foreman of fort ordnance—there are three docu<lb/>ments, one original and two copies, which the War Office require—I inserted it in two, but not in our own copy—I never saw this carrier's note before the inquiry—Davies filled in "Coram &amp; Co." upon it—that would be filled in in the Army Service Office, and it would be his duty, or that of any other clerk.</p>

               <p>exhibit appears as 14 tons 36ft. in the note—it does not figure in the book because we did not make the issue note; we received it in the store—the correct measurement of 72 cases of skeleton cartridges is about 4 tons 36 ft.—in the same carrier's note there is an entry of Gig W, 22 tons measurement—the gig boat lettered W was between 6 and 10 tons—Exhibit 39 is another voucher—it refers to 21 circular tents and poles—that is not in the book—3 tons 23ft. is about correct—pencilled on the exhibit is 5 tons 5ft. measurement—3 has been altered into 5 in the tons column—Exhibits 40 to 41 refer to the bill for £95 3s. 1ld.—on Exhibit 40, which is on the buff-coloured form, I find 17 tons 7cwt. of ammunition entered, and 10 tons 12ft. 9in of light goods, without specification of what the goods are—in No. 1238, bill 31 is charged 17 tons 7cwt. heavy, and 10 tons 12ft. light—that is a note for "Cartage from Hobbs' Point to Haven Forts, and return with stores"—I have been through the stores receipts, ledgers, and books of the Ordnance Department—I have not been able to find any trace of goods specified in Exhibit 40 as having been issued out of the store or carried—I find three carriers' notes at pages 379, 380, and 442—the weight would be about 10 tons—in Bill 31 I find no entry relating to them—Exhibit 41 is a similar form of land transport, showing 38 tons 14ft. light goods and 17 tons 6cwt. 1qr. heavy, trans<lb/>ported on July 17th from Hobbs' Point to Haven Forts—no goods are specified—in Bill 31 I find 38 tons 14ft. of light charged for, and 17 tons 6cwt. 1qr. heavy—the measurement is shown correctly but the weight is generally above—I have searched and been unable to trace the light goods—there are a number of press copies of carriers' notes at pages 346, 349, 366, 368, 369, 373, 376, 380, 382, each for small quantities of stores—the total measurement given is 7 tons 28ft. 7in.—in Bill 31 no one of those is included—those are copied for dates about July 27th, for the period covered by the bill for £95 3s. 11d., to July 31st, and are not included in the bill—looking at Exhibit 45, that is a similar bill for £179 18s. 5d. to September 7th, 1900, and with a number of vouchers, Exhibits 40 to 51, which are all carrier's notes on buff-coloured forms for land transport, and are included in the bill—the body of the notes is Davies' writing—there is bo specification of the kind of goods—I can find no trace of them in the books—Exhibits 47, 49, and 50 refer to tents—those notes represent a total, at 10 tents to the ton, of 1,420 teats, or 142 tons—between August 16th and September 4th; 1900, the period covered by the three notes, the ledgers are kept by the ledger clerk, and the items have been checked with the vouchers—there were nothing like 1,420 tents at Pembroke—the largest number about that time was about 150—we were very short; we had nearly every tent out—Exhibit 52 and Exhibit 53 are buff-coloured forms of a similar kind, and tht amounts are charged in the bill for £1,188—they are signed "J. Law, A.O.D."—the body is in Corporal Davfos' writing—looking at Exhibit 54, I do not know the writing of the signature "J. Law"—it is a similar bill—I can find no traces of the transactions represented by 52, 53, and 54—in the period preceding September 7th I find in Book 3 of the Press Copy Carrier's Note Book, at pages 375, 381, 419, 426, and 427, notes 4ft, 44, 47, and 51, for small amounts, totalling about 2 tons 17cwt. 3qr. 27lb.—in Bill 45, for £179 18s. 5d. none of those notes are include—the body</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LEYCESTER</hi>. The buff forms were signed by Captain Grier, as the officer of requisition—I would not accept Davies' writing—Cummings worked out seven overcharges; I can state that they are correct—it might save time to lump small amounts, but that is not allowed—I do not find one issue note agree with the buff forms—if stores are taken to forts, and others returned, I would expect to find them in the ledgers—I would not expect to find carrier's notes of goods coming into wharf, but they would be in the vouchers from the persons who sent the goods to us, and we can trace the dates in our books—on one or two occasions I measured for myself—I was not present when Cummings worked out the figures, but he worked them out by the same tonnage—I measured the gig or cutter, but I did not come to the tonnage given in the note—I measured the goods packed on a barge with a guard, and tarpaulin put over—they were packed when turned out on to the fort—they would come back packed more loosely, and take more space—the correct measure<lb/>ment in Exhibit 39, which is in the note 21 tons, is 3 tons 23ft. 6in., but I am inclined to think Cummings has made a mistake, inasmuch as I think 6 tons came back for exchange, being storm damaged; therefore, they would not come back in bags or anything—an ordinary tent has a pin bag and a</p>

James' deposit account consists of two entries, a payment in of £240 in March, 1899, which I have heard was the proceeds of his sale of a house through a building society, and he drew out £40 in January this year—it was at interest—he had no current account—I knew him personally—I understood he was Coram's servant—James had no power to draw on the business account, nor sign "Coram &amp; Co.," nor endorse cheques.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective</hi>). On August 14th last I received a warrant from Bow Street for the arrest of James and Davies, and on August 20th I went to Neyland—I went to Coram's office and saw James—I read the warrant to him—I told him who I was, and that I was going to arrest him on a warrant for unlawfully obtaining a security worth £180 7s. 7d. from the War Office, and that I was going to arrest him in connection with Corporal Davies—I told him he would be taken to London and charged—he said, "I do not understand what you mean by obtaining £180 7s. 7d."—I said, "That was the amount of the cheque paid to Messrs. Coram for their account for the quarter ending June last year, which included the charge of £41 for taking the floating target to Fort Popton, a service which it is suggested was never carried out"—he said, "I know nothing about that; we make out the accounts from the carrier's notes, and if we had not received a carrier's note we could not have charged for it. I am only a paid clerk; Mr. Coram attends the office, and makes out his own accounts, and writes his own letters. I am manager, and only make out the accounts and write letters in his absence, I have no authority to sign cheques. Mr. Coram sits in the office from morning until night, and if anything has been done I have not benefited by it. The head of the firm is the person who ought to answer for it"—later on, when Mr. Coram saw him, he said, "Mr. Coram will have to come to London and get me out of this"—he produced the press copybook, and said, "You can see who does the business"—he showed me letters in it in his own writing and in Coram's writing—that same day I went to the barracks at Pembroke Dock, where Davies was in</p>

There was a bundle of quite 100 vouchers tied up with the bill—I only saw a letter book at Coram's office; I saw no books relating to any business at the office; I did not look for them—when I arrested James he left a note on his desk for Coram—the first time I saw Coram was at the barracks, about an hour after I had arrested James; he did not see James then—I saw James writing a note telling Coram he was going to be taken away by the police, and, I think, asking Coram to come and see him—I had been at Pembroke Dock about a month—I did not make any search for books when I arrested James; I did not think I was justified in doing so.</p>

I was with Stockley on August 20th, and on August 22nd I went to Coram's premises at Neyland Point—the only offices there, apart from the railway office, are Coram's offices—I searched his office—I found Exhibit 20 there, "Bill for hire of steamer, etc."—on August 23rd I saw Coram and James on their arrival at New Milford Station—I asked Coram for the keys of the safe—in his presence and in James', I searched the safe; they were on bail then—I found a press copybook in which all the accounts had been copied—that is the only book I could find in connection with this case—I said to Coram, "Have not you any day book, cash book or ledger, as I cannot find them any where?"—he said, "No, the only book we keep is the press copy account book; there in no need for any other books; we make our bills from the carriers' notes, and then press copy them," or words to that effect—I said, "How do you make out your accounts for this</p>

I live at Neyland, Pembrokeshire—I have worked on barges there for the last 37 years—I have been employed by Coram, and by his predecessors in the same business—I have carried Government stores on the barges; there were about 10 altogether—during the summer of 1900 I was very busy taking stores from Hobbs' Point to the different forts, and from one fort to another—I have often carried goods without carrier's notes; I carried them without notes most frequently from the forts to Hobbs' Point—I took any goods which I was told to take—Davies would kick up a lot of <hi rend="italic">row</hi> because the measurements were wrong—I was getting too few goods—I used to complain to Law, and I spoke to all the master gunners at the Haven forts—I have spoken to Davies about it—I have taken ammunition from one fort to another—I have been sent to a fort sometimes, and have been told I had come to the wrong one—I have reported that to James and to Law—he would measure the barge, and send me after Davies—I have spoken to Davies about not having carrier's notes, and he has said he would send them—when I spoke to Law he has altered the carrier's notes himself—I remember a quantity of bedding going down to Popton last year for the Carmarthen Militia from Hobbs' Point—there was a great pressure of work then, more than I have ever seen before—I took a load of clean bedding down to the forts about a week before October 3rd, and I brought it back after the Militia had gone; it had not been unpacked when I brought it back, and I also brought back some which the <hi rend="italic">Milford Haven</hi> had taken down—I received no carrier's notes for bringing the stuff back—during 1900 I took many tents down the harbour to the different forts—the Glamorgan and Cardigan Militia were at South Hook—I took the tent-boards down afterwards; they were not allowed them at first—I brought back all the tents that I had taken down, eight and 10 one day, and 10 or 12 the next—there were times then that I did not have carrier's notes—I reported that to Davies, and I think he said he would send them over to the office—when I took stores from one fort to another, and had no carrier's note, the master gunner who sent them would make out a carrier's note and give it to me</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As a rule, I got a carrier's note when I took goods from Hobbs' Point, but very often I did not—I kept no record of what I carried—I told James I had carried a quantity of stores without a carrier's note—he would not give me a slip of paper to take back to get a carrier's note—I have gone to the department, and got a carrier's note sometimes when I had carried goods without one—I never knew of Davies altering a carrier's note in my presence—I never saw a carrier's note again after I had given it to James.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am not much of a scholar; I can read a carrier's note—I had other work to do besides Government business—I have brought empties back from the forts to Hobbs' Point; they would be stowed on board anyhow, sometimes with a carrier's note and sometimes without—I did not go to the forts every day.</p>

I have been employed by Coram &amp; Co. for the last 28 years, and have sometimes been in charge of one of their boats—I remember taking bedding to Popton last year; some of it was on a steamer, and some of it in a pinnace—that was by Davies' orders—I had no carrier's note—there was too much for the pinnace, and we took what the pinnace could not take—there was an artillery corporal in charge of the pinnace—the bedding was distributed at the different forts.</p>

I am a registered medical prac<lb/>titioner at 170, Elizabeth Street, North Woolwich—I first saw the deceased on September 13th at 2.30—I thought he was dying—he was collapsed, and almost pulseless—he was conscious—he complained of pain in the abdomen—I saw him again about 7 p.m.—I thought he would not live many hours—he was almost unconscious; the extremities were cold—the widow came the next morning for a certificate of death—when I</p>

               <p>first went I took his pulse, which was slack—I did not know the cause of death, and I did not think I ought to give a certificate, as I might he covering an unqualified man—I heard he was unqualified—I made a <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination on September 16th—the cause of death, in my opinion, was the formation of an abscess in the abdomen, overlying the right, kidney, setting up peritonitis as a secondary cause, and death followed from simple exhaustion—the abscess had been forming for at least a fort<lb/>night; it was as large as a cocoanut, containing at least 10oz. of pus—a competent medical man should have discovered pus at least a week before I saw the deceased—I do not think the swelling would have been detected when Dr. Head was called in—the inflammatory symptoms, the tempera<lb/>ture, and everything pointed to, and would make one look for, the presence of pus—when once formed it could not be mistaken for anything else—if I had examined the abdomen on September 10th I should have diagnosed the presence or absence of pus—the swelling would be elastic—the proper treatment was immediate operat on—there was no evidence to show there had been dysentery—the symptoms Mrs. Guery de<lb/>scribes would indicate intestinal congestion—the Medical Officer of the Seamen's Hospital has no such record—he was treated for phthisis and inflammation of the elbow—I should have recommended immediate opera<lb/>tion, the only thing that could have saved the man's life—it would have prolonged it by causing an abatement of the symptoms—there was nothing to lead me to think there was any connection between the abscess I found and the tuberculosis—I should not be surprised at symptoms in the other portions of the body—the left lung contained numerous deposits of tubercle, and the lung was quite adherent to the pleura, indicating some old standing pleurisy—the right lung contained a few tubercular deposits—they were not so large as those of the left—there were not 12; that is a mistake—the state of the left lung was confined to the apex—both lungs were in a state of passive congestion, due to stagnation, as in the case of a person remaining in bed several days, which will induce slow circulation and set up passive congestion as distinct from active con<lb/>gestion, which has acute and inflammatory symptoms—there was no breaking down—in the prescription the five grains of Dover's powder contained a small quantity of opium—that would relieve the pain—then he prescribed five grains of quinine, which would reduce the temperature—that was all right, if he had kept to that treatment—for abdominal treatment the wife's giving castor oil would be bad—the only relief was by opening the swelling—as to discovering the abscess, you first of all have a history of the case from the widow—then one would take the tem<lb/>perature—that was formerly, before she thermometer was used, done as Head did it, by guess, but the doctors were educated by their sense of touch to get it better than we do by the use of a clinical thermometer—having localised the pain, I should have confined my research to that region, and ascertained if the swelling increased—if I had been told the man had suffered from dysentery, it would have made me think it might have been dysenteric ulceration of the bowels, which in its early stage would probably appear—in a later stage you get inflammation and a cellular swelling—I have known a case where a man lived eight days after ulcera<lb/>tion of the bowels—this might have been mistaken for ulceration of the</p>

               <p>bowels, and a local abscess formed, giving rise to the identical symptoms the patient had—if a man arrived at that conclusion I should not con<lb/>sider that criminal negligence, although he was wrong—if he had discovered dysenteric symptoms, he ought to have kept his eye or his examination directly to the part affected; if he had done so he was bound to have detected the presence of swelling sooner or later—talking of making one or two examinations of the stomach is nonsense—the man's emaciated con<lb/>dition would aid him to make the examination—I thin any qualified man who made the mistake the prisoner has, would be guilty of criminal negligence—a country practitioner might have overlooked the symptom—the most accomplished might make a mistake—then the <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examination discloses something different—the effect of having diarrh✗oea would be an effort of the system to get rid of it, to overcome the inflam<lb/>matory symptoms—the bottles produced contain nothing good or ill—I gave him a pill to ease the pain—an operation only would have pro<lb/>longed his life—he was not a good subject for an operation.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D., F.R.C.P. I am Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence in St. Mary's Hospital. I have read the depositions in this case—I heard the last witness's evidence—the deceased's death, in my opinion, was due to a large abscess formed at the extremity of the right kidney, that led to blood poisoning, and that to general failure of strength and death—the symptoms of vomiting, diarrhoea, and abdo<lb/>minal pain would point to abdominal trouble, and indicate a necessity for a careful examination of the abdomen—a competent medical man would be able to discover abscess within a few days of August 31st, by Sep<lb/>tember 5th, or certainly by September 7th—assuming abscess had been detected or suspected, there was absolutely no treatment but operation—a careful examination of the abdomen ought to have been made by the hands by percussion, or tapping of the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, by which you detect what is called the dull note over the abscess—that should be done daily, if not twice a day—twice a day is usual when we suspect abscess—an average medical man of 20 years' standing ought not to have missed it—it would be unskilful treatment for an average medical man to have missed an abscess of that size and in the locality where it is easily detected—emaciation would render detection much easier; the only difficulty is in very fat subjects—the result of the operation would have prolonged life, and most probably would have saved it—death at the operating table was unlikely; the abscess was in no vital part, though an operation is better performed at an hospital—the prisoner ought to have taken the temperature; that alone would have put him on the track of the abscess—the fact that the temperature was not taken was the greatest piece of negligence; and, secondly, there was no daily examination of the abdomen—I saw the copy of the prescription with the depositions—I think it is shocking that, without knowing the condition of the kidneys, that a dose of opium should have been given—no qualified medical man would dream of giving it—a perinephritic abscess can be discovered before death—a number of them nave been operated upon, and the patient recovered.</p>

I live at Bleak House, Stratford—I am His Majesty's Coroner for the County Borough of West Ham—I held an inquest on the body of Michael Guery on September 17th, 1901—a summons was issued for the prisoner's attendance on September 23rd, 1901—he did not attend—he was arrested on October 3rd, 1901—he gave evidence after being duly cautioned—I read it to him; the first of the three pages I handed to him—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "I am an unqualified medical assistant. I have had 41 years' experience, 21 dispensing, and 20 as a dentist. I put up board produced at No. 20, Barwood Road. I am not a registered dentist. I have only been at Barnwood Road four days. On Thursday, September 12th, I went to North Woolwich Road, and saw deceased. He was very bad. Both lungs were blocked. I discovered that with my stethoscope. Left was perfectly solid. Right was better than the left. Pulse was very feeble, and heard too. Temperature I gussed at 100. I gave him prescriptions mentioned in paper produced</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">signed</hi>). My opinion is that the man had phthisis. His wife told me he had been drinking. I examined the stomach, and found in places on the right hand side it hurt the patient. I ordered mustard poultices, and thought he was going to have peritonitis. I have never seen a case of perinephritic abscess, and do not think it would be discovered until after death. I have made hundreds of <hi rend="italic">post<lb/>mortem</hi> examinations. I showed Dr. Mitchell the prescriptions; I have shown the Jury. I was not half drunk at the time. Dr. Mitchell came. In return for treatment of the deceased I received board and lodging. I did not tell either Mrs. Guery or Dr. Mitchell that I was an M.R.C.S. I told Mrs. Query that I had been with Dr. Moir 20 years. I did not tell her that I was unqualified. I do not remember that Dr. Mitchell asked me whether I was qualified; I certainly did not make the answers he suggested. I was so bad with my own eyes that I was glad to have another medical man. I examined the abdomen on the first visit, and I was in attendance on the deceased for a week. I only made one or two examinations of the stomach. I thought his trouble was all lungs. My examination was very careful. The patient complained of pain in his stomach. The medicine was always the same. I got my medicine from Mitchell, the chemist. I thought my medicine was doing him good. He got up and had his trousers on. I never detected the presence of an abscess. There was no external enlargement. The man was terribly emaciated. Stomach at no time was distended. I do not think I could have discovered presence of abscess until after death. I should say left lung might clear up. I personally never operate. If I had a case I should refer it to the hospital. I am capable of judging whether an operation is necessary. I never dreamt of an operation in this case. I never took his temperature. I have not had one for eight months.")—Dr. Moir was a medical man in practice in the parish—I do not think he has been there for some years.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 82, Ann Street, Plumstead—I was engaged by the prisoner to act as cook at the Drill Hall at Woolwich, my father being employed as waiter there—I was first there in October, 1899—at that time the deceased was there in residence—she left in December, 1899—I left before she did—I was re-engaged to perform the same service in July, 1901—the prisoner was then living at the Drill Hall alone—at the beginning of September I heard that the deceased intended to return, and she did return on Saturday, September 14th, from Eastbourne,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210111"/>
               <p>where she, had been in service—I do not know if the prisoner and the deceased occupied the same bedroom for the first few days, but they were on very good terms—I did not see anything to show that there was other than good feeling till Friday, September 20th—on that day I arrived at the canteen at 7.30 a.m.—I did not sleep there—between 9.30 and 10 a.m. I heard the prisoner and his wife quarrelling—she said she wanted to send out for some groceries, and he said she wanted it to give to her son—during the day they did not seem to get friendly at all—I used to go away about 1 p.m. and come back about 3.30 p.m.—I did not return till 5.30 that afternoon—they were still on strained terms—my father asked the prisoner if he had been up in the officers' dressing-rooms—he said, "No", but he thought he knew who had—when I come back at 5.30 the prisoner asked me if I had opened the dressing-room windows—I said, "No", and he went into the kitchen and asked the deceased what she meant by telling him a lie—he said she had no business to go to the dressing-rooms, as they were nothing to do with her—she paid she would go if she liked—he paid, if she did, he would put her out—she said that, as he had asked her to come back, she intended to stay—the dressing-rooms are used at all times of the day; the windows are supposed to be shut on account of the swords—there was a discussion on the Saturday about the deceased cleaning the brass plate outside the door; the prisoner said his wife wanted to see a man out there, and not to clean the plate—on the Friday evening I stayed there till about 9.30; they did not seem to get any more friendly before I left—the next morning I returned about 7.30 a.m.; they did not seem any different when I saw them together—about 9.30 a Mr Tricker brought some rather large pieces of furniture; I opened the door for him, and he asked for Mrs. Mills—I asked him to go up to the canteen door; he went up, and I think my father opened the door—I heard the prisoner say he would not have the furniture brought in; Mrs. Price said she would have them brought in the Drill Hall way, as she had bought and paid for it—I think it was taken away—when it had gone I went into the billiard-room—I heard voices in the kitchen as if they were quarrelling; I could not hear what was said—as I was going through the dining-room I heard the prisoner say, "I will stick this through you," and I heard the rattle of a sword, as if it was being put back into a scabbard; that was about 9.45 a.m.—I had seen a sword in its scabbard in the bar just outside the kitchen the previous day—I went into the kitchen; the deceased was talking to me, and the prisoner told me not to take any notice of her, as she was a bad woman, and would make me as bad as she was herself—the deceased said she knew she had done wrong by going away, but she was sorry for it—I was going home just after 10 a.m.; that is not my usual time to go home—I went into the kitchen to clean some silver, and the prisoner asked me to get him some soap to wash with; I told him there was none downstairs, but I would get him some—he said he would go up<lb/>stairs and wash—he went up, and after a short time he came down, carrying a rifle—he sat with it at the bottom of the stairs leading to the kitchen—the deceased was in the kitchen—the prisoner said to me so that she could hear, "If it was not for studying you, Mary, I would shoot Mrs. Price"—the deceased said, "Don't study Mary; do it"—he said, "All right"—he took the sight cap off—he was about to put the rifle to his shoulder,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190110210112"/>
               <p>and I ran in between them—Mrs. Price screamed and ran out into the porch leading to the kitchen—I was standing just beside the stairs when I ran between them; we were all in the kitchen—the prisoner went into the bar then with the rifle—I do not know what he did with it—I went home about 11.30 a.m.; I did not hear anything more between them—I returned just before two, as the prisoner sent for me—I found the deceased sitting in the kitchen crying; the prisoner was in the bar—I did not hear them speak—I did not notice the rifle after my return—the prisoner went upstairs from 2 till about 3.30—the deceased was down<lb/>stairs during that time, getting tea ready in the kitchen—when the prisoner came down I went out for about 20 minutes; I returned about 4 o'clock—I did not hear anything between them—about 5 o'clock the prisoner told me to go home—I said I would stop and help Mrs. Price wash up—she said, "You need not stop"—the prisoner said I was to go home and he would do the washing up himself—about that time two teas were ordered for the officers' mess—Mrs. Price said she could manage them her<lb/>self—the prisoner said, "You stay, Mary, and see my teas are sent in"—Mrs. Price and myself got them ready, and I told the prisoner they were ready—he said, "Your father will take them in, Mary"—my father took them in—Mrs. Price wanted to hand the tray to father; I asked her to let me hand it, as I knew what a jealous man the prisoner was; Mrs. Price pushed past me and gave it to father—the prisoner was jealous of any man—he looked very unpleasantly at my father then—I asked him what he looked like that for, and said, "Do you think my father is the attraction"—he said, "It is not your father's fault, Mary; it is Mrs. Price's"—Mrs. Price and I remained in the kitchen, and the prisoner went outside the kitchen door; he could hear what was said—Mrs. Price said, "Don't upset yourself, Mary; he is not worth it"—the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">Ain't</hi> I? I will soon make short work of you"—I was standing by the dresser, and Mrs. Price was standing by the table, with her back to the fire-place, and sideways to the canteen—I had heard the name Williams mentioned in the morning by the prisoner—I do not think I heard what was said; I only heard the name—it was after the affair of the sword—I heard Mrs. Price say, "You promised me when I came back you would not mention that name"—I did not hear him say anything after that—about five minutes after the prisoner had said to his wife, "I will make short work of you," and while we were standing in the kitchen I heard a shot—Mrs.Price screamed, reeled back, and fell down by the gas stove—I screamed, and ran out into the canteen—I did not see anybody there—I fainted then—when I came to, I was sitting in the corporal's room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased came back because the prisoner desired it—I heard that Mrs. Price went away with Williams—when she came back she wasto take over the cooking; she had nothing to do with the officers' quarters; I was to do them—during the whole of the last two days they were perpetually at odds—she answered the prisoner back when he spoke—I know the prisoner's son—he was there on the Friday; he came in about 9 or 9.30 a.m.—I saw Him there on Saturday; he came about 9.30 a.m.—I knew nothing about the furniture till it was delivered—I heard the prisoner say that it was unknown him that it had been ordered—I did not hear the prisoner come into the kitchen on the Friday</p>

               <p>morning, and ask his son what he wanted 1s. for—I did not hear anything that young Price said—the prisoner came into the kitchen, and said he would not give the deceased the shilling she wanted—the interval between the last conversation and the firing of the rifle was about five minutes—I was standing by the dresser in the kitchen rolling up an apron during that five minutes—the prisoner was sitting outside the kitchen—I could not see him—Mrs. Price was washing up—if she had looked round she could have seen him—she was never violent—I did not hear anything said during that five minutes.</p>

I am father of the last witness, and am a waiter at this Drill Hall—I was engaged by the Canteen Committee—I served under the prisoner—I knew him and his wife when they lived there together—I remember Mrs. Price going away and then coming back—they seemed all right after her return on September 14th up to September 20th—I did not hear them having words on the Friday—I was there at times during Friday—I was there on the Saturday—I heard words between them about 11.30 a.m. about the delivery of some furniture—I heard the deceased say, "You have got me back now, and you will have to keep me, the last time I went away I went with nothing; the next time I mean to go with something"—that took place between 9.30 and 10 a.m.—the prisoner said, "Go away, or I will push you away," or words to that effect—she said, "I dare you, I defy you"—that same morning the prisoner said to me, "I am sure I shall shoot her, Charlie; I am sure I shall"—I told him not to talk so foolishly—that was about an hour and a half after the dispute over the furniture—about 5 p.m. on the Saturday I told the prisoner two teas were wanted for the officers—he said, "All right; take them in; Mary will get them ready"—my daughter soon after<lb/>wards came and told him they were ready, and he told me to go and get them—I got them and took them into the mess-room—when I left the kitchen the deceased and my daughter were there—I went from the mess-room into the bar—I saw the prisoner sitting on some boxes—a sergeant came in and asked me for some money—I did not leave the bar—I heard the report of a rifle about two or three minutes after I had seen the prisoner sitting on the boxes—I did not hear any voices between the time I went into the bar and the shot—when I heard the shot I was going to get over the counter, when my daughter came in—she said, 'He has shot Mrs. Price"—I went into the kitchen and found Mrs. Price lying there—I went to the door of the dining room and told the officers that Mrs. Price was lying in the kitchen shot—I believe the prisoner was in the dining-room, but I did not see him—shortly after the police came on the scene.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster, of 64, Jervis Road, Plumstead, and am a captain in the Royal West Kent Volunteers—our headquarters are at this Drill Hall at Woolwich—I was there on September 21st—about 6 30 p.m. I heard a shot; I went into the kitchen and saw the prisoner there with a rifle, with smoke coming from it, in his hand—I said, "What have you done, Price?"—he said, "I have shot my wife; she compelled me to do it"—I took the rifle from him, and then went into the bar in consequence of some screaming which I heard there—I went back to the kitchen, and saw Mrs. Price lying on the ground—she died in the course of a few minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was at camp this year—he is a notori<lb/>ously well-behaved man, and much trusted in the regiment—I have known him since February—I do not know how long he has been known in the regiment—I was transferred from one battalion to another last February—I remember when he was attached to the canteen in 1899, but I was only a casual visitor to the mess then—I know why he resigned in Decem<lb/>ber, 1899; it was because of the awkward position he was in with regard to his wife, and because she had run away—I saw him after September 14th—he seemed to me to be labouring under some trouble—when I spoke to him he seemed to have something preying upon him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a major in these Volunteers, and live at Plumstcad—in December, 1898, the prisoner came to the canteen as steward, and his wife as cook—he remained till December, 1899; then he left and returned in February, 1901—his wife made application to come back, and she was allowed to do so on condition she did not go into the bar—on September 7th the prisoner would presumably be served out with 24 cartridges, but being a sergeant, he would take three packets, which would be 30—he fired 24 in the course of a competition on that day—this is the ammunition—the nickel case taken from the body of the deceased is a nickel case stripped from a bullet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner has been a thoroughly honest, trust-worthy, and respectable servant while he has been in the regiment—he was bound to be a confidential servant by virtue of his position—he dis<lb/>covered an intrigue which his wife was carrying on; he followed her and Williams one night; there was a <hi rend="italic">fracas</hi> in the square, and as he was in uniform he felt he had disgraced himself, and he thought he ought to leave—the officers gave him a testimonial when he left—I saw his wife as a servant about the place—I do not know if she was a temperish woman, except what I heard—there were occasions when Williams was in the bar—he is a bandsman in the corps, and was in the habit of using the canteen—on one or two occasions officers have been sent for by the prisoner to make peace between them—I have charge of the prisoner's accounts—I know he was worried over them—while we were in camp he undertook the duty of mess steward, and also the responsibility of running the canteen—he was very anxious about his money, being in open camp, and he found out towards the end of the week's camp he had lost £10—as he usually slept with his money on him, he concluded the money was stolen from him on the only occasion that he slept undressed—I know that was worrying him when he came back—he met his wife at Woolwich in July, but I did not know it till this case came on—I saw him after his</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I arrested you I thought you had been drinking—you did not point out footmarks under the prosecutor's window, and want them corresponded with your boots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in a written defence, said that the prosecutor could not have seen the man who was running away all the time, owing to the turnings, and that, when he saw the prisoner lying in the garden, he thought he was the man he was after; that he (the prisoner) was not concealed at all; that he knew nothing about the affair; that he was only sleeping in the garden; that he was not a minute's walk from his own home, and was lying in the garden because he was overcome with drink.</hi>
