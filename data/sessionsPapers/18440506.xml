I have known the prisoner's wife about three years and a half, and him about two years—they have been married about a year and eleven months—at the time of her death she had a child about nine months old—I used to take care of it for her, and have done so since it was about a fortnight old, while she went to work in the day-time—on Saturday morning, the 30th of March, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner going down Marylebone-street, and spoke to me—he said, "I think she has <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> it "—I asked what he meant—he said, "She has not been to see me this morning," speaking of his wife—I said she was at work—I saw no more of him till about twenty minutes to seven in the evening, when I was cleaning the stairs of my house—his wife was then up stairs in my room—she had come up there to suckle her child—a little girl, named Sarah Simpson, who is under my care, was in the room with her—when I saw the prisoner he was going to pass me on the stairs—I said, "Stop, wait, <hi rend="italic">old chap</hi>, I have wiped two stairs, stop till I have dried them"—he said, "Oh!" and said, "Is my mistress up stairs?"—I said, "Yes"—he stopped while I dried the stairs—I did not notice anything particular in his manner—when I had wiped the two stairs he went past me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184405060020"/>
               <p>and his wife was singing, "Fare thee well, love, I am going;" and as soon as he put his foot into the room, the song ceased—Simpson cried out, "Mother, mother"—I instantly went into the room, and found the prisoner standing with his left arm against my chest of drawers, wiping a razor—the woman was lying dead, with her cheek against the wainscot, bleeding from the neck—I took the prisoner by the shoulder, and asked how dared he ill-treat his wife in that manner—he made no answer—the child I believe was lying under the deceased—I did not see it—it was not crying—the prisoner said, "If one man is not enough, twenty was not too many, you b—r"—he said that, speaking, as I thought, to the corpse, and then went out, down stairs—he walked as fast as he could—the little girl said, "Mother, don't you see the blood?" I ran after him, and called, "Stop him, he has cut his wife's throat"—I stopped him myself in the street—he got part of the way—Davies, my landlord, ran after him—he got three parts of the street—when he saw he was pursued, he turned back to Great Chesterfield-street, where he was living, and I caught hold of him, and said, "Oh, Crouch, how could you do so?"—he never answered me—I left him with Davies—when the policeman brought him up to my room-door again, he shook his head, and said, "Is she dead?"—I said, "Yes, you villain, she is"—he said, "Well, well, I did it, I could not help it"—he was asked what he had done with the razor—he said he had thrown it away—I said, "No, policeman, he has got it, whether it is in his waistcoat pocket, I don't know."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the deceased a very well-conducted, moral, proper person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was, and a woman of unexceptionable character—when the prisoner came to me, and was going up stairs, he seemed to me just as he always was—he did not appear otherwise than in good humour—he seemed to me in very good temper—I was cleaning two steps from my own door where his wife was sitting—the room door was open—if there had been any conversation between them I must have heard it—not a word passed between them—I did not see the infant taken from under the deceased.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 30th of March, I was at the corner of Great Marylebone-street—a boy came to me, and I went into Little Marylebone-street, and at the corner of Great Chesterfield-street I saw the prisoner and a mob standing round him—I took him into custody—I collared him, and he said, "You have no occasion to collar me, I will go with you"—I observed his right hand, up to the knuckles, was dipped in blood—he went with me, and after going a few paces from Little Marylebone-street, he said "Ah well, it serves her right; she had no business to have left"—I then went with him to No. 4, Little Marylebone-street, took him into the room, and saw the deceased lying at full length on the floor, with a great pool of blood on the floor—I called to Mrs. Lynes, to know what be had done with the instrument he bad done the deed with—she said he had got it about him—I then asked him where it was—he said he had thrown it away—I commenced searching him, but not knowing whether the woman was actually dead, I called to somebody to go to the doctor's, and left off searching him, but held both his hands—I searched him at the station, and found a razor in his coat pocket, which I produce—on the road to the station he said, "Ah well, I don't care nothing about it, you may hang me and be d—d"—on going further he said, "Ah, that cursed drink, it is the devil"—I then took him to the station, and on searching him I took off his neckcloth, and discovered a cut in his neck—it was a small cut, what they call a flesh cot—it had bled but very little—there was nothing to be seen outside the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Great Marylebone-street. On Saturday evening, the 30th of March, I was called to No. 4, Little Maryle-bone-street, and saw the body of the deceased Mrs. Crouch lying dead on the floor—I found a wound extending from the angle of the left jaw, dividing the left jugular vein, the left carotid artery the windpipe entirely through to the spine, and the right jugular vein and right carotid artery; it was only the spine which kept the head on; that of course would kill her instantly—the wound might be inflicted by a razor—I saw the prisoner about a quarter of an hour after I had examined the woman—my attention was called to a wound in his neck, which had been sewn up when I saw it—I saw him at the workhouse up to the time of his committal, but did not attend him for that wound; he was under the care of the workhouse surgeon—it was not at all a serious wound, dividing merely the integuments, perfectly superficial; I attached no importance at all to it—the prisoner said nothing to me when I first saw him—he was in a state of stupor—that was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the murder had been committed—that was at the station—I saw him once or twice after, and he expressed great remorse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon of the Third Dragoon Guards. In 1838 I was a pupil of Mr. Luscombe, surgeon of the Devon and Exeter Hospital—on the 17th of Dec, 1838, the prisoner was brought to that hospital—he was at that time in the service of Sir Lawrence Palk—he we perfectly insensible when brought to the hospital—I was told he had been thrown from a horse—the symptoms were those of concussion of the brain—he had an immense swelling over the right temple, from a blow, whether the result of a fall I cannot say, but it was such a blow as would be produced by coming in contact with the wall in falling—I treated him for concussion of the brain—he remained in a state of perfect insensibility till the evening of the 20th—here are my medical notes of the case, made at the time—he first an<lb/>swered a question on the 23rd—that was the first question he was able to answer—he was treated as a person afflicted with severe concussion of the brain, and bled to a considerable degree—I have not the date of his discharge—he remained in the hospital, I think, about four or five weeks—he was under my immediate care at least a month—before he left I saw Sir Lawrence Palk and his brother respecting him—I did not think he was capable to go back to his place, which was that of a groom—that was from no other cause than the injury he had received in the head.</p>

               <p>lead you to imagine such is the fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have only known that one case, which was under my observation a year and a half; but it is my belief it would be so—there are instances on record where men of unsound mind have recovered their senses by concussion—where one man who is mad might become sane, twenty, in different circumstances, might become insane—after the prisoner left the hospital, he was, by my advice to Sir Laurence Palk, taken to a cottage at Kenton—I did not see him after he left the hos<lb/>pital—the opinion I formed of his case, and expressed at the time he left, was, that the great probability was he would not be a useful or good servant, that he would become "a mazed man," as they call it in Devonshire; which means that his intellect would be unsound—the expression means a man cracked or crazed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You meant be would not be able to follow the calling he previously occupied, attending the horses might tend to excite him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I thought he was not to be trusted to drive and ride valuable horses—I did not consider him entirely unfit for the duties of life—he was fit to strap a horse, but I would not trust him to ride a valuable pair of horses—I had done all I could for him as a surgeon, and he was discharged from the hospital—it depends on circumstances what kind of madness concussion would produce—if combined with heat, as I have mostly seen it, he might take a sword and run a man through, <hi rend="italic">run a muck</hi>, as it is called—in India it is generally so—I have not seen it in this country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it likely a person having such a concussion of the brain as you de<lb/>scribe the prisoner to have had, having taken liquor calculated to excite his brain? is it probable such a person would be calm and orderly in his demea<lb/>nour, so as not to excite the attention of anybody who saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell you in this country, but, I should say, in India be would be violent—I have not seen madness arising from concussion of the brain—I have seen that man incapable of doing his duty—in my opinion, a person having re<lb/>ceived concussion of the brain, and taking alcohol, would, generally speak<lb/>ing, exhibit an extraordinary degree of excitement and irritability.</p>

Palk, and placed in a farm-house under my care—when I saw him he appeared to be labouring under concussion of the brain—the symptoms were clearly those of concussion—when first under my charge he was in a state of great weakness of mind, almost amounting to fatuity when 1 first saw him—the state of the brain was very greatly im<lb/>paired—he remained at Kenton five weeks I think—the last memorandum I have of seeing him at Kenton was the 10th of March—I considered it my duty to see him daily—my opinion at the time was that his mind would be affected probably for a considerable period, probably for life—I have known instances of concussions of this nature which have resulted in derangement, both violent and quiet, you can hardly call it morbid—I should not be sur<lb/>prised to hear of a man having laboured under such an affection very sud<lb/>denly committing a violent act without a motive, and hearing that, I should attribute it to injury of the mind, arising from the concussion he had received—I should not be surprised at his suddenly committing a violent act—I knew an instance about twelve years ago of a servant having met with con<lb/>cussion of the brain from a blow, the kick of a horse—without fracture, his brain suffered severely from concussion, he was kept a long period in a quiet state, watched by his friends, and appeared to recover; he was well</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184405060025"/>
               <p>for seven or eight months, and suddenly being by a cider-press drank con<lb/>siderably of cider, and became suddenly excited—he drew out part of a plough and attempted to murder his master with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in a great state of intoxication? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—I was sent for, and only saw him in a state of great excitement—I knew no<lb/>thing of the circumstance of provocation on the part of the master—I was not present—I knew nothing of the circumstances—I suppose it very likely for a person of that sort to be soon excited by liquor, or any exciting cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In proportion as the concussion was more or less severe, would the duration of the liability to that sort of derangement continue a longer period? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I believe a slight concussion might so disable the brain as to produce a long confinement, and a violent concussion a short—I should not be surprised to find such a case taking place after five or six years—I should not consider the length of time the patient was in a quiescent state, if I heard of a violent act under excitement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is concussion of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the consequence of a blow to produce pressure on the brain from a ruptured blood vessel, or from coagulation and stagnation of blood, and disturbing or taking away the functions of the brain, producing in some cases paralysis—it does not always produce death—the brain may remain in a diseased state for life—it would most probably cause an irregular circulation of blood in the vessels of the brain, and in some instances a change of structure in the organs of the brain itself—I had a case of recovery after six years—the son of a surgeon in the navy, at the end of three years, having been kept quiet, was permitted to be rated again—he was sent to a warm climate, but he was obliged to be sent home, but at the end of six years became serviceable again, and was sent out.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had not seen the prisoner since March 1839? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Within a very short period of that—he went to London after going back to Sir L. Palk—he was fit to leave my care certainly, but was far from recovered—not in a state to be trusted with any occupation at the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does taking a quantity of liquor or ardent spirits by a person having had concussion of the brain produce violent or quiet madness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It en<lb/>tirely depends on the constitution of the party—in one it might produce vio<lb/>lent madness, and in the other merely unsoundness—I believe, from what I know of the prisoner, it would excite the brain in that way so as to produce a kind of depression, not render him furious or fierce—from what I recollect of his habit of body, I believe it would have a very different effect to that of a person of a more excitable habit—I do not think it would produce violent symptoms so as to call the attention of an ordinary observer—when he left my care, I did not advise that he should be restrained or confined in any way—I wrote to Sir Lawrence, saying he was not to be trusted, and the sooner he got rid of him the better—I did not consider him incapacitated from per<lb/>forming the ordinary duties of life—I thought he was by degrees getting into a state to enable him to do his duty.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You thought it not improbable there might be a recurrence of that derangement of mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was quite probable, and it would show itself in a degree of moroseness rather than violence—I directed Mrs. Ford that he should not have any drink—I thought that likely to pro<lb/>duce excitement and increase his complaint.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1839, my husband kept a public-house at Kenton.

               <p>with it cheerfully—I had seen him before, at Sir Lawrence Palk's—after his illness he frequented my house, not as a customer, but as a friend—seeing the state in which he was, I permitted him to come to my house when he pleased, in the hope of amusing him—he appeared quite to avoid society—he was quite dejected and low—he dined at my house at one time—he then wore a white cap—he got up in the middle of dinner, left the table, and went away for more than an hour—I have known him sit sometimes for hours without speaking—I considered, from my observation of him, that he was not right in his mind—I treated him as such—I received some directions about him from Mr. Collins, in consequence of which I did not permit him to have drink—I think he staid at Kenton about seven weeks—during that time my observation of his lowness of spirits, and dejection, and avoiding society, was always the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Upper Hyde Park-street, Paddington. The prisoner was my housemaid—I have missed the articles stated—these blankets, carpet, book, and other things produced are all mine—I can speak positively to them—I have the fellow-volume to this book at home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. I became acquainted with the prisoner at the latter end of Dec, 1842—I was at that time writing for the un<lb/>stamped weekly press—or rather preparing, articles for the press—they were not original—I employed the prisoner to copy for me, and he continued so employed till the 16th of March, 1843—he had not been in my employ more than a fortnight, when he made advances towards me—he was a man in a very degraded position of life; and I rather repulsed them—he induced me to visit Mr. and Mrs. Wheatcroft—they told me a great deal about Mr. Goore, and from their representations, I was induced to say that if I could feel con<lb/>vinced in my own mind that his wife was dead, I might perhaps meet his advances—Mrs. Wheatcroft had told me that he had been married—he said himself, when he came to me, that his wife was dead, that he had ascertained that for a fact—he referred me to the Wheatcrofts as persons who could give me some account of him—I did not require him further in my employ, and as he said he was only disabled from serving himself through the badness of his dress, it was said if I could advance him money he would be able to estab<lb/>lish himself in some ostensible employment—I advanced him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for that purpose—I considered it still necessary that further inquiries should be made respecting his wife; and Mrs. Wheatcroft's father was employed to write a letter to some person who they thought capable of satisfying me—the prisoner afterwards told me, as the result of the inquiry, that his wife was not dead, but she was in a very bad state of health—I should say that was about the middle of June—I was very indignant towards him for the deception he had practised on me, and instructed Mrs. Bate, the landlady, to shut the door against him—he was not present when I told her that—he used to be there requently—he wandered the streets for ten days and nights after that—he told me so—I saw him again about a fortnight after ordering him to be re<lb/>fused admittance, but he called once on me, and very frequently came in front of the house, and excited alarm among the neighbours against me—the next time I saw him was when he was relieved from the workhouse, where he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184405060036"/>
               <p>been deposited—that was twelve or fourteen days after directing him to be denied—he again prayed admission to the house, and said he was very sorry for his conduct—I told him that was quite impossible, that I could not admit him after the way he had acted, and if I felt disposed to do so, Mrs. Bate would not—he wrote to Mrs. Bate—she said, in my presence, that she was very sorry for what had passed, and she had no doubt he felt he had acted wrong, but he would do better for the future, and under the circumstances she could not refuse him coming as usual—I did not agree to that, but I submitted to it—that must have been on the 12th or 14th of Feb., 1843, I should say—he then came to the house again, and followed his employment the same as before—he still had the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he boarded at my table, but having followed up his annoyances in front of my house, and excited the curiosity of the neighbours, anonymous letters were sent to the publishers, and I received an intimation that my engagement would cease—I lost my engagement to the press—I consider he had something to do with it—I did not learn that from him, but from other parties—I should have taxed him with it, but he was so harsh a man, I was fearful of doing so—about that time he wanted me to marry him—I told him I could not do so, in fact, I should not, because I was not then convinced that his wife was dead—he said he would ascertain as soon as he possibly could, but he could not do it quickly, he did not know where she was—I told him I wished him to leave my employment, his annoyances were quite disagreeable, it was necessary he should seek employment with a different person, especially as my employ<lb/>ments were likely to cease—he said he would not do so, he had been so as<lb/>sisted by me, it was impossible he could make a return, and if I could not marry him, I ought to come to a determination to do so as soon as I was con<lb/>vinced his wife was dead—he enforced it on me, and I said I would do so as soon as his wife was dead—he said he should go to Mr. King, of Red Lion<lb/>square, to ask him to draw up an agreement, as he did not think there was sufficient authority in anything I might draw—the agreement was that I would marry him as soon as I was convinced his wife was dead—this is the paper—it is Mr. King's writing—this is not the agreement I am alluding to—on his return he brought me a letter relating to the law of divorce—I have destroyed that letter—we lived together as man and wife—allow me to ex<lb/>plain—he told me Mr. King's advice was that we should enter into a closer contract, for the law of divorce was so much out of the reach of the poor man, that the legislature had recently framed a new law in favour of persons situated as he was—that he had not seen his wife for five years, and it ap<lb/>peared from his statement that she was a very bad woman—I said I was very unwilling to believe it, it was something very novel to me, but I certainly should like to make myself acquainted with the fact, and I had no objection to visit Mr. King—I went with the prisoner to Mr. King, who was an at<lb/>torney, at No. 17, Red Lion-square, but is now in the Queen's Bench prison, and he recapitulated in a very plausible manner all the prisoner had said about the new law—I had a very great objection to the prisoner, because he was very hateful and detestable to me, from his principles and habits, and every obstacle I could throw in the way, I did—he saw that, and was very severe on me indeed—he said that my conduct showed that I had an inten<lb/>tion to <hi rend="italic">jilt</hi> him, for he had brought me to a respectable man who was giving him legal advice, and upon that authority I ought to act.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in this house. I know the prisoner by his coming to work for me about three days, six or eight months ago, as a silk weaver—he did not do the work to my satisfaction—I said if he did not do it better I should be under the necessity of turning him off—next day, when I came home, I found he had left—I did not discharge him—he came a day or two after to settle with me—I said I could not settle with him till the work was finished, as it was satin—I could not drive it off—he seemed satisfied—he came in about three weeks when it was finished, and I settled with him—he came again four or five weeks after that with my son, and sat down for half an hour, then bid me good night and went home—nothing passed between us about wages—when I settled with him he thought he was entitled to more, which I gave him—he then seemed satisfied—I did not see him again till he was apprehended.</p>

I was at the Horse and Groom, on the 12th of April—the prisoners were there—I knew them all before—the prosecutor came in while I was there, and joined the prisoners—they all drank out of one pot, him and the three prisoners—I drank with them and several others—I am certain of it—we all sat round one table, and continued drinking together from two till about four o'clock—money was getting short, I conclude, for they were getting short of beer, and the prosecutor pulled off one of his boots, threw it on the table, and said if they could get an old pair of shoes he would put them on, and pawn his boots, that they cost 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Grady went out and brought in an old pair of shoes—Summers tried them on, and said they would not fit, and said, "I am too <hi rend="italic">wide awake</hi> for you, lads, as I have been an old <hi rend="italic">lagger</hi> (which means, I believe, a re<lb/>turned transport; I knew that at the time he said so)—he said, "I get my living by attending fairs and races; I carry the tables with the thimbles, and work them"—he said if there was any person in the room who would get him three thimbles, he would bet a pot of beer no man would find the pea—(some time previous to that he said he had no money about him)—Shehan went out and brought in three thimbles, and the prosecutor said he would bet any man in the room no man could find the pea after he had worked the thimble—Lawley said if any one would back him for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or a pot of beer, he would find the pea—a man in the room said he would bet Lawley, and did so—Summers pulled out 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the thimbles were shifted, and Lawley found it, and won the beer—Summers gave him the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get the beer—Lawley came back with 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and gave it him—shortly after I went out of the room—I was by the watering-place, and heard a person in the room, hallooing "Murder"—I went in and saw the prosecutor and Lawley en-tangled with one another—he was holding Lawley by the neck handkerchief, Lawley was trying to extricate himself from him—I had been out of the room ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—Rogers came down stairs and asked what was the matter—I believe Summers's boots were off then—he said he would not let Lawley go—he pointed to Grady, and said he had put his</p>

On Friday, the 22nd of March, a little after one o'clock, I was passing through Palmer—street—I saw a crowd, and went into this house, and into the room on the ground floor—I there saw a female infant—I found it covered with the soil of the privy—there was some on the face, about the mouth, and more particularly about the body—the umbilical cord was torn about three inches from the belly—that would not have been the case if there had been proper medical attendance when it was born—I ordered it to be put into a warm bath—I was then called away to the prisoner—I found her sitting in a chair behind the door, with a good deal of blood on the floor—I ordered her to be placed upon the bed, and removed the after burden; therefore I can speak with cer<lb/>tainty as to her having been recently delivered—she was then so very weak and low that I was obliged to administer brandy and water to her—the child was brought up to me there—it then appeared in the act of dying—it was crying—Mr. Ross, another surgeon, then came into the room, and attended to the child in my presence—means were taken, as far as possible, to preserve it—it died, I should say, a quarter of an hour or twenty</p>

               <p>minutes after it was brought up to me into the room—it was a full-grown child—from the evidence I heard before the Coroner, and from observations I have made, I should infer the birth had taken place in the privy, from not having seen any blood between the bed—room and the yard—if it had been born in the bedroom, and she had walked away with it to the privy, I think there would have been a track of blood—I should have expected that, and, in all probability, something would have been found in which the child had been carried from the room to the privy—I examined the child all over—I saw no violence about it—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—on opening the brain, I found the vessels distended with blood; also, the substance of the brain itself—the stomach contained about half a wine-glass full of the soil of the privy—the heart and the large vessels were more than usually distended with blood—those were all the appearances I observed—I have heard the evidence to-day, and from that, and from my observation of the body, I am of opinion that death was caused by immersion in the soil: I think so, I cannot positively say.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 28th of March last I kept the Robert's Arms, Devonport-street, Commercial-road. I went to Gravesend on that day—I left a desk in my dining-room first floor—it contained eight sovereigns, about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, some silver spoons, a gold chain, and some articles of jewellery belonging to Mrs. M'Beath—I returned on the 29th, and found that the desk had been removed into the bar parlour in my absence—I took it up stairs again where it had been before—on the Monday morning I opened it, and put in it two sovereigns and a silver snuff-box—on Tuesday, at four o'clock, I went to put in three more sovereigns, and the desk was gone—I called my wife and niece, and asked if they had removed it—I then spoke to the pri<lb/>soner, who was my potman, saying my desk was gone, and asked if he knew anything of it—he said, "No"—I gave him into custody—he was remanded, and kept in custody for a fortnight, and there being no further evidence he was then discharged—ray family consisted of myself, my wife, my niece, and the prisoner—we had no female servant—some time after I heard of the pri<lb/>soner being taken up—I had then let the house to a Mrs. Harris and removed.</p>

               <p>Bart., and reside at River-hill, Kent. In the latter end of 1842 I was in London—the female prisoner was introduced to me in October that year—she was desirous of becoming a companion to me—no arrangement of that sort was come to—I invited her to stay at my house, and she came—she remained with me from about the 10th of Oct. to the 21st of Nov., or thereabouts, as an inmate—after that she was in the habit of coming to my house as long as I remained in town—I understood from her that she was in very distressed cir<lb/>cumstances, and she applied to me to lend her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for an advertisement just before she left—during the time she was with me she had many times the oppor<lb/>tunity of noticing my handwriting—I have heard her say that she could imi<lb/>tate any person's handwriting—whilst she was with me I had a banking account at Smith, Payne, and Smith's, of London—she had an opportunity of knowing that—I cannot swear that she did know it, but I have no doubt she did—at this moment I cannot call my recollection with any certainty about it—I was in the habit of drawing checks on that house while she was with me—she generally sat in the same room that I did—I was in the habit of writing my checks upon engraved bank checks—that was not always the case; I have written upon plain paper, and signed it, but that was not "Pay the bearer"—the check produced is not my handwriting, nor was it written by my authority—it is very much like my signature—I have never had any communication with or from the female prisoner since Dec., 1842.</p>

I am assistant to Frederick Ingoldby, he lives in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—the surgery adjoins the house, and is part of his dweling-house—I left at half-past ten o'clock on Friday night, the 26th of April—it was safe then—the window was down, and the glass was not broken—at a quarter to three I was awoke by the policeman—I went down, and saw the surgery door open, the front-door open, and the window put up—there were a pair of my master's scissors near the bell—they had been re<lb/>moved.</p>

On Sunday, the 21st of April, I was in my room on the second floor front—I noticed the three prisoners on the other side, about thirty yards from Mr. Mullins's shop—I saw some money in Morton's hand—they were standing looking at it—the other two prisoners were stand<lb/>ing close to him—they all seemed to be looking at it—they then moved on from where they stood, and when they got about six yards, Morton stooped down and chinked what I think was a half-crown on the pavement—it was a large piece, white like silver—they then went on a few yards further, and then they made a stop together—Morton came away from the other two, and came back towards where I saw them at first—he stooped down and took up some dirt on one of his long fingers, then went back to the other two, and seemed to be in the act of rubbing it on something in his hand—the others were looking on at the time—they went on two or three yards, then came back to the part where they were looking at the money, opposite Mr. Mul<lb/>lins's shop—Ellis then left them, crossed the road, and went on the same side as Mr. Mullins's shop, only more to the left—Morton went over to look between the shutters of Mullins's shop—Fox went across into Mullins's shop—Ellis was standing about five or six yards above—she could not see what was doing inside the shop—after Fox had been a minute in the shop, Morton turned round and nodded to Ellis—Fox then came out and went towards Ellis; he passed by Morton, took no notice of him, but joined Ellis, and they both went on—Morton came away from the shutters, and when Fox got up to Ellis, he went up to them—he went on in the same direction—I gave infor<lb/>mation to Birch—I saw the prisoners about a quarter of an hour after in custody—I am sure they are the persons.</p>

My warehouse is in Wood-st., and I have a factory at Coventry—I had, shortly before this, remov<lb/>ed from another warehouse—Jacobs had been recommended by Feltham, who was my servant, to assist in moving—in consequence of something that passed on that occasion, I gave directions to Feltham never to have the slightest communication with that fellow—he said he certainly should not; and about six weeks prior to this time I said, "I hope you have no communication with that fellow"—he said, "I have not"—Feltham had been in my employ from ten to eleven years—Shaw called on me on the morning of the 12th, and gave me information, in consequence of which, on Feltham's coming in I gave him into custody of Shaw—these three pieces of satin ribbon in the paper are dressed, but not blocked—they are sent up from the factory undressed, and they are not in a condition to be sold—Feltham knew that—it may happen</p>

On the 17th of April there was a cry of "Stop thief"—I was passing down the East India-road, and a young man passed me very quickly—I cannot say whether it was the prisoner—I saw him throw the handkerchiefs from his hand over a fence.</p>

On Wednesday morning, the 17th of April, was in the East India-road between ten and eleven o'clock—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoner running—he took some pocket-handkerchiefs from his bosom, threw them over the palings, and they lodged on a lilac tree—I saw Mr. Green take them from the tree.</p>

About a quarter before seven o'clock I was taking down my shutters, and saw the two prisoners come up to Marshall's shop—King took the carpet bag, and gave it to Thomas—they both walked away—I went and took Thomas—King went away, and turned down James-street—he was taken up at the office about half-past twelve o'clock—I am sure he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fifteen years old—I live in Queen street, Hoxton. On the 30th of April I was at No. 1, Hoxton, next door to Mrs. Tillett's, and was walking with her two little children—her husband's name is Richard—I had the little child in my arms, and Charlotte, who is two years old, was walking—Lynch came up, took her bobbin away from her, and tied a little bit of string to it—I told him to leave it alone, and then he snatched the beads off her neck—Brown was standing next door, and holding his head down, that I should not see his face—he did not do anything, but ran away with Lynch, and he was with Lynch when they first came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Benjamin Edwards, a jeweller, in Shoreditch. On the afternoon of the 16th of April I was in my master's shop—the prisoner came to ask for some wedding rings—I took the glass case out of the window, and put five or six rings on the counter—he looked at them, and tried them—some were too large, and some too small—he then put his hand into the glass case, and said some of those would suit him better—he took out three, tried them, and then made an attempt to put them down, but he only put down one of the three—I saw the other two pass quickly into his left hand—he then tossed up a sovereign in his hand, and pointed to a ring on the counter, and said, "What is the price of that one?"—I took the rings off the counter, and put the glass case on a work-box—he was going to the door, and I taxed him with having two rings in his left hand—he stood for a minute, and said, "So I have one;" and when he was taking that, I saw part of the other one—I tried to lay hold of him, but he drew back, and ran out—I jumped over the counter, and ran after him—I called, "Stop thief," and so did he—I ran 600 yards, and caught him—I then saw the other ring in his mouth—I took him back 200 or 300 yards towards the shop, he asked me to let him walk quietly by my side—I objected to that, and took him back to the shop, and taxed him with the ring being in his mouth—it was a minute or a minute and a half before we attempted to take it from him, but could not—I should say he swallowed it—he then had a sovereign in his hand, which he tried to get into his mouth, to make it appear that it was that he had—when I would not let him put the sovereign into his mouth, he said, "Did you know I wanted to pay you for the ring?"</p>

I was in the parlour at the back of the shop when the prisoner came in—the parlour door was open—I heard him ask for some wedding rings—Bradbury showed him some—I heard him charge the prisoner with taking two wedding rings, and having them in his left hand—he said, "Oh, have I? I do not know"—he said, "So I have one," and threw one down on the counter—Bradbury said, "You have another"—he said, "No, I have not"—Bradbury tried to pull him—he ran fast out of the shop, and Bradbury after him—I watched him outside the door—I heard Bradbury cry, "Stop thief," and the prisoner cried as well—when our rings were shown to him there were seventy, and when he left there were only sixty-eight—I counted them myself, and know the stock well—when he left he put back one ring on the counter—I took it up, and put a mark of my own on it—my father's marks were on it before.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Brick-lane, Old-street. I am occasionally in the employ of Mr. Garner, a broker and auctioneer—I was put in possession of the house, No. 21, Old-street—I have the warrant here—I went in posses<lb/>sion on the 6th of April—there are six rooms in the house—Pettigrew was not there on the 6th of April, nor on the 7th, but she came and slept there on the 8th, and till the 15th, in the back parlour down stairs—Joblyns and her daughter came to see Pettigrew in the day-time—on the 16th of April, Joblyns came there—she and Pettigrew, who is her mother, went out about twelve—they said they were going to Doctors' Commons, and Joblyns grumbled because Pettigrew was not ready—they left Joblyns daughter in the house—she remained in the shop, and so did I till Joblyns and Pettigrew came back between two and three—they had some bread and cheese, and a pint of beer in the shop—(the granddaughter went away, leaving them in the shop)—Pettigrew then went up stairs alone, and remained there for about an hour—Joblyns was down stairs in the shop—Joblyns and Pettigrew went out a second time, between four and five, saying they were going to their friend, Mr. Sharp's, to tea—Joblyns returned about eight or a little after—she sat down and conversed a little time in the shop—she then said, I wonder what mother has been up stairs for, she has not been up stairs for months; if you will allow me the candle, I will go and see"—I said certainly she might take it—she took the candle off the table and went up stairs with it—she was not away, to my recollection, more than five minutes—she brought down the candle with her, and put it on the table—she said the old lady bad been up stairs doing something to the bed—she stated that the old lady was taken violently ill where they went round to tea, that she was obliged to have a doctor and a physician, and put her feet into warm water—Joblyns went away, and said if her son should call, she should not be long before she was back—I said it was a very great pity that the old lady was taken so ill, and I sup<lb/>posed she would not be able to be left alone—she said she supposed she should have to be up with her all night—I said, "Very well, I will take care of everything the same as if you were here; you know I can't leave the pos<lb/>session <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the house; you will find the shop open, and everything right when you come in the morning"—she left, and came back about half-past nine, or rather better, and asked if her son had been—I generally go to bed about ten, but that night I did not go to bed before eleven, as she told me the old lady might take it into her head to return, as old people were so curious in their way, I had better wait half-an-hour longer—she did not go up stairs then, but left the house a little before ten, and did not return any more that night—I stood at the door till about eleven—I then bolted the door, and</p>

O dear me! what shall I do; my mother is so ill I cannot leave the house"—I said, "You must go with me"—she said, "What damage is done? is the house burnt down?"—I said, "You must go with me and see"—she said, "Is the man hurt?"

What a sad thing it is, for we are not insured," or something to that effect—Sergeant Dubois then came up—I had seen some goods removed for No.21, Old-street, about ten or eleven days before—there was a cart at the door, and Joblyns and a man were helping to put the goods into the cart.</p>

                  </hi>, jun. I am a Saffron Waldon carrier. On the 3rd of May, about four o'clock, I was going to Layton with my caravan—I had ten firkins of butter—I heard a noise at the hind part of the van—I looked back, and saw Honnor taking a firkin of butter out of the hind part of the van—I jumped off the fore part of the van, and made my way to him—the other two prisoners had got hold of a truck—Honnor put the firkin of butter into it, and the other two began drawing it away—Honnor was behind pushing the truck along—I followed them—they drew the truck a little way, not far from the van, and on my going after them they all three ran away, leaving the butter and truck—I gave an alarm, and they were taken in about a quarter of an hour, or I think less than that.</p>

On Saturday night, the 20th of April, before I went to bed, I went over the house—the door was latched with a common latch, but I am sure it was fastened; also the windows, with two latches and a bolt—I went to bed about twelve o'clock—I was the last person up—when I had been in bed some time I was awoke by a noise—I could not tell the time—I laid awake some time, and fell asleep again—about three o'clock in the morning the policeman came—I got up, and found the place very much in disorder—the lower rooms were all dirty and filthy—I missed the articles stated—the two books and a shawl had been on the dining-table, and the jug and teapot on another table in the same room.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">linendraper, Princes-street, Leicester-square.</hi> The prisoner was in my service for about twelve or thirteen days—he came on the 26th of Feb., and, I think, continued with me till the 12th of March—in consequence of a person calling on me after he left, and making inquiry about a carpet-bag, and in consequence of suspicions I entertained from those in<lb/>quiries, I caused a carpet-bag of the prisoner's to be opened—I have the key with which I opened it—in the pocket of the bag I found a pocket-book, in which was a duplicate referring to a scarf—I went to the pawnbroker's and examined that scarf, and it was mine—I never gave the prisoner permission to take it or sell it, or knew of his having it—it is worth about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think the person called about the bag on the 11th or 12th of April—this is the scarf—I know it by this rent from the bottom upwards, which I believe to have been done in the manufacture, and mended by the manufacturer—before I examined the carpet-bag I went to Mr. Hardwick, of Marlborough-street Police-office, and asked his advice on the subject—it was in accord<lb/>ance with his directions that I did what I did.</p>

On the 26th of April I received information, and went to apprehend the prisoner at Red-hill, Water<lb/>enbury—I told her what I wanted her for—she said it was the first time she was ever accused of a robbery, but she knew nothing of either the gold watch or the sovereigns—I had not then found the watch or anything—I had men<lb/>tioned it—I received the watch from Moseley some hours alter taking her into custody—he came to the house, and found me with her in custody, and brought the watch to me with other property—I searched her box, and found some clothing, sheeting, table-cloths, and linen, all new, and these six sovereigns—as I was taking her to the lock-up place, she told me that was the first robbery she ever did commit, and she hoped it would be the last—the Leopard is in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth.</p>
