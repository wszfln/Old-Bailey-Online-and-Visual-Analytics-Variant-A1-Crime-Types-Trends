For the purpose of selling the tickets I left some at Olliver's, in Bond Street, some at Lacon and Ollier's, Austin's at St. James's Hall, Bubb's Library, in Bond Street, and Hayes's at the Royal Exchange—all those Different offices undertook to sell these tickets—I gave instructions to each office not to sell them to ladies, if a gentleman wanted a ticket for a lady he could let him have them, as the gentleman would be guarantee to the lady's respectability—I have an office in Regent Street—I left tickets there for sale with the housekeeper—she was not to sell tickets to ladies—I took precauytions to prevent improper characters coming to the ball—hearing that some questionable characters might attempt to get in I engaged a pensioned superintendent of police named Limeburn, who was stationed at the door, and who was four years manager of the auditorium at the Alhambra, and</p>

H. Hodson—I took the name of Stanley for family reasons—my relations objected to my being in the profession at all—I was formerly a solicitor's clerk—at one time I was a comic singer—I sang comic songs—my name was then Harry Don—my first venture in organising theatrical parties was at the Theatre Royal, Colchester—I was lessee of it—I engaged Charles Mathews, a very unfortunate speculation for me—I lost a great deal of money—it was fortunate for Mr. Mathews—he always got his money; he always took good care to have it—I organised a concert to be given at Tunbridge Wells and Sittingbourne last December twelve months—Madame Brooke, Mr. Cheshire, the harpist, Mrs. Cheshire, and Mr. Sidney were among the troupe—I was the manager—I engaged them at a salary—I took the money at the door—I always do when I embark in any undertaking—I had a handbag with me—the members of the Company very unreasonably requested me to give them some money before they would go on the stage—the thing did not collapse in consequence of any refusal to give them anything—they took it in their own hands—I did not before that bolt to the reilway station; it was after that that they took it into their own hands—I was followed to the railway station by the indignant husband of one of the ladies—I was not found behind the door of one of the out-houses at the station—I was waiting for the train on the platform, not behind the door—the gentleman gave me into custody as he alleged for swindling him and his wife—I was not taken to the police-station—the officer refused to take me, and I went off by the train in question—at that time I was a member of the Junior Garrick Club—that is a club that is supposed to have some representatives of the dramatic profession among its members—after the incident at Tunbridge Wells I was expelled from the club—one of the members of the company I took down was a member of the club, and he brought it before the committee—I can explain the whole of the occurrence—I gave instructions to the booksellers not to sell tickets to ladies, and I myself did not sell tickets to ladies—I supposed that the ladies to whom I had sent invites would attend, that was the only thing I intended—I expected that a few of the gentlemen would bring ladies, their wives or their sweethearts—I decidedly thought that probable—I thought that the members of the Naval and Military Club would bring their wives or sweethearts with them; ladies in their own condition</p>

               <p>I did not know and did not ask; I was taken by their appearance as likely to be attractive features at the dramatic ball; there is generally a dearth of ladies at balls—there was a large sale of tickets in that case just as there was in Cannon Strect—Mr. Best did not, in consequence of the number of ladies of that class that were let in the room, refuse to allow any more to come in; he closed the doors, but he did not give that as a reason; he gave me no reason—I had agreed to pay ten guineas—I refused to pay when he closed the doors—I asked him what the meaning of it was, but he gave me no reason, and afterwards when I went to settle with him I asked him to justify his conduct, and he said "I don't choose to justify my conduct in the least"—I heard from friends of mine that he said he did not like the people that were coming in, that they were prostitutes; they were ladies that I had met there before—I sold tickets for that ball at Evans's and also for the Assembly ball in Vauxhall Bridge Road, not always to gentlemen on those occasions—I sold to ladies at Evans's, and to gentlemen; I did not sell them, the head waiter did; I supplied them, and gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ticket—I did not give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to any one who sold one, only to the head waiter—I can mention names of other gentlemen besides Mr. Villiers who were at this ball; Mr. Charles Tritton, who holds a very good position at the Criterion Theatre as an actor; Mr. Goldsworthy, a member of Mr. Wyndham's Pink Dominoes Company; Mr. Charles Harris, stage manager of Covent Garden and the Adelphi—I don't know whether he is here; I subpœnaed him on the last occasion—Mr. Arthur Roberts, one of the principal comic vocalists; he is playing the principal part in the pantomime at Brighton; there were no very great stars there; I cannot mention other names that you would recognise—I engaged the room of Mr. Rand; he is the manager there—I heard that he was advised that the ball was likely to be of a questionable character; that it was going to be attended by people of the class alluded to—I might have told him that Messrs. Mitchell were selling tickets for me; at that time they had not refused to sell them; I swear that—I said I had sent invites to Messrs. James and Thorne, "Our Boys," and no doubt they would attend—I said I expected they would attend—I had no reason for saying so except that I had sent them tickets—Mr. Rand did not after that object to let me the use of the ball-room—he referred me to the solicitor of the company, Mr. Mortimer—I told him I had sent Mr. Hollingshead, of the Gaiety, a ticket—I did not say he would be at the ball; I could not vouch that he would—I said I expected he would—I had no reason to say so except that I had sent him a ticket—he kept the ticket, therefore I made sure that he would come—he subsequently returned it—I have said there were about 100 ladies present; that is a guess; there might have been more or there might have been less—I had nothing to do with the fancy dresses—people came in what dresses they chose—one was a naval officer that "Cannon Ball" so animadverted on—it was a very correct dress—there were costumes, but I really cannot describe them—there were two ladies as sailors—there were two romps, I believe; I mean with skipping-ropes and short frocks; you always see them at a fancy ball—there were people in fancy costumes, but I was too much taken up in seeing that everything was going on properly to notice the dresses—one of the hotel officials was cash-taker at the door—I don't know his name or whether he is here; he was not here last Session—Mr. Rand placed him there—the great majority of the women there were certainly not of the class you have been talking</p>

Thorne and James and other—the first entertainment I gave was with Charles Mathews, at the Theatre Royal, Colchester—it was a failure—then about the Tunbridge affair: Mr. Sydney, of the Junior Garrick Club, asked me if I could take himself, Mr. John Cheshire, and Madame Brooke out at Christmas—I wrote to Tun<lb/>bridge Wells, and advertised a concert for Boxing Day, but could not engage a room, and the librarian advised me not to come—in consequence of that we went the next day to Sittingbourne, and when the concert was about to commence Madame Brooke's husband and Mr. Sydney came to me and said "We want out money"—I said "It is a very bad house, there is not the money in"—I told him I would give it him to-morrow at the club, being a fellow-member, and he said "Oh, dear, no; we are not going to do that sort of thing"—then I said "I will return the money to the audience," upon which Mr. Brooke said "We will take the money if you will hand over what is in the house and let us take what comes in, and we will go on with the performance"—I acquiesced, and having no further duties I went to the station—Mr. Brooke came after me and said "You are not going away like that; we want some more money"—I said "You cannot have it; Mr. Sydney shall have it to-morrow"—upon that they called a constable, and he refused to take me in custody, and I went away in the train—Mr. Sydney sent to the secretary of the club, and I attended—the committee said "If you choose to pay the money no further notice will be taken"—I</p>

I certainly should not take it if I were you"—he gave no reason—I did not take the chair—I told Mr. Stanley it would be unadvisable for any public man to take the chair, because it would only entail a lot of speechifying, which was not necessary at a public ball; and I don't know whether it was taken, I did not observe—at any rate nobody spoke as chairman—I remained after the supper, but did not notice anything unusual—I have attended many balls, and I may say that the impression I formed was that it was most orderly and respectable as far as a public ball would go—I did not notice any painted harlots, but I certainly noticed seven or eight or what we politely call the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde</hi>, but I see them in all assemblies that I go to; there was nothing in their demeanour or manner that was insulting or offensive—the whole thing was thoroughly well conducted.</p>

I saw Guanneri on the same night I saw Christof—he was suffering from a small punctured wound beneath the right eye, leading to a great deal of haemorrihage from the nose, and the bones of the nose were injured—the wound may have been caused by some sharp instrument, or by the man falling upon something sharp in the road.</p>

I had seen the prisoner previously at the General Post-office in June—on the first occasion he pleaded very hard that The decision by which he was dismissed might be reconsidered and altered—he began to speak of all he said he had suffered from the Post-office officials at sheerness—I don't remember that he named any particular individual, but he spoke against those who had been in authority there, the late postmaster and the then acting postmaster—Mr. Hartigan was then acting postmaster—I told him that any reconsideration of his case was quite leading into a vestibule, and in this vestibule there is a glass care in which the hall porter sits; on the right is a side door which leads into a small office—it would be very dangerous to fire a bullet in there—Mr. Hartigan was not at the General Post-office at that time, nor yet at sheerness; I don't of my own knowledge know where he was—he had returned from sheerness to the General Post-office before December—he was clerk in charge at the General Post-office.</p>

I am one of the officers called clerks In charge at the General Post-office—in October, 1878, I went down to Sheerness to fill a vacancy and take charge of the Post-office there—the Prisoner was a letter-carrier in that district—it was in my discretion to arrange the walks of the letter-carriers, and to apportion their duties—in the exercise of that discretion I shifted the walks; I altered all the walks, that they might be more thoroughly conversant with each other's duties—that was the only alteration I made in the prisoner's duties—I think that altera<lb/>tion</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was a report for insubordinate couduct, &amp;c.</hi>) In consequence of a communication which I afterwards received from Mr. Perrin the prisoner was dismissed—the dismissals in such cases are made on the order of the postmaster-General; his decision is communicated to The surveyor, by the surveyor to me, and by me to the prisoner—I next Saw the prisoner about 5th April—I was assisting in the office at Sheerness, I heard a noise behind me, I turned round in my chair, and the only answer I got was screams of "Branston, Branston," and as I turned round the prisoner met me and struck me in the face and knocked me over; I was covered with blood, and my papers also—I got another blow on the chin, and he seized me round the waist and tried to rush me through a large plate-glass window into the street; I held by the table until help came and he was secured—besides the less for some time, and I felt the effects for months—I afterwards appeared at the police-court against him, and he was sent for a month to Canterbury with hard labour, and bound to keep the peace for three months—it came to my knowledge that in September the prisoner made a charge against me at the Criminal Investigation Department of receiving stolen property; I think he said eight books and a folding slate, which I had paid for; there was not a shadow of foundation for the charge—inquiry was made, and I Still hold my office—I have seen the letter of the 29th December, addressed to Mr. Joyce, and have not the slightest doubt that it refers to me.</p>

Per fortnight interest, and that they got about 60 per cent. Advanced upon them—Edward Learoyed was present during this interview—he said little or nothing; he generally endorsed what Wilton said, a sort of "Yes" or "No" to anything that was put to him—I asked Dunderdale how it was that they were pawing goods in this manner, and did he not know what it would lead to—he said "Well, I have nothing to do with it; I am simply the buyer, and that is all I have to do with it"—he subsequently said that they were put there for a very short time, just to get a little money, and then they would redeem them again—after Wilton's arrest I saw him in prison and asked him for a copy letter-book containing particulars of pledgings to the parties in London—he said "I cannot do with your coming down here asking me question now; Mr. Armitage, the solicitor, is my father confessor, I will tell him every<lb/>thing and he can tell you what he likes"—before this partnership Wilton was in the colonial trade, and he told me he had failed in march, 1878, and paid his creditors 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; he did not say whether he had his discharge.</p>

               <p>the time of his arrest he answered me every question I put to him, I believe fairly and straightforwardly—I believe that he did not conceal anything form me—I have ascertained the amounts for which the goods were pledged, but I have not ascertained the value, except that the prices were the in<lb/>voice prices, except in one case wilton told me that he put 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a yard on some portion of goods that Mr. Cacuhai had—I presume those were goods going to the paris market—about 60 per cent. was advanced upon them—afther Learoyed joined the firm the business was carried on under the name of Learoyed, Wilton, and Co.—both before and after Learoyd jained, the firm of phillipine, pellissier, and Co. were in the habit of discounting the foreign of bills of the firm, and to a considerable extent—there were legitimate transactions of considerable magnitude between then—that firm failed about march, 1879—the defendant's firm by that failure sustained a loss of 2,256<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but we cannot make out a claim against the trustee for more then half—wilton gave us those figures; they were taken out of the bill-book—I should say it is a more difficult matter to get foreign bills dis<lb/>counted in England than English bills—I have got everything the defendants gave up to me; there are some bankers' books, cheques, and so on—I find that all the sums obtained by pledging were legitimately paid in to the banking account of the firm; the pass-book shows that—I should take it, from the books, that the repayments were made in a legitimate way by cheque, but I have nothing particularly to prove it—Wilton told me that at one time they had a business in Genoa—I can only trace 467<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of goods sents to Genoa—he told me that some samples were sent to France, Italy, and Belgium—Mr. Wallker is one of the principal creditors—I have not seen him hare; he want over to Paris with Wilton at the time of the failure—I don't know that Mr. Walker has declined to have any<lb/>thing to do with this prosecution; he voted for it at the statutary meeting—he offered to be bail—I don't know how the goods were pledged at the Magasin Generale.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WADDY</hi>. I believe the Magasin Generale is con<lb/>nected with, and has the sanction of the Government—Wilton told me that it was very largely used by merchants in Faris—I have known Learoyd perhaps two yers, but not to speak to till just now—I have known his family in Huddersfield 10 or 12 years; his father is dead—his mother, in 1876, married a gentleman who was Mayor of Huddersfield last years, a magistrate of the west West Riding, and a gentleman of the highest position—I don't know any of the brothers but this one and Mr. Sidney; I know There are several sisters—in the course of this inquiry I have had occasion to see all the books, which were found for me, and also to have repeated interviews with Learoyd—my opinion is that he has been almost a non<lb/>entity; I believe he has known what was going on, but "Give me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and you can go on as you like, I want some money"—I have had to deal with his private estate as well as with his interest in the partnership but this, nor was he ever apprenticed to any—when he came of age he had 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believe—I only know this through him was invested in a ship called the Zanzibar—I think he spent a good lot of it on the Continent, supplying the Turkish army, etc,—I believe he lost a lot in that, the resrt I think he put Into the Zanzibar—out of the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not a sixpence is left—in order to get</p>

               <p>the money to put into this business he had to raise it on his shares in the Zanzibar; speaking roughly, he got about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first and 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after<lb/>wards; 1,1590<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has gone altogether, and 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of sidney's; there is another 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to came; that will have to be divided—at the time of amash he was lodging at 6, cravan street, strand—his furniture that was taken posses<lb/>sion of was at Taylor's Repository, pimlico—the business consisted in getting goods form Yorkshire and different places and sending them up to town—as far as I know the amount put in by the two Learoyds was the entire capital with which the business was worked—the failure of pellissier would clear off the whole of their capital—it was after that that the other brother was induced to put in his money; he was involved in this bankruptcy, and was also cleared out—Edwart Learoyd was present at the canversation when wilton told me about the goods being in the hands of the Magasin Generale—that was between the 1st and the 10th October—I was present when Learoyd gave his statement to the credirors on the 24th October—he was examined by Mr. Samuel Learoyd, of Huddersfield; he is no relation—another Mr. Learoyd is solicitor to the trustee; he also is no relation—?Mr. Beaumout Taylor was at the meeting—he is a large woolen manufacturer at Hudders<lb/>field and one of the creditors—he was one of a committee of six or seven appointed to consider whether there should be a prosecution, and to con<lb/>sider matters in general, to perpaer for the statutory meeting—I was not aware that he told Mr. Learoyd that the committee had determined if he stated all that he told know about the business, and all that he could get to know, he should not be prosecuted, because they ware of opinion that he had known comparatively little or nothong about it—if there was such a committee I was not present—Mr. Sidney Learoyd was also examined at the statutory meeting—Wilton was represented there by a solicitor, Learoyd was not—I heard it suggested by one or two creditors that if he would make a clean breast of everything he should not be prosecuted—he was under examination by Mr. Samuel Learoyd for a considerable time, and made a very full statement—with regard to many questions that were put to him his answer was simply that he did not know—I believe that he has givan all the information that he could—with regard to both the defendants they have not held anything back from me that I know of; they have told me everything—any question I have asked them they have given me a satis<lb/>factory answer—at the time of the examination on the 24th I had not been appointed trustee, I was appointed immediately afterwards, at the same meeting—they were given into cusody about half an hour after—I never spoke to them after I was appointed until after they were apprehended—it was by the direction of Mr. Learoyd, the solicitor, that Mr. Walker went over to paris—I thing there are some entries in the bill-book in Edward Learoyd's writing, but not in any other—he told me he did not know much about the books—I dare say I have stated that there were assets, something over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but they have turned out so badly, there has been nothing to realise except the 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that has been recovered from constitutes the Zanzilbar and the balance of Edward Learoyds furniture that constitutes the assets—I think 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was received yesterday from Dawbarne's—there was a pre<lb/>liminary meeting at leeds, when an account was presented showing the estimated state of the estate, upon the assumption that the goods were worth what they had been bought for—I don't thing that showed the estste to be solvent, but nearer then I show it now; that was form figures put in</p>

               <p>by the defendants—I have had a good deal of experience in the woollen trade—I think some of these goods were badly bought—I think learoyd told me that he was in Scotland in August; he had married a young lady from Aberdeen shortly belive—he was in Scotland about six weeks, and on his return I think he said he went to Paris.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>.

I thought it would be the best thing he could do—at the same time he told me he would do everything he could—what I said to him was on my own authority and Mr. Samuel Learoyd's—I don't say I had Mr. Samuel Learoyd's authority, I had his opinion—in fact it was held out to him that he would be made Queen's evidence; I think that was the term that was used—the con<lb/>clusion of the committee was that Wilton should be prosecuted, and that if Edward Learoyd would say all he knew about the business, he should not be proceeded against.</p>

I am now residing at Ear'ls Court Road, London—in January, 1879, I was in the employ of Learoyd, Wilton, and Co., at 66, Mark Lane—I was general clerk, till I took over the books—they first traded as colonial merchants and afterwards about May, com<lb/>menced woollen merchants—there was no business carried on at Mark Lane, they simply wrote letters there and saw any persons who came—I know Cauchai, Allen, Dunkley, and Faulkner—Allen and Cauchai came there frequently, about twice a week; Cauchai perhaps oftener—I have not seen Faulkner or Dunkley there—I was not present at any of the interviews with Cauchai; he came about advancing money—I have been to the gentleman's office about advances, to take letters—Mr. Wilton generally told me to go—I have sometimes taken patterns—I never had any conversation with Mr. Cauchai; I have taken a letter and waited for a reply; that is all—I had been a clerk in the office since January—I stayed there up to the last—from what was being transacted in the office I drew my own conclusions—I did nothing; I did not write letters or see them—I was not a dummy—I received a salary of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was nothing to do—there was no salesman, nor any attempts to sell that I know of—I never saw any order-book or stock-book—I have been to Southgate's to draw patterns—I saw goods there represented by the patterns—they were manufacturers' goods, held by Southgate's for Learoyd, Wilton, and Co.—I don't know for what purpose they required the patterns—I bought them and gave them to whoever was in; to the partners—I</p>

               <p>have never had any conversation with Wilton about the business, or with Allen or Cauchai—I made copies of the manufacturers' invoices and put them on the file, and returned the invoices to Wilton—they related to cloth goods that they had bought in the North—they were taken on to the gentleman who advanced the money—I have not taken them—I believe I have taken transfer orders to Southgate's for Wilton, with direction to lodge them there, and that a fresh order was to be given on goods—that was to obtain money on them—I know that money was obtained on the goods—Dunderdale was always at the office expect when he was away buying—he sat in the private room—he saw customers and anybody who came in; I mean the people who came to show goods manufacturers' agents, and so forth—I know his handwriting—he used generally to sit with Wilton and Laeyord—there was a private room for him—I don't know what went on in the private room—I have not seen Mr. Cauchai go into Dunderdale's private room, but in the room in which he was with Wilton, and I was then told by Wilton to say they were out if anybody called—I think Allen was there once when Dunderdale was in Wilton's private office; I don't recollect the date—he has not had any conversatoin with Dunderdale in my presence—he has been shown into the private room, where all the partners were, as well as Cauchai—I may have been called into the office when Wilton, Dunderdale, and Cauchai or Wilton, Dunderdale, and Allen were together, but I can't recollect—I am doing my best to give good evidence—I to give every information—I have been called into the office when Wilton and Dunderdale were there; I may have been when Allen was there and when Cauchai was there, and on both those occasion I have been told to say they were out—Dunderdale has been present when Wilton has given me the invoice to copy, and told me to retyrn them to him—they were generally copied in the morning, as Mr. Wilton wished to go out with them to one of those four gentleman, as the case might be—i remember Dunderdale going to Yorkshire in August—when he returned he said he had had a devilish hard time of it, that the manufacturers were suspicion, and that he should not have gone down to the North unless he knew the firm could pay 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—he said it was very difficult to get the goods, as the manu<lb/>facturers were suspicious—he said he told them that he should not have come down there unless the firm could have paid 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—this was during the period that I was going to Southgate's, getting patterns and copying out the invoices—I knew that these persons were advancing money on the goods at London Wall—Dunderdale never told me that he knew it—he was always in the private room therefore I presume he must have know—Mr. Leayord used to leave everything to Wilton and Dunder<lb/>dale—during the time I wsa in the employment, from January to March, there was not a single bond fide sale of goods in England to my know<lb/>ledge—I consider it would have been part of my duty as clerk to have entered it, if any such sale had taken place, there was nobody else to do it—I never made an entry of any <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> sale during the whole time I was there—this letter of 19th May, 1879, to Messrs.

I took a parcel of goods to Faulkner's by Wilton's direction—he said that I should receive a cheque in my name for the amount, and I was to take it to the bank and get it cashed and bring him the notes for it—I received this cheque for 390<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., drawn by Faulkner on the Imperial Bank, payable to Griffiths or bearer—I cashed it there and gave the money to Wilton—I did not receive my salary for the last month; it only received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on account of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am member of the firm of Norris and Gilby, merchants, of 44, Mark lane—we are London agents for Morgan and Co., of Hamburgh—Mr. Edwin Chaplin is the sole partner of that firm—I have known the defendant for some time as a customer of Morgan and Co.—on 14th January last year he was indebted to them about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—bills were runnign for that amount—on 29th January he came to my office—I had then a letter from Mr. Chaplin enclosing this copy of an order for 50 quarter-casks of brandy and 25 quarter-casks of sherry—I told him that I thought he was indebted too largely to Morgan and Co.—he said that we might hold over the order till the first bill was paid if we liked, but it would be a great pity to do so, as it was a right season to ship these goods, and if the shipment was deferred they would not go to so good a market—I said "You already owe Chaplin and Co. about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I cannot recomment them to extend that amount; if you wish to send them out now you can send the bills of lading through an Australian bank, who will advance you 80 per cent. on the invoice price, and Morgan and Co. will draw upon you for the remaining 20 per cent."—he said he could not do that, as the interest and charges would eat up the profit, that there was no risk in taking the order, and that I might look on the bills now running as good as paid—I said that part of the 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was consequent upon re<lb/>newals of bills, that I did not like renewals, and if he did any more busi<lb/>ness with them there must be no more renewals—he then agreed to that—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120079"/>
               <p>he repeated several times that there was no danger in taking the order, and that the bills would be met at maturity—he said "If Morgan and Co., wish it, they can draw at a shorter date and then renew, making up the usual credit"—I said "I will agree to no renewals, but if you assure me that there is no risk in talking the order, and thar the running bills will be met regularly at maturity, I will write Morgan and Co. advising them to make the shipment, but in future your account must not exceed 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there must be no renewals"—to this he agreed—some of the goods were to be shipped to Melbourne and some Sudney—on the same day I wrote to Mr. Chaplin, and the goods were shipped—either I or my partner had the mate's receipt—I could not say that I saw it in the office—in the ordinary course of business it would be obtained first and be afterwards exchanged for bills of lading—this is the letter I wrote to Mr. Chaplin on 29th January: "I have seen dhyhenson and had a long talk with him; he is very reasonable, and says it you don't like to ship now you can wait till the next bill runs off. He offers to accept at four months and you to renew, but I hate renewals, and said he must not expect them in any case; to this he agrees. write and let me know if you like this arrangement. I don't think there is much danger in executing his last order now, but you can leave it till after the 9th March if you like." This is Mr. Chaplin's reply: "February 3rd. I am much obliged for your report as to G. F. D. Under all the circumstances I think it would be as well to execute his order; it will therefore be sent off this week." On 20th February I sent this memorandum to the defendant: "I herewith beg to hand you mate's receipt for G. F. D.,50 quarter-casks brandy and 20 quarter-casks wine shipped per your account per Ann Duthey for Sydney." Om 25th February, in consequence of what I heard, I went and saw the defendant at his offfice—I said "I hear that one of your bills for a small amount has been dishonoured, and I have come in consequence to demand the mate's receipt sent to you a few days ago"—he said "It is impossible to give tit you, as I have already sent it to my correspondent abroad"—I said "That is unlikely, as there has been no mail for Australia. since the date it was sent to you"—that was so—he said the dishonour of the bill was a temporary affair, and he expected to put it to rights in a day or two, when all things would go smoothly as before—I said I could not believe that, as a man doing his large business must be very hardly pushed to let a bill about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. come back dishonoured, and I again demanded the mate's receipt or the bills of lading, whichever he might have in his possession them—he declined to have anything more to say on the subject, and I then told him that I considered it a rank swindle, and should recom<lb/>mend Messrs. Morgan to prosecute him—a few days after that notice of his liquidation was sent my office—these bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), except the one dated 25th February, represent the outstanding liability—the last bill, dated 20th February, for 252<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., was for these goods supplied—it was never accepted—none of the other bills were met—I was induced to part with the mate's receipt by the statement made by Dickenson to me at the interview at my office on 29th January—I should not have parted with it if it had not been for that. Croos-examined. I was agent for Mr. Chaplin in this transaction; the order was his and the goods were his—he finally decides whether the order small be executed—in this case he wrote me a letter stating that he had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120080"/>
               <p>decided to execute it—he selected the goods according to sample; I suppose he made out the invoice, I don't know it as a matter of fact, but there is no doubt of it—the goods are sent to this country by Mr. Chaplin; the invoice might go either before or after, and the goods are put on board—when the goods come here the name of the vessel by which they are to go Australia is given to me—that name is given by Mr. Dickenson or his clerk, and my clerks put the goods on board, and the mate's receipt is sent to Mr. Dickenson by another clerk of mine—the great question is whether the order shall be executed, and when we decide on that the ordinary steps are taken, among them the handing over of the mate's receipt—I did not see the defendant between 29th January and 25th February—I have known him a number of years, I could not say how long—I believe he has carried on an extensive businesss in the City for a good many years—I think it was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was due when I saw him in January—I attended the first meeting that was held after he filed his petition, and was appointed chair<lb/>man—the creditors met and his affairs were placed before them—I believe he afterwards went into bankruptcy—I had a claim of my own against him because I discounted one of the bills; I proved on the estate, and no doubt Mr. Chaplin did—I don't know that I was invited to oppose the bankrupt and to inquire into his proceedings; everything went to Messrs. Wontner and Sons—I made to opposition to the defendant's passing in bankruptey or getting his discharge—I never went to the Bankruptey Court and did not know that he was examined—Messrs. Wontner attended; I did not; I can't say whether Mr. Chaplin did—I saw in the paper that the defandant had passed his final examination and received his dis<lb/>charge—he had creditors to nearly 40,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; some to more than 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen the trustee about these proceedings—I attended before the Lord Mayor; he dismissed my application, and I was bound over—the conversaction I have related took place about this time last year—I have no notes of the coversation made at the time—I believe I am quite accurate in all I have stated to-day—I have not stated to-day that he told me at that interview that he never did such a thing as to obtain an advance on bills of ladinh through a bank—I don't think I said at the Mansion House, "I said, 'You can send the bills of landing and drafts thorugh an Australian bank, and obtain 80 per cent. upon them, putting a margin, and they drawing for the odd 20;' he said, I never did such a thing, and the expense would be too great'"—I believe I did not say so—I said something very like it, but not that—what I said was that he could not do such a thing because the expense would be so great—he did not say, "I never did such a thing"—I signed my deposition; it is incorrect—he said, "It would not do to do such a thing"—I cannot say whether I have said in evidence before to-day that he said there was no risk—you may not take it that I never did say so; I am not sure, I believe I have said so before to-day, but I don't know that I have said it in evidence—I don't know whether I said so at the Mansion House—he said that we might hild the order over till the first bill was met if we liked, but that it would be a great pity to do so as it would lose the season—he did not say he believed that the current bills would be met; he said I was to look upon the current bills as paid—I did not show him my letter to Mr. Chaplin; it was a private letter—the solicitors called some one at the Mansion House to prove the state of his account at Prescott's; not with my kmowledge; I did</p>

Morgan's In January went to Australia; he did make away with them—I attempted to attach them; we found afterwards that they were properly in the hands of persons out there I could not do so—I do not know that the con<lb/>signments signments have not all been realized; I have not inquird into that—I know that there has been a great depression in trade for the last eighteen months—I don't find that there has been a diffculty in getting returns from ship<lb/>ments ments to Australia—I think there is danger in any bill that is drawn, to a certain extent—before I saw the defendant I saw him that thay were not to trust him, and afterwards that there was little danger in doing it.

I live at Kennington, and represented in London the firm of Mr. Smithson, a stuff merchant at Bradford, in 1878 and 1879—I have an office at 25, Gutter Lane, City—I knew Michell before, but did not do business with him till October or November, 1878—I have been in the trade all my life, and have known firms in London 10 or 15 years—I knew the old firm of Keighley and Brother, the father of the present Mr. Keighley, who I have known 12 or 15 years—I knew him just to speak to when the firm consisted of his father and uncle—he commenced three or four years ago to trade on his own account in the name of the old firm—I have not seen his uncle or his father for years—I sold him about two lots of goods about September, 1878, value 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and a day or two afterwards I saw Michell at 4, Priest's Court—he said that they were a nice clean lot of goods, and had I another lot like them—I said yes, I had one or two lots at higher prices—he said "I should like to see them, as I can them for you"—I had some at a higher price—samples were sent, and he said that they would suit him better, as they would suit the West End, and the goods were bought and delivered to Keighley, who had made a communication to me—that lot of goods, which was the fourth lot, came to about 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a week or a fortnight after the delivery I saw Michell at Keighley's place—Keighley was not there—I said "Michell, our account is getting rather large, Mr. Smithson is rather anxious. Mr. keighley has told me you are going to put 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the concern at the end of November, is that correct?"—he said "Yes, Mr. cordoron, it is quite right," and I was satisfied—several lots of goods were bought after that, and I had frequent conversations with Michell—I used to meet him every day or every other day, and he said that he was going to put money in at the end of November—invoices were sent with the parcels, and I made a note of the sales in the order-book, which I have not got—Mr. Smithson has it—I know what goods I sold, but I do not know whether the railway people delivered them—I took about 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of orders, and Mr. Michell told me afterwards that he was very much pleased with the goods, and he had done well with them—that was early in December—I communicated what was said about the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Smithson—I had no power to allow the credit to run to 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he entrusted me with a certain amount of discretion—I would not have trusted Keighley with 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before that statement because, though I knew him to be all right, I knew his trade was not large enough—I depended on the extra trade he was to bring in, and the greater outlet for the goods—Michell pulled a newspaper out of his pocket in November, and said "This is a very nice thing, Mr. Cordoron, to meet one at break<lb/>fast"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120086"/>
               <p>—I said "I don't know, what is it?"—he said "There has been a fire at Notting Hill, and three houses of mine have been damaged to the amount of 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "You seem very happy" or "very comfortable over it; I suppose they are are insured"—he said "Yes, they are, but there is a very great deal of annoyance and inconvenience attending it"—I said "Are they detached villas?"—he said "No; they are in the centre of the terrace"—I said "They are not the only three perhaps that you have?"—he said "No; I have other houses on each side of them"—he ordered goods after that, and I still believed he was a man of property—I was with him and Mr. Smithson and Keighley very shortly after that at the City wine-house, Cheapside, and Michell said "The property will be sold next week, and then I shall hand over to Mr. Keighley over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I saw him when he stopped in 1879—he said that he was very little—he said that things would come all right—I had not supplied him directly, and had no account against him, but I had supplied him with goods which Keighley never saw—they were delivered at my place into one of Johnson's vans by Michell's direc<lb/>tions and sent away—I did not know where they were going, but he said that they were not going to Michell's because they were sold, and were going direct to the customer—Mr. Smithson sold those cords in my pre<lb/>sence, and I delivered them—I do not think the conversation at the City wine-house was before that—I did not know that he was getting advances on the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not ascertain that the houses he spoke of were invested in trustees for his wife; I took his word for what he said—I am certain that the conversation about the house was not in July—I do not know that they were burnt down about 20th July—I did not hear the con<lb/>versation between Smithson and the defendant—what the defendant said at the City wine-house was that he should hand over to Mr. Keighley over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he mentioned "over 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."twice—I made no note of the con<lb/>versation and never mentioned it till I told Mr. Leader about it two months ago, perhaps—I was before the Alderman every day, but was not called—the invoice of the goods sent by Johnson's van was sent to Keighley and Brother at their office—I understood that Michell was acting as agent for Keighley—I do not know what part of the 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for which I took orders has been paid for—Mr. Smithson's business is in Bradford, and I am in London—Kinghley told me he was doing business with India, and I knew it for years—I cannot say whether any of these goods went to India.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think it was November when he took the newspaper out of his pocket; I am sure it was not in July—I had the curiosity to look in the Telegraph, and the fire was in November or December—he never mentioned his wife as to the houses which were burnt down—I heard you tell the Alderman at Guildhall that other witnesses would be called at the trial—it has never been suggested before that Michell held himself out as an agent of Keighley—Michell said that when he came into partnership he would have things done in a better manner and the stock better kept—he never said either that he was a partner or agent, but that he was coming in, and he was trusted according to his representation—he never mentioned its being an order for India when the goods were put on Johnson's van; he said that he had done well with them at the West End, and told me to keep them till he had sold them, and afterwards he said that he had sold them at the West End of London.</p>

I carry on business at bradford, but came from Harrogate yesterday, where I have been staying on account of ill-health, and have not got my book with me; it can be here to-morrow—I first dealt with young Keighley a year ago last October—I think the first transaction was 40 pieces of serge, sold by my agent, Mr. Cordoron, value about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the second parcel was some Lamas, value 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after that second parcel was sent I had a communication from Mr. Cordoron and sent a third parcel of Russell cords in October, value 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was after Michell's name had been mentioned—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an exact copy of my ledger; my cashier made it, and I checked it with the ledger—these are exact copies of the invoices forwarded to Keighley—I will wire for my books, and stay in town till to-morrow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent for some cloth merchants, of 22, Paternoster Row—I have been in the trade 18 or 20 years—prior to September, 1878, who was in business as the sole representative of the old firm of Keighley and Brother—I represent Hyde and co., of Staley bridge, the petitioning creditor, and Messrs. Hertz and Co., of Bradford; I also do business on my own account—in consequence of a letter from Hertz and Co. I went to Keighley's on 20th September, 1878, and on the next day Michell came to my place—I said "Are you Mr. Michell, from Keighley Brother's?"—he said "Yes"—I said "You have come here to endorse a hill"—he said "I have," and endorsed it—I then said "Is it true that you are going to join Keighley in partnership?"—he said "Yes, and I am going to put in 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he saw some papers of shirtings on my desk, and said "Do you deal in this class of goods?"—he said "I am; I have a con<lb/>nection of my own for this class of goods," and let him have patterns—he said "What is the price?"—I said "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he took the patterns, and returned on the 26th September and said "I have a customer for them, and will take them"—the invoice was about 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they were invoiced to Keighley and Brother—I let them go on the strength of the representation that he was going to put 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the business—he had another parcel a day or two afterwards amounting to about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said he sold at a good profit—the two parcels together came to 240<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the terms were a four month's bill from the date of the invoices—the bills were drawn and endorsed by Michell—they were Hyde's goods—two of these bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) refer to the bills fell due they were dishonoured, and the shirtings have not been paid for—I would not have credited Keighley more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the credit I gave him was purely influenced by Michell's statement—Michell came again about 3rd October—Mr. Hertz, from Bradford, came in while he was there, and I introduced Michell to</p>

               <p>him as the in going partner who was going to join keighley; Michell said "I am going to join Keighley and I shall put in 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if the business succeeds well I shall put in more; my wife has a private in<lb/>come of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and I have also a small income myself; I do not like to be idle, and that is the reason I am Joining Keighley in busi<lb/>ness"—after Mr. Hertz left I sold Mitchell 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 260<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of Hyde's goods—this is the original invoice—they were paid for about a month after<lb/>wards by cheque—I think this is it.

(<hi rend="italic">This was signed "F. Michell, stating that he was unable to take up the bill, owing to his bank having stopped payment last month.</hi>) He afterwards called on me, and I said "I am quite surprised that the bill has not been paid"—he said "I shall pay it in the course of a few days"—I saw him almost daily; he said that he was all right, and I had nothing to fear, and all these were acceptances and endorsenments for goods—this letter is his writing.

               <p>securities in your pocket, for to me they are useless; you cannot do any<lb/>thing with them without your wife's consent; I have made my own in<lb/>quiries about you, and the result is very unsatisfactory; in fact, I have found you to be a liar and a rogue," and I told him to leave my office, and said to Keighley "You hear what I have said, contradict it if you can"—as they were leaving I said "It remains with me to consider what steps will be taken after what has come to my knowledge; you hear what I have said, bear in mind what I have said—they then left—I was present at Michell's meeting of creditors in March—he proposed to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound at once, but the meeting rejected it—he was examined at the meeting—there was another meeting, and on 1st April the petition in bankruptcy was filed—I acted as representative for Hyde and Co., and this prosecution was at the instigation of the creditors generally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sold some shawls to Michell on my own account on 26th October, value 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was paid—that made the second parcel that was paid for—the St. James's Bank stopped about 12th September, but there was nothing there to his credit—I may have declined to look at the securities at first, but being pressed I looked at them—I am sure he said 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not know whether his wife's sanction had been given—this looks like the document which I said appeared to be a will (<hi rend="italic">an indenture</hi>)—I am not familiar with legal documents—I put the 69<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill into the hands of Messrs. Plunkett and Leader, who I have known 14 years, some time in January, and in due time received notice of Michell filing a liquidation petition—I attended the meeting, and was chairman—I took no other steps till April 1st—I do not know whether the composition was to be secured by the wife—the general feeling was that the creditors would not take less than 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—as the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was refused Mr. Vanderpump suggested that time should be given—I do not remember hearing Mr. Waddington say that if 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was not paid bankruptcy proceedings would be instituted, or that a prosecution would probably take place, or that the Bradford creditors would prosecute, nor do I remember stopping him and correcting him—I do not remember a statement being made by any creditor that he would prosecute if 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was not paid—the committee of inspection are Mr. Newstead, who is, I think, Mr. Lovering's manager, Mr. Lovering, who is Keighley's trustee, Mr. Hopkins, one of the managing clerks of plunkett and Leader, and myself.</p>

I determined to see Michell, which I did, and he corroborated Keighley's statement that he was placing 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the concern, and that he had not got the money just then, but expected it day by day—the credit had not then expected to 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the morning of January 5th I got information that Keighley had field a petition, and I saw him, but I held no conversation with him or Michell—I never got any information from Michell of his filing a petition there were no acceptances in my case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not a creditor of Michell; I had to prove against Keighley, I took it for granted that Michell was an actual partner—he told us that the deeds were actually prepared but he had not signed them until he had got the money, which was coming day by day—I know that if he had been a partner I could have proved against him—I cannot say whether Michell said in Nov. that the money he should put in was trust money—the second interview commenced at Keighley office, and we walked up Cheapside and continued the conversation at the wine-shop for half an hour—he said that there was a lot of red-tapeism about it, and that it was trust money and trust property, and he should have it certainly by the end of the year—I supposed it was coming to him in consequence of the death of a relative, but I do not know that I heard him say so—it is just possible that when I sold the 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods I sent a messenger to Keighley's office to say that I had some stock in London—Michell came round first, and I believe he came the next morning with Mr. Partridge, who, I understood, was Keighley's manager—the Rusell cords and the black goods are the only two parcel I sold myself; those came to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less 2 1/2 discount.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Keighley said "I can pay on the, day," not "We can pay"—the pay day was to be 19th December, the very day that Michell was at Bradford, and as I did not get a cheque I went to his hotel and asked him for payment for all goods invoiced up to 19th November, which was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "How is it that the cheque from Keighley has not come?"—he said "I have got an explanatory letter from Keighley, and will see after it; I am going there this afternoon, and it shall be sent to-morrow."</p>

I am a stuff manufacturer of Bradford—in 1878 Keighley owed me between 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and in December, 1878, I saw him in my office; Mr. Sutcliff was present—Michell said "If you will be quiet and not push your account, you will be paid 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound; I am going into partnership with Mr. Keighley, and am going to bring in from 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>." as far as my memory serves me—we said that we would be quiet and not push our account—he saw our stock, and asked me to send patterns, and said that if he sold them he would pay cash if we would let him have them—we sent samples, and he paid me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one sample piece in Keighley's place—I told him we should not deliver any goods until the whole account was paid—we afterwards took out a writ—I have never said that if he would pay 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound we would not prosecute, but if he did not we would—I introduced Michell to Mr. Robertshaw in the Liberal Club—as well as I remember, Mr. Robertshaw said "Shall we get our account?"—he said "Yes, it will be all right."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I attended Keighley's meeting of creditors in London—I did not meet Michell in Cheapside and say "I mean to have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound out of you or Keighley"—I said just the contrary, I said that I had made up my mind to prosecute every case, as it was an outrage to commercial morality—I said nothing about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—this was the same week as Michell's first meeting of oreditors—I don't remember going to Keighley's meeting at all—I went to Michell's meeting, and I was very angry; most people are when they lose their money—I do not remember saying that if we did not get 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound the Bradford creditors had resolved to prosecute, or that some gentleman stopped me and said that it was too soon to talk of that—my solicitors are Wood and Killick of Bradford, and I think a Mr. Wood of St. Paul's Churchyard is their London agent—I think he was at the meeting of ereditors on 13th March—I did not go about among the creditors at Bradford trying to get up a resolution for a prosecution—I talked to one or two persons, and we did ultimately decide to prosecute, or there would have been no prosecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I do not believe I said anything about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound being paid—I said many times, "Whenever a case of this kind occurs I am determined I will prosecute," and I am of the same opinion still—it was after I was at the meeting of his creditors on 13th March that I saw Michell in Cheapside.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stuff merchant, of 4, Priest Court, Foster Lane—I have been in business on my own account about three years as J. Keighley and Brother—they were my father and uncle—in my state<lb/>ment of affairs Mr. Card, of Aldermanbury, is my debtor for 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on the other hand I owed my mother 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my total book debts were 3,378<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., including the 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Card—I first knew Michell in November or December, 1877, when he came about a bill of Card's which he had accepted, and within a few months of that he bought goods of me from time to time—previous to July and August, 1878, he owed me about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I held a deed of his for some time as security, but I gave it back to him; this is it. (<hi rend="italic">The indenture</hi>)—I had no other security—I told him one day that I was hard up, and his large account and one or two others made me very short indeed—he said, "Why don't you take a partner?"—I said, "I don't care about it, and I do not know anybody who would be likely to join"—he said, "Why not take me?"—I said, "I will think about it"—he said, "I have a fine West-end connection, and I can bring in some money"—a few days afterwards I said, "I have thought about it, and I will take you as a partner"—he said, "I expect some money to be left me by a relation of my wife, who is expected every day to die; I have been telegraphed for two or three times"—shortly afterwards he came and said, "My relation has died"—I said, "Do you get as much as you expected?"—he said, "Yes, rather more, about 4,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was about the beginning of July, 1878—he said, "I am going to put in 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and pay you at the same time the account I owe. By the terms of the will it must be settled, and I must have the money within three months"—that would be the beginning of October—he said, "I think you had better not say anything about it tll I get the money," and I said no more about it for three months till the time came—he asked if I would mind his letters being sent to my place, and I gave him permission—he came there every day, and stopped sometimes half an hour and sometimes an hour—I supplied him with a few goods between July and the beginning of October, but not to the same extent—I drew bills on him for his indebtendness; some of them are in my box not discounted, and some were paid away and were subsequently dishonoured; these are some of them. (<hi rend="italic">Seven or eight bills were here put in, drawn by the witness and accepted by Michell.</hi>) Two of those bills have the notarial charges on them of 20th April and 17th May; they are marked as dishonoured—I should think they were never paid, but I cannot swear to it from memory—these two cancelled bills of 10th October were renewed, I believe, but I cannot swear that from memory—here are two in February, 1878, not marked or cancelled, but marked "N.S.;" they were renewed—there are other bills to represent them somewhere—these two of 15th and 19th March were renewed—this bill of October, 1877, would be due in February, 1878; that was paid—the oter were, I believe, all subject to renewal—after the beginning of 1878 his bills came back or were returned—they are <hi rend="italic">bona<lb/>fide</hi> bills given by him as the purchaser of our goods—I told him in October that I was very hard up, and he knew I was—he saw two or three writs that I had, and I showed him papers showing that I was pressed for money—I referred to the time being past when the legacy was to be paid, and he kept saying that the lawyers could not get the property realised, that it was principally housed, but there was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Consols—I said, "I cannot go on as I am going on; I have been dpending on your money coming in"—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120097"/>
               <p>said, "It will be all right; it will be sure to be settle in a short time; I am expecting it every day"—he said that more than once, and said he would go down to Bradford and try and get the bills renewed, and put his names on the back for additional security because he was coming in as a partners—just before the goods mentioned in this invoice of 14th October were delivered I heard Michell say to Mr. Dear, "I am coming in as a partner, and I am going to put some money in"—I don't think he said how much then—I said, "I should not say anything until the money is in"—he afterwards tole other people in my presence, and then I told other people, but he did not tell me to go and repeat that statement. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLAY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">objected to this evidence, and the Cournt did not think it admissible.</hi>) Michell spoke to me many times about ordering goods—if we had the pattern of a cheap lot he would say "You had better order those, I could sell them"—I very often acted upon those statements—I remember this invoice of 14th of October for coloured lamas—I ordered those—I cannot call these parcels to mind of 15th October I had a conversation with Mr. Cordoron in the prisoner's presence—I remember the subtance of it—it was simply that I was about to bring in a partner who would find the money—I believe Mr. Cordoron let us have the goods on the strength of that statement—I recollect this parcel of serges in invoice F.S. 4,102'. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we had samples first—Michell saw them—I consulted him—he said they were cheap, and we offered a lower price than that at which they were de<lb/>livered—I know what the goods were of F.S. 5,66<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were ordered under the same circumstances—as to F.S. 6,301<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I said to Michell "Can you pay for these goods? you know what I mean; I am dependent on your money coming in to pay for them; you know I cannot pay for them myself, and unless you will give me your word of honour that your money will be in before the money is due I shall send every piece back to Cordoron's"—he said "You need not be at all frightened, my money will be in long before it is due"—on the strength of that I did not send the goods back, but we kept them—I cannot say the value of the goods I ordered separately—Michell was party to the buying of the majority of them—F.S. 7, of 26th November, 24 pieces of alpaca blacks, 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I bought myself; also F.S. 8,34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., F.S. 9,24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we had samples of F.S. 10—he said he knew where he could sell them; he could sell a lot—after that statement I gave an order for forty pieces, 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—F.S. 11 and 12, December 9th, did not come intomy place at all—Michell told me he was going to order them—I understood they were going to Bowers and Co.'s, a customer, of Covent Garden, whom Michell introduced—this invoice of 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I ordered myself—there were no patterns—they were delivered—they were sold to different houses in small lot, every few of them—the others wee sold when my stock was sold—they from part of the assets of my estate—I had a few transactions with Hert before the defendant came—I had not paid anything for two or three months before—I said to Michell that we had no sale for these things, they are worsted—the amount is 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said "Oh, I can sell them; they are cheap"—that was in Mr. Hertz's wareshouse—they were sold to a Mr. Card, at 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard profit—I do not remember his making a statement to Mr. Hertz—Michell went to Hertz to get a bill renewed—I think that was the first intimations Hertz got of the partnership—Michell went to Bradfore about twice alone in October or November—I first knew that Harfeld had transactions with Michell at</p>

               <p>the last sessions of this court—that was the first time I had seen Harfeld—I knew of about half-a-dozen pledgings by the defendent—the first was about October, when the money did not come in as Michell promised—he said, though I forget the exact words, "We must get some money on the goods to tide over till the money comes in"—I knew where they went—I consented—I expect they went to Harfeld—I connot say that he mentioned the name of every parcel—an invoice went out with the goods—some porter fatched them—the goods were not measured, they never are; the manufacturer's measure is taken—this was Michell's banker's book—I had no banking account of my own from October 15—some moneys I paid into his bank and some I paid away in other things without banking—the moneys received from Harfeld would be used in the business, or paid into this account—I kept my own cash account—I carried on the business till the last day of the year—I filed my petition on the 3rd January—I had two or three conversations with Michell before stopping—I said "It is absurd going on like this"—the last thing I said was, that if he could not tell me something definite the next day I should put my affairs in my solicitor's hands—that was the day before we closed—I did so—up to that time I believed he had power to put money in—he then owed me about 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1,700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I recollect from my books—I did not receive from the bank more then I paid in—there was a small balance left of about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon that account belonging to me—Michell told me so—I handed over to Michell these five bills of exchange with my initials and numbered J J K 22 to J J K 26, because he said I ought to give them up as he had endorsed a lot of bills for renewal at Bradford: they are dated 17th September, 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 129<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 134<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—some of them repre<lb/>sent The bills which you have shown me—they all represent goods that Michell had of me to the value of them—the original bills were given up for goods—I never consented to his putting my name in the list of persons owing him 740<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he never consulted me about it—I banked at the Union Bank before the account was opened at the head office of St. James's Bank—I did not know the defendant was pledging the goods he bought of me—I had no account with E.G. Williams and Co.—I did not know of the purchase on 17th December from Mr. Grandage—I saw a sample of the goods at our place—those goods were not sold; they became part of our assets—when I found out how things were going I kept the goods in the place intact—Gillies, Garnett, and Co.'s bill for 185<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was renewed—I had a conversation about it—Michell said he would endorse it, to induce them to renew it till his money came—not endorsing it was an oversight—I do not know what Michell's travelling expenses were—he was absent when he went to Bradford three or four times during the period, but not more then three days—I went with him once or twice—I saw Mr. Waddington, Mr. Hertz, Mr. Borisson, Mr. Robertshaw, and several others—they were all my creditors—I know One or two cheques were dishonoured in December—this one of 9th November For 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was—I cannot say if it was paid the next day—it is cancelled—the bank stopped about the 12th December—I knew then that Hall Well's cheque was dishonoured for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was afterwards paid; also a cheque in favour of William Blake Williamson, of 10th December, 1868—I had none of the money—I remember an application being made with reference to Hall Well's cheque in favour of J.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I remember the goods bought from Mr. Herts, at Brad-Ford—Michell sold them to Card; I was not with him when he sold them—I cannot say whether he paid part on account—I had the money—it would be after the 10th December—the entry in my ledger of 14th December of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. credited to Card would be it—he it Browers, of Govent Garden, paid the 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for his goods—the money ernt into the business—I asked Michell to sell the goods in invoice J.

I will send the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Halliwell's and send the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. another time"—I cannot say that it did not happen—Michell told me that when the St. James's Bank stopped there was a small balance to my account, from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I suppose I was not asked that before the Alderman—the Union Bank stopped my account about the beginning of October—it was understood when the defendant opened an account at the St. James's Bank that it was to be for the convenience of Keighley and Brother until the partnership was complete; my money was paid in to his account—money was paid in and drawn out from time to time—I do not suggest that there was more than from 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me on the balance—I do not say that I paid in all I reveived; when I wanted a cheque to pay any of my creditors I went to Michell, and said "I want so much," and when he signed a cheque it was against money which had been paid in—a cheque may sometimes have been drawn before the money was paid in, and I paid the money in afterwards—I never paid Michell any commission or salary, he had nothing out of the business—sometimes he got money for me, and handed it over—I never got Card to obtain advances for me, or any one else—I belive Card is in London—my bought ledger was kept at Bradford, and I did not see it—I closed the office at Bradford about the end of the year, just before I failed—I swear I saw Mr. Wyatt, my manager, there in October, and I feel perfectly certain I saw him there in December—he came to London at the beginning of the year, and made the book up then—he made entries in the bought ledger after he came to London, and looking at it would enable me to tell very nearly when he was last at Bradford—I also got some goods from Rendle—I should say I had between 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. represents the goods I had between August and</p>

I owed to my mother—I went down to Bradford in July or August with Michell to see Mr. Wood, a manufacturer, and other people—that is not Mr. W.H. Wood—I wanted him to discount bills, and roughly made a statement to him of what my position was—I believe Michell had just gone out, but I should not like to swear he did not hear it—I gave him two bills of 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each which I wanted him to cash, but he refused—I do not think I had dis<lb/>cussed my position with Michell—he knew the object of my going—I made a memorandum of my affairs on a piece of paper for Wood, and I never saw it afterwards—I will swear I never showed it to Michell, but I will not swear he never saw it; I don't believe he did—I did not ask Michell if he would endorse the bills, I belive he suggested it first—they were to be drawn on him, and he was to be the acceptor—I perhaps left the bills with Wood, but I got them back again—I Kow Michell left the office directly we get the bill stamps the first thing in the morning—I made the writing to get the bill stamps the first thing in the morning—I made the writing when I was down there, not in London—I had it in my head—I will swear I did not make it in London and show it to Michell in the train—I will swear I told Wood what I owed my mother—I was never asked that before the Alderman—I was solvent up to the end of December if I had my mother's money, at least I believed so—I made two or three large bad debts, one of 1,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two or three more of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I owed 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I stopped, the bad debts would very nearly bring it to that—I do not know whether I made a mistake or not, it was a very rough thing—my cash book will show what payments I made after July, 1878—I should say I did not pay between 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods previously had, and for goods supplied during that time—I can tell by the cheques what I paid while I was at the Union Bank—I think I paid Sutcliffe about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I don't think it was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay Borisson 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 28th November he sent me 290<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., half of the bill, and we were to find the other half to take the bill up, (<hi rend="italic">Several entries in the cash-book were read to the witness, which, he stated he could not remember.</hi>) I know 163<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was sent to Borisson to meet a bill—I do not see it here, but I am sure that was not a cash payment to him; there was a bill drawn by him on me coming due, and they sentme up the money.

Plunkett and Leader on 1st January I knew that I was insolvent, but I did not know what my liabilities were, I had not gone through them—we discussed the matter, and I think we came to the conclusion that it was about 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—by my statement of affairs my liabilities are 10,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—I do not recollect Mr. Leaoer saying that Michell really was a partner with me, or saying that the deed had been drewn, though it was not signed—I will not swear that nothing of the sort was said—I am not sure some gentleman there did not say "Are you a ware you are liable? the deed of partnership is drawn up, though it is not signed"—I had given them instructions about October to draw up a partnership deed from the time his money came in—I don't think Michell was there, but I had his authority—he was not to be a partner until he brought his money in—Plunkett and Leader were my father's solicitors—Mr. Cordoron owed me 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I stopped—I sold him about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods in 1878—perhaps 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of the goods I had from Smithson were for the Indian market—the lost were very small—the cheque for 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Harfeld and Co. at the beginning of October was some money which Michell got me from Harfeld, and there is an entry in the ledger in red ink on October 2, "Sundries 128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—that was posted by the trustee from my cash-book—the cntry of those goods is in my day-book; it is included in this 195<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I never sent Harfeld a piece of goods myself—I might have very likely credited the cheque and not received it at all.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on 18th May—it had been taken up be me out of my funds before he had the goods—they were sold to him in the ordinary way of business—on 22nd June he dishonoured another bill of 151<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and another on 10th August of 163<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had not, I believe, provided any funds for any of those bills—the five bills were given on 17th September simply to balance up what was owing on the dishounoured bills—that is why they were all of one date, and when his money came he said he would take them up, so I did not discount them—that represents the total amount of goods he had of me—these accouts, J.J.K. 14 and 15, were always on two sheets of paper, debtor and creditor—I charge him as a debtor.

(<hi rend="italic">Reading a number of amounts from the margin of the cheque book</hi>)—I went through that with the defendant last night, and there is a very little differences as to payments out—Michell for his own purpose got money from the banking account to the amount of 437<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I do not say that amount exactly, but there is not much difference—I have no means of knowing what the monkeys were that were paid into the bank—I know the amount, but I do not know where it comes from—Michell has said that is was a private banking account of himself, but not his own money—he said that moneys of his moneys of Keighley were paid in, and I asked him last night and neither he nor Mr. Keighley can do it—I asked Keighley whether any of Michell's money went into the bank, and he said he did not know, but Michell's said there were several payments in out of his private money—I found no trace of Keighley and Brothers's cheques—the banks—book will show the total paid in—Michell pointed out one payments which he thought was his own: the first item in the book 64<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said he thought so, but he could not speak positively—he also pointed out a loan of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the paying in book, but I did not understand it—the total is 447<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including one of Mr. Dear's acceptances for 99<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 13th November—the amount paid out under keighley's name is 1,616<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and Michell says it is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more—there was a credit balance 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when the bank stopped—amongst the papers delivered to me as trustee were several invoices from Keighley to Michell—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are two invoices delivered up to Michell—amoung the invoices delivered up by Michell I find reference to the identical goods which are in Harfeld's Re<lb/>cepits—I find no instances of a sale at a profit at Harfeld's—correcting the statement of affairs by my evidence now, the total gross deficiency in Michell's bankruptcy statement is 4,222<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is the differences between the debts and credits—I first had knowledge of sales at Harfeld's at the examination in bankruptcy—I had often seen Michell before the sales commenced; he was in and out of our office twice and three times a week during the liquidation—he did not explain to me where the goods had gone; only the shawls to Dear—he said there was a parcel of goods which he had sold at a loss, but Harfeld's name did not turn up in any other instance—I believe he mentioned Harfeld's as the person to whom Dear's shawls were sold—he said that he had had great traveling expenses and living expenses, and had not made much profit out of his transaction—I don't think he gave me any explanation of the expenses he spoke of or the profits he had made—he said that they had made very little profit, and in some instances made a loss—he did not mention to me three journeys to</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have never found Michell Backward in answering any question as to the figures—I think he has given me the best answer he could—I do not think any of the information he has given me has been willfully false as to facts and transactions, but he has given me such a little information—after the petition in bankruptcy was filled he told me of the transaction of Harfeld with regard to Dear's shawls as the only transaction of the sort—to the best of my knowledge I never heard Harfeld'd name till then—I was at the meeting of creditors on 13th March, and I believe Harfeld's name was mentioned—I think a question asked him by Harfeld was the only Michell answered—I know he had one dealing with Harfeld—I never went to Harfeld—I asked Michell several question, the same as I ask bankrupts to account for the deficiencies and he said that he could not give me a account, that he made very little profit, and on some transaction a loss—I reckon his deficiencies to be 4,229<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which he has to account for—2,271<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is accounted for his accep<lb/>tance to Keighley, which reduces the account for by 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I account for the largest part of the deficiency at once—there are three cheques besides to Borisson, to Bowers, and to Halliwell—I do not know whether he received anything for them—he said that he never had a sixpence for them—I have never asked Keighley about it—I did not apply to the Bankruptcy Court for an order on the defendant to file better accounts; we did it in another way; we had him privately examined—I think he has passed his public examination; I was not there—he enters his liabilities in bankruptcy at about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or nearly so; that is in consequence of the amounts due to the creditors being correctly ascertained—he told me then almost entirely from memory—I do not suggest that he kept anything intentionally back from me—he did not omit the names of any creditors which I afterwards found out—the substantial differences was between his account and Keighley's and there was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more liability—he told me that Keighley had a claim for 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that was his first statement, but he did not tell me anything about the bills that were ruining—he said that he had endorsed a considerable amount beyond the value of the goods or he would not have made him debtor for so much—I could only prepare the accounts from what he told me—I saw Mr. Vanderpump; he did not ask how it was that Keighley was put down as a debtor instead of a creditor—Michell's explanation to me was that it was in order to make the account Balance properly, because though Keighly and Brother were creditors of his, still he had accepted a large amount beyond the amount of his goods—having no books, I could only get it from his mouth until I saw Mr. Wyatt—I did not then know that Keighley's claim for goods was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not discover before the meeting in liquidation that the actual amount Michell admitted was 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I took his figures entirely—he in<lb/>sisted that Keighley was his debtor for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in respect of the balance of account—he told me he had endorsed and accepted, and made up the account in his own way, and claimed credit for what he had not, and had made himself liable for about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not advise him only to put Keighley down as a debtor for 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if Mr. Vanderpump says that I did he</p>

               <p>Has made a mistake—I never told him that as Michell had endorsed bills to The amount of 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Keighley ought to appear as a debtor, and not as a Creditor; I expressly said that that was the amount Michell made it, and According to his figures it was correct; all those endorsements are figured As unsecured creditors to this day, and we did not know, except from the Debtor, that they were unsecured creditors—at that time Michell himself Did not know the exact state of affairs—I must have understood that Michell had taken up the endorsements—Michell was so foggy about his Books, having only his memory to trust to, that I can distinctly state that I did not understand it, and I may have concluded that Mr. Vauderpump Thought from the debtor's statement that the claim against Keighley was Correct—I have not got the original draft from which I prepared the Debtor's statement, I have an office copy—the figures were taken down From Michell's dication by one of our clerks, but I have not got it; most Probably Michell took it with him; it was of no use after I had made my Copy—I do not think Michell came to me on Card's recommendation, he Came of himself—I have known Card as long as I have known Michell—I Cannot say that Michell did not tell me that Keighley's claim against him Was considerably larger than 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he might have said that he owed Keighley about 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for goods, but if he did I do not see how that can Make him his debtor for 560<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in all probability he claimed that the Difference between 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should appear on the other side of His account—it was very important to wipe out his debt and make him a Debtor; we have always recognised that as accounting for the deficiency to That extent—if he did not take up drafts he would be a debtor for them, But not to Keighley—none of the bills were taken up—Michell said that He really could not tell what the state of his account was without seeing Keighley's books and I sent him to see them; I did not go personally—I think Mr. Lovering refused to show them once, and on two other occa<lb/>sions The books were at Bradford—I applied for an order of the Bankruptcy Court on 8th August to see them, which is on the file—it was made in a Day or two—that was after I had examined Keighley on 29th July at con<lb/>siderable Length in Michell's bankruptcy—we wanted to get at the fact, And see if we could elicit the truth—we had not seen the books then to Take extracts from them.

Plumkett and Leader Are finding out what property he or his wife are entitled to—I am not a Lawyer—I do not think it was an unfair thing not to make inquiries before The prosecution was instituted; we go upon the figures that are put Before us—Michell does not say in his balance-sheet that he has rights In consequence of Mrs. Masters's death—I believe be has said in my hearing That his claims were in consequence of Mrs. Masters's death—my solicitors Have inquired what the property was to which he said he was entitled—I Have not asked them the result at present of what they are doing in the Matter—I cannot say yea or nay whether the defendant has any claim Under the will—I cannot say whether Michell has any interest under Certain wills in consequence of Mrs. Masters's death—I have never read the Wills or settlements—Mr. Vanderpump asked me to prepare the accounts In the bankruptcy—the delay in filing the accounts was not in consequence of My not having prepared them, it was in consequence of an error one of My clerks made, which caused some little delay—the trustee in bankruptcy Prepares the accounts, but they are the debtor's accounts—I did not tell Mr. Vanderpump after I was I was appointed trustee that I could not Undertake to prepare the accounts; what I said was in the interregnum Between the liquidation and the bankruptcy; when the liquidation fell Through Michell was adjudicated bankrupt, and it was 21 days before The appointment of a trustee, and between those times I suggested to Mr. Vanderpump that perhaps it would be as well to draw up the statement Before the trustee was appointed—I drew up one statement, but it was Incorrect, and Mr. Vanderpump drew it up afterwards; a certain Correction was suggested, and Mr. Vanderpump adopted it—my clerk pre<lb/>pared The bankruptcy accounts, and they were produced at the examination In July, and Mr. Knight objected to them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the state<lb/>ment I handed to Mr. Vanderpump—this comes from our office—Mr. Vanderpump or Mr. Knight suggested that it was incorrect because Sheet A Contained all the liabilities—that was just the mistake which was In the liquidation proceedings—that was not Michell's fault—it contains The 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., more than the liquidation, we had got the amounts Corrected then—I have been ordered to prosecute by the Committee of In<lb/>spection; As trustee I am only a servant—the Court of Bankruptcy put Me in motion and I put it in motion—I have not said that this is an</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120119"/>
               <p>He stated two reasons, one that he did not want Keighley's creditors to know That he was indebted in such a large sum to Keighley, and that he had also Endorsed and accepted bills for something over 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for Keighley—I said "That is nonsense, you have not paid those bills, you have simply en<lb/>dorsed Them; are you in a position to pay them?"—he said that he should Be—I told him I could not take his endorsements as a set-off against Keighley's claim, which was very nearly 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the open account and Acceptances running—neither he or Keighley could give me the particulars Of those bills, but I got them subsequently—think the conversation about The 171<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 178<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which were struck out was in Michell's Presence, but I am not positive—it is impossible for me to say by the ex<lb/>amination Of the day book whether those items are fictitious or not—i only Know why they are omitted on the information given me by Keighley—There has been no insisting on the restoration of those two items—in January, 1879, when Michell told me he was liable for 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I said "How is it if You are able to pay this 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you have not paid a bill of something like 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I heard you speak of yesterday as having written to a creditor At Bradford about?"—he said that he had a large sum locked up in cones<lb/>quence Of the stoppage of the St. James's Bank—I said "I understood all Along from you and Mr. Keighley that the money at the St. James's Bank Belong to Mr. Keighley, not to you"—he said "That is of no consequence, It was an understood thing that the bill was to be paid from the proceeds of The bank."</p>

               <p>necessary for another statement to be prepared for the meeting in bank<lb/>ruptcy, and I believe Mr. Everett's clerk copied the exact statement that had been made in the liquidation—Mr. Everett pointed out to me that as trustee he ought not to prepare the debtors' statement—there was some delay in the filing of those accounts, and on, I think, the fourth of fifth day of the private examination Mr. Everett handed me across the table the state<lb/>ment of affairs in his clerk's writing—I looked at it at once, and saw that it was exactly the same as before—there had been no alteration whatever—Mr. Knight, the Counsel, being there, I put the question to him how it was To be framed—he advised that it was not in the proper form, as the bills Endorsed and accepted should have been under D instead of A—he did not disapprove of any other matter, but I think it might have been framed very much better now; but the defendant did what I advised him to do—the accounts under the liquidation were fully gone into at that meeting of creditors—they were read out and discussed, and Mr. Lovering tendered a proof for 1,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on behalf of the bank<lb/>rupt I disputed it, acting under Mr. Everett's advice—I think I explained publicly at that meeting the way in which I arrived at the balance—it was explained and thoroughly understood by all the creditors—when Michell consulted me first he told me how he had got into his difficulties—I procured an office copy of Mrs. Master's will—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Mr. Joseph Downer's, original will from the Probate Court—it is dated the 12th of February, 1835 (<hi rend="italic">This was put in and read</hi>)—Thomas Harrington died before Mrs. Masters, childless and intestate, and she was only between William Downer and Mrs. Michell as representing her mother—I cannot Prove Mrs. Thomas had any other child but Josephine; but Josephine represented her dead sister or brother—William Downer and Josephine Michell divided the estate between them, and they have already divided the money—they have each taken their share—it was 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—Mrs. Michell's share was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after payment of solicitors' charges she received 493<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I received 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it from Plunkett and Leader—the land was not sold, but it is estimated to be worth 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also produce Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement (<hi rend="italic">This was dated the 5th of June, 1839, and Was partly read</hi>)—the money was paid over in Mr. Read's presence to the Bank of England—he is here and will prove it—it was exactly 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—I first obtained particulars of Josiah Downer's will within the last Three weeks, and of the marriage settlement within the last fortnight, at any Rate since the case was set down for trial here—I found out these two documents through Mr. Read's solicitor—the 505<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mentioned in the marriage settlement has never been handed over to any one, it is now in dispute—that does not relate to the Consols at all—758<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. New 31/2 per Cents. Was originally settled by the marriage settlement—that is the total Amount—I know it from the trustee himself—the endorsement relates to What is paid under the will—I also produce an office copy of Mrs. Masters's Will—it was sworn under 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the terms of that will are the beginning Of all the trouble—there purports to be a real estate passing by that will, But there is none, the prior document having directed where the real estate Should go—it does not pass under that document at all but under two other documents—the amount passing under that was 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a small amount of the plate and furniture, which was not valued, but it was sworn under 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—here is also a declaration of trust of 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., of</p>

And then 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. goes to him absolutely if he survives her—the actuaries' opinion has been given since the bankruptcy—Mr. Leader said that it would give the defendant's friends the option of purchasing, and they have offered to sell it to me for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the defendant's age is 35 I think—I think it would be a very good specula<lb/>tion for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the reason it is not worth more is that you are obliged to take one premium, and therefore it is really worth nothing at the present time—I have seen Mr. Everett repeatedly since the commencement of the prosecution—there is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year under Mr. Harrington's will; this is an office copy of it; under it the trustees are to pay Mrs. Michell 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for her separate use until certain claims on the estate are paid off, and then it is to be increased to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the balance invested for the benefit of the children, in whose favour there is a trust of the whole of the estate with the exception of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year to Mr. Michell for life on the death of his wife, subject to some very strong contingencies; he cannot charge or continue it—it is voidable in bankruptcy, but I do not think he has lost it by the present bankruptcy—I think it means bankruptcy subject to this taking effect—I have put in all the documents—I prepared Sheet G after a careful examination of all the facts Mr. Michell put before me, and after a careful examination of him as to what property he had—did not know of Joseph Downer's will or of the settlements of Francis Downer at that time—the trustee is here and he will prove that he did not know of it, it has all come out since this inquiry—whatever was given was for the wife's separate use, not subject to the control of the husband—I do not know of any other property that passed under that—the defendant also handed me this receipt for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the trustees, dated 10th December, 1878, and the original document bears the same date—I heard Mr. Everett cross-examined by Mr. Clay, and heard him deny that he had made certain state<lb/>ments to me—that denial is not true—Mr. Everett said to me that this was an improper prosecution, that he was simply trustee in the matter, that he personally considered the prosecution was not a proper one, as it was for the purpose of compelling the bankrupt's friends to come forward, and he should not have gone on if he had not been compelled by the Committee of Inspection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That took place in Guildhall Yard after Mr. Everett's examination—I knew at the time that he had no control over the prose<lb/>cution—he considered that it was an improper prosecution; that is what I said—he and I walked from the Court together; there was no one with us; this was privately spoken to me in answer to something I said to him—I have been instructing your learned friend in this matter—I have made no inquiry whatever about Keighleys—I supplied them with materials I did not suggest that he had been insolvent before—I was his solicitor first in 1876, I think—I was never concerned in paying his creditor—I never acted for him in reference to any composition—I don't think I acted for him before the beginning of 1877—I should disclose or compel a client to disclose any contingent interest in property, most decidedly—I know as a fact that the defendant did not know of this half interest—I know that no</p>

               <p>one knew it except Mr. William Downer—that was under Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement—I first had knowledge if it two or three weeks ago, and that was the same time that Michell had knowledge of it—the omission of that property from Statement G was most decidedly from ignorance—had I know it in January, 1878, I should have inserted it—the other property does not all come under the headings 1,2,3, and G—there is no mention of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is no non-disclosure except under G, which I only I known that the defendant had any interest in it in the right of his wife I should have mentioned it on the statement—I believe he gave me the fullest information in his power, and I filled it up myself—there is only one contingency, and that is of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I have written "a hundred a year, &amp;c., until he becomes bankrupt," but that does not relate to Downer; that is under Harrington's will—when he brought me this parchment and I found it was worth nil I temporarily gave him a cheque for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he promised to bring me back—he did not, but brought me this security, and asked me to get him 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it and pay myself, and I said it is not worth it—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not borrowed on the statement that it would be paid again in a day or two; it was not sent to him, it was sent to some one else—I think that was about December 30—I cannot tell whether Card stooped in 1878 or 1879; he had as early as 30th July dishonoured a cheque given to Rowley, and I say here in my books "Writing to you to take cheque up, and dishonoured cheque, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that is true—the property was really the property of Mrs. Josephine Michell's father—it had not been invested in houses, it was a very long row of freehold shops, which brought in between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it is worth 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say whether it was old Mr. Harrigton's property time out of mind but it was his before his death—under Mr. Harrington's will he takes 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I am speaking of the property at Notting Hill—it represents more than that, because she was to have 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and there was another 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay mortgages, and the remainder was to be laid out in trust—it is all to her private use and benefit; there is only a charge of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Michell on his surviving his wife—I think his saying "What a thing for me to find my property burnt down" was a very reasonable observation if it was his wife's—he had never the control of a single tenant—I knew nothing about his business affairs before he came to me to consult me about keighley having stopped and his affairs being in confusion—he did not then show me the little bank-book of the British Linen Company; if he had I should not have looked at it, because I had arranged with him to employ a professional accountant—I did not know he had an account there till I heard it at the Mansion House—the whole of the books and papers were handed to Mr. Everett, and he attended to them solely—I do not know of his having any banking account between 15th April, 1878, and 12th October, 1878, when the other account was opened.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am positively certain that the defendant knew nothing about Mr. Downer's will and Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement—he told me something about his expectations, and how they came—List G discloses 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. coming under a marriage settlement, but with no statement about bankruptcy—I prepared two office copies of the two wills, and satisfied myself by the will of Mrs. Masters that the property was bound to Mrs. Michell's separate use—at the meeting of 13th March, after the debtor's</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. That creditor was very angry—he did not say that it was a swindle, nor was it pointed out by one of the creditors that Michell had got rid of 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of indebtedness by getting his friends to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the pound, or that this was another attempt after 12 months' trading nothing of the kind was said in my hearing, and I was there the whole time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. READ</hi>. I live at 1, Earl's Court Gardens, and am a brewer, of Kensington—I am one of the exectors of the will of the late Mr. Harrington Under which Mrs. Michell has an income of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which is to be Increased to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she also has 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, which is the interest of 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—Woodbine House is let furnished for the benefit of the estate; The trustees of her father's will have taken it at 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; the rent and taxes are about 160<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, and the surplus 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. goes to Mrs. Michell under her father Mr. Harrington's will—there is a surplus to educate the children, and in the event of the mother dying, 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is left to the father for the support of the children—there is no special fund for the maintenance of the children, but it accumulates till they come of age—the property under Mr. Harrington's will consists of houses on a terrace at Notting Hill. Which are in the hands of trustees, out of the rents of which Mrs. Michell's income is paid, and the defendant's income if he survives her—on 9th July, 1878, a fire took place there, injuring two or three of the houses—they were insured, and the insurance was laid out in rebuilding them—I first heard of the fire by Mr. Michell's calling on me early one morning, and showing me the account in a daily paper—it mentioned this terrace—I have known the Michell family 40 Years, and have known Mrs. Maters very well—I know that she received the rent of the Bull Inn, at Rodenden, direct from the tenant for some Years—I did not know that there was a mortgage on the Bull Inn till July, 1879—so far as I know, Mrs. Masters was entitled to it unencumbered—I know that it was part of the property settled by Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement—Mr. William Downer and Mrs. Michell are entitled to the property on Mrs. Masters's death in moieties—I do not know the details of the marriage settlement—I never saw it till Yesterday or the day before—I know there was one—this is the first time I knew of its provisions—the copy has been lost for some time—I knew of the cottages at Westborough Green, and that Mrs. Masters received the rents of them—I thought they were hers absolutely—I did not know the provisions of Joseph Downer's will—she only had the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols for life—I did not know originally that the sum settled under Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement was 750<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know how the Bull Inn came to be included under a settlement—when Mrs. Master's died I knew that I was one of her executors—I proved the will about 22nd October, 1878—I remember the receiving from Joseph Downer's trustees the proceeds of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—I was present, at the request of Mr. William Downer, when the cheque was handed over, but I did not receive it—I think it was on 25th or 26th November, but I have nothing to fix the date—there was</p>

               <p>an arrangement by which the money was to be temporarily handed to Harrington's trustees—consent was given before it was lent to them—I did Not believe at the time I paid it that the money came under Mrs. Masters's Will; I thought it came from the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—I am executor to both Mr. Harrington and Mrs. Masters—I knew that there was a will if Joseph Downer existing before July, but I did not know the provisions of it—I Knew there were Consols under it, but having nothing to do with it I did Not interest myself in the matter—Mrs. Masters was willing that Michell Should have this money—there is no other person who is as intimate with the financial affairs of Mrs. Michell as I am—she has no brother, she is the only surviving child—I know it was intended that the Bull Inn should be sold at the end if December, 1878—I believe six months' notice had been given to the mortgagee—negotiations were proceeding for the sale as early as January, 1879—there was considerable delay in selling it on account of the missing deed, Mrs. Masters's marriage settlement—the deeds were supposed to lay with Mr. William Downer—I have had rendered to me an account of the proceeds of the sale, 855<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—certain claims were made for costs by William Downer and his London agent for about 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I dispute as trustee, And contend that I am not liable—I understand that the trustees of Michell's bankruptcy had made a claim to it—what Mr. Vanderpump said yesterday as to the relationship between Mr. Downer and Mrs. Masters is correct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was examined at the Bankruptcy Court in June, 1879—Mr. Harrington died on 18th September, 1877—Michell and Josephine Harrington have been married seven or eight Years—I was acquainted with the family most intimately—Mr. Harrington had two sons, but they both died some years ago, one quite a child—Josephine was the only child when Michell married her—you will find my name on the second appointment of trusts, on 13th August, 1873, and I have acted from that date as additional trustee—I paid her money to her and took her receipts; the money had been on mortgage, it is now invested in Consols—up to her father's death she was getting the simple dividend on 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Consols—I took the dividends and paid the whole to her every half-year—in september, 1877, a new state of things occurred. Her father died—up to that time the contingent property in Michell was 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the event of his surviving his wife—I had no notice from any one in 1873 or 1875 not to pay the money over to Michell in the event of anything happening—I was never applied to to be examined in the Bankruptcy Court about it—I was Mr. Harrington's executor—Mr. Har<lb/>rigton rington had a lease of Woodbine House, Turnham Green, which is described as the bankrupt's residence; he lived there and permitted his daughter and her husband to live with him—Mrs. Michell has two children; the whole property became vested in her for her separate use on her father's death, and if the furniture had been sold I should have had to apply the money for her use—the house is in trust under Mr. Harrington's will for the pur<lb/>pose of forming an income for Mrs. Michell free and distinct from her husband's power and control, and up to June, 1879, I permitted Mr. And Mrs. Michell to occupy the house and use the furniture—I was liable to Pay Mr. Harrington's liabilities under the trusteeship, and it is a fact that there Was 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. still to be paid off in June and July, 1879, as liabilities which Will take six or seven years to pay off—up to January, 1879, the time of the bankruptcy, I had paid Mrs. Michell her private income—she had the house and the furniture, and no rent to pay—I paid her 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter,</p>

               <p>notall at onec, but ouly as she asked for it; I paid nothing to michell—after the payment of existing liabilities I was, with Mrs. Michell's consent, to pay back the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within seven years; that was thoroughly well known to michell—the cheque for her half share of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was 493<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went with him to the Bank of England on 25th or 26th November, 1868; he cashed the cheque there and gave me the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the memorandum of December 27th shows the way I was to have the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know nothing about his having dishonoured some bills, or about his business affairs—Mrs. Masters died in July, 1878—was at the funeral; the will was read; the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not to be free from her husband's control—everything but the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was tied with the condition that she was to have the enjoyment of it as a <hi rend="italic">feme sole</hi>, as I understood, but I am not a solicitor—Michell did not apply to me to advance him 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to put into the business—I never heard of it till these proceedings—I saw him there or four times a week—he know I was the executor of Mrs. Masters's and of Mr. Harrington's wills, and the also the trustee under the original thrust of Joseph Harrington—I cannot say whether the six months' notice to the mortgagee was given of the sale of the Bull Inn—I nothing to do with that trust; Mr. William Downer managed that, and I only know what he tells me—I have said that Mrs. Michell's interest was only one half of the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that was my belief at the time—no question was put about any other property—I know nothing about the marriage settlement, I only know about the 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Console—I was asked whether there was any interest upon any other property—if the question had been asked I should have answered that there was a marriage settlement—the cottages are under the grand<lb/>father's will, which I never read, and know she became possessed of them—I thought they were vested in her absolutely—I leave the succession duties to my solicitor—I have got the 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is in Mr. Badham's hands, the trustee of Mrs. Masters, if he has not paid it into the Court of Chancery—Mrs. Michell has instructed my solicitor to claim a settlement of it—Mrs. Master had been ill eighteen months or two years, confined to her room, if not to her bed—I do not know of Michell using Card's rooms in Alderman<lb/>bury, or a room at Keighley's—I know he did something in the city—I believe this letter is in his writting—I know nothing of any affairs between Mr. Harrington and Michell—I heard that money had been lent, but I had Nothing to do with 418<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. lent in 1875—I know nothing about his affairs in 1876—it is rather an expensive house, we pay 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent—we cannot let it unfurnished, so we let it furnished—it was given up about 5th or 6th October, 1879—I did not give any portion of the rent to Michell—it is Mrs. Michell's property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I pay her the balance between the rent I pay for the House and that which I receive—I attended Mrs. Masters's funeral—I was not present when the will was read, but it was read over to me privately by Mr. Downer—I know that Mrs. Masters possessed an interest in cottages at Wisborough Green, and also in the Bull Inn—I had no reason for not mentioning that Michell has often asked me when the property was to be sold—he asked me in November and December, 1878—Mrs. Masters re<lb/>ceived 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and there was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. ground rent and property tax deducted—all the surplus goes to pay the mortgage, amounting to about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—it will be finally paid off in six or seven years, but the interest will be decreas<lb/>ing—I have not gone strictly into figures.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Farmers' Arms; Stratford—on 3rd December about 3 p.m. the prisoner came in, and at the same time a man who I have seen in custody this week came into the other compart<lb/>ment—a little cripple on crutches named Winter, who is there everything day, was there, and Mr. Williams, who belongs to the Great Eastern Railway, came in some time after the prisoner—nobody was in bar but me—I served the other man with two of ginger-brandy, and the prisoner with two pennyworth of port wine; he then asked for a threepenny cigar—the cigars were kept in a glass at the back of the bar on the each other side of the door where the gold is kept, and there is cabinet work on each side of the door—the other man was nearly opposite where the cigars were, oppsite where the gold is kept for change in a small grog glass—I showed the prisoner the cigars, he took one, and while he was smoking it he said "These are vary nice cigars, but they are hardly in season." and asked me to feel them—I put my left hand across the bar and said I thought they were all right—after he had finished that he had another two of port wine and another cigar—during the time he was smoking they both went out for a minute or two, and both returned into their separate compartments—it is about 7 feet 6 inches form where the other man stood outside the bar to the place where the glass was—on their coming back I served the prisoner with two more of port wine and another cigar, but although it was a cold day the other man only had two of ginger-brandy, and did not smoke—they when out twice—I did not serve the second cigar, the barmaid served it, as I went out of the bar for five minutes—the prisoner tried to draw my attention in several ways; he asked me to give him a sheet of paper to write an address on, and he turned his back to me, looking out at the window on tiptoe—he said "who is over at 64? is Mr. willoughby? the place with the red curtains"—I did not take the trouble to look at the curtains, but the cripple and Williams recommended him to go to the next street, where a Mr. Willoughby lived—if I had looked out my back would have been to the other bar—I left the bar in charge of my wife, and she left if in charge of the barmaid—I was not absent five minutes; I hard my wife shout, and when I came back both man had bolted—I rushed into the street, but saw nobody—I informed the police an hour afterwards—before the man went out they looked very knowingly at one another, they gave a quick glance—I was afterwards taken to worship street to a room with a lot of men—I was asked if I saw anybody I knew,</p>

               <p>and picked out the prisoner immediately from about 25—I went before the Grand Jury on Tuesday and after that I saw the second man, and gave him in charge—he was remanded to Ilford—a half-sovereign was taken from my place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> After I had the half-sovereign and the glass stolen I gave information to the police at Strarford, and about 10 days afterwards one of the detectives said that there was a man in custody at Worship Street who answered the description and would I go up—his name is Lloyd—I accompanied him there—he did not go into the room with me where the man were; one of the officers of the Court, a police officer, took me in—it was a small room and it was full—there were any in plain colthes—I did not know any of them—I knew perfectly well what I went in for—trousers on, but my impression was that there were some detectives there—I have a notion where Cambridge Road is; I should say it is about three miles off, it may be only a mile and a half—I do a pretty good business—I have three compartments—I did not see the half-sovereign and the glass taken, but I saw the person who was attested for stealing it at Stratford Police-court yesterday morning before the Magistrate—he was remanded till Sturday and I believe he is at Ilford—I have identified him as the person who was there at the time we lost the money, and I am sure be is the man—the prisoner was in the house about an hour—he came in about 2.40. into the compartment on the left-hand side, where there was a fire—I was behind the bar alone—the two men came in at the same time, within a second.</p>
               <p>

I gave for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver—that only left a half-sovereign, which I missed when I came back and found the glass on the floor outside the har, just agaiust the door—the prisoner came in where we had a fire, and the cripple was in the same compartment sitting by the fire, and Williams was there—the wooden partiton between the compartments is 6 feet high—the third compartment is a little passage—the priosner kept on the move continually he did not sit down at all, and he was always on the talk—a man at one bar can see a man at the other bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter by trade, and live at 42, Baleman Street, Deptford—I have known Stephens for about four years—I was formerly manager of a running ground at St. Helena Gardens, Rotherhithe—during that time Stephens was in the habit of coming there to run—he told me that he was something in the chemist's line—after that I lost sight of him for about three years till last November, when I met him at St. Helena Gardens again, and I undertook to train him for a race that was to take place in january—no particular arrangement was made between us as to how I was to be paid—he did not come to me; I went to him at his house in Theobald Street, New Kent Road—he first took me there to show me where I should call for him every morning; that was in November—I was to call for him, and take him, and take him to the Lambeth Baths to train him—he said 'I shall soon move from here, as there are so many <hi rend="italic">D's</hi>, meaning detectives,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188001120133"/>
               <p>coming to live about here"—I thought that a strange remark to make—I called for him every morning—on Monday, 1st December, as we were walking up the road from his house we met Harbord—that was not the first time I had seen him; I had seen him once before at St. Helena Gardens in November, where I was four years ago—I knew he was a com<lb/>panion of Stephens—there was another man speking with Harbord when we met him, and that man went on one side, and took Stephens on one side, and had some conversation—he then came back to Harbord, and the other man went away—Stephens said to Harbord "What do you think, he offered me 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen for them bottles that are worth 96<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen"—Harbord made some reply which I did not catch—we walked up the road, Harbord and the third man left us at the Elephant and Castle, and Stephens and I went on to the Lambeth Baths to train—while we were there Harbord came, and had a little conversation with Stephens—I did not hear what it was—we then all three left—in consequence of what had occurred on this day I went to try and see Inspector Phillips at Greenwich, him—on Tuesday morning I called at Stephens's house as usual; he showed me a bottle of pepsine, and said "This is one of the bottles that that man offered me the 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozzen for"—I looked at the bottle, and saw the name of Morson on it—he also showed me a bottle of castor-oil or something to that effect—we then went out together, and called for Harbord at his house in some buildings called the Palatinate in New Kent Road—I stayed at the corner, Stephens went to the house, and Harbord came with him, and joined me, and we went on to the Baths, but Harbord left us again at the Elephant and Castle—after I had done training Stephens that day I parted from him, and went to Morson's, the chemist's, in Southtmpton Row—I saw Mr. Morson, and made a communication to him, and they telegraphed for Mr. Phillips—on the following day, Wednesday, the 3rd, I again called at Stephen's house—Harbord was there, and we three left together—when we got outside, Harbour left us—as we were walking along, Stephens said "I cannot go to the baths to-day, as I have got to go and meet a pal of mine in Holbourn, of the name of mott, to get some morphin, he works at Morson's," and in further conversation he said "We have got another pal, a night-watchman at Messers. May and Baker's. Battersea, where we can get red pri<lb/>cipitate and white calomel"—I said "How do you manage to get get it?"—he said "We get it when the police are changing between nine and 10 o'clock" that was all he said then—I left him—Iwent to his house in the evening, and he gave me a bottle of pepsine as a sample, and asked me if I would try and sell some—I took it away and showed it to Inspector Philips; that was not far off—next day, Thursday, I called on him again—I gave him back the bottle, and told him I thought I could sell some—he said "I shall be frightened to have anything to do with it, as the <hi rend="italic">D's</hi> turned my pal Mott over yesterday, and, as luck would have it, he had nothing on him, as there is not a night that he comes out but, as a rule, he brings something, little or much; now we will let it lay by for three or four months, till it gets blown over, as we have cleared everything out with respect to that"—we then left the house; Stephens put a bottle of pepsine in his pocket, and a bottle of pepsine lozenges—as we were going along, he said he was quite at a standstill for money, and could not go on with his training—he said "You can have any amount of red precipitate and white calomel, as we can get any amount</p>

               <p>of it; we have already filled up our customers"—we walked up to Harbord's house, and he left me at the corner a few doors away—he returned to me, and brought me a sample of red precipitate and white calomel; there was a very small amount, a little sample, in separate papers—he gave them to me, and said "These are samples"—Harbord had come out, and was standing by—we then all three walked down the road together—something was said about the price, and how much they could get by to-morrow morning, Friday; this was Thursday evening—Stephens said they would go to Batter-Bea that evening, to Messrs. May and Baker's—Harbord said "I don't know how much we shall be able to get you to-morrow morning, as I do not know whether Tom will let us have two or three runs or not"—we walked up and down the road—Stephens could not go to the baths that day, because they Were shut up, and an arrangement was made about the morning—Harbord said he did not think they would require a cart, as they would manage to get just as much as they could nicely carry, but by Monday they could manage to get between two and three cwt.—I said "Well, it was arranged that 1 should meet them on Friday morning at the Waterloo station at 8.30 with what they could bring—they said they left the stuff at a place at Battersea, but they did not say where; I can't exactly say which said that, it was in con<lb/>versation—they said they were to give a shilling a pound for it—on this occasion Harbord told me about the Greenwich affair—he said "We were charged at Greenwich last summer with having the same sort of stuff in our possession one night as we were going home, we were remanded for a week, but I talked to the Magistrate like a lawyer, and we regularly gulled the police by telling them that it was white lead; old Francis the detective got into the witness-box, and asked the Magistrate to keep it for another fortnight, and on the very day the fortnight was up we went and fetched it away; we sold it"—I told Inspector Phillips of the appointment I had made for the Friday morning—I went that morning about 8.30, just outside the station—Inspector Phillips was there and a police-sergeant—Stephens came out from the station alone—I said "Where is Harbord?"—he said "He is not quite so quick as I am"—the police then came forward and took Stephens into custody—he was carrying a black bag—I did not see Harbord come up; I went away at once as soon as the police took Stephens.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The St. Helena Gardens have been closed on several occasions since I have been away from them—I don't know the reason of their being closed; it was after I left—Harbord told me that he had worked for May and Baker—they told me the watchman's name was Tom King—I gave information to Inspector Phillips because I thought there was some<lb/>thing wrong—when Stephens said "I shall soon move from here because of the D.'<hi rend="italic">s</hi>" I thought it was a curious remark for a respectable young man to make; that sort of opened my eyes—it may have been a fortnight after Wards that I gave information to the police; it was in November—I did not do so before because I did not know as a fact that there was anything wrong—I had my suspicion—I went to Morson's on 2nd December; thats was when I really knew that there must be something wrong—I did not know know before that that they had these bottles—I knew they were speaking concerning bottles on the Monday, but I did not know for a fact that they bad any till 2nd December—that was when I went to inspector Phillips, and he was not in; I did not go to some other person—I thought I would wait for him; I thought I should like to have his information first—I</p>

               <p>knew there was an Inspector Phillips at Greenwich—I had never spoken to him before to my knowledge—I won't swear I had not; I may have spoken to him perhaps once before: nut to my recollection—I knew nothing about the prisoners having been charged last June with having chemicals in their possession till the Wednesday or Thursday, when they told me with their own lips about it; that I swear—Stephens did not tell me About it before I went to Inspector Phillips—I don't beleive he told me before Wednesday; I won't swear it—I was nut expecting to get some<lb/>thing out of this from the police; I swear I did nut expect one farthing if the prisoners are convicted I do not expect to get anything—I did it because I thought it my duty; because I did not think it safe to be in their company—I did not know that Stephens worked at a jam manu<lb/>facturer's—I will swear that Harbord said they were going to May feud Baker's at Battersea to get the stuff—I said so at the police-court, and also that he said they had gulled the police—I may not have said "gulled," but I believe I said a word amounting to that—I mentioned at the police-court about Tom the night watchman—I told the police of it, and left them to act—I was to have given 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound for each article, calomel and red precipitate, whichever they could get—I did not taste the pepsin, I only saw the label on the bottle.</p>

I am a member of the firm of May an Baker—when the communication was made to us by the police on 5th December I looked at our stock of Calomel to see how much was missing, and I missed about 100lb. in weight; the value of it roughly would be about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have looked at this stuff, and in my judgment it is our manufacture, unfinished—you can get from Battersea, where our premises are, to the Waterloo Station by railway.</p>

He left me on London Bridge, and as he did not come back in an hour I wandered along Thames Street and I fell asleep. I went along the Wands-worth Road, and the constable came and asked me what I had got, and I told him a man had given me something to drink, and I felt very tired and I lost myself.</p>

I went with Puttick and Reed to 93, Trafalgar Street—the landlady pointed out the back kitchen and a small room upatairs as occupied by the prisoner and his wife and children—I found nothing upstairs, but in the kitchen I found a small packet, what I believe to be plaster-of-Paris, that is used in coining; also some small pieces of white metal, which appeared to be the chippings or overflow of moulds—there were splashes of white metal on the fender, and also on the cocoa-nut matting in front of the fire—this piece of an old mould defaced was lying near the fire—I found a large quantity of broken moulds in the dust-hole—they were scattered throughout the dust-bin—the frac<lb/>tures were old—they must have been accumulating several weeks by the quantity of dust—here is one bearing the impression of a shilling, and lour others and half-crowns—I also found four moulds in the yard about a foot below the surface of the ground in a piece of dirty rag and quite warm—here are two for shillings and a doable mould for sixpences—next morning I found a considerable quantity of white metal on the front of the prisoner's trousers and a small portion on his boots—he said "I am working at Blackfriars Bridge; a man gave me this money yesterday, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I showed them to a lad who called for me to-night, and he must have put the police on to me"—after the charge was read over to him he said "The lad and another man brought them to me yesterday; they were both together" but when he became aware that we had found the moulds he said "Yes, I know they were there; they gave them to me last night at the Elephant and Castle and asked me to take care of them, and I put them in the dust-hole."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The landlord did not tell me that they were in the dust-hole, nor was I told.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Snow, of 90, Trafalgar Street, Walworth—the prisoner and his wife occupied the back kitchen and a bedroom upstairs; they have been there about 10 weeks—he went by the name of Jepson—his wife did Dot come until about a fortnight after him—they had two children—I used to go into the kitchen frequently for water, but noticed nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> No one washed there but you—you used to turn the mangle for me there—you worked Clapham Common way and on Black<lb/>friars Bridge—you were always home early of an evening.</p>

               <p>they are the worst I have ever met with—one of them has been tried, but the <hi rend="italic">get</hi> is so bad that using it would account for the overflow of the metal which was found, and that would also account for the bad im<lb/>pressions—the coins fit the moulds, but I cannot say that they came out of them because they are so badly taken—the other three moulds have not been used—here are three bad shillings, but not out of those moulds—they are so bad I cannot say whether they are all from one mould—this is part of a mould for half-crowns—this plaster-of-Paris is for making the moulds—this is lampblack, which is used for blacking the coins over after they come out from the battery; they are then wrapped up separately; the object of it is to deaden them—this metal is the same kind as the coins are made of, and it may have been in the using of that mould that it went there.</p>
