A little after four in the morning, on the 5th of this instant, I awaked, and heard a noise at the door; I went down into the cellar, which also is a warehouse, and there I observed this piece of cheque was removed from off a counter and laid under the grating; there was a pane of glass broke in the window. (Producing the cheque.)</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property is it?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. It is the property of Mr. Berverdsell, my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where it lay the day before?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. I saw it on the counter when I shut up shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. I stood in the cellar and saw the prisoner and another man pass the grate several times. There came a butcher's man and pitch'd his basket, then they walk'd off; after he was gone they appeared at the grate again. Then they put down this stick, with a hook tied to it (producing it ) and hook'd the piece up to the grating.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them hook'd it up?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. The prisoner was the man that hook'd it up, and the other man cut the string, with which it was tied-round, and it fell down again under the area of the grate; we have two doors, one opens into Cateaton-Street, and the other into Lawrence-Lane. I went up and opened that in Lawrence-Lane. They had just past the door, going towards King-Street. Then I shut the door and watched<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130003"/> their coming, knowing if they put their hook down the grating I should hear them. I soon heard them at it. I went out at the door, and the other person was on the watch, who call'd to the prisoner. I went and laid hold on the prisoner when he was within two yards of the grate, and took his hook from him; he beg'd I would let him go. I brought him in at the door and rang the bell, and the other two men came down; we got a constable and took him to the compter. He was examined before Sir

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. Last Tuesday was a week, about a quarter before five, the porter call'd. I got up, and from the window I saw him drawing the prisoner to the door. I came down; he told me he had seen him attempting to take away a piece of cheque from the warehouse. I call'd up the other man, and sent him for a constable. I went to the grating and saw this piece of cheque lying underneath on the ground, and the window was broke belonging to the warehouse or cellar. I ask'd the prisoner how he could go to do such a thing; he said it was the first time, and he did it for want, and pray'd heartily that we would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that window whole over night?</p>

               <p>Q. to Tharlfa. Did you see the window over night?</p>
               <p>Tharlfa. I did, and it was not broke then; it was one large pane that was broke out the next morning.</p>
               <p>Humphry Deacon. I am an apprentice to the prosecutor. Mr. Kettle call'd me up about half an hour before five. I came down stairs, the porter had got hold of the prisoner in the passage, and I was told he had been attempting to steal a piece of cheque out of the cellar. I went and saw it lying out of the paper, under the grating. I had laid that very piece on the counter in the cellar before, and saw it there over night, I went for a constable, and the prisoner was committed.</p>

               <p>Letitia Green. She absconded, I found her and asked her about it; she own'd she took it, and said she had sold it to a woman that was gone to Cambridge. I never found it since.</p>

            . The prisoner lives at Kendal-house, in the parish of Isleworth. In the year 1756, about October, he came to the Coach and Horses at Isleworth and sent for me; I went. He wanted me to get some fish to put into his ponds. After that he and I had some discourse at the Watermen's-Arms, where were the prisoner Hanson and Norton. We sat in a little box and had some steaks; our conversation was only about fish. Graham desired me to get him some fish to put into his ponds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any sort of fish?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I can't say he did, only fish in general.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it understood that you was to get them ?</p>
               <p>Rowley. From out of Twickenham-Common ponds. He was to give us 9 d. per pound for all killable fish, and the other lesser fish were to be put into his ponds behind his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was this proposal made to?</p>
               <p>Rowley. To Hanson, Norton, and myself. We went down to his own house about that time, and then he wanted us to go and rob the earl of Bath's ponds.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was this?</p>
               <p>Rowley. It was before we came to action, in getting any fish.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to work to get fish?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I believe on the 2d of March last. He sent for me to come to his house then, about the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make use of the word rob?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I believe he did. He entertained me with some cold leg of pork. He bid me go to the Rose and Crown, and there I should have as much strong beer as I could drink; I did go, but not then, for then I was not acquainted with Hanson; he desired me to get fish at my lady Varney's pond, and sent me a letter to my house by his man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I'll save the court a good deal of trouble; I wrote it. (The letter produced.)</p>
               <p>Rowley. I was not at home when it came, but when I came home my wife read it to me; was it read over I should know it again.</p>

               <p>March 27, 1757,</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you understand that letter?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I understood by it, that having so many times ask'd me to get fish, it was to spur me up to go and get some; but I could not tell where to get any.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do next?</p>
               <p>Rowley. The first action of this sort was, we went to Twickenham-Common, that was, I believe, the 10th of April; the next was at my lord Vere's at Hanworth, that was either the 14th or 15th of April; we took a horse and cart from Mr. Graham's, which was left there on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you ?</p>
               <p>Rowley.

             did. We went out about nine at night, with some hay or straw in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this with Graham's knowledge ?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130005"/>Rowley. It was. We told him we wanted straw to keep the fish alive, we also took a wicker basket or flasket of Mr. Graham's, to put the fish in; we got to Hounslow between nine and ten, and had two pints of hot at the White-Bear there, and staid a little, because we thought it was not late enough; I believe we got to the pond a little after ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the situation of the pond.</p>
               <p>Rowley. The pond is betwixt two houses, in the back street of Hanworth town, within about a quarter of a mile of the park side, or thereabouts; we put the cart and horse on the side of the road, at the distance of about twenty-five or thirty yards from the pond, and gave him some hay; then we took the nets and put them into the pond, and went about half way round, where we found a great root or limb of a tree in the middle of the pond; Hanson pull'd off his cloaths, went in and pull'd it on shore, till such time as I could get hold of it; then I drag'd it on shore. After that we got the net out with a pretty quantity of fish. There were about twenty-two brace of carp and tench together; there were also about one dozen and a half of perch. We put them all into the wicker basket. Then we saw a woman open a door and look out with a light, and a man on the other side; then I said to Hanson, bear a hand quick. We put them into the cart upon the straw, which he brought to the place while I was getting the fish out. Then we drove away to Hounslow, and so to the prisoner's house, at about two in the morning; there was nobody to receive them, so we put them into Mr. Graham's stews, according as he had ordered us; he came down about six o'clock. Then we went to weighing the fish with his stilliards. We had seven store carp, which we put into his pond; I can't be particular as to the largeness. The killable fish we put into his stews, according to his order, where they may be catch'd in a quarter of an hour's time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the fish weigh?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I can't tell, nor how much money we received; I know we did not receive it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing to you as to the better management of the fish, when he was not present?</p>
               <p>Rowley. He ordered us to come to the Park a private way, because we had like to have been blown, and he shew'd us a well concealed, in which to put the fish; he put a stick down it, and I remember he said it was a pretty convenient place to put a bastard child in.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I am a fisherman.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not the prisoner buy and sell fish?</p>
               <p>Rowley. He has for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not advertised to buy fish, honestly come by?</p>
               <p>Rowley. He did that for a blind to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that pond advertised to have been rob'd?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I don't know it was advertised; there was a rumour that it had been rob'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Graham come to you soon after and call you to an account where you got this fish, and say he hoped you had not them from thence ?</p>
               <p>Rowley. No, he did not; I went to him, and told him a man told me my lord Vere's pond had been rob'd. He said, he hoped I did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you give him?</p>
               <p>Rowley. He said further, '' Why had you not '' taken the poker and beat his brains out, had '' he came to me I would? If you have done any '' thing amiss more than you can answer, you must '' take care of yourself.''</p>

               <p>Q. How can you tell that this pond is my lord Vere's property?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I can't tell that it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the price of carp per pound?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I believe about 9 d. per pound; but he had all the killable and store fish at the same price.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you buy carp of a common fisherman, fit to come to a gentleman's table, for 9 d. per pound?</p>
               <p>Rowley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the price of tench and perch?</p>
               <p>Rowley. They are worth 18 d. per pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever mention my lord Vere's pond to you?</p>
               <p>Rowley. No, never; he said in general, any ponds where we could, and said he had as much right, on the waste as the earl of Northumberland had.</p>
               <p>Q. What could you have sold those fish for at market?</p>
               <p>Rowley. There were some worth three or four shillings a brace.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him they were stolen fish?</p>
               <p>Rowley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether on the 15th of April it was not excessive cold weather ?</p>
               <p>Rowley. It was very frosty.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130006"/>Q. Why did you carry the fish in the night time ?</p>
               <p>Rowley. For fear any body should see us, and we had nets kept at Mr. Graham's conceal'd on purpose; and it was usual with us to have the horse and cart at his house ready.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever charge you any thing for the keeping of the horse?</p>
               <p>Rowley. No, not a farthing. He sent Hanson to rent the river of the earl of Northumberland on purpose to blind the thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you apprehended for this ?</p>
               <p>Rowley. I heard I was to go before justice Birkhead. I was sent for, and I went and made a confession free and voluntary, the same as now.</p>

            . In the beginning of April last Mr. Graham sent his servant for me. I went, and he desired me to go a fishing for him, he said he'd get another to go with me to carry the net; I told him I was afraid to go, he said I had no occasion at all to be afraid. I ask'd him where I was to go, he said upon Smallberry Green, and I was to take my horse and cart.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose mannor is that ?</p>
               <p>Hanson. My lord of Northumberland's mannor. I went home again, and the next day he sent for me again, and said he could get no body, and desired me to get somebody at the mill to go with me. I went there, but the men appear'd to be in liquor, so it was put off till he got Rowley to go with me. Then he sent for Rowley and me, and we were both at his house together the next day, which was the 9th of April. Rowley and I went to Twickenham Common, and brought some fish from thence to the prisoner's house. The next time we went out was two or three days after, when we went to Hanworth; he told us he would give us 9 d. per pound for all killable fish, carp, tench, perch, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any mention made by the prisoner of Hanworth ?</p>
               <p>Hanson. No; not as I know of. I had left my horse and cart at Graham's house from the first action, and when we went to Hanworth I took them and a basket, and some straw and the net, from Graham's house. We set out a little after nine at night. Graham said he'd leave the gate open for us, that we might go backwards to his stews with the fish, and bid us take our own time as we thought proper. He also shew'd us the gate, that we should not mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention your going in the night?</p>
               <p>Hanson. He did; we went thro' Hounslow about a quarter before ten, or it might be ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know in what manner you were to get the fish ?</p>
               <p>Hanson. He did, he bid us get them where we could on the waste, but he told us of one pond in particular, that was the earl of Bath's.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to Hanworth ?</p>
               <p>Hanson. Between ten and eleven, it was very dark, but the people were not all gone to bed; we stopt (leaving the cart at a distance) and had some beer, and went to look at the pond; there is a farm-house joining to it, and we saw a man with some horses in a stable; then we went to the cart, and when things grew quiet we brought the cart within about thirty or forty yards of the pond; then we took the net, and carried it to the pond, and drew it till we came about the middle, where we met with a tree; then I pull'd off my cloaths and drew the tree out of the pond, and then we drew the net to shore. Going to take the fish out we perceiv'd a light at a little house near, so we put the fish into the wicker basket, and into the cart. There were carp, tench and perch; we went away with them to Kendal house where the prisoner lives, and carried them thro' the gate he had shew'd us, and put them in the stews as he directed, some in the basket, and the perch in a sack. We came there just before two o'clock, the clock struck two as we were hanging up the nets.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did Graham pay for them?</p>
               <p>Hanson. He paid me at the rate of 9 d. per pound for them all, but paid nothing for the store fish, which we put into the ponds. We saw him about six in the morning, he made a sort of a smile when he saw the fish, and said you have met with them to night somewhere.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him where you had them?</p>
               <p>Hanson. No, we did not, he never ask'd us.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of you weigh'd the fish?</p>
               <p>Hanson. I held up the stilliards, and Graham look'd at the notches, they were his own stilliards; he separated the killable fish before we weigh'd them.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I did not ask him whether they had rob'd my lord Vere's pond or not, after I had read the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Hanson. No, he never ask'd that question till we heard of it ourselves, when our hearts misgave us, and we ask'd him if the nets and things were safe out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him you had rob'd any other ponds?</p>
               <p>Hanson. Yes we did, but we did not tell him what particular ponds, he knew we went to the ponds for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130007"/>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>Hanson. I am a poulterer, and go about the country to sell poultry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell fish?</p>
               <p>Hanson. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you was afraid, pray what was you afraid of?</p>
               <p>Hanson. I was afraid to go a fishing where he told us.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Rowley tell you he had a brother that had got a pond by his house on Twickenham Common, and you might go and fish in that?</p>
               <p>Hanson. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Mr. Graham you had purchased a pond of fish for a hundred and fifty pounds?</p>
               <p>Hanson. That was what Mr. Graham said himself, in order to blind his servants.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this talk'd of, before or after you had rob'd ponds?</p>
               <p>Hanson. After we had rob'd ponds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear people had a right to fish on commons that have a right of commonage?</p>
               <p>Hanson. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q How came you to go to Hanworth ?</p>
               <p>Hanson. We were informed there were fish there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever heard of that pond before?</p>
               <p>Hanson. No, never, neither was I ever at it before.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether or no I did not tell you the bad consequence of robbing ponds, and that if you offer'd to go to gentlemens ponds it would be a very bad affair.</p>
               <p>Hanson. No, you never gave me any such account; if you had, that would have given me a caution not to have gone to my lord Bath's pond in his garden at Twickenham.</p>

Rowley doubled it with an oath, and said he had not; master said, if you have robbed any ponds that are in pales or inclosures, it is a hanging matter. Rowley doubled it with an oath again, and said he knew nothing of the matter.</p>

               <p>Q. In what capacity?</p>
               <p>M. Newman. As a cook, and on the 10th fish were brought in. I have myself brought the stilliards to weigh fish.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of fish?</p>
               <p>M. Newman. Tench, carp, and eels, from time to time a great many times. I know these two men, Rowley and Hanson, have brought fish, and they have weighed it in the day-time, after the family was up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe your master would have bought any fish, if he had known them to have been stolen?</p>

               <p>Fenn. We serve gentlemen all the way, as far as Oxford. I have sold carp to Mr. Graham for 9 d. per pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell him tench?</p>
               <p>Fenn. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. At what per pound?</p>
               <p>Fenn. At 16 d. that is, small or middling.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call small?</p>
               <p>Fenn. That is, two pounds, or three pounds and a half a fish.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you sell the large carp at per pound?</p>
               <p>Fenn. We have a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they properly killable fish, which you sell at 9 d. a pound?</p>
               <p>Fenn. They are; if they lie ten years they will never be any bigger.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the common price in the country?</p>
               <p>Fenn. We have sometimes 9 d. sometimes 10 d. and sometimes 1 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they well-fed fish, that you sell at 9 d. per pound?</p>
               <p>Fenn. Yes, sit for any gentleman's table in the world; as good at a pound and half size, as any size.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you serv'd Mr. Graham?</p>
               <p>Fenn. I have serv'd him about eight years. I never sold him any but I gave him a receipt for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have you them from?</p>
               <p>Fenn. I rent about 200 acres of water of lord Onslow, in Surry; my brother rents 300 a year. He buys and sells fish all over the counties of Surry, Sussex, Berkshire, and Hampshire. We stock the water ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What! rivers, or ponds ?</p>
               <p>Fenn. Ponds.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What is a fine perch worth a pound ?</p>
               <p>Fenn. That is according as markets be, sometimes not worth 8 d. and sometimes half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never above half a crown ?</p>
               <p>Fenn. I never had 2 s. and 9 d. for a pound of perch in my life; we often charge 18 d.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you sell a tench for a pound?</p>
               <p>Fenn. I have sold the prisoner tench for 16 d. a pound, small ones; some weigh'd half a pound, and some three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What will a tench of fifteen inches weigh?</p>
               <p>Fenn. Some of that length will weigh three pounds, and some not a pound and a half. They are worth, according as markets be, sometimes 25 s. and sometimes not half a crown a brace. I have sold a brace for 15 s. and I have known others sell a brace for a guinea and a half.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came to my shop for, I believe, about a fortnight together, not every day, but occasionally; the first time of his coming, I think he laid out in books about sixteen or seventeen shillings, and the second time twenty-four shillings, and paid for them. After he had been several times at my house Mr. Darbyshire, who lives in Wych-Street, and is a bookbinder and bookseller, came to me and ask'd me if I had not lost some books. I said, none that I knew of. He said he had seen several amongst a parcel, which a person offered to sell for twenty-five pounds, or guineas, amongst which he thought some were mine, and that they were at the person's lodgings, at the back of St. Clement's. He went away, and I did not look, not missing any; but he having mention'd Miscellanea Curiosa I began with the octavo's to search, thinking those most likely to be taken away. I missed my Lord Clarendon's History of the Rebellion, and in searching on I missed many others; then I sent for Mr. Darbyshire, and he came. I asked him if he remember'd seeing Lord Clarendon's History. He said he did. Then I got a search warrant from justice Fielding, and went to the prisoner's lodgings, where I found all the books that I had missed, and several which I had not then missed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find all that are mentioned in the indictment?</p>
               <p>Baker. I did, in the prisoner's lodgings. (Produced in court.) These are all my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever sell any of these to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Baker. No, never.</p>

               <p>

               <p>Q. Where were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Baker. They were taken from out of my shop. There never was any money accounted to me for them, and I believe my servants can clear themselves from any suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Baker. I live in York-Street, Covent Garden. When we went to search the prisoner's lodgings, at the back of St. Clement's, he was very ill in bed. I charged him with taking the books, and said I was very much concerned to see a gentleman in his situation of life guilty of such an action, as he was seemingly going into his grave. He wanted to speak with me by myself. I said I had nothing at all to say to him, but he must go before the justice; but he seeming extremely ill, I did not care to take him out of his bed, so I went to Mr. Fielding to know if he might he in his lodgings all night. The justice told me I must have somebody with him, so I gave a man two shillings to sit up with him. The next morning I carried him before the justice, who ask'd me if the books were mine. I said they were, and that I had neither sold nor lent them. There being six volumes in large paper, I could not conceive how he conveyed them away; and according to the number of times, of his being in my shop, he must have taken a dozen at a time. I said to the constable he used to come in a great coat, pray look on the inside of it. He turn'd it out, and there we saw a pocket on each side; the whole lining seem'd to be pockets, in which he might have taken away a bushel of books almost at a time. He was asked then how he came by the books. He said, 'I do ' acknowledge them to be Mr. Baker's books, and ' he has them again, and if he requires any other ' restitution in the world, I am ready to give it him' I told him that he had done an action that had subjected him to the law, and he must take his trial.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Baker; I remember the prisoner being at our shop six or seven times, and the two first times that he came he had no great coat on. He had one on the third time. He then walk'd round the shop and look'd at the books.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay that time?</p>
               <p>Lankford. I really can't say how long. I remember the second time he came, he was going out of the shop as I was coming in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him to meddle with any books the third time he was there?</p>
               <p>Lankford. He took some down from the sholves to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put them up again?</p>
               <p>Lankford. I did not observe that. I had no suspicion of him, he having bought books of us before; I can't say as to his taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the books that were found in his lodgings?</p>
               <p>Lankford. I did. I was there, and all the books that we brought away I can swear to be Mr. Baker's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever sell the prisoner any of these books, here produced?</p>
               <p>Lankford. Upon my oath I never did, neither to him nor any body else; I never sold the prisoner any books. He bought two parcels of books, but he paid Mr. Baker for one, and the apprentice for the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all these books in the prisoner's lodgings?</p>
               <p>Lankford. I did; there are both master's mark and mine upon most of the books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Darbyshire. I am a book-binder and bookseller, these books here produc'd were offer'd to me to sell, particularly the history of the Rebellion by Lord Clarendon, in large octavo, by the prisoner, at his lodgings on the backside of St. Clement's. He ask'd me twenty-five guineas for the parcel; there were two or three hundred vols. these and many others. I told him they would not suit me. I had a suspicion they were stolen. Then I went to Mr. Slater, one of our business, and told him what I had seen; and he told me he suspected the prisoner was a thief, he had alter'd some books for him.</p>
               <p>Q. How alter'd them?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. In making them that were light more dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know these were Mr. Baker's books, did you bind any of them for him?</p>
               <p>Darbyshire. No, I did not bind any of them. I found Mr. Baker had sold him some books by my describing him, so I ask'd him if he did not miss any, and told him my suspicion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You seem to be very unjust and malicious in your representations, and have carried it on all along in such a manner, that right or wrong I must be accused of felony by your means.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have got my defence on a bit of paper, I hope the court will indulge me to read it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130011"/>Court. That you may.</p>
               <p>He reads.</p>
               <p>Whereas Mr. Baker, bookseller, in Covent-Garden, has accused me as guilty of stealing some books out of his shop, and having prosecuted me for a robbery on that account, it has thrown me into a horrid dungeon, where I am almost strip'd of all the necessaries of life, and am reduced to such a state of bodily weakness, that I can hardly stand upon my legs, and have been so spunged of the little money I had, that I have scarce any left wherewith to support myself, by which means I am quite disabled from having an attorney at law to act as my counsellor, having nothing to pay for his usual fees, wherefore I must offer the following defence for myself, which I shall submit to the worshipful judge and the honourable members of the jury.</p>
               <p>And first I desire it may be consider'd that I bought a parcel of books of Mr. Baker, for which I paid him the full value in cash, and he having sent his boy along with me to carry them to my room, it seems some of his books were mix'd with them, which Mr. Baker being invidiously inform'd of, he came and found them in my custody, and thereupon founded his process of felony against me; but how this should have happened I can't conjecture, unless it has been thro' a mistake, and inadvertently owing to a defect of my eye-sight; and if this was really the case, me thinks it was sufficient to excuse the matter to Mr. Baker, if he had been disposed to treat me with the smallest degree of candour, but it seems he was determined to prosecute me with the greatest virulence; and indeed he seems in this whole affair to have acted from a principle of revenge, and to have been impatiently thirsting for my blood, so that nothing less would satisfy his malicious resentment than that my life should be made a sacrifice to his revenge. This methinks will be sufficiently apparent if it be consider'd, that when justice Fielding seemed disposed to mitigate the matter, Mr. Baker (sir'd with rage) attempted to corrupt his mind, and to bring him under the deepest prejudice against me, by suggesting to him that about ten years ago a Scotch clergyman having been found pilfering books at London, he made no doubt but I was the same man; a malicious aspersion this, purely of his own invention, on purpose to slur my character as far as slander and calumny could go. Had I intended to deal as uncharitably with Mr. Baker as he has dealt with me, I might have prosecuted him for committing a robbery against me, by carrying off several books from my room, under a pretence of securing his own property, which I could have proved to be mine by particular receipts under the hands of those booksellers of whom I bought those books; but I thought myself oblig'd to interpret his conduct with more charity than to impute it to an intention of robbery, but russes to a mistake; and to convince you of the unexampled malice of that insinuation of Mr. Baker's to justice Fielding, I would desire you to consider that it not seven years since I was in London before, where I preach'd the Gospel in most of the Presbyterian meetinghouses with universal acceptance, and under as fair a character as any minister in London; and before that time I had officiated as a minister of the church of Scotland above eight years, with great approbation, and am still of an unreproachable character, as appears by the ample credentials I received from the Presbytery to whom I belonged, and which I carried along with me to America, where I preach'd the Gospel for the space of ten years, in most of the British provinces and islands, with the greatest marks of honour and esteem, as a minister of the best character.</p>
               <p>Now I appeal to you, gentlemen, whether it is at all likely or probable, that after I had supported so good a character for so many years, I should immediately upon my arrival at London prostitute my sacred profession all at once, and abandon my self to the silly scoundrel trade of pilfering books, as if I had extinguished all sense of honour and virtue; methinks the very supposition of such a thing must needs be abhorent to every ingenuous mind. I hope what has been said may be sufficient to convince your honours, and indeed to satisfy all the world, that the imputation Mr. Baker has endeavour'd to fasten-upon my character is utterly false and scandalous, and that I have sufficiently vindicated myself from so vile an indignity. May it therefore please your honours to canvass the matter in your serious thoughts, not with that rigour and severity which Mr. Baker has used, but with that tenderness and impartiality, that compassion and benevolence which the alleviating and mitigating circumstances of the case will readily admit, and then I doubt not but you'll find reason enough to reject Mr. Baker's charge with the indignation and contempt it deserves. I shall only beg leave to beseech your honours to release me from that dismal place where I have suffer'd so much already, and not remand me to that dreadful prison, where should I remain but a few days more, I must inevitably starve and die. What a scandal is it to old England, that the king's prisoners should be reduced to such<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130012"/> miserable circumstances: May I be the last prisoner who shall suffer in such a deplorable condition! May it please your honours to reinstate my character, which Mr. Baker has attempted to fully and destroy, and restore me to a capacity of farther usefulness in the Christian ministry, if God shall be pleased to spare my lilk and recover my health, and this will oblige your humble petitioner ever to pray for your success and prosperity.</p>

            . I knew the deceased and prisoner many years, they lived at Harmondsworth. The prisoner work'd by the day, at labouring work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do his work as other people?</p>
               <p>Taylor. When he had fits he could not work, he used to fall down in them. I was at the deceased's house (he kept a chandler's shop) on this day three weeks, when the prisoner and he were in the room together. He said Richard was not well, he having had fits for four or five days, but he hoped he'd go to work again soon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Not one word. He was sitting there. I went away and left them, and soon after that I heard he had kill'd his father; I saw his body in the coffin. I was on the jury, of the coroner's inquest.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of his death?</p>
               <p>Taylor. He was kill'd; his skull was broke, and his face mash'd in a terrible manner; but who did it I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the state of his mind, did you ever know him to do any mischief?</p>
               <p>Taylor. No, never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came out of his fits was he as other men?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Not very soon, sometimes not for two or three hours; but at other times he never was ready to answer questions as other men, nor sensible<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130013"/> like other people; he'd say as others said to him, let it be what it would; he'd do things as often wrong as he would right. I never heard he attempted to be mischievous in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever had any quarrel with his father?</p>
               <p>Taylor. Never as I heard of; his father was very tender of him. He was a very honest sober man.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about fifteen years. Having heard the prisoner had kill'd his father, I saw him and ask'd him where his father was; he said he lay dead on the floor. I saw him lying dead. He push'd a pitchfork through the window at me. Then another man came up. He bar'd the door up so that we could not get in. We burst the door open. He push'd a pitchfork out at the door, and we took it away from him; then he said he had got another ready for us. After that we got on the backside of the house to another door, and broke that open; but he would not let us come in till we had stifled him with dirt. There were people enough to assist when we got upon him. After we had seiz'd him he said nothing at all. The deceased was lying with his brains beat out, and all the prisoner said was, he had kill'd Mr. Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his father ever go by that name?</p>
               <p>Crips. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear of any quarrel between this man and his father?</p>
               <p>Crips. No; they always agreed.</p>
               <p>Q. What temper of mind is he of?</p>
               <p>Crips. Not like another man in behaviour, better sometimes than other some. He was out of his mind sometimes in fits, and just as he got out of them.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he had not fits was he reckoned a man of sense as other men?</p>

               <p>Arnold. No, it was in the scabbard. I told him I had none. He said he'd search my pockets, which he did, but found nothing; then he demanded my cloaths (I had observed he had drawn his hanger two or three times before he stop'd me.) I pleaded very hard, and said I had been ill many months, and they were very bad. He took my hat off my head by force, and seeing it not a good one he returned it to me again. I went up to Copenhagen-house and told the case. Two men went down the field and found him. Then he was carried before a magistrate and committed.</p>

               <p>Lambert. In Panton-street. I shew'd it to my mistress, who said it was silver; then he said he wanted to know the value of it. She said there is a silversmith near at hand that can tell you. I went with him there, but the person was not at home; then the prisoner said to me, what will you give me for it. I said nothing at all. Said he, don't you know any place where I can sell it, or any person that will pawn it for me for what they can get. As we were going along he laid hide it. I went with him to a silversmith in Piccadilly, and shew'd him the sword (and left the prisoner at the door.) I said this man wants to sell or pawn this for what he can get, I think he does not come honestly by it, and ought to be taken care of. Then I said to him, soldier come in, you are to have three shillings for it; he came in, and I shut the door; then we got a constable, and sent him to the Round-house. We intended to have advertised it, but the serjeant finding the prisoner in custody, he came to us, and by his means we found the shop out from whence it was lost. At first the prisoner said he found it by a stone in a street by Covent Garden, after that he said he found it by New-street, Covent-Garden.</p>

He took it into a shop and shew'd it to a young woman, who said it was silver. I said I found it, what do you think it is worth; she said a silversmith lives a little lower, and the porter shall go along with you. We went there; the porter went in, and came out again, and said the silversmith bids you 3 s. for it. I said, what for a silver hilted sword. They ask'd me how I came by it, I said I found it coming along; then he said I must have you before the justice. I said I was not afraid of going before a justice or any body else.</p>

            . I work in the Victualling office. On the 7th of June as I was in my yard about five or six o'clock, I saw a hand out at the window, and as I was looking up I saw two hands. I call'd out and said, are you taking the windows already, for I thought it had been the glazier; at last I saw the prisoner's face, I went round to the door, and stop'd there, and Mr. Legg came by; he stood till I went in, and as I went in I saw the prisoner at the bar go out at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I may have seen him before, but not to know him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he is the same man?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the windows out?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I saw him take the lead and iron down into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it up one or two pair of stairs?</p>
               <p>Gibson. It was up two pair of stairs; as I went in I call'd a plaisterer to assist me, and we met the prisoner just coming out in the backyard; we stop'd him there, and ask'd him where he had that lead and iron; he said he had it at Bartholomew's Hospital. He had a bag with him, and some iron in it, and some under his arm. There was a sheet of lead and glass, and a casement in the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that this lead and iron belong to Mr. Wilks?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to belong to these windows?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I can't say, it was casement lead and iron; as he brought it out of the house it appeared to be the iron and lead that belonged to some windows. He was taken up in Shoreditch, and carried before a justice of peace and examined, where he said he brought it from Bartholomew's Hospital.</p>

            . I took a walk in the morning before I went to work, and about half an hour after five, as I was returning home, I saw Mr. Gibson, who told me there was somebody in the house next door but one to him, and that he had seen the man take down a sheet of glass and a casement; he said he was afraid to go in for fear there should be more than one; then I went directly through a place up to the door, where I heard the glass was breaking, and there I saw the prisoner with the bag. I saw him take it and shove it down to hold more, then he stoop'd and put more into it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he put into it?</p>
               <p>A. He put lead, glass and iron into it. It was lead belonging to sheets of glass; there was lead and iron in the bag, and there was iron under his arm when we took him, and his fingers were cut very much with the glass; we call'd a man that lived near, and when he came we ask'd the prisoner how he came by it; he said he brought it from St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The bag, iron and lead produced in court.</p>

I found a door forced in a two pair of stairs room, where I missed a set of bed curtains, and there I found another buroe broke open, with several drawers in it, and also a chest of drawers, from which were several things taken; but those my wife put up, so I can't give an account of the particulars thereof. I missed from that room two pair of window curtains. I only speak of the things we have since found, knowing them to be my property. I found them on the Thursday in Whitsun-week, part of them upon Mr. Boswell the evidence; and the day following I found a remnant of alapeen, about six yards of it, at Hadley's lodgings, and some days after I found at a pawnbroker's in Leather Lane, named

            . Hadley came down to my house the day before the house was broke open, and told me that there was a gentleman who liv'd in a little street near Fetter-lane, which he imagin'd was gone out of town, for the door had a padlock upon it.</p>
               <p>Hadley. Let somebody look in that witness's hand, he has been branded already.</p>
               <p>Boswell. He said it he could get the padlock off, he could unlock the other lock, and by so doing he thought he could get a great deal of money. I went to his house, and he and I went to Harding. We all went to this house in Dean-street about three o'clock. I pull'd off the padlock from the door with a piece of iron about eighteen inches long; it made some noise in doing it, so I went down lower in the street, and Harding went up with the key and unlock'd the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he the key?</p>
               <p>Boswell. I believe Hadley gave it him; the watchman heard a noise, and came with a candle and lanthorn; then we all three walk'd into Fleet-street, and after the watch was gone off we turn'd back again, this was a little after four; we stood a little time in Fetter-lane, till the watchman was gone off, and then Harding and I went in, while Hadley stood at the door. We took a saucepan out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130017"/> of the kitchen, then we went into the dining room, I don't remember we took any thing there; then we went up one pair of stairs, and in the two rooms we took a large pier glass in a gilt frame, a pair of scarlet window curtains, and some harrateen curtains belonging to a bed, and a piece of stuff roll'd up, about six or eight yards of it; then we went up the two pair of stairs, where we took a blanket, in which we put the glass, we also took a sheet and some linen, we put some of the things in a bag, and in a little bag we put some more odd things. Hadley carried off the little bag, Harding the biggest bag, and I the pier glass. We went different ways, but we all met at Harding's house, where we agreed to part the curtain, for which we drew cuts. I happened to have the longest cut, so I chose out of the six curtains the two scarlet ones. Some time after that Hadley sold his two curtains to Harding, and the rest of the things were divided among us; the pier glass was left at Harding's ho use in the blanket. After it was advertised Harding and I knock'd off the frame and burnt it. After that we carried the glass to the White Bear in Aldersgate-street one night, and he knowing the landlord we left it there, and Mr. Loveless fetch'd it away; the landlord did not know how we came by it. Hadley came there before we went away.</p>
               <p>Hadley. I can't say but I did see the glass, but it was not left at my home.</p>

After I had serv'd it, he and his wife told me this glass here produc'd, belong'd to Mr. Loveless, and that he and Harding broke the frame, and burnt it, that it might not be discovered, and that it was at the White Bear in Aldersgate-street. I went there, and ask'd if Boswell, in company with two other men, had not left a looking glass wrapt up in a blanket there, the landlord said he had. I desir'd him to deliver it to me, and told him I had an information it was stolen. He deliver'd it, I took it to Mr. Harding's. ( The glass produc'd in court.)</p>

               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Pett. His name is Foster. I saw her deliver it to him. Immediately after I read it, and considered the contents, I turned to the prisoner, and told her it was a forged bill; upon that she declared if it was a forgery, she was intirely innocent of it, for she received it in a post letter, either that or the proceeding day, and produced the letter, which is in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. What mark is upon it?</p>
               <p>Pett. There is the Portsmouth mark upon it. I immediately carried the bill and letter to Mess. Brown, who were then at dinner, and told them my opinion of it; the woman waited in the shop till I return'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she an opportunity of going away in that time?</p>
               <p>Pett. There was no restraint laid upon her as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you declared your opinion to her in the shop before?</p>
               <p>Pett. I had publickly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not leave direction with the other person in the shop to stop her if she offer'd to go away?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130019"/>Pett. No, none at all. Mr. Brown came and told her it was a forgery, and she told him the same as she did me. During the time they were in conference, an acquaintance of Mr. Brown's came in, an officer was sent for, and she was taken before my Lord-mayor. I remember upon her being ask'd in Mr. Brown's compting-house who she received it from, she said she did not know the person that wrote the letter. Mr. Brown or somebody observed that it was something extraordinary she should receive a letter with a bill in it, to send down wines, and receive a reward for her trouble, without knowing the gentleman. She reply'd, as she was in a very public way, a great many gentlemen used her house that she might know, but could not recollect them.</p>
               <p>Q. What way is she in?</p>
               <p>Pett. She keeps wine vaults in Tavistock-court, Covent-Garden, and when before my Lord mayor she made the same reply as at Mess. Brown's. She was that evening sent to the Poultry Compter for farther examination. The next day she was brought before my Lord-mayor again, I and Mr. Isaac Lane were present. She made the same answers then to every particular, I don't remember she varied in any circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told her it was forged, did she shew any signs of hesitation or guilt?</p>
               <p>Pett. I perceiv'd no visible alteration in her, and she constantly persevered in the same story.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the letter?</p>
               <p>Pett. This is it, and this is the case (holding them in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give it into your hand voluntarily?</p>
               <p>Pett. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you have not had more bills brought you by other people, in the same kind of writing, drawn on the same person?</p>
               <p>Pett. There have been several. There was one brought some time before this was, and another the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Bridge in Johnson's Court?</p>
               <p>Pett. I do. He brought that the day after she brought this.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any inquiry after a person at Portsmouth, that is supposed to be the drawer of this bill?</p>
               <p>Pett. Upon Mr. Bridge being stopt, he declared his innocence, and that he received the bill in a post letter that same day, sign'd

               <p>Q. Was there any gentleman in the house when you came there ?</p>
               <p>S. Copping. No, not one. The next day between eleven and twelve I was there again, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130020"/> heard a gentleman read it over. She said she had a letter out of the country, and she could not tell who it came from, but she said she thought it was from some gentleman that had used her house.</p>
               <p>The jury desir'd she might write the same words in court, which were wrote on the letter for a direction.</p>
               <p>She wrote the same, viz.</p>
               <p>To Mess. Hinton Brown, and Co. in Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>The jury compared them, and found the hand writing agree.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you write that direction on the back of the letter for?</p>
               <p>S. Copping. For the porter to carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you frequently at Mrs. Cane's house?</p>
               <p>S. Copping. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe in the reading the letter the names of Miss Betsey and Miss Polly: Were there such persons in the house at that time?</p>
               <p>S. Copping. There were two Betsey's, but never a Polly. There had been a Polly in the house, but she had been gone three months</p>

            . I am a hosier and hatter, I live at the corner of Tavistock-Row. Mr. Price came to me, and told me Mrs. Cane had just shew'd him a note that came in a letter from Portsmouth, but she did not know any thing of the person, but imagined he had been at her house; and he ask'd me if there was such a person as Hinton Brown. He said it was drawn on a person at Wapping, and that it was very odd. I told him that was frequently done. He went and fetch'd the note, and it seemed to me to be a fair note.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note ?</p>
               <p>Harris. This is the same note. He said she intended to go for the money. I said she might send a porter, for they will pay it directly. She came afterwards to me, and ask'd my advice. She said she would go and receive the money herself, and said the reason of her going was, that she was to send the money down to Portsmouth by the stage, and was to have a guinea for her trouble, so one journey would serve for the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was this?</p>
               <p>Harris. I can't say, but it was about the 14th or 15th of June. After that I was sent for to Mr. Brown's, and was before my Lord may or with her. She gave the same account there as she had done to me in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Price?</p>
               <p>Harris. He is out of town, and I believe he was so at the time of the subpaena being taken out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the letter?</p>
               <p>Harris. No, I did not. She said she received one, and that she did not propose to send any wine down. I did not see the note in her custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bridge. I received a letter from Portsmouth, with a draft in it, directed to Mess. Brown, in a frank.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive it?</p>
               <p>Bridge. I believe it was three weeks or a month ago last Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it frank'd by?</p>
               <p>Bridge. I forget now, because I gave it to Mr. Brown's teller.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon this?</p>
               <p>Bridge. I believe this is it. I went on the Wednesday, the day after I received it, to receive the money. The letter was sign'd Bosworth. I took it to be one capt. Bosworth, that used to come to my house with capt. Murray.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Bridge. I keep the Cocoa-tree in Johnson's-Court, Charing-Cross.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this draft. (He takes it in his hand.)</p>
               <p>Bridge. This I take to be the same hand writing as Mrs. Cane's is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mess. Brown pay you the money?</p>
               <p>Bridge. No, I was stop'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that Bosworth owe you any thing?</p>
               <p>Bridge. No, Nor I never had any dealings with him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the letter directed to you?</p>

               <p>Pett. Mr. Bridge did, who was detained, and has given bail.</p>
               <p>Bridge. I went down to Portsmouth, and was there four days; I inquired at all the offices, and got every officer's name there, by sea or land. I got the names out of the books of admiral Broderick.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a ship call'd the Unity?</p>
               <p>Bridge. There is, but no such name belonging to her. I have received since a letter from a friend of mine (the surgeon on board the Alcide ) who says he made all the enquiry he could, and could find no such name. I went to the inn where the stage-coach puts up, but found no such person. I have found, by inquiring at the War-Office, that capt. Bosworth has been gone eight or nine months to America, as a captain in lord Loudon's regiment.</p>

            , one of our servants, came and told me, on the 28th of June last, that he had seen the prisoner take a parcel of gloves out of one of the presses, and convey them into his counter, where he work'd. I order'd Mr. Figens, our foreman, to wait upon a landing place on the stairs, and I went into a passage and look'd through a hole, to watch his carrying them off. I saw him take them out of the counter and put them into his pocket. He went out with them, and down Fish-Street-Hill. I pursued, and took him in Monument-Yard. I took him back to the door, sent for a constable, and took him to the constable's house, where we took from him twenty-five pair of mens leather gloves. ( Produced in court, and deposed to.) He own'd he took them, and acknowledged them to be our goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them?</p>
               <p>Hartley. They cost us 25 s. He was carried before my Lord-mayor, where he confessed he had stole twelve other pair, and sold them to one Dukeshal, in Shoreditch, the Friday before. I got a search warrant, and went to his lodgings in Mint-Street, where I found more gloves of different sorts, one pair of which I can swear to. I went to him since he has been in Newgate, and there he confessed he stole twenty pair from us, and sold them to Dukeshal for 11 d. per pair; and also that he had stole others, and sold them to one Mitchel in Shoreditch</p>
               <p>James Figens. I am foreman to Mess. Warriner and Hartley. On the 28th of June last I saw the prisoner take out these gloves ( taking a parcel in his hand) out of a cupboard in the sore warehouse. He carried them into a back warehouse, where he was at work, and wanted to put them into a cupboard there, but by accident it was lock'd. He open'd a counter, which I heard by a remarkable noise that it makes, and as I found afterwards he had put them in there. I sent him to look at the press, with which we press our gloves, to see if it was not out of order; then I look'd and found the gloves there cover'd with a skin. I let them lie, and went and told Mr. Hartley the case; then I shew'd Mr. Hartley a little hole, where he might look through and see the prisoner put the gloves<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130023"/> in his pockets, and I went to stand in a place to watch him. I saw him going out at the door. I went to the counter and saw the gloves were gone. I gave the signal, saying he is gone. Mr. Hartley followed and laid hold of him at the corner of the Monument. I was at the searching of him, and saw the twenty five pair of gloves found upon him. We took him before my Lord-mayor, and there he said but little; only he confessed he took them out of the warehouse, and whose property they were. I heard him acknowledge after that, that he stole from my masters one dozen and twenty pair, and sold them to Mr. Mitchel.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise made him to induce him to confess?</p>
               <p>Figens. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, but call'd the following persons to his character.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Garry. I live in Long-Acre. I expected to meet a friend or two from London at <placeName id="t17570713-29-crimeloc138">Parsons-Green</placeName>

Then I left the stable, and went into the house, and call'd for a bottle of Yorkshire ale and a paper of tobacco, to enjoy myself till my friends came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they appointed to meet you there?</p>
               <p>Garry. No, they had not, but they frequently go there, and one of them came before I went away; and having no company before they came, I fill'd a glass of ale, and lighted my pipe, and began to smoke; then I walk'd towards the stable door, to see if my mare was feeding, the prisoner was in the stable (the first time I ever saw him) along with the hostler; my mare did not feed, and I said she is very warm, and will feed by and by; then I came out of the stable, and left the prisoner and hostler there, and return'd to the house, which is some little distance from the stable. I drank another glass of my ale, and my company not being come I walk'd down to the stable again, and found the stable door shut; not thinking proper to disturb the horses, I passed the door, but there being a window that shuts up with a wooden shutter, which was latch'd up with a piece of leather, I look'd therefrom into the stable, and saw my mare and a man's head about her. I wonder'd what the man was doing, and thrust my head further into the window, and saw the prisoner at the bar in the act of beastiality with my mare, standing upon something that he had put cross the stall, about a foot and half high. I was surprized and shock'd thereat; and seeing Mr. Campbell smoaking a pipe at the house door, who was a stranger to me, I went up to him, and desired him to step with me to the stable, and told him the occasion, and he went with me, and observed the prisoner's actions in the stable from the window; then Mr. Campbell went away, and brought two other men from a greater distance from the stable than he was when I went to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might Mr. Campbell be from that window when you went to him?</p>
               <p>Garry. He was about twenty-five yards distance; the other two witnesses came back along with Mr. Campbell, and saw the prisoner in the action I first saw him in; but some noise being made, he was alarm'd and turn'd his head about, and saw us all at the window, and then he withdrew from the mare.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you all to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Garry. I could have reach'd him with my hand whip, and struck him cross the back; and being a good deal incensed against him, I went into the stable and horse-whip'd him all the while he kept doing up his breeches, they being quite down when I first went in. He kept crying out. What do you horse-whip me for, I have been doing nothing but putting the cloth over your man ? I said you had no occasion to have put your breeches down for that, I believe you have been doing that which will bring you to an unfortunate end.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide is the stall?</p>
               <p>Garry. I suppose about six foot wide. The thing he stood upon was either a piece of deal, or pitchfork, or broom, or something of that sort. I believe I should have neglected prosecuting the prisoner, had he not been very insolent, for when I was got to my pipe again, the prisoner being postilion to a post chaise that had brought down some gentry, as he was putting his horses to the chaise, he turn'd back, and seeing me at the door he held up his hand or whip, and said, I'll do for you for horse-whipping of me; whereupon, seeing him so very outrageous, I laid hold of him, and said public justice should be done on him, and then with some assistance he was carried before a justice of the peace at Fulham, who committed him to New-Prison; my mare is since dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. Campbell. Whilst I was sitting on a bench in the yard at the Peterborough-Arms, Mr. Garry, a person I had never seen before, came to me, seemingly in some confusion, and pull'd me by the arm, and said pray step this way. I said where, he still beg'd I'd go with him, and I went accordingly, and when we were got about half way to the stable, he said you'll see something that will surprize you, there is a little fellow buggering my mare in the stable. I went up to the stable window, and found what he had said to me was true, and was very much shock'd thereat; I then ran and beg'd of Mr. Sayer and Mr. Bedford to come back to the stable window with me, telling them what I had seen; accordingly they forthwith came, and found the prisoner much in the position as I had left him in, I was gone above a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he stand upon?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I can't say that, but as we look'd in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130026"/> at the window, my hat made a little noise against the window shutter, and thereupon the prisoner turn'd his head about and look'd at us, and drop'd down behind the mare. Then Mr. Garry went in and horse whip'd the prisoner, after which I went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the prisoner's breeches to be down?</p>
               <p>Campbell. I did not.</p>

Mr. Campbell came to me and Mr. Bedford, and desired us to step with him to the stable window, which we did, and there saw the prisoner in beastiality with a mare; there being four of us we made the window dark, or else by somebody rushing against the window shutter the prisoner was disturb'd, and drop'd down from the mare; on which I said to Mr. Garry, Sir, go in and horse-whip him, for I think he deserves it very much, and here is a pond near, which he ought to be drag'd thro'; thereupon I went into the stable with Mr. Garry, and saw the p risoner's breeches quite down, and he endeavoured to put them up all the time Mr. Garry was horse whipping of him, but when the prisoner came out to put his horse to, he began to use Mr. Garry with ill manners, and call'd him names; then Mr. Garry went up to him, and said he should be prosecuted.

            . The prisoner is upwards of sixteen years of age, and has lived in several noblemen's families. I believe he is the first of his family that ever was within side a prison. I ask'd Mr. Bedford in this court yard if he saw any thing of this affair, he said yes. Then I ask'd him what, and he said, he did not come till all was over.</p>

On the 31st of March the prisoner and one Green, not taken, came to me at the George in Leather-Lane, and the prisoner agreed to give me 6 l. for a forrel gelding. He desired I would take him to the Bell Savage-inn on Ludgate-Hill, where I was to be paid; I went. They ordered the hostler to put him into the stable. Then the prisoner said to me, you must go with me to the Temple-Exchange coffee house, and there I will pay you for him. Then we all three went out with an intent to go there, but before we got there Green gave me the slip, and went away. When the prisoner got me to the coffee-house, and had kept me about ten minutes, I desired him to pay me, for I could not stay. He said have a little patience, Green is gone to change a 20 l. bank note. When I began to be impatient he said I believe I can find Green, he is gone to Symond's inn cellar, Chancery-Lane. We set out from thence<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130027"/> in order to go there. When we came there he said to the landlord, has Green been here? The landlord said no. Then he said my wife by, and if she is at home I can a will for the horse. I went with him to a place near Fetter-Lane, where a woman said she was gone out. Then he said we must go to Symond's inn-cellar again, which we did. Then he ask'd the landlord if Green had been there since we went out. The landlord said no. Then he said, come coachman let us drink a tankard of beer. I said I could not stay. Said he you think I want to cheat you out of your horse; if I can't pay you, you can but have him again, so you may go and take him. I said, then you must go along with me. He said, I will not. I said, they will not let me have him, for he was delivered in your name. I desired the landlord to get a porter, in order to send to the Bell-Savage-Inn for the horse. A porter came, and I gave him an order to go for the horse; then the prisoner said he'd go along with me, so I call'd the porter back. We went down Chancery-Lane, almost to the bottom of Fleet-street. He said, suppose the horse should be gone from thence. I said, nobody can take a horse of your's or mine without an order. When I got there I inquired of the hostle, who said a porter had been for him, and had taken him away. I ask'd him whose name he came in. He said the prisoner had given a note to him before I went out of the yard: The contents were, to deliver the horse to any man that should come for him.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at this conversation ?</p>
               <p>Hicks. He was. The hostler gave me the note. I said to the prisoner your name is

               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed then?</p>
               <p>Hicks. In a light colour'd coat and waistcoat embroider'd with gold. He was carried to the compter in that dress. I remember he had another coat on the next day, when he came to go before my Lord mayor. Six days after this Green sent me word, by some acquaintance, I might have my horse again. I ordered him to bring him to the Horse and Groom, in Eagle Street, by Red Lion-Square, where he sent him, and I had him again. Since the prisoner has been in Newgate he sent for me, and desired me not to appear against him.</p>

               <p>This horse was brought by Mr. Hicks in order to be delivered to me when I sent for him. Green came to an unfortunate man in the Press yard in Newgate, Mr. Gatewood, who was executed for robbing the mail, about sending money into the country to subpoena witnesses for him, and he ran away from me, and took the horse unknown to me. When I was going to advertise the horse Green got knowledge of it, and he sent the horse to Mr Hicks. If my consinement has not been a sufficient punishment for the crime, and the court find me guilty, I hope I shall be sent on board a ship to serve my king and country.</p>

            . I live in the parish of St. Giles's in the Fields. My landlord and I had a little difference together. He was a little hot headed. I was afraid he'd come and seize, though I owned him nothing. I desired a man that boarded with me to take the chest and twenty seven guineas in money out of the house, to a neighbour's two or three doors from me, and I have never seen the money nor chest since.</p>

               <p>Quinn. I believe the prisoner is the man, but I and not sure; it is a great while ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago?</p>
               <p>Quinn. About seven years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so cruel as to take up a man that you do not know?</p>
               <p>Quinn. I took him up, but whether he is or is not the man I can't tell.</p>

            . On Saturday the 2d of July the prisoner offered this tablecloth to me to sell. She had got a bundle, in which I perceived a scarlet cardinal. I ask'd her what she had got there.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130029"/> She said, it was nothing to me. I said I would see. I took it from her, and ask'd her if it was her own. She said yes, it was left her by her aunt, who liv'd about two miles beyond Sturbich. I said, you seem to be a hay-maker, and it is odd to carry such things about you. Then I saw the two quart pots with the name taken out, and said there is something more in it than this, there must be some house broke open and rob'd.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How do you know the pots to be your's ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My name is out, but there is the man's name that I bought them of.</p>
               <p>Fell. I told her she must go with me before justice Welch. When she came there she said a woman had given them to her upon the road. Mr. Welch ask'd her where she work'd last. She said with Mr. Hutchins on the King's road. Mr. Welch told her he believed she told him a lye, and that there must be somebody concerned with her; but she would not confess any thing, only said, she was to give the woman the money they fetch'd that delivered them to her. Then he committed her to New-Prison for farther examination, and desired I would advertise the things, which I did, and about nine on Monday morning, Mr. Thomas and another gentleman came to see the things, and owned them.</p>

               <p>I carried these things for a woman almost a hundred miles. I came with her out of the country. She ask'd me to sell that tablecloth for her, and to meet her in Smithfield, and she was to come to me; she went to the hospital, where she said she had a little girl.</p>

               <p>Groom. This was about ten at night, on the 27th of April, when they went away. I believe they came about seven. My wife ask'd for the handkerchief when she was in bed, while I was undressing myself, and I found it was gone.</p>

               <p>Groom. In Drury-Lane. The other young woman and she lived together. The prisoner own'd she had pawn'd the handkerchief to a person in Holbourn, where I went with her, and found it pawn'd for a shilling in her name, and I had the gloves again from out of the prisoner's pocket. I took her before the justice, and there she own'd she did pawn the handkerchief.</p>

            , Mr. Bridge then acting as steward to Sir Richard; so early did she begin to display her genius of this kind. Mr. Bridge at that time was instrumental in discovering her transactions, and bringing her to justice, and she was committed to Newgate, where she lay about fifteen months. When she got out she kept a bagnio in St. James's-Street, where she lived for some years; but in the year 1739 she became greatly indebted to many people, and her creditors came upon her, and she was sent to the Fleet, where she lay from 1739 to 1748, when she was discharged by the Insolvent Act. It was not long after before she set to work. She began within a month after her confinement with Mrs. Mulder, and filed a bill in chancery against her; several transactions in pursuance to that are not at an end. I shall not take notice of that transaction any farther than as it has a connection with this. She never had any demand on Mr. Ralph Bridge during his life time, who died in March 1747. In July following she sent one Boucher, an attorney, to the present Mr. Robert Bridge, his representative, to whom he left the greatest part of his fortune; and he never was without great sums of money in bankers hands, and India bonds. She sent to demand of him the sum of 750 l. and produced a bond, which she said was executed by Mr. Ralph Bridge, and given to her; this was a demand in her own right. Mr. Bridge was a good deal surprised, and could not think that his uncle, a man of affluent circumstances, could owe that sum to any person whatsoever; but when he came to understand who this creditor was, (a woman in the Fleet for a debt of 180 l.) it was impossible he could conceive the debt genuine. It is remarkable that bond is witnessed by two persons; one her brother John Eddowes. a poor necessitous man, who was sometimes a bailist's follower, sometime a day labourer, and at last was obliged to her for bringing him into a scrape, for which he was committed to Newgate, where he died, not being able to pay 40 s.

            , a person in the Fleet at the same time, in circumstances which in every shape convinced Mr. Bridge this must be forged; therefore he soon afterwards filed a bill in chancery against her and the witnesses, in order to discover the circumstances attending the execution of it; for she brought an action on it immediately after he had refused payment. She in June, 1748, put in her answer, where she says, in order to give an account of it, Mr. Ralph Bridge was an acquaintance of her's, that she had advanced 400 l. to him, and some other person had advanced 400 l. more in her favour, and that Mr. Bridge undertook to purchase an annuity for her with that sum; but an opportunity not falling out immediately she had received several sums of money from him back again, and at the time this bond is supposed to be given he came to her in the Fleet. They settled accounts, and upon the ballance this sum of 750 l. was due to her; that he brought a blank along with him, and told her she might get any body to fill it up, and he was ready to execute it; that she looking out of her chamber window saw Mr.

It came on to a hearing, and my lord chancellor thought proper to direct the issue of it to be tried at law, and Mr. Bridge prepared himself for that trial; but upon the examination of the witnesses it appeared she had dated that bond at a time when Mr. Bridge happened not to be in town. It happened to be at the time of Litchfield election. Mr. Bridge did business for gentlemen of fortune, who interested themselves in that election, and he was gone down there on that occasion. When she found this, and that it would be wrong to stand a trial at law, she did not try the cause; but when it came back again into the court of chancery the issue was taken ( pro confesso ) and it was agreed that that bond should be delivered up and cancel'd.</p>

               <p>After that (she had an invention so fruitful she was not at a loss to commence new demands) she set up a most extraordinary one indeed, and this is the subject principally of our present inquiry. She set up a person, one Mrs.

She pretended Mr. Ralph Bridge was intimately acquainted with her, a particular friend of hers; that she was an officer's widow, who had been in the French service, that she had dealt here as a sort of a merchant in lace, French wine, silks, and other commodities. That she had drove a large trade, by which she had been enabled to get a considerable fortune, and Mr. Bridge, as a particular friend of hers, undertook to put out a sum of money for her; that in the year 1740 she advanced to him the sum of a thousand pounds, which he undertook to put out for her, and in the mean time he would pay her five per Cent. She<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130031"/> produced another bond, whereby it appeared that Mr. Bridge had given this bond as a security for this thousand pounds; it was made in the penalty of two thousand pounds for the payment of one, that she insisted was fill'd up by Mr. Bridge himself, and executed by him, and witnessed by two women, one an old woman,

            . He afterwards died, then she takes out letters of administration to him, and as his representative made this demand. She by her answer to Mr. Bridge sets forth the bond, says she is very well acquainted with Mr. Bridge, Mulder and Knight, and insists upon the bond as a real bond, at that time, which was in November, 1752; but when she made the first demand of this bond she took no notice at all of three several promisory notes, she did not pretend any of them were due to her, yet two of them are indorsed upon the back of the bond; the third, which is for 300 l. she took no notice of, but before this answer she insists upon it she is not only intitled to that, but 600 l. more, which is these three several notes. Mr. Bridge amended his bill, she puts in her second answer, she there says as to the 100 and 200 l. she believes the money is not due upon them, but that they were given as a collateral security for part of the money due upon the bond.</p>
               <p>Now observe the bond was supposed to be executed in March, 1740, the other not given till 1745; how could it be possible that two notes should be given as a collateral security against the security of a higher nature, and so long afterwards.</p>
               <p>Upon this the cause was brought to issue, many witnesses examin'd on both sides, and it appear'd she did not examine a single witness to prove the existence of this

            , though she had said she was a woman of consequence in trade, and died worth 3000 l. yet in another answer she said she was worth nothing, her effects not being equal to her debts. It appear'd she had been a little out of luck in the execution of this bond too, tho' she had taken some care to obviate a little difficulty she had in the last, for she had dated this bond a great deal farther back, this was March 1740. Therefore as Mr. Bridge was generally in town about that time of the year, in the spring, she thought there she should have him, but there she was again mistaken, for it appear'd that this Mr. Bridge lodg'd for 14 years with Mr. Curgee, a goldsmith, in Fleet street, and continued there when in town to his death. Mr. Curgee, in looking over his papers, found a letter from him at this very time, wrote from Oxfordshire, by which he recollected he set out on the 6th of March for Burford, and the letter was dated the 9th at Burford, which is 70 miles from London, therefore it is impossible he could be in London at the time; in order to take off that, she or somebody else has been guilty of the most extraordinary forgery that almost ever came before a court. She got leave of my Lord Chancellor in order to prove some exhibits. She produced six letters, the tenour of them appear'd to be a correspondence kept up between this Mrs.

             at Brustels in Flanders, and Mr. Bridge; these letters had no post marks on them, the whole appear'd upon inspection not to be his hand writing, nor like it, and from the spelling and manner of expression no man could hesitate a moment; upon this the cause came to be heard. She produced a 7th letter, but that was calculated to answer a particular purpose, and that was to shew that Mr. Bridge was drunk when he wrote one of the letters; when it came to be heard before my Lord Chancellor, there was another cause came on at the same time, my Lord thought proper to direct issues, and when they were fram'd and prepar'd for trial she filed this first cause, but did not think proper to try the other at all. The whole matter was tried before my lord Mansfield last May, by a special jury of gentlemen, in Westminster-Hall, and after a full hearing by witnesses the jury brought in a verdict against the bond, that it was not a real bond; and likewise the notes, and these very letters were produced<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130032"/> in court, and witnesses on both sides examined as to the hand writing, when the jury found a verdict against the reality of the bond and notes. She had the hardness to attend the trial, and my lord Mansfield thought proper to commit her, and bound Mr. Bridge over to prosecute.</p>
               <p>The first thing we shall go upon is, to prove this bond was not executed by Mr. Bridge. We shall likewise prove by several gentlemen of character and credit, who very well know his hand-writing, and will positively declare this is not his hand-writing to the best of their knowledge.</p>
               <p>As for the publication, that is beyond all manner of doubt. We shall shew she produced it to her attorney in order to bring an action.

               <p>The only thing is how to bring it home to her, as to the knowledge of this bond being forged, and that can only arise from the general nature of the transaction, from the facts and circumstances arising from it; there are many inconsistencies indeed in her answers in chancery, as she gives different accounts of this

            . (He is shew'd the bond.) I believe I have seen this bond before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago?</p>
               <p>Powel. Two years ago. The prisoner applied to me to bring an action on this bond. I wrote to the gentleman or his attorney, but had no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had you it from?</p>
               <p>Powel. I had it from the prisoner at the bar, in order to recover the money. She avow'd it as a bond, upon which the money was due.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name was you to bring the action?</p>
               <p>Powel. I was to bring it in her name.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to decline it?</p>
               <p>Powel. I heard Mr. Cooper (an officer of the King's-Bench) knew something of Mr. Bridge, so I waited on him with the bond, and I remember he said he doubted whether it was wrote by Mr. Bridge or not, so I deliver'd it and would not proceed.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. What was the reason you kept my affair in your hands two years and would not go on with it ?</p>

               <p>Osgood. He always went by the nickname of Cheshire, he being a Cheshire man. I well knew him and the prisoner in the Fleet.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Osgood. He was a follower to one Hunt a bailiff, several times before the year 1746.</p>

               <p>Q. What time was that?</p>
               <p>Osgood. He work'd for me there on the 26th of August, 1746, and staid on and off till about November, 1748.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he as to circumstances in life?</p>
               <p>Osgood. He was a man in no circumstances at all. He went to Newgate upon an attachment for non-payment of 40 s. and there he died as I was told.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever in company with him and the prisoner together?</p>
               <p>Osgood. I was; while he work'd in my garden my servant was telling me that Cheshire had related that some body had died, and left him a good deal of money; so I had the curiosity of asking him how it was, and told him if I could be of service to him I would; said he, I can't tell, there is somebody dead that my sister can inform you of, and I should be obliged to you if you will go along with me to her, he not knowing who it was, or where they died. I went with him the 16th of October, 1747, to her in the Fleet Prison, I there had a good deal of conversation with her. She offer'd to put some proceedings in the court of Chancery into my hands, which I took with me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175707130035"/> more out of curiosity than any thing else; and on the 19th of October I went to her again, when she acquainted me that one

That poor creature was turn'd out of the hospital for perjuring herself in this cause; the creature forgot her story, they gave her too much gin, and I have too little of every thing. I have not a six penny piece left to pay a porter, much less to see council. I have been very troublesome to some gentlemen in the city, men of business, whose time is their bread, and I can't call them; it is seventeen years ago since this affair of old Bridge. I can't call witnesses to prove it now, and the two witnesses to the bond are dead. If I must die because I am poor, I can't help it.</p>

            . I work'd for the prosecutor; on Saturday night the 21st of May, Tyers bid me come early on Monday the 23d I went early down into the yard accordingly, and Tyers followed me with an empty sack. He went into the warehouse and call'd me to him, then we took a sack of malt and put it into an empty sack, sack and all. Then he ask'd me if I knew Cloth-Fair, I said no, then he said, do you know Paul's Wharf Hill, he bid me go up there, and make the best of my way up Duck-lane with it. I went, and when I came there with the sack of malt he stood leaning upon a post, at the corner of Smithfield. I ask'd him how much farther I was to carry it, he said but a little way, then he had me into Cloth Fair, to the house of Low the prisoner, a publick house, the White Hart; we went thro' the tap room, and up one pair of stairs, and pitched the malt in a passage, where I saw a malt mill fix'd against the wall; then we went both of us down stairs, and in a few minutes the prisoner Low came down stairs, and paid Tyers for the malt, but he said nothing to me; after this Tyers and he went backwards together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Low knew the malt was in his house.</p>
               <p>Curtice. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What consideration had you for carrying this malt?</p>
               <p>Curtice. Tyers gave me either 3 s. and 8 d. or 4 s. and 2 d. I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any liquor?</p>
               <p>Curtice. We had two pots of two-penny.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Low know what Tyers gave you?</p>

I apply'd to a justice for a warrant to take them all up. I found when I came to talk with them, the prisoner at the bar contradicted himself two or three times, which gave me a strong suspicion he was the man; then I charged him home with it, and he confessed he took it, to me, and afterwards before the justice.

               <p>Q. Are you a married man?</p>
               <p>Everit. I am. Coming thro' the gateway in Westminster into <placeName id="t17570713-45-crimeloc224">Old Tothill street</placeName>

I pull'd my purse out in order to pay for it, and the prisoner and two soldiers were sitting in a box in the same room; after that I went and sat down at the lower end of a table next to her. I had a pot or two of beer, they drank with me, and I pull'd out my purse again to pay for the beer; the prisoner had a great mind to take my purse then, but the landlord bid her keep her hands to herself; she put her hand towards it as it lay upon the table. I took my money up, the prisoner followed me out, and the landlord call'd after me, and said, knock that hussey on the head, for she'll rob you. I went on my way home, she came up to me, and I ask'd her what she wanted; she said my dear only to see you safe home. I desired her to go back again, but could not get rid of her. Then I cross'd the Broad-way to Dormant's hill, when she gave me a shove on the side and push'd me into a dirty way. I got my hand to my pocket, and said, hussey if you take any thing from me, expect what will follow; she said she never did such a thing to any man in her life, then put her hand under my armpit, and pull'd me close to her. I shoved her from me, and put my hand in my pocket, and my money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe her hand in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Everit. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear you had it when you went out of the house?</p>
               <p>Everit. I can very safely swear I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Everit. I was very able to walk without any support; I knew every word that was spoke to me, and what I said to her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to her when you missed your money?</p>
               <p>Everit. I said you have rob'd me. She made use of a very bad word, concerning her eyes, and said she never touch'd a farthing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Everit. This was about five in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any people about?</p>
               <p>Everit. Yes, people were going to work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call any body to your assistance?</p>
               <p>Everit. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so ?</p>
               <p>Everit. Because my wife being big with-child I was afraid of giving her uneasiness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Everit. No; I never saw her in my life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever meet with your money or purse again?</p>
               <p>Everit. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Everit. She promised to go back with me to the man's house where we came from. When I was for going she insisted upon going through the street that I lived in, but I did not chuse that.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Everit. Because people were up and would see us.</p>
