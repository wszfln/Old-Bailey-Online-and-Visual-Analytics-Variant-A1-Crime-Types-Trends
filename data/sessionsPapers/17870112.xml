In November last, Lewis became so pressing for money, that she then told him she would endeavour to sell out some stock which she had in the Bank, on purpose to discharge that debt; she then applied to a Mr. Good, to know who was his broker, he living in the neighbourhood of her mistress in Portland-street; upon which, without any idea of an ill purpose, the name of Langdale was wrote upon a piece of paper; with this paper, on the 13th of December, she applied to Mr. Langdale the broker, and informed him she wished to have a power of attorney, to sell out a hundred pounds stock; she described her father to be a man in age, and living at Clapham, but having received an injury by a nail in his foot, he was unable to come to town, therefore it was necessary for a power of attorney to be made out to her; they went into the office, and there she gave verbal instructions to the broker, to have the letter of attorney filled up; she there described Winterbourne as a sawyer, living in Cannon-row, and herself as his daughter; the power of attorney was filled up, and he read it to her to know if the description he had given was correct; she then acquiesced in the description being a right one; as soon as she had given the name of

Gentlemen, it is certain that there were the names of three persons on this paper, how she got these names, or where she got them I cannot possibly give you in evidence, but the fact was, three names were produced, but how they were produced we do not know; having possessed herself of the warrant of attorney, and having been to Mr. Langdale, it was perfectly easy for her to transfer this stock; Mr. Langdale could not have any suspicion of a young woman that came to him in the name of a gentleman whom he knew very well, and the two chairmen could suspect nothing. Gentlemen, as to the law upon the subject, it is perfectly clear, a person forging the name of another, to defraud a third person is an offence, and an offence of a very high nature indeed; in this case the Bank have been defrauded, they are answerable and have made good the loss to Mr. Winterbourne, whose name has been forged. Gentlemen, the Bank in this case, think it their duty, though as men, they lament their situation, for it is a painful one, to bring a young woman to be tried at this bar for so high an offence; but it is a duty they owe themselves, a duty they owe the public, and also to every one of you, to put a stop if possible to these kind of practices; the property that you have acquired, you have placed in the hands of men from whom you expect to receive it; your earnings which you have placed there you expect to leave to your children; it is therefore incumbent on the Bank to protect that property, and to bring every criminal of this kind before you: This scheme seems to have been calculated more artfully, than one would expect from such a young woman; but Gentleman, the facts are, I am afraid, too plain; for it will be given in evidence to you, that she went to the Bank in the character and name of

But Gentlemen, if on the other hand, I have opened facts which cannot be proved in evidence, I shall be the first person to desire you to blot them out from your memory, and give them no attention at all; I have stated them not to direct, but to guide your judgement, and you will give that attention to them which I trust they deserve.</p>

               <p>You are a broker? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you know that unhappy young woman at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see her? - It was about the 12th of December that she came to me at the Stock-Exchange, in company with another person, an old woman whose name I have since understood is Mears, and asked me if my name was Langdale; I told her, yes; she produced a piece of paper, with the name wrote upon it; she likewise asked me if I did not do business for Mr. Good, of Queen-Ann-street, East; I told her, I did; she said, she wanted a power of attorney to sell 100 l. three per cent. for her father who was in the country; I asked her name, she said Winterbourne; that Mr. Good was her father's intimate friend, and that he had recommended her to me; that her father, William Winterbourne, of Cannon-street, sawyer, for that was his name and description, as she mentioned Ratcliffe-highway, had run a nail into his foot, and was at Clapham for his health, and could not come; and that her father had wrote her a letter, desiring her to take out a letter of attorney to sell out 100 l. part of his three per cents, and for her to be the attorney; this I think was the 12th of December, or thereabouts; it happened to be about two o'clock; I asked her which three per cents; she said, she did not recollect, for she had left her father's letter at home; I told her, if it was the three per cent. consolidated nothing could be done for a month, that she might go away for that day; and she returned the next day, and said it was the three per cent. reduced annuities; the books of that stock were open; I wrote the instructions, and carried them to the clerk; the description agreed, the Christian name, the sirname, the place of abode, and the profession, according to the books; I left her in a corner of the office with the proper clerk to make out the power, which he did; she said, she would go over to Clapham that afternoon, and get the power executed, and bring it the next day; the next day she brought it, and left it with the proper clerk in the office; I looked at it, and upon inspection it appeared to me to have all the necessary parts; it was left; the next day she came according to my desire, and said, if the power was passed she would do the business; that was on the 15th; when she came the next day, seeing her, I went and asked whether the power was passed; he said, it was; accordingly as I could have no suspicion of the business, and all was regular, I sold the stock, and paid her the money; this was on the 15th; I paid her 73 l. 12 s. 6 d. nett, in three 20 l. notes, and the rest in cash; I always take a memorandum of the number of those bank notes; she went away, and I believe she said, she was going to Clapham; I think there was a young woman with her when she went to Clapham; she was then dressed in a very plain decent manner; on the 20th she made application to me again to transact some business of the same sort; but I cannot say I recollected her immediately on her coming, she had metamorphosed herself so much; I did not know her till she told me her name.</p>
               <p>In what rank of life might you have supposed her to have been in the first time? - As the daughter of a sawyer, a man in trade; the next time she was dressed like a lady; she told me her name was Winterbourne; I looked at her and discovered it was the same; she then said her father wanted to sell another 150 l. reduced annuities, and desired I would take out another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701120007"/>power of attorney; accordingly I gave the necessary directions to the clerk as before; but having been struck with this alteration in her garb, I recollected that Mr. Simpson had done business for this person before; on inspecting the books to see whether the account was right, therefore I applied to Mr. Simpson, and in consequence of something that he said, Mr. Winterbourne attended on a subsequent day, when she was in the accomptant room; on the 22d, when she came to bring the second power of attorney, she was asked whether her name was

            ; she said, yes; I then asked her whether she saw her father sign this power; she said, she did; as soon as these questions had been asked, the old man, Mr. Winterbourne, who was in waiting, was called into the room, and he was asked whether that was his daughter, and he answered no, it was not, nor did he recollect at that time who it was; but upon the reply of the old man, the prisoner fell down in a very strong fit; after she fainted away he recognized who she was.</p>

               <p>Who did he say she was?</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I object to that question, she was in a fit, and must be considered as not being present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When the girl recovered so as in your opinion to have her intelligence about her, did he say who she was? - I continued in the room but a short time with her; I left her in that situation in the accomptant's room.</p>
               <p>Had any thing more been said in her presence and hearing by Winterbourne who she was? - I do not recollect there was; the next day I saw her in the Bank parlour at the examination.</p>
               <p>Who were present at the examination, was Winterbourne there? - During part of the examination; I do not recollect whether he was there the whole time; I believe not.</p>
               <p>At that time did he say who she was? - I do not recollect indeed; we did not ask him.</p>
               <p>Then what was said to the girl about this? - He said nothing to her in my hearing.</p>
               <p>What was said to the girl when she was in her senses? - It was during the time of her fainting away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You are not to tell us that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. But I mean the next day, what she said or was said to her about her real name? - I cannot say: we all then knew very well her real name was

               <p>Is that the instrument which was produced to you on the 22d, and under which she then demanded to act? - It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was this which I see now, written all at one time? - The body of this first letter of attorney was most certainly written all at the same time, excepting the date and the execution, she was to take it when it was filled up; of course it was.</p>
               <p>Were these instructions after it was written, never altered? - I never altered them; and I know they were right.</p>

               <p>Is that exactly in the state as when you first received it? - Exactly in the state as when I received it; there is no alteration that I can perceive, nor no erasure; there is no other addition made on the face of the power, except the bank notes.</p>
               <p>Has there been any alteration in the name by which it is executed? - None at all that I can perceive.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you any doubt whether it was altered at all after it was delivered to the Bank? - Certainly, not in the least; the Bank never suffer a power to go out of their hands after they receive it, especially after it is acted upon.</p>

               <p>Do you remember to have seen her at your house in December, before Christmas? - I do not remember the time; she applied to me to go with her into the city the day she was taken; I went with her once before to the Bank; the first time she did not do any thing, but the last time she left me in the street, and I waited for her pretty nigh an hour and half; she did not stop two minutes the first time.</p>
               <p>How long was she absent the last time? - I never saw her after she left me in the street.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Devenish coming to your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The first time you went with her, who did you see? - A gentleman came to the door and spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Should you know that gentleman again? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Look at that gentleman, Mr. Langdale? - Yes, that is the gentleman; I heard her tell that gentleman that her father was at Clapham; I saw Devenish at our house, but I did not know his name, he was doing something on a piece of paper, but what, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was he writing? - He had a pen in his hand, who gave him the paper I do not know; that young woman stood over him.</p>
               <p>It was the second time you went with her to the bank? - Yes, and she left me in the street with her muff, and bid me wait, she should not be long.</p>

               <p>Was Mears present then? - Yes, it might be a week or ten days before Christmas.</p>
               <p>What passed between you and that young woman who was there? - This man is a shoe-maker; I went for a pair of shoes; a young woman was there; and Mears knew I could write, and he asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701120010"/>me if I would be so kind as to write a person's name for the young woman.</p>
               <p>Was that in the hearing of the young woman? - Yes, I told her I could write a very indifferent hand, and she brought a piece of paper, and a pen, and ink, and I wrote about five letters of my Christian name, and she said that would not do.</p>
               <p>What passed then? - She said she wished I knew of any body that could write a good hand; I hesitated a minute, and I recollected my partner Devenish, and I told her so; she wished I would go and fetch him, and I did; and there was a pen and ink, and she desired him to write, that she might see how he wrote; and he did so, he wrote once or twice, and she said she thought it would do, only she mentioned one word, she said she wished it to be fuller at the top; then he wrote that word again; then she desired him to write the name upon another piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Who produced that other paper? - She had the paper there, then he wrote a name upon that other paper, but what name I cannot say, I did not take any particular notice.</p>
               <p>Where was the young woman at the time he wrote on that paper? - She was sitting close by him.</p>
               <p>What was done with the paper after he wrote? - That I cannot pretend to say; I went out and left the young woman there with the papers, and Devenish went out two minutes before me; I stood by the fire; I did not look over them; I am sure I should not know the name.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say you do not know who the young woman was? - No, I do not indeed.</p>

               <p>Upon what did you write them? - Upon a piece of paper folded up; it might be two or three inches in length.</p>
               <p>Look at this letter of attorney? - That is my writing, all the three names, it was doubled up in quarters; she had some pieces of paper in her hand; she said it was a piece of fun; she was very merry, and laughed, and I went away, and she gave me thanks; I saw her again in three or four days before Christmas; there was a gentleman came to me in the morning to fetch home some things upon a chair man's horse; coming home I stopped at our public house, I sweat very much; and the master of the public house said, here has been somebody here wants you, at No. 11, Edward-street; and as I was going home to the gentleman's door, Mears the shoemaker, (I did not know his name then) he said I must come to his house; when I went, there was the same woman, but I did not know her again, till she spoke to me and said, chairman, I want you again to write these names, I have lost the other piece of paper; I sweat very much, and the sweat run down my face; she said to the woman of the house, see if there is any brandy in the bottle; and the woman gave me half a glass of brandy, and I drank it; and then she shewed me a single name, which I think was

               <p>Did she tell you who she was? - She first said her name was Forbes, but before the Justice, she said her name was not Forbes, but Cummins; I do not recollect seeing her before; but when she came into the shop, she said she had been in the shop a year ago, and bought a parcel of goods, and paid ready money for them; and one of my clerks says, he recollects her; nobody came with her or after her as I can recollect; nobody appeared connected with her, or belonged to her; she passed entirely, and acted in looking out the goods, as a woman that knew business exceeding well.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to the last witness; the prisoner came to our house, on the 1st of January; I was to serve her; she first of all wanted something in the millenery line of one of the ladies in the back warehouse; on returning out of the room, I asked her if there was any thing I could serve her with; she said she wanted several articles in the haberdashery line, she kept a shop at Winchester; she said first ribbons, she looked out a considerable quantity; I turned to reach a different colour that she wanted; and when I turned back, I missed some pieces off the counter; I had every reason to suspect the prisoner guilty, there not being another customer near me at the time.</p>
               <p>What did you miss when you turned back again? - Two half pieces of ribbon; nobody was near but her and me, except two or three of the servants in the shop that were passing and repassing; I did not find the colour that she wanted; I informed her I would look into the drawer of cut ribbons; I reached that out, and she fixed on the colour that she wanted.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take any thing? - I cannot positively say I saw her take any thing, but I thought I saw her put something into her pocket, which I took to be the end of a ribbon block, which is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701120014"/>white paper put over the end of the ribbon; she fixed on two or three different colours of ribbons which she liked in the drawer, which were cut; I informed her if that was not a sufficient quantity, I would get her a piece of the same, she said she would take what there was of them; I then went and informed my master that I suspected her; I immediately left him and went and shewed her more pieces of ribbon.</p>
               <p>Did you then tell him you had seen her put something in her pocket that appeared to you like the end of a ribbon block? - I did not.</p>
               <p>But are you sure that you saw it? - I am sure that I saw it; after I had done serving her with some ribbons, she asked to look at some lace, and I shewed her two or three different drawers, and she looked out a very considerable quantity to a very considerable amount; they were not measured; after she had looked out what lace she wanted, she said, I will not look out any more now, can you measure these things over now while I am here; I said it will take some time to measure them; she said if you will be so obliging to do it immediately, I will call in the course of two hours, and I beg you will have a bill made out of the lace and ribbons, and to mark the ribbons that I may know what to sell them for, and the lace likewise; she begged I would not delay any time, as she was under the necessity of returning to Winchester that evening; this was the morning of the first of January; I cannot say the hour; she begged I would get them all ready to pack up in a chest, and get the chest ready, and a bill and receipt, and she would pay for them on her return, I then suffered the prisoner to go out of the shop; after she had got about eight or ten yards, I went after her, and told her that there was some part of the ribbons that I was not sensible how she would have them charged; I begged her to come back and tell me; she came back, and I desired her to walk up stairs in the dining room; and the constable went with me; immediately upon her entering into the room, she took from under her cloak, upwards of forty-nine yards of lace, a large card, I saw her take it from under her cloak; I did not see her take any of the lace in the shop, and I had not the least suspicion of her taking it: at the time she took the lace from under her cloak, she was amazingly confused; I begged she would put her hand in her pocket; the constable was then present, and pulled out the ribbons which she had taken of Mr. Dyde's property; she pulled out all I believe she had.</p>
               <p>Did she say any thing? - She was very much confused, and hoped we would not expose her; she delivered up the whole of the property that she had in her possession, and begged we would let her go; she was immediately taken to the Justice's where I was present; she was examined there.</p>
               <p>Was that examination taken in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before? - Never in my life to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Were these pieces of ribbon and the lace together? - She had them in her possession.</p>
               <p>Were they in the same drawer? - No, they were in separate drawers; she looked them out separately.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take any of them out of any of the drawers? - She took them, I imagine, from off the counter after she had looked them out of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Were they all upon the counter at the same time? - She had not done looking out the whole of the ribbons before I missed some.</p>
               <p>Did you shew her the lace after she had done looking out the ribbons or before? - After.</p>

               <p>I am the constable; I was sent for to Mr. Dyde's; when I came there the prisoner was in the shop; the shopman ordered me to wait at the door; I waited at the door a considerable time; when she came out of the shop, and Mr. Smith followed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701120015"/>her, and he and I brought her back again; we took her up in the dining room, and in searching her I found this piece of ribbon, and the lace; I stripped her almost naked, as far as decency would permit; I searched her; the first pull I made, was getting the lace from under her cloak; some she pulled out, and some I took out of her pockets; the lace and ribbons have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Smith. I know the whole of them to be my master's property by the private mark; except two half pieces of ribbon which are not marked.</p>
               <p>Was it the seeing her have the end of the block in her hand as you thought, that gave you the suspicion? - No, I suspected her from missing two pieces of ribbon; I did not see her take the lace; I had not the least knowledge of her having it in her possession.</p>
               <p>Was what you saw any thing wrapped up in paper? - It was like the paper at the end of a piece of ribbon, her hand was over it.</p>
               <p>Could it be the lace? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say in my own defence; I rely on the mercy of the Court and Jury.</p>
               <p>Have you any witnesses? - Nobody knows any thing of my situation.</p>
