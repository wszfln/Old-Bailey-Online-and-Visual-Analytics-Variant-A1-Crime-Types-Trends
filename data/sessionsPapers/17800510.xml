               <p>When did you first miss them? - On Thursday in the Easter week, the 28th or 29th of March; it made my family very unhappy; we did not know who to suspect. I advertised the lace but did not hear any thing of it. On the Saturday following in the evening, the prisoner went away for a few days to make holiday; she came again five or six days after, and chared as before for two or three days. A lady who lodged at my house lost a pocket book after the prisoner came again. I apprehended the prisoner on suspicion. I took out a warrant at the office in Litchfield-street, and Grubb, an officer, came with me. I took the prisoner into the parlour and charged her with it; the officer advised my wife to go into another room and try to get her to confess, which she did, and then she confessed taking the lace.</p>
               <p>You did not hear that? - No; but I heard her acknowledge it afterwards; she was very much distressed, and owned she had stolen the lace and pawned it.</p>
               <p>Did you make her any promises to induce her to confess? - I promised her if I recovered my lace I would show her all the lenity the law would allow.</p>
               <p>Did your wife make her any promises? - I believe, she did; we found the lace in consequence of her confession. Grubb was present with my wife when she went into the other room.</p>

               <p>What sort of lenity did she promise her? - She said, it was a capital offence, the lace was worth ten or twelve pounds; that she would show her all the lenity that lay in her power, for she would not lay it capitally.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. You said she acknowledged in your presence that she had taken the things and pawned them? - Yes. At Mr. Parker's and at Mr. Freares's; I went there and found the lace.</p>

               <p>Are you sure they were brought by the prisoner? - Yes; I had seen her before. I asked her whose property they were? She said, she brought them for a Mrs. Robinson who kept a house in Marshall-street, Carnaby Market.</p>
               <p>Did you know such a person? - No; she pawned them in the name of Robinson.</p>

               <p>What did she pawn them for? - The twelve yards two guineas, the other piece half a guinea.</p>
               <p>(The lace was produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This piece is very particular. I had but one piece of that sort; it was taken out of the lace box in the mahogany press.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner access to that drawer? - On the Thursday morning I found the press open, so that somebody must have been at it.</p>
               <p>Had it been locked? - I believe it had, but it was carelessly left unbolted. I missed this piece in particular that morning.</p>
               <p>Is there any thing so particular in this piece that you could have sworn to it if she had not confessed? - Yes; from the pattern, the breadth, and the quantity of yards; there was a private mark to the end of it, that is taken away.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other piece of lace? - Yes. I missed a piece of the same quantity. I know this to be mine; there is a particular joining in it.</p>
               <p>Is there any mark upon it? - No; only the pattern; I cannot positively swear to it.</p>

I turned round and saw the prisoner's cutlass. I struck him over the head with my cane, upon which he reeled; I turned my head over my shoulder to look at the other, and I observed he had his cutlass lifted up to strike at me; I knocked his blow off with my cane; I had my arm extended to keep the prisoner's blow off, and he cut me on the under side of my arm; he followed his blow and cut my little finger entirely off, and the next finger quite through the bone, leaving it hanging only by a little bit of skin; upon which I dropped down and asked for mercy. I told them if they would spare my life they might take my money; then the prisoner put his right hand into my breeches pocket and took out two guineas and three shillings; the other man asked for my watch. I had not my watch about me, I told him so; but he searched for one; then they d - d me and bid me go about my business; and I saw them both go up the field towards White-Conduit-house.

I saw him conceal one piece of ribbon in his hand. I thought that was for no good purpose; presently after that I saw him put it into his right hand pocket. I let him go out of the shop. I then told the young man who was in the shop, that I had seen that man take a piece of ribbon; when the prisoner had got about three doors off, I followed him, and brought him back; he was never out of sight; then he took those two pieces of ribbon (producing them) out of his pocket himself. These are our property; there is my mark upon one, and my master's mark on the other; they are very particular patterns; we had them a great while in the shop. He confessed he had taken one, he did not confess as to the other. The constable at the watch-house found three pieces of black ribbon upon him; but I was not then present; that is marked 15, the number of yards there are left upon it, the other piece I can positively swear to being my master's property; and, besides, I saw him take it; that is eleven yards.</p>

On Monday the 17th of April, between six and seven in the evening, the two prisoners came into our shop, and asked to see some silk cloaks. I desired them to go to a part of the shop where we generally shew those things; they wanted to see them in a dark part of the shop; their behaviour was such as caused me to suspect them as soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100007"/>they came in; I therefore counted the cloaks. I laid down six black silk cloaks before them. They found a deal of fault with them; they said the lace was not good enough, that they wanted them with broader trimmings and larger. I said, in order to see how large they were, they had better try one on, upon which Thompson pulled her cloak off, and tried one of them on. Kent had on a long scarlet cloak. Thompson dropped a cloak on the ground, upon which Kent sat down on a stool, and then the cloak which she had on reached almost to the ground, and then she

             the cloak that had been dropped, up under her own cloak, as I suppose by the circumstances which turned out afterwards. I desired my servant to bring some cloaks with broader trimmings; she brought three. I returned three of the others, in order to keep the same number before them. They thought these cloaks not large enough. I desired my servant to bring another. They seemed to like that and asked the price of it; I said twenty-six shillings. Thompson said she would give me twelve shillings for it, and if I would not take that she wished me a good night, and said she was sorry she had given me the trouble. As they were going out of the shop, Thompson laid hold of the door.</p>

               <p>You refused the twelve shillings? - It cost me twenty-two shillings. As they were going out I laid hold of Thompson with one hand, and the other with the other hand. I said they had a cloak of mine, and they must not take my property away. I sent for a constable, who lived at the next door. He came in. When I charged them with having a cloak, Kent dropped the cloak from under her arm; as my servant will prove. I did not see it myself; it was found where Kent stood. I knew she had the cloak before I shewed her the last cloak, and I fancy she must know I knew it by my countenance, for she said I fancy the gentleman is hard of hearing, and does not choose to shew us any more cloaks.</p>
               <p>Did you see Kent draw it up under her petticoats? - I saw Thompson drop it and look at Kent as much as to say pick it up, and she sat down immediately.</p>
               <p>You did not see her pick it up? - I cannot say that I did; when I charged them with it, they said they knew nothing about it. I gave the constable charge of them and sent them to the Compter.</p>
               <p>ANN MOUNTAIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 17th of April, between six and seven in the evening while he was attending the two prisoners, I placed myself at the end of the counter, as he was shewing them the cloaks. They seemed to think the cloaks too small. He said, Mountain, is there not a larger one, a 6th, I said, I believed there was, and fetched the cloak; I was going to try it on; she said, Did I think she never put a cloak on; what business had I there? I had more need go about my business. I begged her pardon, and went to the end of the compter. They bid my master twelve shillings for a cloak which cost him twenty-two shillings and six-pence. They were going out; my master lifted up the counter and followed them and clapped his hand upon each of their shoulders, and then Kent dropped the cloak from under her cloak; I saw her drop it just within the sash; it lay on the ground till the constable came, and he took it up.</p>

               <p>I live in the same house with Hicks, on the back room of the ground floor; my door opens to the stair foot. These people go out to get their bread, and when they are out I generally enquire who goes up and down. I had been ill from the Wednesday till this Friday, then I was up sitting by the fire; my door was open. About three in the afternoon I heard some people go up stairs, but did not see them; I called to know who they were, who they wanted, knowing there was nobody in the house but myself they gave me no answer.</p>
               <p>Did you go up after them? - No, I was not able. They came down in about ten minutes after; hearing them coming down I got up and went to the door as well as I could; I saw two women, the first had passed me, I did not see her face; the last was Hatfield. I do not know whether the first was the evidence or Hickes, they had both brown gowns on. I said to the first of them, whom did you want? she said she had seen them she wanted. Hatfield turned round and smiled, and said the other only wanted her sister.</p>
               <p>How do you know the one that spoke was Hatfield? - By her face.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before? - No. They went out.</p>
               <p>How soon after did you see Hatfield? - On the Tuesday after, at the Lord Mayor's.</p>
               <p>Did you know her again immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure Hatfield is one of the persons who came down stairs? - Yes. Soon after they went away somebody else went up. I did not see who it was; I said, is that Poll? I thought it was a girl Hicks had sometimes to do things for her. She said nothing.</p>
               <p>How many went up? - One only,

One of them bid me tell her husband if he came home, she was gone to the Dolphin, and the other bid me tell her husband she was just gone out a little way. There was nobody left in the house but me.</p>

               <p>After you got up did you hear any body go up between one and three o'clock? - No, only the two people that went out. The accomplice said they fetched them out to take them to drink while they committed the robbery.</p>

               <p>I live at the sign of the Cock in Hand-alley, Cock-hill. On the 14th of April, I lived in Gravel-lane; the prisoners both lodged in my house. About half after three o'clock that day I was told Hicks was detected with some stolen things. I went to her room; there I saw Hicks and the other prisoner. The man who was at work with me was ordered by a woman to take them into custody, for that the goods were stolen. I said to my man, you are not an officer, you cannot take charge of her, we will send for Mr. Withers, which I did. Mrs. Hatfield took hold of two gowns which seemed to be quite new, both of a pattern. She said one of these is mine and the other is my sister's. I saw all the things there which are mentioned in the indictment except the woollen cloak. Then Mary Hatfield said her uncle had sent her three guineas and a half to get the things out of pawn, and that she had but one hall guinea left.</p>

               <p>Do not they live together in the same house? - Yes, one in one part of the house and the other in another. I found this apron (producing it) in Hicks's drawer. I found nothing in Hatfield's room.</p>

               <p>I keep a water cart at Hampstead, I was at the Cock and Crown at Hampstead. The prisoner asked me to carry a parcel which was in the Cock and Crown; that was on Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Do you know what that parcel was? - It appeared to be pewter wrapped up in a coarse cloth; it weighed about three quarters of an hundred weight. I carried it about twenty or thirty yards and put it into the boot of the Hampstead coach to come to London; this was between eight and nine in the morning; she desired me to take it from the Cock and Crown, and put it in the boot of the coach as fly as I could that the master of the coach might not see me put it in left the man should get turned away from his place.</p>
               <p>Was there any direction on it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she go into the coach? - No. She went back with me to the Cock and Crown to give me half a quartern of gin for carrying it and putting it into the coach.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish it to be pewter? - I just saw it and felt it and shook the plates together. The bottom parcel was large, the top smaller.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No, I never saw her before in my life.</p>

               <p>Gale. She came to town in my coach; I put her bundles in the coach myself. This parcel was put in another coach.</p>

               <p>The prisoner came to the Cock and Crown about ten minutes after seven as nigh as I can recollect on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I drive a Hampstead stage for Mr. Davis. She asked me what time I should go to town; I said about nine o'clock. She asked me to carry a parcel for her to London. I asked her where it was; she said she would go and fetch it, and when my coach was driven out she was walking backwards and forwards before my master's door. I asked her, where is your parcel? she said I have put it in the boot. I asked her if she went down in the coach; or if there was a direction on it? She said no, I might leave it at Mr. Chandler's, the corner of Great Russel-street, Tottenham-court-road. She said she had not done her business, and could not go then. I staid a while and going to town catched Mr. Gale's coach, and she was on the box of his coach. I thought it was very odd. We stopped at the corner of Russel-street, and Gale's coach drove up behind me; and she came to my coach and demanded the parcel; I took it out, it was very heavy; I rested it on the wheel when I let it down on the pavement, the plates chinked, the wrapper was open. I had the curiosity to see what it was. I saw it was pewter. She took the parcel from me, and paid me three pence for the carriage, and I lodged it in the shop. Chandler keeps a great grocer's shop, the corner of Russel-street.</p>

The compting-house is in the side of the shop, and has a view of every part of the shop except just the door. I turned round to see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100012"/>who it was. She asked for some muslin. I thought she had a suspicious appearance, and therefore came into the shop to watch her. I then saw the prisoner standing in the doorway; I had not seen her before.</p>
               <p>The woman in the red cloak was not the prisoner? - No. When I first saw the prisoner in the shop I saw something white hanging under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner been in your shop? - She was standing in the door-way in the shop waiting, to all appearance, for the woman who came to ask for the muslin. She had been in the shop, but had not asked for any thing.</p>
               <p>Was she within reach of the counter? - Yes, she was within reach of the counter. She had a on a black cloak. I saw this piece of muslin under her cloak. I advanced to her and put my hand under that part of the cloak where I saw the muslin. Then I turned her round, and said to my shopman who was with the other woman, be witness that this woman has concealed a piece of muslin under her cloak. He said he saw it. I immediately sent for a constable. She said it was very hard when a person came into the shop that I should put a piece of muslin under her cloak and charge her with a theft; that was all she said.</p>

               <p>You do not know how long she had been in the shop? - I did not see her come in.</p>
               <p>You do not know whether she bought any muslin? - I am sure she did not.</p>
               <p>This is an open shop, where you exposed your goods to sale? - It is.</p>
               <p>This is the piece of muslin you found upon her? - It is; it has my mark upon it. There was about six yards and a half of it.</p>
               <p>Do you know where it lay? - We had been very busy and there was a parcel of muslins lay upon the counter by the side of the prisoner. This piece lay there.</p>
               <p>Is it a whole piece or a remnant? - It is neither, it is a cut piece.</p>
               <p>Did you know that it had been cut before? - Yes; I cut it myself; it is marked in characters, one mark by my man and the other by me: this is my mark.</p>
               <p>What is the meaning of that mark? - The price that it cost.</p>
               <p>How long ago did you mark that? - I marked it in the month of February.</p>
               <p>She submitted to be searched, and did not attempt to run away? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you seen this piece that day? - Yes, that very day.</p>

               <p>The gentleman asked me what I wanted; I said a piece of dark cotton. He took me round the waist and pushed me to the counter. He took that piece of muslin and said I had taken it. He said he had been robbed the day before, and if it lay in his power to hang me he would, for he would do it to deter others. And then sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I said I would take every step that the law would afford me; that it was a very serious matter to her, and I would prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the value of this piece as it is now? - It cost me nine shillings and sixpence per yard. There are six yards and an half of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I desired to be searched; he would not search me. I lived servant last. I was at home with my friends. I live in the country. I did not think it necessary to have any witnesses to my character, as I was innocent.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Prosecutor. Are you sure that muslin was not sold after you saw it, before you found it upon the prisoner? - I am very certain, because I brought it myself to shew a customer.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife to the last witness. On Monday the 1st of May my husband brought the prisoner home to sing him a song, and said he would give her a draught of beer; my husband went to the publick-house to order some beer.</p>
               <p>How came your husband to bring this woman home to sing him a song, did he frequently entertain you in this way? - No, never before; there was nobody in the house but she and me; the watch was on the mantle-piece. I missed the watch. I said to her, my husband's watch was here just now! She said, that he had taken it down and put it in his pocket. I said I was sure he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see it there when he went out; - Yes, some time after he was gone.</p>
               <p>How long was he gone? - Three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>How soon after he was gone did you miss the watch? - It might be a quarter of an hour, I cannot say to a minute; she sat on one side of the fire and I on the other; I might get up for something.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner ever out of your sight, did you leave her by herself? - No. The watch was on the mantle-piece, on the right hand side where she sat; I sat on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>How high was the mantle-piece? - Not very high, one might sit on a chair and reach it.</p>
               <p>Was the mantle piece no higher than a persons head who sat on a chair? - Very little if they sat on a high chair; she sat on a low chair; it was above her head; the chain was hanging down off the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>You missed it, and told the prisoner you missed it? - Yes. She said, she saw it there; that the chain was hanging down; that she saw him take it out with him.</p>
               <p>How came you not to put the chain up when you saw it hanging down, was not you afraid it would fall? - No; it lay so for days and days; I went to Mr. Hopkins's to my husband, and took the prisoner with me.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you missed the watch before you went to look for your husband? - Near half an hour. I waited in expectation of his coming back; I asked him if he knew any thing of his watch. He said, it was at home on the mantle piece. I said it was not at home.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he generally leave it there when he went out? - He never carried the watch out at any time, it was always left on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - I did not see the prisoner much more that night.</p>
               <p>Did you let her go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Without searching her? - I did not know what to do. She came to me the next morning and asked me how I did, and whether I had found the watch? I said no. She said she was sure my husband had taken it, and she supposed one of the press gang had whipped it out of his pocket; there was a press gang. I went to the pawnbroker's and desired if such a watch was brought, describing it, they would stop it; they told me such a watch had been offered there half an hour before by a woman in a striped gown, but they had not taken it in.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the watch? - Yes; upon the prisoner, on Tuesday the 2d of May. We sent for an officer and had her taken before Justice Clarke; and the officer found it under her petticoats.</p>

               <p>When I went into the publick-house Brown was sitting by the fire place with a pint of beer; he asked me to drink; his wife came and asked him to go home; and he desired me to go home with him and sing him a song. She said, young woman come home with him, that I may get him home. I went home with him and his wife, and he went and fetched a quartern of liquor and gave me and his wife some of it; he then put his watch in his pocket and went out for some beer, and did not come in again; when the ale-house man came for the pots she quarelled with him and broke the glass and cut her hand; he gave me the watch and said, he would make the bitch believe he had lost it. I went in the morning and asked her how her hand did? She said, it was better, but that the rogue had lost his watch, and the villain would not let her advertise it. I said never mind, it was not lost, she would hear of it very soon. I had the watch in my pocket. I did not mean to keep it.</p>
               <p>To the constable. Was the watch in her pocket? - No; when I took her, she denied having the watch, and refused to let me search her.</p>

I rather put my head on one side and lifted up my cane, the other, that stood close to him, got hold of my wrist, turned me round, and wrenched the cane out of my hand.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A surgeon in his majesty's service; the young lady who was in my company gave a sort of a scream. I apprehend he might imagine I was going to make an attempt to seise him, upon which he clapped his hand up my shoulder and said, Sir, your life or your money this moment! One had hold of my collar. I saw them pull the young lady about. I said do not use she young lady ill; I will give you what I have, I knew I had both gold and silver in my pocket; I thought I had given it him all, but the next day I discovered that I had given him only a shilling.</p>
               <p>You have said nothing to the prisoner, was he one of those people? - I cannot say whether he was or not; he was stopped about fourteen or fifteen yards from me by a person in court. I was asked whether he was one of them? I believe, I might then say he was. I might then say more than a man would wish to speak, if he was cool; but as for his being one I cannot say I know it. I desired the young lady to give them what she had. She said, she had done so; then the men ran off; there was a single horse chaise came by; the man whom I gave my money to ran off, and at that very instant I heard some other people come up the same road I was going. I called out</p>
               <p>"take care of yourselves, here are some footpads;" upon which one of the witnesses stopped the prisoner and said, Sir, is this one of them? I told him he might be one.</p>

               <p>I was coming home from Paddington last Sunday was month, which was the 9th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100015"/>April, at about nine o'clock at night, between Tottenham Court Road turnpike and the Duke of Bedford's private road, with Mr. Williams, we heard a noise of a woman crying, seemingly as if she was in distress. I went a little forward, rather faster upon hearing the cry; when we came within eight or ten yards of them, I saw three or four men round Mr. Creamer and a young lady; upon my approach three man ran from me, and one walked softly towards me. I looked at him as he passed me; as soon as he came by me, a gentleman came up and said, gentlemen they are all footpads; they have robbed me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was one of them? - Yes; I saw him come from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Did he attempt to run away? - No, not the least in the world, he walked softly; as he had passed me four or five yards, the gentleman came up and said, Stop gentlemen, they are all footpads, and they have robbed me. I went immediately after the prisoner, and stopped him. I said to the gentlewoman is this of one them? She said, the man who held me has an handkerchief tied round his neck.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the young lady here? -</p>
               <p>Creamer. She says she was so much frightened that it is not in her power to swear to the men; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Avis. Mr. Creamer said he believed him to be the man; the prisoner had a blue handkerchief with white spots tied in a bow under his chin when I laid hold of him; he made some resistance; when he made resistance Mr. Williams came up and took the stick out of his hand (producing a very large stick) which he was going to make resistance with.</p>
               <p>What was it o'clock? - About eight.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - Moonlight, but at times rather cloudy. I took him by the gentleman's desire to the first publick-house; there Mr. Grubb was sent for. I saw him come from the gentleman, and he never quitted my sight till I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing upon him? - Nothing but a cord with a slip noose to it, and a knife.</p>
               <p>What distance was you from Mr. Creamer when you saw four people about him? - Very near, I suppose not more than nine or ten yards.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I had an information that there were some footpads out; I was fetched from my house; just as I came to Tottenham Court they said they had one in at a publick-house who had robbed a gentleman. I went there and took the prisoner into custody; the people there said he had thrown something away in the field where he was apprehended. I get a link and looked among the grass but could see nothing. The next morning we went there, and there were some people who had found a cane, but we did not find it ourselves.</p>

               <p>To the prosecutor. Did the other three run away? - Yes, three ran one way and one the other. This witness says he saw two or three run away from me. When I was at the office where the men were examined, I was attacked for want of candour and honesty; a man in the office had even the insolence to tell me, because I was doubtful within my own breast, he finding the man was not likely to be convicted, told me I was as bad as a thief myself, because I would not convict him. I said I should be glad to know whether in an office like that people were to be insulted in that manner? He said, if the cap fitted me I might wear it. I said a very little altering of it would make it sit himself. My Lord, what I do here is by mere compulsion; the morning following<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100016"/>when I went to the office some evasions were made, the lad could not be brought to be examined. I said when I came out of the publick-house, let that man go, the effect it has had upon me is such that, should that man's life be affected, I should never be happy nor the young lady, for she was very unhappy at what she said in her hurry; those two men who robbed me parted from me some moments before the other parted away, when I saw him I could not recollect him, though I stood so very near him.</p>
               <p>Court. Who at the office found fault with you for not being more positive, it was a very scandalous conduct? - He was a stout man, I do not know his name.</p>

On Tuesday the 2d of May, the two prisoners at the bar came into my shop under pretence of looking at some callico for gowns. Davis, after seeing several, said, she would come or send again; and desired I would give her a card of the shop; it was only Davis asked to look at the callico.</p>
               <p>Was any body else in the shop with them? - No. I was at dinner in the parlour; there was no one in the shop. I went into the shop to them. I turned round to reach a card for her (as I had suffered much I was very suspicious of them) I turned back and saw the tall one standing rather open to hide the other. I gave her the card; and just as I had given her the card I saw a piece of muslin under the other's apron. I observed a man standing at the door looking very significant at them, as they always go in a gang; and the short one, who had got the muslin, went to the door. As I know the practice is to give it to a person without, and then to hand it off, I laid hold of her arm and pulled her back. She had by that time got her gown covered over it; it was all huddled together, and she immediately dropped the muslin. I had hold of her arm; it had my shop mark on it; it had just come in, and had never had the wrapper put upon it.</p>
               <p>What quantity is it? - A whole piece, it had never been cut.</p>
               <p>What was the value of it? - It cost me four pounds ten shillings that very same day.</p>
               <p>DAVIS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I asked him to let me look at a piece of chintz pattern, which I wanted for an acquaintance. I said they were not fine enough. He said there was a piece at the other end of the shop he thought finer; he shewed it me. I asked him the price; he told me. I said it was a great price; if you will oblige me with a card I will give it the gentlewoman, she may come herself; he went in with this young woman and pushed the shop door to. He said, he had been robbed two or three days before, and he would make her pay for them all. I knew this young woman four or five years ago. I met her accidentally at the end of the Fleet Market, and went with her. I never knew her guilty of any thing of the sort, in my life. I was obliged to stand before her, because I was looking at a piece of chintz.</p>
               <p>MORGAN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I never saw the muslin till it lay upon the ground. The gentleman shut the door directly, and said, he supposed I meant to rob him.</p>

On the 15th of April, the prisoner looked in at my window and then he went away again. I was sitting at supper, it was past eleven at night; there is no glass to that part of the shop, it is open. he returned again in two or three minutes, and put his hand under the kit and lifted it up. I observed he looked hard on the other side of the way, and then left the tub and went away again. I staid to watch him; he came again in three or four minutes and took the tub of salmon off. I ran after him directly; he turned up an alley. I ran after him and catched him with the tub of salmon in his hand, and the glass was upon it. When I caught him he said, what can you do with a drunken man? I gave the watchman charge of him; he did not appear to be drunk.</p>

               <p>What is your business? - I do something in the Mercery branch. On Thursday the 20th of April, as I was passing by Clerkenwell New Prison, I observed two women, I accosted one of them by the name of Betty and said Betty, how do you do? How does your brother Joseph do? I thought I knew her; the fact proved otherwise. She immediately answered she was very well, her brother Joseph was pressed over night, and was in the New Prison, Clerkenwell, but that he would be discharged the following day. And she asked me to go in and see him. I told her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100018"/>I was desirous of seeing the prison, but that I was rather timerous of going in; at last she persuaded me, by telling me it was very safe. I went in, and we sat down.</p>
               <p>I should think if she had not been your acquaintance you must have found it out before you went in? - I did not find it out till the pretended brother appeared; then I discovered my mistake, and said is this your brother.</p>
               <p>Is the woman you took her to be, a woman of virtue! - She is. When we had seated ourselves the pretended brother did not appear directly. One of them wanted to drink; I offered to treat them, and ordered the liquor.</p>
               <p>Both the women went in? - Yes; when that was drunk we called for some more.</p>
               <p>What was it you had? - Spirituous liquors. The first was half a pint of rum. When the first liquor was brought in,

She observed me tremble; she said, what do you tremble for; I said I was not much used to the inside of a prison. They said we should go round the prison.

               <p>On the 20th of April at about six in the evening, my son saw the prosecutor at Justice Blackborough's door, and brought him to Redgrave and me; he was so intoxicated in liquor we could hardly understand what he said, he told us he had been robbed; I asked him by whom; he said he could not tell. He said suppose you was in a prison, and people put something over your eyes and threw you down and robbed you, how could you tell who did it? He prevailed on me to go with him to the jail. I went and told the turnkey the matter, and then asked the prosecutor if he knew who had robbed him; he said he did not. He said there were two women he should know because they had light cloaks. I laid hold of the two women. He said he had nothing to say against them; he did not know who robbed him. He came to me the next morning, and said, he thought Madan was the likeliest man to rob him. I went with him to the prison, and the prisoners were brought out before him; he said he believed there was not any one person there whom he had seen before. A person called out

               <p>Did he say he was on the bed with one of the women? - Yes; he said he went into a room where there were four beds, and he and a woman were on the bed; the first day he said that he had been robbed of two guineas and an half, and eight shillings and sixpence; afterwards he said he was not robbed of the eight and sixpence, that he gave that to the woman.</p>

At the corner of Great Ormond-yard he said, that out of that house he and Trubshaw had got a couple of large pictures, and said they were in the possession of this Mrs. Shaw; he asked me if I knew where to dispose of them for him? I told him I would see what I could do for him, because I lived with a picture frame maker in the Strand; when I was taken up I shewed Jealous the house they were taken out of.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. The prisoners were apprehended on another charge in the country, and brought to the office, in Litchfield-street. We searched them and found some watches in their pockets, and the key of their room in Mary-la-bonne, and there we found these things (producing them) and the bills of parcels. I put the bills of parcel in my pocket, which has since been picked of them.</p>

The prisoners came into my shop and asked to look at some coloured silk stockings; whilst I was shewing her them a lady came for some cotton stockings; I left the prisoner and went to attend the lady. While I was serving the lady, I perceived the prisoner's hand in a position that led me to suspect she had concealed some stockings. As soon as the lady was gone out, I went to the prisoner; she fixed on a pair, and asked me the price of them; I put them in a piece of paper for her. I asked her how she could come to the shop under a pretence of only buying a pair; she told me not to suspect her. I took her cloak aside, and there was these stockings (producing them) under her arm.</p>

Mr. Ryder having an intention to quit the house applied to me to receive the key of the house, and to shew the house to any person who might be desirous of taking it; I agreed to it; the key was left at my house. There was a considerable quantity of furniture left in it. All the things mentioned in the indictment, except the tea-kettle and lamp; I saw in the house at the time the key was left with me. Upon the 18th of April, a gentleman called on me about five in the evening for the purpose of looking at the house. I tried to open the door, but to no effect. The next day I sent for a smith, and then we found the lock had been broken. We were obliged to open the door by force. I found some brass locks, which had been broke, and some pokers and tongs, and two senders lying on the parlour floor. I then went up to every room in the house. The locks had been broken off most of the chamber doors. I observed that two of the bath stoves had been taken away. When I came down stairs I missed the copper. The cellars were broke open and a quantity of wine was gone. Three pier glasses were taken away, and the glass lantern was gone which had been taken down and placed in an apartment below stairs, and three locks and keys were taken away, and several were lying upon the floor; several more had been attempted which they could not get off.</p>
               <p>What occasion had they to break off those locks if they did not take them away? - They were laid upon the parlour floor ready to be taken off at another opportunity.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the fact of the prisoners being concerned in it? - No. This was Tuesday the 18th. On Wednesday morning a smith came; we got in; I went to Mr. Ryder's chambers, at Lincoln's Inn, and told him what had happened; I went to Sir

The smith mended the lock and nailed up the door where the wine had been taken out, and bolted and barred the doors as strong as he could; on the Thursday morning I went into the house, and found then by the saw-dust about the floor that they had been at the wine again. There was a piece taken out of the door and a great quantity of wine had been taken out. I went to Sir

               <p>How came you to know the taste of your master's wine? - I fancy there are few servants that do not know the taste of their master's wine.</p>

               <p>Was there any thing else which you knew there that was your master's property? - Yes; there was a tea-kettle and lamp, I verily believe to have been my master's, and two hat-pins, which are the same pattern as those which are left in my master's house; the tea-kettle and lamp produced I can safely swear is my master's property; it is very old fashioned; it was left to Mrs. Ryder by her grandmother.</p>

On the 20th of April I went to Cross-lane in Parker-street, St. Giles's, to apprehend the prisoners; there having been an information made against them; there was a person, whose name was Clarke, who shewed us where they lodged, they had separate lodgings. In Trubshaw's room I saw three dozen of wine standing by the bed side; in another room there was more. We took the wine away that was in Trubshaw's room, and in the next room, in which Hawkins lodged, we found some more wine, which we likewise took away.</p>
               <p>Was it white or red wine? - There was red wine and white wine of different colours; we took the wine to the Brown-Bear, in Bow-street; the servant saw it there. In searching Trubshaw's clothes we found a tinder-box with tinder in it, matches, flint, steel, and two pieces of candle in his pockets, and between the sacking and the bed I found this dark latern (producing it) and I found these keys (producing about twenty or thirty) and this strong screw turner (producing it) this kettle and lamp came out of the house but who brought it out I cannot say that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Were there any brass screws? - In Trubshaw's room I found these two brass pins (producing them). (It appeared that the screws were the same with those which were left in the room.)</p>

They said they knew of a house which had been empty a long while.</p>
               <p>Where did you lodge at this time? - In the same house Trubshaw did, the corner of Cross-lane; Steward had, in play, cut the hand of a young woman who lived with me; she was going to the hospital. I knew I must be up early in the morning to go with her, therefore I declined going with them; they went by themselves; they were up about four o'clock in the morning; they knocked against my room door; I answered them; they said I should be sorry I had not been with them; they said they had got about four guineas. I asked them in what? They said they had got some looking-glasses, and other thing which would fetch them about four guineas.</p>
               <p>Who said that? - Trubshaw.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the other men where in his company? - Yes. I said, I did not care; the glasses and pewter plates where fetched away before I got up. They then asked me if I would go with them at night to fetch the other things, some coppers, and brass stoves? I accordingly did go with them, on Tuesday night; we fetched two Bath-stoves, a glass lantern, and a copper away; we took them down to Mrs. Mailing's house in Turnmill-street. On Wednesday morning Steward, I, and Million, went again to get some brass locks which were upon the doors. Trubshaw did not go with us then. He said, his head aked so, so he would not get up; we took three or four brass locks off the doors, and a copper, senders, pokers, shovels and tongs, and laid them in the fore parlour, ready to take away; we went down stairs; we saw a door locked; we took the door off the hinges and in that cellar there was a quantity of wine.</p>
               <p>What quantity did you take away of the wine? - A great quantity; we went backwards and forwards different times; we then left the brass locks, sender and shovel, in the parlour. We carried off as much wine on Wednesday morning as we could, till it was almost day light. On Wednesday morning Trubshaw and Million got up and went to fetch away the remainder of the wine; the wine that was fetched then was what was found in his room.</p>
               <p>How do you know they went to fetch more wine, unless you was with them? - Because he called me and I would not get up; and when Sir

I drank some of his wine, and was taken with a fit; and in the fit he brought wine into the room, and threw all over my face, and swore he would strangle me if I could not drink; when I came out of the fit again he asked me to let him leave the wine bottles in my room till night. He said it came out of the country from his relations. I said he might; and these gentlemen came and took the wine out of my room; and the two brass hooks, found in my room, he gave the woman I inhabit with for a chimney line.</p>

               <p>Trubshaw. He made these pick-lock keys with files; he came into my room several times; he said he was a watch-maker by trade; when I went into his room and saw him at work upon them I asked him what he was doing? He said, he was at work in his trade.</p>

               <p>I am wife to the last witness. On the 12th of April I lost a cloth cardinal and a gown. I went to the dispensary in Houndsditch, about ten o'clock; I left no one at home; I locked the door. I live in the lower part of the house, there are no other lodgers in the house but ourselves; the landlady lives in the one pair of stairs; some people work in her shop; she keeps a weaver's shop. I came back between eleven and twelve and found my door broke open; the lock was broke in two. I missed my gown and cloak out of the chest; my husband's clothes and the child's were in the chest, but I missed nothing else. I went and fetched my husband. I had no suspicion of any body. Eight or nine days after the landlady of the prisoner came to me and asked me if I had no suspicion of her; that she had money, and wanted to leave the lodging; she had lived servant at a publick-house just by, but was out of place.</p>
               <p>Where did she lodge? - Two doors from me. I spoke to her on the Sunday. She said, she would come to me, but did not. About a fortnight after she left her lodging. I went to Bishopsgate work-house; I saw her in the work-house yard. She said, she supposed I only wanted my things; she confessed she had taken them and pawned them for eighteen shillings, at Mr. Davison's in Bishopsgate-street. I went there and saw the gown hang up in the shop. I was surprised at that, as it was pawned; he then told me he had bought it out right; and he told me he had the cloak.</p>
               <p>What did you say to her to induce her to confess? - She said, she hoped I would not hurt her if I got my things. I said, I should be glad to get my things, and would be as tender as I could.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>EDWARD CLARKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am shopman to Mr. Davison, a pawnbroker, I know nothing of the prisoner; the things were brought to our shop by a Mrs. Busy, who is here as a witness; they were first pawned and afterwards sold out; she told me a long story that they belonged to a young woman, whose husband was pressed.</p>

             came to me and brought this gown and cloak in her lap. I cannot recollect the day of the month, nor the day of the week; she desired me to pawn them for her; that the young man was on board the tender. I have known her, on and off, some years; I never heard any harm of her; it was about the middle of April, to the best of my remembrance; I thought she came honestly by them; she said, the man was pressed where she was; and that his wife was in great distress, and asked me to pawn them for her. I asked her what the woman's demand was? She said sixteen shillings. I brought her sixteen shillings and a duplicate. She came to me again and said, the poor woman was in distress and must sell them out right; she had the duplicate and went with me and got two shillings more for them, and sold them out right.</p>
               <p>To Clarke. Did a woman come with her the second time? - Yes; I believe, it was the prisoner, but I am not sure.</p>
               <p>What might they be worth? - Not more than I gave for them to purchase; they might sell for twenty-two or twenty-three shillings.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Charlton. On going into my master's pantry, on the 14th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I found the prisoner behind the pantry door; he asked me for some person, whose name I do not remember; not knowing his person, and seeing that a pair of candlesticks and a table-cloth were removed from the place where I left them, I suspected he had no good design there. I prevented his going out of the pantry, and called one of my fellow servants; upon his coming up the prisoner took these snuffers and the stand from under his coat and put them on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Did you see him? - I did; they were left on the dresser to carry up into the parlour after dinner.</p>
               <p>(They were produced in court and deposed to by the witness.)</p>
               <p>How did he get in? - The area door was left upon, and the other door was not locked; he had two doors to open.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He behaved rather insolent to my master at first, and said he wanted somebody.</p>

               <p>I am a hair-dresser by business; I came there to enquire after a servant, whom I taught to dress hair; he was to give me a guinea. I met him by accident; he said he lived at St. John Charlton's, Esq. in Berner's-street; he desired me not to knock at the door but go down the area and open the door and go in; the gentleman called his servants about me, and asked if I knew any of them? I told him they were neither of them the persons.</p>

               <p>On the 7th of April, at about seven in the evening, while I was sitting in a back room adjoining to Mr. Mashador's shop, I heard a window break (he <rs id="t17800510-24-viclabel132" type="occupation">keeps a pawnbroker's shop</rs>

I ran out to see what it was, there was nobody there; but I observed that the window was broke by the plate board. I went in again and told Mrs. Mashador that her window was broke; and I thought there were some thieves about; she desired me to shut up the shop. I said no, I would watch them if I could; I went and stood in a publick-house opposite; the prisoner and two more came by the publick-house; they were in discourse; they looked at our house. About a minute after I saw the prisoner looking at the plate in the window by himself; he looked about on one side and the other, and then put his hand into the hole and drew something out; I could not see what it was; as soon as he had done so he held his hand down by his side and walked two or three steps, and then fell a running. I ran across the way and catched hold of him about three doors from our house; we had a struggle together; and one of the men, who were with him came up and swore at me, and asked me what I had to do with the man? I got hold of him by the collar. I said, I had him safe and would not let him go; he threw the spoon into the highway. I took up the spoon and carried him to a publick-house.</p>
               <p>(The spoon was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

I asked her what she had in her lap; she said nothing of mine. I said she had. Then she loosed her apron and threw the pots down. Some people gathered round us, and she was secured.</p>

               <p>I live close by the field. I keep a public-house; Mr. Waters puts up with me. Mr. Waters went out of town on Saturday, and left this cow, with three more in the field under my care. The three fat ones were to go to market on Monday morning; the other was to be taken care of till he came to town again. The salesman was to send for them. I saw the cow in the field on Sunday night at seven or eight o'clock; I missed her on the Monday. I enquired of every body whom I thought likely to give any information of her; but I did not hear of her till just as Mr. Waters came to town again, which was on the Wednesday following; then I found her in Mr. Martin's cow-house.</p>

               <p>Did you ever see him before? - Yes, many a time.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He goes about for one cow job and another, and drives to market, and such things as that, and he drives calves.</p>
               <p>Was this the cow which was owned at your house by Mr. Waters and Mr. Hayes? - It was. He drove my cow away; I have never seen her since.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Martin. The prisoner came to my master's house on Sunday and told him, he had a cow in calf to sell, and he would make a rap between my master's fat cow and that if he thought proper. He asked my master to go up and look at this same cow; my master was very poorly, and he could not go on account of his milk; this was in the morning. He came down again in the afternoon to our house; then I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100036"/>down with him; it was in the field along with the other three.</p>
               <p>You liked the cow did you? - Yes, she was likely to give some milk when she calved; I liked the looks of the cow well enough. I told my master the cow would suit him very well if they could agree.</p>
               <p>This is the cow which was found at your master's? - Yes the same cow.</p>
               <p>Did you go to drink at Mr. Hayes's? - Yes, we had a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Was that after you had seen the cow or before? - After. I paid for the beer myself, he was at the door with me, and drank part of the beer with me.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing about the cows to Mr. Hayes? - No.</p>
               <p>To Waters. Do you know the prisoner? - Yes; I have known him some years.</p>
               <p>Has he ever jobbed for you? - He lived with me about fifteen years ago.</p>
               <p>Did he ever use to drive your cattle for you? - He does as many at Islington do; when people buy cattle; they take them home. He has been a drover twenty years I suppose or better.</p>
               <p>You had not ordered him to sell this cow for you, had you? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Is he a married man? - Yes, we have two of his children in our workhouse; his wife has run away.</p>
               <p>PRISONER'S DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I lived in the prisoner's family five years; I lived with his brother from the beginning of his business to his ending; I have sold him a good many beasts in my life on time or other; he asked me to take the three beasts to market; he must have somebody and I might as well take them. I said that cow would not stay by herself; he said if I could find any body who would give a tolerable good price for her, I might sell her; I went down to Scotch Johnny; I have trusted him twenty pounds at a time. He has always behaved very civil; I had no thoughts of any thing of this. Somebody robbed me of two or three guineas of the money I sold the cow for, and I was ashamed to go to Mr. Waters, or this would not have happened.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Did you tell him he might sell them? - I would not have put him in trust to sell a cow for me. He asked to drive the three fat beasts to market for me? I said he might take them down; I would give him sixpence to take them down. Mr. Hayes had particular charge to take care of this cow, and to give her hay.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I drove the three fat cows down to market on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He delivered these three cows very safe to Mr. Bransworth; the cow he had of this man he put to one Lost to sell; he took the money she sold for and ran away.</p>
               <p>To Hayes. When you missed the cow on the Monday morning were the three fat cows remaining there? - No; they were all gone; then I enquired of the salesman at night; he told me this man had brought the three fat cows down to him. I thought then that the other cow had gone out of the field after them.</p>

               <p>How long did you stay with her? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>What money had you in your pocket? - As soon as I went into the room a woman came up and demanded three pence for the use of the room; I gave her three pennyworth of halfpence. I told the prisoner I was very dry and should be much obliged to her to send for a pot of beer; I gave her sixpence to pay for it; she sent the woman for it who came up into the room and demanded the three pence; the beer was brought; I told the woman she might keep the halfpence, and I did not take the change. I drank once of the pot of beer; she drank of it; then set it down. She asked me to give her a shilling? I pulled out all my money and held it in my hand. I had not a shilling; the loose money which I had, besides this guinea and a half, amounted to ten pence or ten pence halfpenny. I took the guinea and a half out from among my halfpence and put it in my right hand breeches pocket; the prisoner saw me do so; I gave her the halfpence; then we went upon the bed together.</p>
               <p>How long might you lie there? - I do not suppose above five minutes; during the conversation I found her left hand once or twice in my right hand breeches pocket; I removed her hand once or twice; I then felt her hand deeper in my pocket.</p>
               <p>This was all while you were upon the bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I suppose your breeches were down at this time? - Yes; undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive her take the money from you? - When I felt her hand deeper in my pocket she drew it out hastily; I put my hand into my pocket and immediately missed my money; I rose up and said, that kind of usage would not do with me; she asked me what? I said she had picked my pocket; she denied it; we had words; two men and a woman came up into the room, after some little conversation, they pulled me about; they pulled the eye off my jacket; they wanted to take charge of me to take me away. I swore I would not leave the room till I had my money returned; they wanted to search her; I objected to that; I did not know but they might be confederates. I was not out of the room, nor would I suffer them to go nigh her; they asked if they should search the room? I said, I had no objection to their searching the room. I looked with a candle and lantern upon the floor and the bed, and there was nothing found; they took both the prisoner and me to the watch-house. I there told the constable of the night my case; and the prisoner was taken to St. Giles's round-house; she was searched at the watch house but nothing was found upon her.</p>
               <p>What became of the men? - I do not know; they afterwards proved to be watchmen.</p>
               <p>What you called out thieves, I suppose? - I did not.</p>
               <p>What brought the watchmen up? - They said they had heard a noise as they passed by in the street; there were words; our conversation was rather loud, after I told her she had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Was the woman the same who fetched you the liquor? - To the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>You say you felt the prisoner's hand in your right hand pocket two or three times, but the last time you felt her hand deeper in your pocket? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When she drew her hand out hastily you got up immediately and felt the money gone; - I did.</p>

               <p>Did you look about the bed to see whether the money might have have been scattered? - No; the watchmen did.</p>
               <p>Are the watchmen here? - They are not.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When this man picked me up he went home with me; he sent for a pot of beer; he said he would give me all the money he had, which was ten pence halfpenny; when he gave it me I asked him if he had any more? He said he had no more money. I had not been with him above five minutes before he said he missed this money. He pulled his pocket out before to convince me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100038"/>he had no more money; when he gave it me, he said he would come to me again. I took it; he said he missed his money in five minutes after I was with him. I called up the landlady and said, this man said he missed his money. She went down and fetched up the watchmen. He would not believe that they were officers of the night; he would not let them come nigh me to search me; they insisted upon us both going to the watch house; they searched me there and found nothing about me; I had not a farthing in the world but what he gave me.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. How came you, as a private soldier, to have a guinea and a half in your pocket? - I live with an officer in town; I am his servant; I had six shillings and five pence when I set out in the morning. I had six weeks pay due to me, which, at five shillings and sixpence a week, amounts to one pound thirteen shillings, which the paymaster of the company paid me, excepting three halfpence; I spent all the rest, except the money I had in my pocket.</p>

               <p>When was this? - On Saturday the 29th of April; when I got up to Denmark-street I saw the prisoner about an hundred yards off, walking by the side of the gentleman, whom Forbes described, to have taken the bundle from him. The person whom Forbes described looked back, seeing me without a hat I imagine he had some suspicion. I drew back out of the road that they could not see me; they carried the bundle that it could not be seen by any body that was behind them. I walked on slowly after them; they got about three parts up the road before I got up to them. I stopped them and desired Joseph Davis to let me look at his bundle. I looked at it and said, I would swear it was my master's property. I took it from him and he ran away directly; I called out</p>

I had gone but a few steps before I was seised by my collar, on the right-hand side by the prisoner Humphreys, he demanded my watch and money or my life, or to that purpose. I was much frightened; I looked him in the face the whole time, and told him I had no money.</p>
               <p>Was it a dark or light night? - As fine a star-light night as ever was without a moon.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you tell whether he had his own hair or a wig? - He wore his own hair tied behind. In the interim that he took my watch, another man came up, put his head in my breast, and struck me in the groin. The first person still had hold of me. I could have been certain of Humphreys by his voice, if I had not seen him. I suppose the other man did that to look at my buckles; as I was in mourning, they were black. I said I had no money and my watch was gone. After they had searched my pockets, they both went away; I turned round and looked at them, and saw my brother at about the distance of three yards, seised hold of by another man, the two prisoners went to him; I heard him say I have only a guinea and three or four shillings, or to that purpose. The short man came back again, and then the prisoner, Humphreys, collared me again; they searched my pockets, and the short man took some halfpence out, they both went back again to my brother the second time; the man who had hold of me at that time, I suppose to be Johns, but I cannot swear to him. They went back again to my brother, and beat him about the head and breast with a bludgeon. I called to him and bid him give them what he had; he still persisting to save his property, was either tumbled down or knocked down, and then they burst his breeches open to seek for his watch. They were with him five minutes, I dare say, which makes me so positive to the prisoner, Humphreys. I looked at him the whole time; I had an opportunity to go away which I should have done had it not been for leaving my brother in that situation.</p>
               <p>You take upon you to swear positively to his person? - Yes, and his voice. I knew him directly as I saw him at Sir

            's and described the three men. At the same time I advertised my watch with the particulars; I never heard any thing more of them till last Friday night.</p>
               <p>What sort of a watch was it? - A<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100044"/>silver watch with a double case, it had a silver seal upon a swivel, with the initials of my name on one side, and a woman's head on the other. It had a base metal key, gilt, and a steal chain. I have never seen my watch since. I picked Humphreys out as soon as I saw him; I knew him by his person immediately. When he spoke I knew him by his voice.</p>
               <p>Was the third man a tall or a short man? - There were two tail men and one short one, about my size but lustier; one of the tall men was with my brother, and did not come to me.</p>
               <p>Was not you in such confusion as not to be able to make much observation upon their persons? - I was much confused at first; I looked the man full in the face. I could not think how he could get between my brother and me.</p>
               <p>What became of the little boy all this time? - He ran away immediately to the Adam and Eve.</p>
               <p>How old is he? - About ten I believe.</p>
               <p>Is your brother here? - No, he is not, he was held down by them and did not take notice sufficient to speak to the persons of any of them.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. He knows I lived within three doors of him for six weeks after this? - I never heard of it till after he was taken. I never knew that such a man lived there.</p>
               <p>Court. Had they regimentals on when they robbed you? - No; they were all very genteelly dressed; I took them for gentlemen when they passed us on the grass.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the colour of their clothes?</p>
               <p>Humphreys had a large fashionable flapped hat, a little turned up, a fort of a drab coloured coat pretty large, whether a great coat or a close-bodied coat I cannot say, but it was a light or a quaker's colour, white stockings, and a pair of white metal or silver buckles.</p>
               <p>Humphreys. I have been at his shop twenty times since the time he says I robbed him, to buy hearts, and kidneys, and things.</p>
               <p>Court. What shop do you keep? - A tripe and offal shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you ever seen Humphreys in your shop? - No.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prosecutor? - I do.</p>
               <p>He lives near you? - About half a dozen doors off.</p>
               <p>Can you tell any thing of Humphreys, on the 16th of March, which was of a Thursday? - I cannot tell, I never heard any thing to his prejudice till this affair.</p>
               <p>What was his general behaviour during the time he lodged with you, was he regular? - He always behaved exceeding civil and kind to every body in the place.</p>
               <p>Was he regular in his hours of coming home? - Pretty well; he generally used to come home about eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he used to go to the prosecutor's house to buy tripe or any thing? - They used to buy tripe and things but I do not know where they used to go.</p>
               <p>Did they use to dress tripe at your house? - They had a room up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did he pay you regularly for his lodging? - Yes; half a crown a week.</p>
               <p>Did he lay constantly in your house? - I do not know that; he was never out of a night, except once he was in the country to see his friends.</p>
               <p>Jury. What business did he follow while he lived with you? - He was a soldier, and the other was a tailor; I never went up into the room to see what they did; Brown lodged in my house, not the prisoner Johns.</p>
               <p>Jury. How did he use to appear in his apparel? - He always appeared very decent.</p>
               <p>Had he very genteel apparel? - Yes; he appeared rather genteel.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the prisoner Humphreys in any other clothes but regimental clothes? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What were they? - The clothes he has on now (a kind of claret colour.)</p>
               <p>Had he any other clothes besides them? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Was it his practice in the afternoon to take off his regimentals and put on these clothes or not? - I cannot recollect; I did not use to take much notice of them.</p>

Upon the 6th of April the prisoner and another woman came into the shop and asked for a sufficient quantity of cotton to make a bed gown. I produced the piece mentioned in the indictment, among many others, for them to choose a pattern out of; as I was leaning on the goods, persuading them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100046"/>buy a piece that seemed to please them, I felt something pluck under my elbow; I did not suspect them till then. As we had lost things before, I let them alone to do as they pleased, and turned round to the shelves to reach some other goods, in order to detect them.

I laid hold of her and turned her round, and as she turned I saw the piece of printed linen drop down from under her clothes. I took it up; it was exceeding warm, I imagine from bodily heat; we had no more of that pattern.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - No; I never saw her before last Tuesday was week, which was the 2d of May, at about six o'clock. I asked which was the nearest way to an acquaintance's of mine. I was coming from an acquaintance's in Long-Acre, it was about six in the morning.</p>
               <p>What business had you in Long-Acre at that early hour in the morning? - I was out of town the day before with a friend of mine, and I had lain in Long-Acre all night.</p>
               <p>What is your friend's name? - Mrs. Mayes, who is a millener in Long-Acre.</p>

The prisoner swore she would have money or else my heart I said I would not give her any; upon that she took hold of me behind, and took my cane out of my hand, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Did you walk with a cane? - Yes. I had a riding dress on; the prisoner took hold of my cane, the other took me behind by my hair, and another took me by the collar.</p>
               <p>What sort of a cane was it you rode with? - It cost eight shillings and sixpence, my own name was upon it; it was about the size, I suppose, of my little finger.</p>
               <p>How came they to knock you down? - With the violence they used, I suppose; I can declare solemnly upon my oath that while one held me down the prisoner took my breast buckle out of my shirt and my braid from behind my hair.</p>
               <p>Was that breast buckle set with garnets? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Did you lose a ring? - Yes, and two halfcrowns out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>Did the prisoner take the ring? - I cannot say which of the three took it when they had me down, but I can safely swear she took my breast buckle out.</p>
               <p>Where had you been dressed up in this manner? - I had been down to the forest to see my two children.</p>

               <p>Was your friend a male or a female? - A female.</p>
               <p>Did you travel on horseback or in a phaeton? - I went and came in the stage to Illford, the rest I walked.</p>
               <p>I suppose Covent Garden was full of people; the market begins at four in the morning; there must have been five hundred people in the market at that time? - I saw nobody but a parcel of men, who I suppose belonged to her; I had met them before; they had even broke the teeth in my head and cut me without mercy; I never set my eyes upon her before; it was because I would not give her money to drink.</p>
               <p>And you saw nobody but those men you took to be accomplices with this woman? - None.</p>
               <p>In What part of the piazzas was it? - This end of the piazzas.</p>

               <p>Jury. Tuesday is a market morning, there are five hundred people about at that time? - I came right through the little piazzas into the great piazzas.</p>
               <p>You came down James-street, did not you? - I cannot really say, I do not know much of Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>Which way did you come from Long-acre? - Just by the coachmaker's.</p>
               <p>Where was you going? - I was going home.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you been in bed all night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>With Mrs. Mayes? - With her maid servant.</p>
               <p>Was the ring on your finger? - Yes, and plumes of feathers in my hat, and a band and loop.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 2d of May this girl came to the office, in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Which girl? - The last witness, I call her a girl. She came for a warrant against some people for beating her and robbing her of the things mentioned in the indictment. She did not know the name of either of them, so no warrant could be granted.</p>
               <p>Did she apply for a warrant against one or two? - For three. I saw she was very bad, her eye was swelled up prodigiously and very black. She said she had been so treated by three girls. She described them. She said she must have a warrant. I desired her to go home and take care of her eye. I thought she was drunk by her appearance.</p>
               <p>What time in the morning might it be? - About seven in the morning. I heard no more of it till the Friday following. It was then my watch-night. She brought a girl at night charged by the watch, into the round-house, and said this was one of the girls who had ill-used her.</p>
               <p>Was that person the prisoner? - No. I kept her all night, as a night charge; I had her before a magistrate in the morning. The prosecutrix said that was not the girl who robbed her, but that she was one who had struck her. The justice asked her if she knew who it was that had robbed her; she said yes, and if the justice would give leave, she would go with the constable and shew where to find them. I went with her into Dyot-street, there I found the prisoner; I asked the prisoner what she had done with the braid or bit of hair, she took from the girl's head; she said she had sold it to a barber in Drury-lane, for six-pence, and would shew me the barber's; she accordingly went and shewed me.</p>
               <p>Did the prosecutrix give you any reason for the suspicion, she had of the prisoner or give you any information how she had found her out? - No, it was by the other girl who was taken that the information was got.</p>
               <p>Did she charge the woman she brought the night before? - She said she was one of those who used her ill, but she was not the person who robbed her; the other girl when she came before the magistrate said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100048"/>would shew who the person was that robbed her.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutrix. Was the woman you brought to the watch-house one of the three women who attacked you? - Yes. She held me down, while they stamped upon me.</p>

               <p>I am a barber. I live at No. 5, Drury-lane. I bought this braid (producing it) of the prisoner for sixpence.</p>

               <p>I met this young woman at the corner of the great piazzas; she was talking to a young man. Another young woman who was along with me, went up to her and asked her for something to drink; she lifted up her cane, and hit the young woman on the head with it. I asked her what that was for, she hit me. Then she went into the piazzas, took off her hat, and gave it a man to hold while she fought me. When she found she could not get the upper hand of me, she got a chairman to beat me, who knocked me down in the high road and would have killed me, I suppose, if people had not come up. I have neither father nor mother.</p>

On Friday night the 5th of May, having been taking leave of two or three acquaintances who were going to sea, I was going home to Hayen-street near Burlington-street, at between eleven and twelve o'clock. I met a watchman, I asked him if he could take me to any private lodging where I could lodge for a night, for I knew it was past the hour of my getting in at home? The watchman said he could; he took me to the prisoner at the bar, she lodged in <placeName id="t17800510-38-crimeloc207">Church-alley, between Fetter-lane and Chancery-lane</placeName>

               <p>Did you ask for a lady to lodge with you or only for a lodging? - Only for a lodging for that night.</p>
               <p>Was you drunk or sober? - I was not quite sober; the prisoner was standing a little way from the door without an hat. I found there was a correspondence between the watchman and she by his conversation; his name is Tankard. She lit a candle and took me into an apartment. I thought it was a private house, and that she was the mistress of it; it was a ground floor which has formerly been a kitchen; the watchman desired me to give him something for leading me there. I had four guineas in my pocket. I pulled one out and asked her if I could trust the watchman with that guinea? She said yes, he was a very honest man; he was gone some time to get change, and when he came back he brought, I believe, the quantity of half a pint of rum for him and she to drink together. I asked her to give the watchman sixpence or a shilling; I had not the change till the next morning, and then there were three shillings short.</p>
               <p>And lay alone? - Yes, all night; I had no communication with the woman, nor had I any thoughts of the kind. I awaked between four and five, as near as I could guess, and found I had been robbed. I had not been awake above ten minutes before the mistress of the house came in; she saw me, and saw I was a stranger. She said, where is the lady that brought you in here last night? I said I did not know, I wish I did. She said she hoped nothing was the matter. I said yes, she has taken three guineas out of my pocket and my watch; she pursued her directly into Chancery-lane and there she was taken; She brought her back to me; and I saw the prisoner pull my knee buckles out of her pocket and throw them on the bed; she handed the shoe buckles to another woman and that woman gave them to me. She swore and blasted herself, as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100051"/>much as ever I heard a sailor in my life time, that she had none of my money. I sent for the constable; when he was coming in she desired me to hold fast the door that he might not come in, and she would give me what she had got; she laid the seventeen and sixpence and the halfpence all together upon the table; she then made a pretence to take up the chamber pot from the side of the bed and go to the other side where the curtain was drawn; there I saw her leave a guinea; then I opened the door and let Mr.

I went by the gentleman's desire to the pawnbroker's, that if she should happen to come there they might stop her. In the interim, the landlady went to Mr. Flemings's the pawnbroker's to stop her; a woman who lives in the court followed her and said, she has dropped a watch. I think she said she picked it up; I did not see the watch but saw the chain, and I saw the prisoner have two guineas and some silver in a nutmeg-grater, which the woman who picked the watch up afterwards shewed me; she had given her the money. I said, she had better give it the gentleman again; when the money was produced from that woman to her again, I saw her put one guinea in her mouth; afterwards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100052"/>she took it out of her mouth and put it up her petticoats.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This girl is a woman of the town, as well as myself; I went down to buy a gown; this gentleman followed me with his face all over blood; he insisted upon following me home. I ran up different places to drop him, because he was so deep in liquor; he followed me till at last I got to my own door; he insisted upon going with me, and lying with me. I said, I did not choose he should, he being so much in liquor; I said there was the bed, if he chose to lie in it he was welcome; he insisted upon my taking two guineas; he desired me to send a watchman for some liquor; I called Mr. Tankard to the house; he fetched the liquor; he drank the liquor and went into bed; he insisted upon my coming to bed, which I would not do. I did not see the watch. I came back in the morning in half an hour and sat down in a chair till half an hour after five, then I went out to the pawnbroker's, having some little money in my pocket, besides the gentleman's two guineas; I released a jacket and petticoat; when I came in the landlady laid hold of me and said I had robbed the gentleman; as I came along the court it was very full of people; there was a person, who keeps a house in the court, came in and laid a watch in my window and said it was his watch; those two young women who stood in the entry were never in my room; they are very desperate women and well known for false swearing, and Mr. Payne is a very particular acquaintance of their's; the gentleman gave me a couple of guineas; my door was open, so I cannot tell who might come in to rob him, or who might rob him before I came in. My landlady fetched the constable; she called me on one side and side, if I would give her part of the money she would clear me. I said I had not robbed him, therefore I could not give her any; Mr. Payne took me by the neck, after he had almost strangled me he let me loose; he then found a guinea under the paper upon the table; it is very possible that the gentleman might lay it there before he went to bed. I could have some gentlemen here to speak to my character, but I did choose to scandalize my relations.</p>

               <p>My father's mare was lost from Bray-mead on Sunday night, the 12th of September. I saw it in the mead between four and five o'clock in the afternoon; the mead is near two miles from our house. I went in the morning between four and five o'clock to fetch her out of the mead; she was gone; the mead is a common field unenclosed. We did not hear of her again till Mr. Horne found his waggon and gave us intelligence of her, in consequence of which I went last Tuesday was a week to Southgate. I saw her on Wednesday morning in a pond; a man was watering her; he took her into Mr. Grove's stable again. I owned the mare immediately.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was the mare you lost on the 12th of September? - I am.</p>

               <p>Did you tell them how it came to you? - I told them I had it of Davis's father; the waggon was at work for me ever since June last.

I turned round and saw a man coming after us, and two men lying in the grass opposite us almost ready to step down upon us. I ran away as fast as I could, in order to escape them; the two that were in the grass got up and pursued me; when I got to the turnstile in the field, one was close to me; I got through the turnstile before him, and ran half the length of the field, but finding I could not get away I stopped; he immediately clapped a pistol to my head and said I must give him my money. I told him I was but a working man and had a family of children; the other was at some distance. I had a stick in my hand; I thought to get an opportunity to knock him down; but the other came up and put a pistol to my pole behind my head; while I stood in that situation I gave them sometimes good words and sometimes bad; they insisted upon having my money. I put my hand under my apron to pull part of it out, and intended to conceal my watch chain, but the little one, the prisoner Brown, laid hold of the watch-chain and snatched it by force.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner Brown is the man who took your watch? - Yes; I have never had him out of my eye since, look which way I will I have him in my eye; they were with me about ten minutes; I could distinguish their faces very well; it was a starlight night; the other prisoner had his pistol to my head when I pulled the money out of my pocket; Lessingham received it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it was Lessingham? - I am positive of it; then Brown felt in my pocket; he said you have not delivered all your money, if you do not deliver it all this minute I will blow your brains out. I took all the money out of my pocket, but concealed it in my hand, and threw it upon the grass. The next morning I found three and sixpence, which was all the money I ever recovered; whether I had given them all except that three and sixpence the first time I cannot say; then they told me to go about my business and we parted; and I never saw them afterwards till I saw them at Sir

The prisoner is in the Coldstream regiment; he was not on duty; he came there by chance; the battalion he belongs to was on guard the next day; I remember the day because the battalion I belong to mounted guard that day, and then we are more particular.

He used to come backwards and forwards to a man that works for me. I never heard any but an honest character of him. On Saturday the 22d of April he came to my house, about half after seven in the evening, he staid their till the watch went ten; he was never out of the place. The man he used to come to was in a decline, and subject to fits. I was busy and sent for him to come and stay with me.</p>

On the 17th of April, as I was going home from a public-house between eleven and twelve at night; the prisoner picked me up. I had been drinking and was a little the worse for liquor. As I was coming up the Old Jewry, the prisoner took hold of my arm, and said, she wanted to speak with me. She pulled me down the Old Jewry, till we came to an alley on the right-hand; there she felt about my breeches, and wanted me to feel about her; I told her I did not understand that. Then I put my hand to my watch, and felt I had got it. She walked with me out of the alley, up to the beginning of <placeName id="t17800510-41-crimeloc223">Cheapside</placeName>

There was nobody in company with me but the prisoner. I told her she had got my watch; she denied it; I took her to the watch-house, and she was searched, and the watch was produced upon the table in the watch-house.</p>

Then he said if I would go with him he would give me something. He said he had nothing to give me then, but I might take his watch to hold. When he was going away he asked me for it again; I asked him for what he promised to give me; he knocked me down like a dog, and said if I did not give it him he would charge the watch with me, which he did. I did not deny giving it him when I came to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Did any thing indecent pass between you? - No. Something indecent might have passed perhaps if she had not taken my watch. I saw her give it the other woman who stood at about four yards distance.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On the 17th of April I went with a warrant to search a house in <placeName id="t17800510-43-crimeloc235">Three-pigeon-Court</placeName>

I heard somebody come out of the cellar. Carter opened the door; I asked him if they did not know one Jones; and in the mean time Dixon came up. We went in and shut the door. I told Mr. and Mrs. Carter, who were in the lower room, that I had an information, and came to search the house on a suspicion of their carrying on the coining business.</p>
               <p>You looked upon her as the wife of Carter? - Yes, at that time. I desired Mr. Dixon to look about, and I took care of the prisoners. Dixon clapped his hands upon a piece of paper on the mantle-piece, which contained three shillings and sixpence in counterfeit money. He asked her how she came by that money? She made no direct answer to that. He searched a little farther, and in a corner cupboard beyond the chimney-piece he found about twenty-eight or twenty-nine shillings in base money. We asked Mrs. Carter how she came by them? She said she did not know, she supposed they belonged to a lodged she had had in the house. Mr. Dixon asked what was the lodger's name; she replied, she supposed the lodger would hardly give his right name. Mr. Dixon asked her over again? She said it was immaterial, she supposed the lodger did not give his right name. There is but one room on a floor. In the parlour we saw a little bit of a board which will take up occasionally to look down into the cellar. We took that board up and saw the coining tools below. Carter wanted to go up stairs to put some clothes on; I went up stairs with him; Dixon staid below, to take care of Mrs. Carter. I asked Carter if he rented the house? He said yes, I pay rent for the house. I asked him if he had any lodgers in the house? He said no, he had no lodgers at all in the house. He dressed himself. I told him he must go with me; when we came down stairs Mrs. Carter wanted to go backwards; I went backwards with her, and in the yard I observed a window blinded up with sacks and brick bats; that was the area window which looks into the yard. We came in again, and then we went into the two-pair-of-stairs room, there was a bed in the two-pair-of-stairs room, but it did not appear to have been lain in some time. We took the prisoner to New-Prison, and then we went and searched the house. Upon the stairs which go down into the cellar there hung a pair of gaers; Mr. Carter said they were his.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went with Grubb to search the prisoner's house; he was in before me; I followed him in and told them we had a warrant to search the house for coining tools. Mrs. Carter said we might search the house if we liked, there were no tools there. I put my hand on the mantle-piece, and found three shillings and a sixpence in bad money (producing them). I told her then if there were no tools in the house they had had bad money. I searched farther and found twenty shillings and fifty-two sixpences, in a corner on a shelf, they are all counterfeit. There are some black spots on the shillings. On the shelf, where the victuals were, I found this (producing a little pipkin) which appears to have had lambblack and bees-wax in it, the same stuff that is on the shillings. I asked him what that was for; he said he blacked his shees with it. We found the blacking for his shoes up stairs afterwards. I lifted up the board in the parlour and saw below the working tools, and a vyce, and a bag with pattern shillings and sixpences, which are good ones. The bad appear to have been made from them. There were also two botles of aqua fortis; one of them has been used the other has not. The colour is changed of that which has been used. If any base metal is put into it it will turn it instantly; one sixpence lay on the bench unfinished, that is smooted ready for colouring; it would colour it if it was put into aqua fortis and water. I found a pair of flasks and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100058"/>screws complete, the metal is run into them for the purpose of making counterfeit money. There was no sand in them; they were not set. I found some sand, scowering-paper, some metal, and some crucibles for melting. Here is a piece of metal which has been melted, and some facing, and every thing which is used for the purpose of coining.</p>
               <p>What do you call facing? - It is sprinkled over the sand to make the impression come out clean; we found no one in the house but the prisoner. When they were before the magistrate, they were examined apart. Carter said they were married some where in Birmingham; she said they were married some where by the Borough. I found these three files (producing them) in the cellar. They have been been used in filing metal of this kind.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>You met with no obstruction? - No; when they were before the justice the woman blamed him for not fighting instead of going quietly.</p>
               <p>Court. These shillings appear to be old ones? - They get old ones for patterns, because if they were new they would not pass so currently.</p>

               <p>Can you tell that they are new made when they appear to be old? - Yes; if they have been long made they will lose their colour.</p>
               <p>You know if they are convicted that you are entitled to a reward of forty pounds a piece? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing wanting to complete the business? - Nothing in the world that I know of.</p>
               <p>Was there any fire below in the cellar? - There was a fire place but no fire in it, the grate was cold.</p>
               <p>Mr. GREGORY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a monier of the mint (looks at the three shillings and sixpence) they look like good shillings.</p>
               <p>Dixon. They will appear to be bad if they are broke.</p>
               <p>Court. If the monier of the mint does not know they are bad, how do you discover them to be bad? - Any body may know them to be bad.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gregory: (Breaks them) they do not appear white now they are broke.</p>
               <p>Were they made at the mint? - I cannot tell; there has none been made since I have been at the mint; these do not look to be bad; I do not see any thing coppery about them; I will not take upon me to swear that they are bad.</p>
               <p>Look at the twenty shillings and the sixpences? - By this light they do not seem to me to be bad; they look like old worn shillings (files one of each) they look bad now they are filed.</p>
               <p>Was that coined at the mint? - I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Do you coin bad silver at the mint? - Not that I know of.</p>

I lost a waggon out of my cart-house on the 30th of July; I missed it in the morning; I made enquiry among my neighbours, but could hear nothing of it. On the Saturday following I went to Reading and advertised it, and dispersed a number of hand-bills, but to no effect. I had afterwards intelligence of it by two young fellows who had been at work at Enfield-Chase and came home in the month of April; they said, they had seen such a waggon in the possession of

            , who is known in that country by the name of Black Dick. In consequence of that information, I went to Southgate and found the waggon at Mr. Groves's on Tuesday the 25th of April. I could swear to the waggon, though they had disguised it all they could; it was a different built waggon from any in the neighbourhood, it was a kind of half-bed waggon, it had rails and hoops over the wheels; when it was with me I painted a groupe of wool-packs on the head of the waggon, on one woolpack I painted my name, and on another the country; they were all painted out when I found it; the board was black, there were no traces of it at all.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to swear it was your waggon? - I do. I found Holloway at Southgate and took him into custody, but he made his escape.</p>

               <p>The waggon came first to Southgate about August last; it continued working with me from August till Christmas, in the joint name of Holloway and Davis, as partners. I do not know of my own knowledge who brought it. I was told it was brought by the prisoners at Christmas; on a dispute they parted; the prisoner further paid some money, and the waggon became his sole property; he kept it till the 6th of March then I bought it of him for six pounds five shillings. The prisoner's brother-in-law, Howard, worked for me before they came out of the country; the waggon was brought first to his house, and he and the prisoner and Holloway worked with the team.</p>

I desired to see it? She opened her apron, and immediately dropped them. I locked her and the lodger together into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100062"/>dining-room, and went down and sent for a constable. The things mentioned in the indictment were the things she had in her apron. She had taken them out of my two-pair-of-stairs room. She said before the justice, that she bought them of a Jew.</p>

I had the money in the morning of a shop-keeper in rag-fair; I had laid none of it out. As soon as they had the money they all ran down, and I ran after them. I was almost distracted about my money. I could not tell where they were gone; some of the neighbours took notice of them, and told me where they were. I found the little one in the necessary; she said you Dutch bougre what do you want with me, do you want my life or my child's life. I said give me my money; she said you Dutch bougre I won't give you a farthing, I wish I had more of you, do you want my life or my child's life, she said again. She said what she would do to me if I did not go out. I was afraid and went away, and she went out. They saw some of the neighbours run after them, and then they ran into the house again. The woman of the house asked me what was the matter, I cried and took on so. She bid me look over my money, and see what I had lost. I took my money out to count it, then Green came up and took a guinea out of my hat and ran out. They all ran out again. The constable took them in the street, and searched them, but did not find any thing upon them. I did not get any of my money again.</p>

Just as the supper came up, the prisoner came in; the other said she hoped I would excuse her; that she was a friend of her's come to eat a bit of supper. I said it was nothing to me. When the things were all taken away but the cloth, this woman got up and fastened the door. I said there should be no door fastened there, and immediately got up and unbolted it and rang for the waiter. I had a good deal of money in my pocket, and shutting the door rather alarmed me. When the waiter came I asked him what I had to pay. I told him I had no money in my pocket, but a two guinea piece, that he must keep that for the reckoning till I came again. I held it in my hand; the waiter went back to see what I had to pay; and while he was gone the prisoner got up and snatched it out of my hand; I rang for the waiter; he was on the stairs; he came back immediately. I told him the prisoner had stolen the two-guinea piece from me. The other woman sat by the chimney. The prisoner began to blast and swear, and box the waiter. The waiter went and got a constable, and she was taken to the round-house. She was searched in the round-house, but nothing found upon her.</p>
               <p>Why was not she searched in the room? - I suppose the constable forgot it. I was afraid of her. She swore she would swear my life away if I touched her.</p>

She came down stairs and desired me to come up. He ordered a supper and after supper, he called the waiter to bring his bill, and said he had no money, but if he would give him a direction where to call for it, he would leave his watch. If he had had a two-guinea piece; he would not have talked of leaving his watch. He stopped me and said I had taken the two-guinea piece. And he let the other woman go.</p>

             were in the room. I stood at the door and said, I could not come in, I wanted to go home. Hambleton laid hold of me and pulled me in and shut the door. There was a chair; she put me down in the chair, and sat down by me, and was very great with me, and presently I saw the chain of my watch, in her hand; I laid hold of her fist to try to get the watch from her; then Ann Gee came and pushed me off; she gave me two shoves, and asked was I going to murder the girl? Then Martha Raymond came up and took the watch, and ran down stairs with it. I called the landlord and told him they had robbed me of my watch. He laughed at me and told me I should keep better company. I begged of them to let me have my watch again; I wanted to go home. Hambleton said if I would give them a shilling to buy some supper, they would give me the watch again. I gave her the shilling, and then they began to turn me out of the room. I have never seen my watch since. The Landlady came up and said we made a great noise; and she turned us all down stairs; they said they had a box to deliver at another house; then they said they would go with me to the watch-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100065"/>or any where, I should search them for the watch. As soon as we were out they run one one way and the other another. I pursued Hambleton, upon which she cried out murder! She was taken by the watchman, who carried her to the watch house, there she was searched, but nothing found upon her. Raymond was taken on the Thursday following.</p>

Then Lucy Hambleton and the prosecutor lay on the bed together; when he got up he missed his watch. He asked for it; he told them if they would give him his watch back again, he did not mind what he spent, he would spend two shillings, which was all that he had got; he made a great rout after it, and the landlady came up.</p>

               <p>It is not true then that while he struggled to get the watch from her, you pushed him and gave him two shoves and asked him if he was going to murder the woman? - I can take my oath, I never said any such thing.</p>

On Monday the 24th of April the prisoner came into our house; she went through the tap-room into a back-room; she sat down in the first box and called for a pint of beer; she seemed a decent sort of woman. I thought she might be waiting for a waggoner; there were a number of parcels which we received for waggoners in that box; they were removed by my order; my coat and waistcoat were in the same box; soon after I went to a barber's shop in the yard. A gentleman came into the shop to me and said that woman (meaning the prisoner) will bilk you of your reckoning I fancy, for she seems to be moving off. I came in directly and she was then sitting down in the box, and seemed to have something in her apron. I desired her to get up that I might look for my coat and waistcoat; she got up; my daughter said, I have put your coat in the bar, but I could not find your waistcoat; I had not pulled it off above a quarter of an hour. I said what have you got in your apron? She said nothing that belongs to you. I pulled her apron down and saw my waistcoat folded up in her apron; I took her to the counter.</p>

The two prisoners came into my shop on Monday the 24th of April, at about twenty-five minutes after one clock; they asked to look at some white muslin. I took them into the back shop and shewed them some; they did not seem to like any I shewed them. I said would not a fine lawn do as well? They said let us look at it; they bought a yard of one piece I shewed them; I cut it off, delivered it to them, and took the money for it, which was six shillings.</p>
               <p>Which of them paid you for it? - I cannot recollect which. I said I am sorry I cannot sell you any muslin. One of them, I do not know which, said, have you got any good sprig muslin? I shewed them some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100067"/>sprig muslins. While I was shewing them some sprig muslins the tall one, which was Rook, pulled a piece out a good deal and held it up before my face, as if to look at it; while she held it up so, I perceived something move off the counter, but could not tell directly what it was; I observed immediately almost, a motion of her legs, which was, I suppose, endeavouring to conceal the whole rapper; it was very heavy, there was thirty-five pounds worth of goods in it. I suppose she had drawn it off the counter upon the ground; it was a large rapper full of muslins; it was too heavy for her to conceal it, and I kept leaning over the counter to watch her.</p>
               <p>Did she stoop down? - She did not stoop to pick it up; I was rather flurried and probably she might observe it and might think I saw her; she did not stoop low enough to reach any thing; the tall one put her self on one side; she picked the rapper up and put it on the top of the counter, says she I wonder you keep your floor so dirty, if these things tumble down they will get dirty. I shewed them another piece of muslin; they bid me seven shillings a yard for it; while I was shewing it them the tall one held that up, as she had done the other, and said the work was not good enough; then the short one stood in about the same place were she stood before; I kept my eyes upon them and saw a piece pulled off the same as the rapper was; she moved herself about in the same manner as she had done before to secrete it; there was a chair there; she drew herself back and said she would sit down; I saw her put her hand to her pocket-hole, as if she was pulling something up; that was, I suppose, with a view to draw the muslin up; they both sat down upon the two chairs about two or three minutes, I believe; she said will you take my money? I said no. She said I will not have it if you let me go out of the shop, I will not come back if you call me back. They went out; at the door I laid hold of the little one and said, I shall be obliged to you to let me have what you have got of mine. She asked me what I meant by that? I said it did not signify I must insist upon searching them; she ran back towards the back part of the shop, as I supposed, to drop it, where she had seen the muslins. I catched hold of her and shook her clothes a little and I saw the muslin drop from under her clothes. I sent for a constable and gave him charge of the two prisoners, and delivered the piece of muslin into his care.</p>
               <p>(The muslin was produced in court by the constable).</p>

               <p>What is the worth of it? - It cost three pounds.</p>

On the first of May, about half after nine o'clock at night, I heard a noise, like the lifting up of a window, in the passage; the outside window shutters of the passage window were not fast. I took a candle in my hand and went to look; I saw the prisoner in the passage; he immediately got on a board and jumped out of the window, which is about six feet high from the ground. I unbolted the door immediately and pursued him. I cried, stop thief; he had a bag on his shoulder; he threw that down; another person took him; he would have been taken sooner, but he cried stop thief himself, and that misled the people; he was taken at Queenhithe, about two hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>How far was he off when you got out? - About ten yards; he was standing up in a corner with a bag over his shoulder; when I came up to him he threw down the bag and ran away; he had no bag when he was in the passage; the sack was brought to my house, there were some things in it, but they did not belong to me. I got a constable and took him to the Compter. I asked him what business he had in my house? he made me no answer. I am sure the prisoner is the man that was in the house; the window was shut down; I saw my servant shut it just before.</p>

            's? - I cannot say there was any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Did any thing in general pass between you? - We had some conversation.</p>
               <p>What sort of conversation was it? - I cannot say, it was a great while ago.</p>
               <p>Did he make any addresses to you, did he pay you any compliments upon your person? - I cannot say he did.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him next? - At my sister's, in Vere-street, Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Did you meet him at your sister's by appointment? - No; that was by accident too.</p>
               <p>Where these all the times that ever you had met together? - All the times I ever saw him.</p>
               <p>What passed between you at that time? - I had lost the use of both my arms by the rheumatism. He asked me what was the matter with me? I said I had the rheumatism in my arms, and could not lift them up to my head; I do not know any thing else that passed then.</p>
               <p>You know what he is now charged with, inform the court what you have to say upon that? - I had the rheumatism in my arms, and lost the use of them, so that I was obliged to leave my place and go to my sister's.</p>
               <p>You went to your sister's when you quitted your place? - I had not quitted my place, I had only left it during my illness.</p>
               <p>Relate what you have to charge the prisoner with? - I used to be of days at my sister's in Vere-street, and of nights at my sister's, in Duke-street, Grosvenor-square; when my brother parted with me on Saturday night; he asked me to drink tea with him next day. I said I would. Accordingly on the next day, which was Sunday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100070"/>the 6th of April, I drank tea at my sister's in Vere-street. After tea my sister asked me to take a walk; I went with her; there were in company this man (the prisoner) my brother, and two or three more. We walked to Bagnigge Wells. My sister and I stopped in Lamb's Conduit-street, to speak to a young woman, the rest went on to Bagnigge Wells. When my sister and I went on towards Bagnigge Wells, we met my brother; he told us that they were not at Bagnigge Wells, but at the Bull in the Pound, which is in that neighbourhood; they sat drinking there a good while; then we set out to go home. When we came to Vere-street my sister said to the prisoner, that as he was going to Marybone, and I to Duke-street, Grosvenor-square, he might as well see me home.</p>
               <p>Now you were separated from all the rest of the company, and alone with him? - Yes. He said he had some money to receive, and was to go out of town on Monday, and could not go out of town without it; so he went into a house in Drury-lane; I do not know the name of the house; he told Justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Did you go into the house with him? - Yes. He said he should stay but ten minutes. He called for a pint of beer; he asked me to drink; I put it up to my mouth but did not drink at all. We sat some time; the man came into the room; he asked where the master was; he said gone out. He desired him to send him in as soon as he came in. When he came in, he said, I suppose you want some money? The prisoner said yes. The master of the house paid him down half a guinea. When he received the money, he called for sixpennyworth of half and half. I got up two or three times, in order to go; he put me down once in a chair. He said I should stop till he went. After he had had sixpennyworth of half and half we went out; he kept me there till it was past eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Was he guilty of any indecency to you while he was in the house in Drury-lane? - No, none.</p>
               <p>Was he sober or otherwise when he quitted that house? - I believe he was sober.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes. We went from thence to go home. When we came to <placeName id="t17800510-57-crimeloc322">Oxford-buildings</placeName>

He knocked at one door, nobody came; he went to another; he pulled me in. I insisted upon going to my sister's, but he pulled me into the house. He had me up one-pair-of-stairs and called for a pint of wine; he poured out two glasses, I drank one. He broke a biscuit and put it to my mouth. After the wine was drank he called to know whether he could have a bed for me; the man of the house said yes. He desired them to make it up for me. When it was ready the man came in and told me. The prisoner told me I should go to bed and he would sit up. The landlord went up stairs; I went after him. The prisoner followed behind me; I did not see him till the landlord was got out of the room; then I saw him; he locked the door upon me, and insisted upon my going to bed; I said I would not go bed. He insisted upon my undressing myself; I would not. I said he had promised to sit up and let me go to bed; and I would not go to bed if he staid in the room. He said it was a fine thing for him to pay for a bed and I not to go into it; I said that did not signify I would pay for the bed. He pulled off my cap and shoes, and he tore my petticoat and apron in pulling me to the bed. Then he shoved me down upon the bed and did as he pleased with me.</p>
               <p>You must be more explicit, you must tell what happened to you? - He throwed me down upon the bed.</p>
               <p>And did what? - And had carnal knowledge of my body.</p>
               <p>Was this by your consent or against your will? - It was against my consent; I called out as loud as I could, but I was so struck I could not call out loud. I pulled him, scratched him, and bit him, all I could. I was lame in my right arm, I could only defend myself with my left.</p>
               <p>When you called out in this way did nobody come to your assistance? - No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Was it a large house or a small house? - I do not know, the room we were in was very small; up two pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100071"/>Did there appear to be nobody in the family but the landlord? - I did not see any body but the landlord.</p>
               <p>How long might this be about? - About a minute.</p>
               <p>In prosecutions of this kind it is absolutely necessary to be very full, particular, and explicit, in order to make out the charge; did he enter your body? - He did.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive any thing to come from him? - I cannot say; I was so ill, I begged for God's sake for him not to use me ill; I said I would sooner die than he should use me ill. And I said I would die before I went out of the room, if he did use me any otherwise than well.</p>
               <p>You cannot say whether any thing came from him or not? - I cannot say I was so ill; I trembled so the place shook under me, I was so struck.</p>
               <p>Did he repeat this any more? - I drawed back the curtain to jump out of the window, and would have jumped out of the window if he had not laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen this house since? - I have been a great many times that way, but have never been near the house.</p>
               <p>Do not you know who lives in it? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know the name of the person who keeps it? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know how many the family consisted of? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This happened on the 16th of April? - It did.</p>
               <p>I believe this young man bears a very fair honest character, and is well acquainted with your family? - He is acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>They introduced you into his company as a proper person to be with? - To be trusted with, to be seen safe home.</p>
               <p>You was at a public-house in Drury-lane along with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you go there? - A little after nine.</p>
               <p>And you was there till past eleven? - He kept me till past eleven.</p>
               <p>You was not made a prisoner of was you? - No.</p>

               <p>Then you staid willingly? - No. I insisted upon going; he pushed me down again into the chair.</p>
               <p>Why did not you go afterwards? - He kept me till it was so late I was afraid of going.</p>
               <p>You were not apprehensive of any ill design in him all that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between you and him in Oxford-road? - Nothing particular as I know of.</p>
               <p>Did not you say to him that you should be locked out from your sister's? - I believe I did say once he had kept me so long that my sister would be a-bed.</p>
               <p>Then that was the reason why he proposed your going to another house, you having said you should be locked out of your sister's? - No, I did not say so, I said I was afraid she was a-bed.</p>
               <p>Then you went voluntarily along with him to this house? - No, he pulled me in and insisted upon my going in.</p>
               <p>Did he pull you against your will into the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How far was it from the place in Oxford-road where you said you should be locked out of your lodging, to this house where you was with him? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>It is several hundred yards is it not? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You made no resistance in the street? - Not till I came to the place.</p>
               <p>You did not call out? - No.</p>
               <p>When he knocked at the door you went in willingly into the house? - No, he pulled me in.</p>
               <p>Who opened the door? - The door was not fastened, it was so that he could push it open and get in.</p>
               <p>Who was the person you first saw there? - The man.</p>
               <p>Did you express any unwillingness to that man at being in the prisoner's company? - I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner proposed a bed-room? - He did for me.</p>
               <p>You made no objection to that? - He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100072"/>had kept me so late I was wet through; he promised I should have the bed and he would fit up.</p>
               <p>Did he promise that to you or to the man? - To me.</p>
               <p>He did not say so to the man did he? - I did not hear him say that to the man.</p>
               <p>After the bed was proposed and getting ready, I believe you drank some wine with him in another room? - I did.</p>
               <p>How much did you drink? - He poured out two or three glasses for me, but I did not drink above one.</p>
               <p>How long was you in that room before you went into the bed-room? - I cannot pretend to say how long it was.</p>
               <p>The landlord lighted you up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You expressed no unwillingness to go into the bed-room? - No.</p>
               <p>After you got into the bed-room did you make any noise at all? - I did.</p>
               <p>What sort of a noise? - I halloo'd out as loud as I could.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you cannot halloo very loud? - I halloo'd as loud as I could, but I was too much struck to halloo much.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by struck? - I was so struck that the place shook under me.</p>
               <p>Did not you lay yourself down upon the bed willingly? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Where was you all night, in the bed or in a chair in the room? - In a chair in the room, afterwards.</p>
               <p>Did you talk any thing to the prisoner about marriage in that room? - I cannot say whether I did or not; I was so ill I could not say much to him.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath whether you did not propose to him to marry you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You did not say any thing at all about marriage? - I did not. He I believe said something about it, but I did not give any ear to what he said, or enter into any conversation with him.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - I believe a stone-mason.</p>
               <p>What time of night was it when you got into that house? - Past twelve o'Clock.</p>
               <p>You was there till six in the morning? - I was I believe.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner and you both came down stairs together from that bed-room? - We did.</p>
               <p>Who was the person you first saw? - The maid of the house.</p>
               <p>Did you complain to the maid of the house of any ill usage? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner and you go together? - Yes, a little way. He asked me to tell my brother I had been at a friend's of his. I said I would not, I would tell him all that had happened.</p>
               <p>How far did he go with you? - Only two or three doors I believe.</p>
               <p>Did not you send somebody to the prisoner the next morning after this happened? - My brother. When I came home in the morning I told my sister how ill I had been used; she saw my things were torn all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him how? - No, I said he had used me ill, that was all I said.</p>
               <p>Then your brother went from you with that message to him, that he had used you ill? - My sister told him as soon as he came home to breakfast, and he went after him; he came back to my brother's house with my brother.</p>
               <p>Did you charge him then with having used you ill? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>That was all you said to him? - Yes, he said he did not know whether I was a man or a woman.</p>
               <p>Did your brother or sister then talk of having a warrant for him? - My brother asked my sister if she would have him taken up; she said yes.</p>
               <p>Your sister was for taking him up, not you? - I was so ill I did not know what I said or did.</p>
               <p>Did your brother tell him he should fetch a warrant for him? - I cannot say what my brother said to him.</p>
               <p>Did he say he would stay there while your brother went? - I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Did he go to get a warrant for him? - He did.</p>
               <p>And did the prisoner stay there till he came back with it? - Yes, he did. He wanted to go away, but my sister said there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100073"/>was somebody below who would stop him if he offered to go away.</p>
               <p>Do you say that upon you oath? - My sister told me so.</p>
               <p>I ask you upon your oath whether your sister has not been the promoter of all this business? - My sister, me, and my brother together.</p>
               <p>Did not she propose the prosecution? - I myself proposed the prosecution.</p>
               <p>What happened before the justice, was he committed by the magistrates for having ravished you? - They did not commit him to prison, they admitted him to bail.</p>
               <p>For what? - They asked me whether I chose to take his life or not; I said he deserved the worst of punishment except life.</p>
               <p>Did you complain of any ill usage of your person there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you talk about being bruised and injured? - Not being bruised further than being torn about and ill used.</p>
               <p>Not bruised on your knees, or elbows, or thighs? - My thighs were so stiff that I could not move them hardly.</p>
               <p>Did he desire any surgeon to be sent for? Yes.</p>
               <p>Was one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you was not at all bruised or hurt? - Yes, I was hurt so far as this, that I have never been right well since.</p>
               <p>You was ill before that you know; now did you prefer one or two indictments? - Two.</p>
               <p>What were they for? - One was for the rape, the other was to indict him for an assault.</p>
               <p>How came you to prefer two, because if he had only committed an assault, he could not have ravished you.</p>
               <p>Court. She did very properly for if it should in point of Law not come out to be a rape, it may be an assault.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass at your brother's house before you went before the magistrate, that if he would make you a satisfaction all would be well? - No, nothing of that was said; if he had offered me a thousand pounds it would have made no difference to me, my honour and character was not to be lost through such an one as him.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came yesterday to be tried, was you applied to to know if you would attend the prosecution? - I was.</p>
               <p>What was your answer to that to the person who applied to you? - He asked my brother whether he intended to stand the trial or to make it up; my brother said there never were any proposals made to make it up.</p>
               <p>Did not you then say you should appear to day unless the matter was made up? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court. When you came into this court in Oxford-road, that you have been mentioning, was you perfectly sober? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did you during the time you was there drink so as to intoxicate you? - I drank only one glass of wine all the day and some tea; I drank that glass of wine, as I was wet through, that I might not catch cold.</p>
               <p>And you had your perfect senses and understanding about you? - I had.</p>
               <p>Previous to the time that you went up stairs to bed in that house had you seen any woman in the house? - No woman at all.</p>
               <p>And you was a perfect stranger in that house previous to the time of your coming there? - I had never been in the house or court before; I had been by it several times.</p>
               <p>Could not you have got out of that house that evening if you had attempted it? - I would have got out if I could, at any rate, but I could not get from him. If I had got out, where was I to go to at twelve o'clock at night? I begged, for God's sake, of the landlord to let me sit up all night, being wet through.</p>
               <p>It was natural for a woman, being in a strange house seeing none but men, to be under alarm, was not you frightened? - I was, I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>In the part of the house that you was first introduced to, where did it look out to, could not you have alarmed any person that was passing by, by throwing up the window? - It looked out into a yard the back part of the house.</p>
               <p>Was there no house adjoining to the back part of the house? - I did not see that there was.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath if you had made every<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100074"/>attempt to escape out of that house, could not you have escaped out of it? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Does not this house stand in a row? - It does.</p>
               <p>Then there are houses close to it on each side? - There are.</p>

               <p>What is your business? - A carpenter. The week before this happened the prisoner, who was a particular acquaintance of mine, called to see me and my wife, he was out of work; in the dusk of the evening we took a walk; we had three penny-worth of crank in a publick-house; my wife and I, before he went away, asked him to come to dinner on Sunday. He said he would; he came to dinner on the Sunday; after dinner he asked me to go and take a walk; when we went out he said he was going into Nottingham-court by Drury-lane after some money; we went there; another young man of his acquaintance was there before me; we had three pints of ale. He asked for the landlord; he was not at home; he said he thought he was staying away on purpose that he might not pay him the money; he would not let the other young man nor me pay the three pints of ale; he would have it set up to his account; we came to my apartment to drink tea; after tea, however, we proposed to go and take a walk; we all of us went to take a walk, there were two or three people besides him called to see us; we went all together to take a walk to Bagnigge-wells. Going along, my wife called to see a young woman in Lamb's-Conduit-street; she stopped about five minutes; the prisoner and I went to Bagnigge wells, from thence we went to the Bull-in-the-Pound, a publick-house, because they saw a young man with us had a silk handkerchief about his neck, and he could not be admitted into the place. I went back to meet my wife and sister, because I knew they would go on to Bagnigge-wells. I met them and took them to the Bull-in-the-Pound; in the course of that time, the prisoner told me he was going to get some money from his brother; that he was going into the country to Barnet on Monday morning, and had no money; he went; when he came back he said he had five shillings. I said I would let him have some money to help out till he came to town again; we all parted at the end of Vere-street. I asked him if he was going to that house he had talked of? He said no; he wanted to be at home; as he was going out early on the Monday morning. I said, I had half a crown I would let him have that, if he could make shift with it till he came to town. He said yes. He said, as he must be up early in the morning he would not call at Nottingham-court, but go straight home. My wife said, James you will take care of Betty and see her safe home. He said yes, let that alone to me, I will see her safe home. When we parted he and my sister went away, and we wished them a good night. On Monday, when I came home from work at eight o'clock to breakfast, my sister was at our house.</p>
               <p>Who else was in company? - Nobody but the prosecutrix and my wife.</p>
               <p>Court. Now tell me the exact story she told you? - She was sitting in the chair and crying ready to break her heart, so was her sister. I asked what was the matter? Said my wife to me,</p>
               <p>"O George! that fellow has kept my sister out all night." I asked who? Said she James, meaning the prisoner. I asked her if he had done her any injury? The prosecutrix said yes. I asked her was that really fact? She cried and told me it was. I said I should see her righted.</p>
               <p>Did she describe to you the nature of the injury? - Yes, she did. I asked her if the prisoner really entered her body? She declared solemnly to me that he really had. I said now consider what you are about and tell me the real truth. She said, George, if this was my last minute, my dying minute, it it really true. I put off my working clothes, cleaned myself a little, and said I would go after him; I did, and found him in his lodgings; he was putting his Sunday's clothes by; when he saw me he stood confounded. He said, what is the matter, have you seen Betty! I said yes I have, you know that very well, else I had no occasion to come<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100075"/>here. I told him he must go along with me. He said well I have done nothing to go along with you for. At length he came along with me to my apartment; coming along I said James, how did my sister behave to you? He said the same as a modest woman ought to do; as we were coming along he said I was a damned fool I did not do it, for if I had she would not have owned it. I brought him to the publick-house in Vere-street; I called for a pint of beer there and left him in the publick-house.</p>
               <p>Was he in custody of any body? - No.</p>
               <p>He might have gone off if he pleased? - He might have gone off. I went home to my wife and sister; my sister was gone to bed and asleep. I asked my wife what she would have done, for I had brought him down? She said she would see him tried as far as the law would go. Then I sent for a constable; he told us we must go to Sir

               <p>He was let out upon bail, and a recognizance was taken to prosecute and give evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the fact? - No. I went out on Monday evening to the place where they were all night; it is in Oxford-buildings, Oxford-road, very near Stratford-place, on the Bond-street side.</p>
               <p>Was it a publick-house? - As I am told it is a bagnio. I went into the house; I saw the landlady and a young woman who is here in court. I asked the landlady if a young woman and young man slept there over night? She said no; there was nobody that slept in the house that night but one seafaring man, and he was blind with one eye.</p>
               <p>Do you know the names of the persons who keep the house? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Is there any sign? - There are two large lamps at the door; I am told it goes by the name of the two Lamps.</p>
               <p>Is there any inscription over the door? - Not that I know of; it was in the night-time when I went; all I saw over the door was dealer in foreign spirits; I think I saw that.</p>
               <p>Not lodgings for gentlemen only? - I saw nothing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Did any thing further pass there? - No.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner was in your company on the Monday the 17th what conversation was there about making satisfaction? - None at all in my presence.</p>
               <p>Was there any proposal for satisfaction made yesterday in your presence on the part of the prosecutrix? - None at all.</p>
               <p>Were there any friends of the prisoner sent to the prosecutrix yesterday when you was present about his surrendering himself to be tried to day? - There was.</p>
               <p>What was the answer to that question, whether he would surrender himself to-day, by you and her? - This gentleman that stands here came out and asked whether I should attend the trial or not at nine this morning? I said, to be sure I must; he went in directly, and the prisoner's brother said then as it was gone so far he should stand trial.</p>
               <p>Was nothing said more than that? - Yes. The prosecutrix said yes, for there never was any recompence made nor offered.</p>
               <p>Did not you say something to the same purport, as well as the prosecutrix? - I said I should not be against it if it was agreeable to them.</p>
               <p>Would this prosecution have happened at all if it had not been for your wife? - Yes it would.</p>
               <p>There were no bruises upon the prosecutrix, no personal injury? - Not that I saw.</p>

               <p>She walked to the justice's, did not she? - Yes, she did.</p>
               <p>She had walked home from Oxford-buildings to where you live before eight in the morning? - She had come in some few minutes before me.</p>
               <p>Then she walked from Oxford-buildings to Vere-street, from thence to Bow-street, and back from Bow-street to your house in Vere-street? - She did.</p>

               <p>In what condition did she appear? - Her petticoat and apron were torn all to pieces. She complained of the injury she had received from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did she complain immediately as she came in? - No. She was about seven minutes, I believe, before she could speak; then she fell a crying. I asked her what was the matter? She said she had been ill used by the prisoner, and that he had kept her out at a publick-house all night; she cried and I cried likewise. I asked her particularly what was the matter and in what manner he had used her ill? She said he had taken her into a publick-house and had kept her all night in a room and had done as he pleased with her.</p>
               <p>Did she describe to you in any other terms what he had done to her? - She did not then, but before she went to Sir

            's she said she was taken into this publick-house under a point of friendship, that he told her he would sooner lose his own life than injure her, because of the friendship between us.</p>
               <p>Did you ever hear any imputation upon her character before? - Never in my life, nor, I believe, any body else.</p>
               <p>Did you examine her person? - Not then; when my husband came home we had breakfast and she drank one dish of tea, and I put her to bed.</p>
               <p>Did you examine her person to see if there were any bruises or violence? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Did the surgeon examine her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What appeared to you upon the person at the time? - No other appearance than what she expressed in court.</p>
               <p>No bruises or apparent injury? - No; she was incapable of lacing her stays or putting her hands behind her, for a week afterwards I laced her myself.</p>
               <p>She had been ill of the rheumatism? - She had, but had got pretty near the better of it, but not quite; but by struggling she had hurt her arms so that she could not lift them up to her head.</p>
               <p>For how long did this lameness continue? - A week, I believe.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>She came away from Mr. Deacon's service on account of having the rheumatism in her arms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did she tell you that she herself had first told the prisoner in Oxford-street that she should be locked out of her lodging? - I questioned her and she said no, she did not; she said her sister might possibly be a bed.</p>
               <p>Did you observe nothing particular about her but her crying when she came to your house on the Monday morning? - Nothing except the tearing of her clothes to pieces; her apron and petticoat and her cap were entirely spoiled.</p>
               <p>Was her apron torn out of the binding? No, in the main stuff.</p>
               <p>How were her petticoats torn? - Out of the binding for above half way.</p>
               <p>If the petticoats had been torn out of the binding by force applied to tear them, whether that must not necessarily have bruised the person very much? - I cannot speak as to that, she was so very bad with her arms that I was forced to dress and undress her for a week.</p>
               <p>There must be great force in tearing binding out of the gathers? - There must be.</p>
               <p>Court. Did your sister, in any conversation you had with her subsequent to this transaction, ever give you reason to think that she had consented to this upon any promise of marriage or any inducement that had been offered her by the prisoner? - She never did in any conversation in her life.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100077"/>Did she ever say that he had attempted to seduce her by giving her expectations to marry her? - She said he told her he wished she would go with him to Barnet, but she must not be so shy as she had been, and that he proffered her his watch, but she threw it away, and that he proffered to change handkerchiefs with her but she insisted upon keeping her own.</p>
               <p>Have you any reason, from any conversation between you, to think that she had been induced to agree to what passed? - I do not think she would agree to any such proposal.</p>
               <p>Was she in all your observation of her a person of modesty and decent deportment? - I believe not a person in the world can speak the least disparaging of her character.</p>
               <p>Did you ever observe her to be fond of men's company? - No; quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>She went with all the pleasure in the world to the house with me; we went up stairs, drank a pint of wine; then we were shewed up stairs to bed; the landlord went first, she followed him, I followed her; then she said she would not strip; she undressed her head, tied a handkerchief about it, pulled her shoes off, and went on the bed. She asked me if I would marry her; I said I never came to such a place to make up a match, nor marry a woman that went there with me; upon that we differed; she got out of bed and sat up most part of the night. In the morning she came out with me, about a quarter past six. When she went on the bed with her clothes on, she had only her cap and her shoes off; she made no objection to my lying down. When I would not consent to marry her she got up, and I did not attempt to stop her. I said if she was not willing I did not choose to force her. I concluded she had been willing or she would not have gone there with me; then she got up in a passion and said she would make me repent it, or suffer for it.</p>

               <p>Do you remember having seen the prisoner at your house on the 16th of April last? - I remember seeing the prisoner extremely well; there was a woman along with him.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect the person of that woman? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what day of the week it was? - It was a Sunday, about a fortnight ago, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>What conversation passed between you and the prisoner? - He asked for a room; I shewed him one. He called for a pint of wine, and sat down. He said I do not want such a room as this, I want a room for my wife and myself to sleep in.</p>
               <p>What part of the house was this in? - One pair of stairs room, a drinking room.</p>
               <p>Did you shew them into a room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any force used to get the woman into your house or up into the one pair of stairs room? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Did she make any objection to going up into the other room? - No, not the least.</p>
               <p>Who took the wine in? - I took it in myself.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you cannot say whether she drank wine or no? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long were they in that room? - I believe a quarter of half an hour.</p>
               <p>There did not appear any wish to get out of the house on her part, or complaint of ill usage? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he say he wanted a bed-room for himself and wife in hearing of the woman? - Yes. I said I had a spare bed, which was kept for the use of my boys when they came from school. I said it should be at his service, knowing the prisoner by sight. He said he was obliged to me, because he was locked out of his lodgings; the bed-room was up two pair of stairs backwards, I lighted them up. When he asked for a bed for him and his wife she made no objection. I told them the bed was ready, and lighted her up stairs; she made no objection. I went up first, they both followed me, which came next to me I cannot say, because I went first with the candle.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether he was in the room as well as her before you left it? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100078"/>Yes, I am sure both were in the room before I left it.</p>
               <p>At the time you left her was there any expression of unwillingness on her part to be with him there? - No.</p>
               <p>And she went in under the title of his wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time was this? - I believe it might then be turned of twelve; I always shut up at twelve.</p>
               <p>Was there any noise heard in your house, made by her? - I never heard any; if there had been any I must have heard it, for I sleep upon the same floor myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you recollect whether he went into the room before the woman or the woman before him? - I cannot pretend to say; I was first with the candle.</p>
               <p>Is your house a house for the reception of people to sleep in? - No. I keep a tavern, The Vine Tavern, it is written over the door.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner frequented your house before? - I have seen him before with other men; I never saw him with a woman before this to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Is it not customary if you permit people to lie in your house that the females should attend them if there is a woman in the case? - They happened not to be at leisure at that time which caused me to light them up.</p>
               <p>How many females are there in your family? - My wife and two maid servants.</p>
               <p>They did not either of them appear during the course of this evening did they? - I do not know that they did.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath whether at the time that he made that representation to you that this woman was his wife that you thought her so? - I really looked upon it as such as he told me so.</p>

               <p>Did you hear any noise that night? - I did not.</p>
               <p>If there had been any noise made in that room must you have heard it where you lay? - I think I must. I let out the prisoner and the prosecutrix in the morning; that was after six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did she make any complaint of ill usage? - Not at all; when she came down stairs she said, Good Morning, I said the same to her.</p>
               <p>Did they go out friendly together? - Yes; they did very friendly.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make any observation upon her person or character? did her clothes appear to be torn? - No; I did not see any of her clothes torn.</p>
               <p>Was her cap torn? - She had a bonnet on.</p>
               <p>Did her petticoats or apron appear torn, or was she without an apron? - I did not take particular notice.</p>
               <p>Then you did not observe whether from her appearance, she seemed to have been ill treated or otherwise? - I did not see that her countenance was changed or any thing.</p>
               <p>Are women permitted to lie in your house? - I cannot say, I have nothing to do with it. I am nursery maid.</p>
               <p>Are women permitted in the evening to drink wine with strangers? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived there? - Three months.</p>
               <p>Where was the prosecutrix when you first saw her in the morning? - In the passage.</p>
               <p>Court. This house is a Bagnio is it not? - I do not know; it is a house where gentlemen drink wine. I am only to mind the children, I never see who comes in nor who goes out hardly.</p>
               <p>Do not men and women come in together? - Yes I suppose so.</p>

               <p>You are a surgeon and man-midwife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was you called upon on the 17th of April last, at the public-office in Bow-street? - I was sent for there but I did not mark the day.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the prosecutrix? - I did.</p>
               <p>Were there any marks of violence about her? - None. I was sent for by Mr. Wright, and desired to examine her whether there was any violence upon her person. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100079"/>went into a little adjoining room with her sister and herself. I said what is the matter; her sister said a rape had been committed upon her. I said that is a heavy charge indeed, take care what you are about, because it affects a man's life. I said have you ever been lain with before; she said no, I was a maid. I said we shall soon see that. Then I exmined her; I found so far from any inflammation, which there would have been if a rape had actually been committed, if there had been any recent perforation, if there would have been of course an inflammation and soreness, and in all probability a great quantity of blood; there was no appearance of the sort. I said, child, here is no appearance of violence here, why do you bring a charge of this nature, consider you will hang this man. Sir, says the sister, I would not hang him by any means in the world; we only want him to make satisfaction. I said to the sister, you are a married woman; in all probability this man might make an attempt, but as she says he was not a moment upon her, in all probability he emitted before he penetrated her.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make such an examination as to discover minutely and particularly whether the hymen was penetrated or not? - I did by the magistrate's direction.</p>
               <p>Was it intire? - No. The hymen was broken, but it appeared not to be recently broken; because, if it had there would have been an inflammation. I asked her if she had the same shift on then which she had at the time? She said she had; then there would have been blood and other appearances upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. I am to collect from your evidence, that in case this woman was in fact a maid, you think that no rape could have been committed upon this occasion, but if she had before had communication with mankind a rape might have been committed upon her though no inflammation appeared? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. She had been represented to you as a maid? - Yes, she said she never had been connected with a man before.</p>
