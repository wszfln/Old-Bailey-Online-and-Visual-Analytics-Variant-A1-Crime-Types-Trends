            . I am a patrol on the Foundling Estate; Bernard-street is on my beat, and in the parish of St. Pancras. On the 4th of January, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I was passing Mr. Pugh's house - it was quite foggy and dark. I observed that one of the wooden panes on one side of the scullery door appeared to be out, which made me think somebody was about the place. I went down the area, and found the scullery door partly open - the watchman was coming down the street; we found the area gate unlocked. I told him to keep the gate fast while I went down the steps; I was going down, and found the prisoner coming out of the scullery door. He said he had got up too early to go to work, and that he met two men, who told him to come down to such an area, where they would find plenty of grub, and they would share with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing with him - A. No. Before I took him away I found a sack with five dishes, part of three half-quartern loaves, a piece of beef, two pieces of cheese, a piece of dried salmon, a quantity of butter, and a small pan of kitchen-stuff, all tied up in the sack which was in the scullery.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the scullery immediately underneath the step of the street door - A. Yes, it is part of the area, which is enclosed. The kitchen door enters into the scullery, and the scullery door into the area.</p>

            . The scullery is immediately under the step of the street door; one door leads into the area, and the other into the kitchen. On the night of the 4th of January, when I went to bed, I made the doors fast - I bolted the door leading to the area, at the top and bottom. About six o'clock in the morning, the watchman called me, and I found it open; a pane of wood, which was safe when I went to bed, had been taken out; a man could put his body through, and unbolt the door, top and bottom. I saw the sack with the things in it - I had left them all safe - the sack was not there the night before; thirteen plates were tied up in a handkerchief under the sink - I had left them in a plate-rack. I am certain I fastened the doors, and the area gate was locked; the door leading to the kitchen was not opened. Last night I found these things in the water-cistern in the scullery - here is a skeleton key, which opens the area gate easily, also a bottle, a steel, and a flint.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The evening before, I had some words at home, and went out; I fell in company with two young men at a public-house, and told them I was out of work. They said if I would meet them at the corner of Bernard-street at six o'clock they would get me work. I met them; they sent me down to the scullery for the bag. The patrol came and caught me on the steps.</p>

The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, my friend?" and at that instant his right hand came to my watch. I let go the trunk, and seized him before he got it out of my pocket - all three then threw me down.

The witness came to my assistance, and collared the prisoner as he lay down - they were all three on me at that time, endeavouring to get the prisoner clear; the other two escaped; I said I had lost my watch.

I sold fourteen of them at the market, and delivered the rest to my servant to put in a close by the roadside, at Southall, Middlesex. I marked all the beast sent to me with a large slip over the hip, and a short slip under it. I saw these five marked. One particular bullock I marked myself with a small V - the five were worth from 110 l. to 115 l.

He was driving them up the street, and asked me to lend him a hand to drive them up a little alley, which goes to his shop, which I did; I did not count them - it was a dark night - the beast were very much heated. I merely turned them into the alley, and then went away.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at Pinner, which I think is about six or seven miles from Southall; the prisoner keeps a butcher's shop at Pinner - he was in a small way of business. On the 9th of December, about twelve o'clock in the morning, he asked me to come to his slaughter-house, which is up an alley, to assist in dressing three oxen. I went directly, and assisted in slaughtering and dressing them - he and his brother helped a little, but not much; he was present. I helped to kill three, and saw no more killed, but there were two heads in the slaughter-house. The beast were in a cool state.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the marks of the salesmen about the neighbourhood - A. Yes; I saw Welch's mark on them. I always work left-handed, by which I know my work from other peoples'. I have seen the five skins found at Lewin's - I know my work is on three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing done with the meat - A. Two hind-quarters and a fore-quarter were cut up in the prisoner's shop, and another fore-quarter was sold to the master of the work-house, by the prisoner's direction. I helped to load a cart with four fore-quarters and eight hind-quarters, to go to Newgate-market - he said they were to go there. This was on the 11th of December.</p>

I am sure he took it, he was the only man close to me, and I saw the watch in his hand. The prisoner is the man, I endeavoured to lay hold of him, but received several blows from the people round me, they hustled and struck me, which prevented my securing him. I pursued him to the corner of King-street, and said he had robbed me - he escaped. He had a grey coat on. On Friday morning Dorrell fetched me to Bow-street, and my watch was produced - it is a gold watch. I produce it. The case was lost in the scuffle.</p>

            . I am a brushmaker, and live in Bird-street, Manchester-square. On the 8th of December I was in St. James's-square, saw the prisoner run against Mr. Davis, and snatch the watch from his pocket, the gang was round - he stumbled and fell to the ground. I pursued him to the bottom of King-street, there took him into custody, and found the gold watch and seals, without the case, in his right-hand breeches-pocket. I am sure he is the man. I delivered it to Mr. Davis on the 10th, at Bow-street.</p>

I found the watch in his breeches-pocket. A number of persons were with him at first, who hustled a great many people.</p>

I was at the Red Lion, public-house, on Wednesday, the 5th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; the prisoner came in with his foraging cap and great coat on, and said he had been walking all night. He went up stairs, then came down in about a quarter of an hour with his great coat off, and a bundle wrapped up in it. I asked him for a piece of leather? He left the bundle on the table, went up stairs, and brought a piece down. He went up again, came down, and went out with the bundle.</p>

I pursued and secured them in a field opposite the house, and brought them into the road. When I got an officer, I returned to the spot where I took them, and picked up a handkerchief with the plated castor in it - I did not find the other things. They were safe in the cupboard when I went out; the prisoners said a third boy had been with them; I found a candlestick in the field about an hour after.

On Sunday, the 5th of December, about one o'clock in the afternoon, I went down to the Fourteen Acre field, and found a very valuable ram had been killed; the skin and three feet were cut off, and left, but the carcase was gone. I traced the footsteps of two men over the hedge and up to Elstree, to a cottage in which Clark lived - Cartwright lived farther down the village. Next morning I got a warrant to search Clark's house first, and found part of a very fine fat shoulder of mutton, dressed. Clark came in at the time, and we asked him where he bought it? He said at Watford, but afterwards said he thought it was at Jonathan's of Edgware. We then went to Cartwright's, and found two bits of fat mutton, they were parts of a shoulder, and a bag, which was fresh with fat and blood, as if hot meat had been in it. We took them into custody, took a shoe off each of them, and compared them with the foot-marks - they matched in length and breadth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blood near to where the skin was found - A. Yes, the sheep appeared to have been killed there. It was a wet day; I could trace them step by step on the grass, and lost the trace between two and three hundred yards from Clark's house. On Tuesday, the 7th,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120007"/>Pinnimore fetched me to the Artichoke, public-house, where I found some mutton; the shank of the shoulder matched with that found at Clark's - they appeared both to belong to the same sheep.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The mutton found at both the houses was dressed - A. Yes. The shoulder-bone found at Clark's matched the shank.</p>

            . I am constable of Great Stanmore. I had a warrant, and searched Clark's house, and found part of a shoulder of mutton, dressed; I also found part of a shoulder, undressed, at Field's, who keeps the Artichoke, public-house - it corresponds with the other; there is a splinter in the bone, which matches with it; I found two small pieces and a bag at Cartwright's. Three days afterwards. I saw the mutton at Field's, and compared the feet with two legs, which were found in a hollow tree. They appeared to match exactly when I first saw them, but they have been so long in the bag that the sinews are contracted. I am a butcher myself; they were jointed in a different way to what butchers would do them. The bag found at Cartwright's was very greasy and bloody - the fat of mutton was very plainly to be seen in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If he had bought a sheep's head, and put into the bag, it would have this appearance - A. No, there was suet and kidney fat.</p>

            . I am a butcher and farmer. On the 7th of December, in the afternoon, a man came to say some mutton was found in a hollow tree in my field. I went to the hollow tree - several men were round it - it was taken out before I got there. I found two legs of mutton, part of a loin, a neck with part of a loin to it, part of two shoulders, and other parts, cut in a very unbutcher-like manner; they were taken to Field's next day (Wednesday). I was present and saw the part of the shoulder which the constable produced - the bone appeared to correspond. I have no doubt but it belonged to the same animal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The bone was dressed - A. Yes; the other was raw. There might be a bone to fit it which did not belong to it - it matched to a nicety. Roasting would not alter it much.</p>

On the 31st of December the prisoner came and had a bed at my house, he came down next morning between ten and eleven o'clock, and as he passed the bar he asked if he could have a bed at night again? I said Yes. In all, who was in the bar, said he had robbed him of a pair of sheets sometime ago. I immediately sent up to see if mine were safe. I found the sheets on his bed, but missed a pair off a bed in the next room; he ran out, we pursued him down West-street, and secured him on Little Saffron-hill, brought him back, and took the sheets from his person.</p>

            . I am a publican. I was at Lloyd's on the morning of the 1st of January, we were talking in the bar, the prisoner came down, and asked if he could sleep there that night, Lloyd said he could. When he was gone I said I believed he was the young man who had robbed me of a pair of sheets. Lloyd sent the servant up, she said she missed the sheets from the next room. I followed and took him on Little Saffron-hill, unbuttoned his clothes, took the sheets from round his body, and found a towel in his hat.</p>

I missed it about ten o'clock, and asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about it? as I suspected him. He said he knew nothing of it; he is the son of the person who keeps the shop. About ten days afterwards he behaved disorderly at home, and they gave him in charge of an officer, who found the duplicate on him.</p>

I went down into the cellar with Lade, and found the silver in the hole, and in a piece of tissue paper on the opposite side of the hole, was a pearl ring. I put it back, and informed Mr. Duper - I merely went out of curiosity, knowing the prisoner kept his money there. I then went down with Duper, and saw him find two knife-rests in the same hole.</p>

On the opposite side of the hole I found two silver knife-rests, which I took up stairs with the ring, and called the prisoner into the parlour - he denied all knowledge of it. I then went into the cellar, brought up the silver, and asked him if he knew any thing of that? He said that was his. I fetched the officer.</p>

            , I am servant to Mr. Sparks. About three o'clock in the morning, of the 1st of January, I was going to his cow-house, and found the lock off the door - the watchman was close behind me; the prisoner came out in a great hurry, we seized him and took him to the watch-house. I called my master up, and we went to the cow-house; I had left the saddle-cloths and bridles hanging up in the loft - they were gone. I found them on the dung-hill, about fourteen yards from the loft, covered with straw. I found the lock of the door inside the premises; I found a crow-bar and a piece of the binding of a hat in the loft.</p>

            . I live in Dean-street, Westminster. On the 28th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with two others and watched them; a cart and a coach passed by. The prisoner crossed the road, and took the tea-board from Brooks's door. I called out Stop thief! and followed him down the Almonry with the tea-board under his arm. I turned up the New Way and saw two boys. One of them said,</p>
               <p>"What a row I have made." I heard a whistle - they turned and met the prisoner in the middle of Orchard-street, then all three turned down New Tothill-street into Swiss-yard. The prisoner went up to a cart and put the tea-board into it. I went to Mr. Brooks's other house and told him of it. He went with me, and took the prisoner at the corner of Swiss-yard. I never left the prisoner until I brought him to the cart, took the tea-board out, and gave him to the officer. I am quite sure he is the boy who took it. I had seen him before.</p>

               <p>Q. One of the women went out for gin - A. Yes; the prisoner was close to me. In about a minute she said she wanted to go down stairs, which she did immediately. I missed my watch which was safe just before, and told the other girl that my watch was gone. I went down, found the prisoner in the back yard, and charged her with it - she said I might search her, but I could not find it. She went up stairs with me, and remained about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after. I asked her for my watch? She denied it, and told me to go about my business. I fetched an officer, and gave her in charge about an hour after. I have never found the watch. I had been with no other girl.</p>

On the 22d of December, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I saw him leave work, he passed me; I was at that moment inquiring if my orders respecting the cuttings of lead had been complied with. I called to him as he passed, and said,</p>
               <p>"Plumber, have you brought down any cuttings?" He did not attend to me, but kept walking on. I called again, he said,</p>
               <p>"Sir;" but kept still going on. I followed, and overtook him just beyond the gateway which leads out of the premises. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you stop, don't you hear what I say to you?" On looking at him I saw he had something concealed under his dress, and on laying my hand on his side, I felt something which I had no doubt was lead, brought him back a short distance towards the premises, and called Churchill and Welch. While I was endeavouring to get the lead from him it fell from under his waistcoat. He said he hoped I would look it over. I said I should make an example of him, as a warning to others. He was taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he worked there - A. One week; the lead is mine. I had given orders that the cuttings should be brought to the counting-house, which is inside the gate, he had passed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. He said he went outside the gate for a necessary purpose - A. No. He had come down a ladder sixty feet high from where he worked; the men usually carry lead on their shoulders.</p>

Last Saturday night I sent him into the cellar to put some old nails by; I suspected him, listened, and distinctly heard him take up several handsfull of nails. He came out of the cellar, I waited about ten minutes till Bond came in, then called him and the prisoner into the counting-house, and ordered him to deliver up the nails which he had taken from what he took down into the cellar; he said he had none. I said if he did not deliver them up I would send for an officer. He then emptied both his waistcoat-pockets of nails, and begged of me to forgive him, as it was his first offence - there were 3 lbs. of nails. While I sent for an officer he made his escape out of the counting-house into the smith's shop; I followed, and brought him back, he got on a ladder, and partly dragged me up; I hung to his collar; he made a slip, and shook me off; he then ascended the ladder, got on the shed, and broke through a window into a woman's room; he could not escape through there, and returned. I found him on the roof of Mr. Dickenson's livery stables, and gave him in charge.</p>

He told us that the prisoner had called there in the evening; he went with me and the officer to the Mansion House. We then went to look after the prisoner, but could not find him - we found

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Phelps. On Saturday, the 18th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, I was going to shut up the shop under the Change, and heard somebody getting behind the outer gate. I took a light to see who it was. The instant the prisoner saw me he ran from behind the gate, and as soon as he got into Castle-alley he called out to somebody. In a few minutes he returned and asked me if I was going to shut up the shop? I said Yes, and he bid me good night. I shut up the shop, locked the outer gates, and went home. I am sure the prisoner is the man. I have seen him at the Change before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. It may be about two months - I only know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120013"/>him by his coming to the Change to inquire for a situation - I did not know his name. I never visited him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday morning I was sent for to the Exchange, and found the shop broken open - I told the gentleman it had not been done by a regular housebreaker. It appeared to have been done with a knife, and in a very awkward manner. I then went to the apprentice, searched him, and brought him to Mr. Wontner - he described the prisoner, and I apprehended him at a public-house in Dunk-street. He asked me what I took him for? I said I had some pencil-cases, and that the girl he was to meet at night could not meet him. I found a pencil-case and 23 s. on him; I also found an umbrella in the parlour where he had been; he said the umbrella was his sister's. He said he expected to be taken, and he would tell me all about it - I told him to say nothing about it. He said the man that was with him was to meet him that night, and that he had only 20 s. out of the property that was pawned at Greenwich. At Atkins's I found five umbrellas, the duplicates of the property, some watch-keys and seals, a knife, some silver pencil-cases, and a toothpick. I found a knife, two pencil-cases, and a toothpick at Parnell's, as she has stated.</p>

Not shutting the door, the lady with whom I was sitting went out, and shortly after she called me; I went and found my great coat had been taken.

               <p>"Adone, don't take my father's coat." I went out, missed the coat, and saw the prisoner, Walters, at the door with the apples, and asked him if he saw any one take it? Instead of answering me, he said,</p>
               <p>"Do you want any apples, Ma'am?" I wished to pass into the street, but he put his sieve of apples before me to prevent me. I again asked him if he saw any one take it? He said,</p>

               <p>Q. Were you able to pass with your waggon - A. There was not room. The deceased stopped, went to the prisoner, and asked him civilly to be so good as to move his cart a yard forwards. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"No, d - n his eyes, there was room enough for any man that knew how to use his whip." The deceased said to me,</p>
               <p>"Go on, Will; we can pass if any one can." Our waggon touched the hind part of the prisoner's cart, but did no injury. We passed both the dust and potatoe-carts without doing any injury. Immediately as we got past, the prisoner ran up, hit the deceased right and left, and knocked him under the wheel. I ran from the fore horse, which I had hold of, to save the deceased, and said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"What did you hit him for?" he up with his fist, and knocked me against the horse of the potatoe-cart. Our horses, being young, went on before I could recover myself, and ran over the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you done any thing to the prisoner before he hit you - A. No, I only asked what he hit the deceased for?</p>
               <p>Q. If he had not struck you, could you have saved the deceased - A. I think he must have had one leg broken, but I should have saved his arm. I called to the horses to stop, and as I was taking hold of the deceased, I asked him what he hit him for? and he knocked me down. The horses went on; the fore wheel of the waggon went over his legs, and the hind and fore wheel over his arm. We took the deceased to the Westminster Infirmary. The prisoner must have seen the situation the poor man was in, when he struck me, he was not two yards from him. This was on Thursday, he died on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prisoner know the deceased before - A. Not that I know of. He drove, and had the whip. The waggon had thirty-five sacks of coals in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You had a team of young horses - A. Yes. We were near the end of Bedfordbury, which is the narrowest part of the street, and were going towards St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your mate use very coarse language to the prisoner - A. Not that I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not somebody say to the deceased,</p>
               <p>"I'd be d - d if I would not go on at any rate" - A. No. I had the fore horse, the deceased was at the wheel horse.</p>
               <p>Q. When you passed the prisoner's cart, did not somebody cry out,</p>
               <p>"Why you have almost killed a man" - A. Several cried out so when the deceased was ran over. Our waggon drove the hind part of his cart towards the houses. If our horses had not gone on this would not have happened. The whooping and hallooing would make them go on.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The cry of</p>
               <p>"You have almost murdered a man!" was after the deceased was ran over - A. Yes. When the horses stopped the deceased laid just before the fore wheel. I could have saved him if the prisoner had not struck me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could the prisoner have made room with his cart if he chose - A. Yes, and it was in his power to have helped the deceased up, if he had been so disposed.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did not your mate think there was room to pass as he went on - A. As the prisoner said there was room, my mate told me to go on, and said he would see if he could pass. There was not room - we hit his cart in going by.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you saw the horses going on again why not stop them - A. They stood still until he struck me, then the hallooing made them go on.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was in Chandos-street - the dust-cart stood on one side, and a potatoe-waggon on the other, which blocked up the street - there was not room for a waggon to pass between them; the dust-cart stood about fourteen inches from the curb, a sufficient space could have been made by moving it nearer to the pavement. The deceased went to the prisoner, and begged him to move on about a yard, and he would have room to pass; he spoke as civil us any man could, but all he could do he could not prevail on him, he refused. A Hammersmith stage-coachman got off his box, and asked him to move, he would not. The coachman went to move his horses a bit, and the prisoner knocked him under the horses' feet. At that moment the prisoner went in to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120016"/>bring out some dust, taking no farther notice, and without moving his cart. The coachman was covered with mud; he got up, and asked which of the two dustmen had knocked him down? the prisoner said he was the man, and if he wanted any thing to come out into the street, and he would serve him the same again; the coachman then went away to his coach. The prisoner went, and fastened his horse's head down to the collar, he would not move his cart. He turned, and went into a cook-shop for dust, saying there was room enough for any man who knew how to use his whip. At that moment the deceased dragged his horses on slowly; the wheel of his waggon touched the wheel of the dust-cart, and brought the cart and horses round, and turned the horses's heads into the middle of the street, no mischief was done. The deceased was near the centre of his horses, and Hughes was at the horses' heads, leading them - the dust-cart was partly over the pavement. Several people were standing by; it was very near driving them through the window. The prisoner did not wait to put his cart right, but ran off after the deceased - the waggon was still going on, until it got about thirty yards down the street. The prisoner swore with an oath that he would knock him down; and as the hind part of the waggon was passing the fore horse of the potatoe-cart, he shot by between them, and came up to the deceased behind him - he touched him on the left shoulder, and as the deceased turned round, he gave him a violent blow, and knocked him right forward under the horses' feet; the horses were then going on - he fell under the nearest horse to the shaft horse. Hughes hallood to the horses to stop, they stopped for about half a second. The deceased cried out,</p>

               <p>"For God's sake stop the horses!"</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from him then - A. Not a yard, I suppose. He had sufficient time to draw him from under the horses and save his life, if he liked, but he made no attempt to do it. Hughes left the fore horse immediately, came to the prisoner, and asked him what he did that for? he up with his fist and knocked him on the pavement - he went against the front of the houses, or he must have fallen.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, might the prisoner have saved the poor man's life - A. In my opinion he could have done it if he had wished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This happened in the narrow part of the street, near Bedfordbury - A. Yes; the accident happened there, but the dust-cart stood about thirty yards nearer to Covent-garden. The pavement is so narrow, that when the dust-cart swung round, it endangered the lives of the passengers. Some women cried out,</p>
               <p>"You have nearly killed the people." Mr. White was in his shop, his window was not broken. I think there was not room for a person to pass between the tail of the cart and the houses - there is not room for more than two when there is no obstruction - the cart was turned round. The prisoner used bad expressions, and followed the deceased directly. The horses were going on when he struck him - they stood still at the instant he struck Hughes, the hallooing made them go on. The potatoe-cart was rather more towards St. Martin's-lane than the dust-cart; the horses' heads were both one way.</p>
               <p>Q. The Hammersmith coachman used very coarse language - A. He said he must be at his destination at a certain time.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. The potatoe-cart was quite close to the pavement unloading - A. Yes; if the dust-cart had been close there would have been plenty of room. The horses did not stop until the deceased fell. I declare the prisoner might have saved the man's life with all the pleasure in the world.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in Chandos-street, on the left-hand side of the way, coming from St. Martin's-lane. Just as I came by Bedfordbury I saw some confusion. I got about three doors past Bedfordbury, and saw the dust-cart with the ladder against the wheel - the foot of the ladder was against the curb-stone, to keep it from slipping. I had not time to observe any thing else, before the dust-cart turned short round - I could not pass, and crossed over, about thirty yards farther down towards St. Martin's-lane, and just as I came round the horses' heads of the coal-waggon, the prisoner came and struck at the deceased, who stood by the next horse to the shaft horse, the horses were then going on. The deceased called out,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake stop the horses!" I called out,</p>
               <p>"Bring a light!" the deceased laid close by the horses' feet, under the shaft horse. I turned to look at the prisoner, for he nearly hit me when he struck the deceased. Hughes came towards the prisoner, and said,</p>
               <p>"What did you hit my mate for?" the prisoner up with his fist, hit him away from the horses' heads, and from his mate, as he was going to stop the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner had not struck him from the horses might he not have stopped them - A. I should think he might. The horses instantly went on again, and I heard the man groan. I got a light, and saw him lying flat on his back, with his leg broken to pieces, his whip laid by him. I secured the prisoner with assistance. At that instant Hodge, the prisoner's partner, came up, and told him to bolt; for it was all wrong. I left the prisoner in custody of some people I knew. I took Hodge also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You must have been as near the deceased when he fell as the prisoner was - A. I dare say I was. I was glad to get out of the way from the scuffle. I had no idea at that moment that he was in any danger, and thought he would have scrambled out of the way.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see Hughes come up to the prisoner - A. Yes, my Lord. The horses had been made to stop for a moment - the mischief was occasioned by their going on. Hughes called whoa! to the horses, and then went up to the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was standing in Mr. Bennett's shop, just opposite the tail of the coal-waggon. I heard a great confusion in the street, and saw the dust-cart at the cook-shop door. Somebody asked the dustman to move on. I came out, and heard one of the dustmen say, d - n their eyes, they would not move for any one. I came to the tail of the coal-waggon, a coachman was knocked down against me; I ran back to the shop, returned, and heard some one order the coal-waggon to drive on. I crossed over by the eating-house, and was driven into the door by the tail of the dust-cart. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120017"/>heard the prisoner use bad expressions, and say he would knock him down, or give him a downer. In a moment after I heard the deceased cry out,</p>
               <p>"You have murdered me!" or</p>
               <p>"I am murdered!" He laid with his arm over his head; his leg was crushed to pieces. I wiped the blood off his face, and helped to carry him to the hospital.</p>

            . I am house surgeon of the Westminster hospital. The deceased was brought in about six o'clock in the evening. I found him with a severe compound fracture of his left leg and left arm - amputation was performed. He lived until six o'clock on Friday evening. The injury he received was the cause of his death.</p>

            . I lodge in Chandos-street. I was looking out of window, and heard the deceased say he would go by. The Hammersmith coachman got off his box, and asked who the dust-cart belonged to? he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n me if I don't see who it belongs to." He moved it to make room. There was an altercation between him and one of the dustmen. A man said,</p>
               <p>"If I belonged to that waggon I would see if I could not pass or no." The deceased then said,</p>
               <p>"D - n me if I don't go on." He whipped his horses violently, and they went very fast along, and his waggon turned the dust-cart furiously round - one or two persons on the pavement had nearly met with an accident from it, if White's door had not been open. The prisoner ran across after the waggoner - I saw nothing more.</p>

            . I keep a cook-shop in Chandos-street - the dust was loading from my house. The prisoner was filling in my cellar, and the other dustman was minding the horse. The wheel of the cart was nearly a foot from the pavement. There was a potatoe-waggon nearly opposite my house. The coal-heaver asked the prisoner's mate to move, that he might pass; he refused until he had done, and said they were allowed twenty minutes. He fetched another basket up, and was again asked to move, but refused - he went down again. A coachman got off his box, and d - d and swore; he looked into my house, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you move this cart?" He began to abuse a man, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why don't you move this cart?" The man said the cart was nothing to him. The coachman said, that unless he found the man that did belong to it he would move it himself. He went to the horse's head - the prisoner was underneath, and must have heard all that passed. He ran up and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n me, the first man that moves my horse I'll knock him down." He rushed out, and the coachman came to my door covered with mud. I did not see him knocked down. I went out and told the prisoner to move away, and come another day for the dust. The prisoner immediately went to move his cart. He said he would move it for me, but not for them. He was just clearing from my window to move it, when it was jammed against my door. I crept out of my door, under the cart, after the coal-waggon, to take the number. I saw a woman with her hands up, screaming Murder! Just as I passed the waggon; I saw a man lying in the road; he appeared to have been ran over - he was carried away on a shutter. I took the name on the waggon, for running violently against my house and endangering peoples' lives. I have known the prisoner two years - he is an inoffensive man, and acted with forbearance.</p>

I went up, and as I entered the room the prisoner stood with the door in his hand, which was open. I asked him what he had been doing? he said he had done nothing to her. She sat at the bed-side, on the floor; I went to her, and saw a quantity of blood under her and near her. She said the prisoner pulled her out of bed, that she fell on her back, and was much hurt. He was on the landing-place and could hear, but made no answer. She said she supposed it would bring on labour, and told me to shut the door and not let him in, as the floor was not in a fit state to be seen. I put her on the bed, the blood then increased very much. I called the landlady up. The prisoner was going down stairs before me, I hurried him down. Mrs. Gardener and I went up, the blood still kept increasing. She died in about three-quarters of an hour.</p>

I took it from him, and said she was dying, and that after he had ill-used her it was a poor recompence to make her drunk. He cried over her, tore his hair, and said he would not leave her.

            . I am a surgeon. I was fetched to the deceased; she was alive, but speechless, and dying, apparently, from the loss of blood - she was near her time. The impression on my mind was that she was flooding to death from the rupture of vessels within. I examined her for the purpose of delivering her, but found it impossible. I could discover no external bruise whatever. On opening her I observed a small fissure, or opening, near the urethra, which communicated with a branch of a large blood-vessel, from which the blood had discharged. She died from the loss of blood. At that advanced period of pregnancy the vessels are much extended, a blow or fall might have ruptured it, but I think not without one or other of them.</p>
               <p>Q. It does happen at times - A. Yes, great exertions all day, and strong passion will do it, but I should rather attribute it to a blow or fall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking with my shopmates, she came to the public-house, and drank with us, we then went and bought different articles. She went home, and I stopped with a friend. I went home about a quarter before one o'clock, she was abed in her clothes, and began to blow me up for sing out. I said,</p>
               <p>"If you blow me up I will go and walk the streets all night." My little boy said,</p>
               <p>"Don't go, father" - I hit him a slap. She said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, don't murder him!" She jumped out of bed, and fell against the bedstead. I did not think she was hurt until the woman came up; I then went and got her some liquor. They said I must go to the watch-house; she held out her hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"Tom, don't go with them."</p>

I have a desk in my office, of which I keep the key myself, and in a drawer of that desk, of which I keep the key, are kept the keys of my own and the Company's iron chests, and other places where I keep my property. The company is designated right in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. In your iron chest did you usually keep money - A. Yes, there was above 400 l. in Bank notes, also some guineas and half guineas, some foreign gold coins and seven shilling-pieces; there was also three mourning rings and a small ivory scent-box, all in the iron chest.</p>
               <p>Q. In the Skinners Companys' iron chest, was there any plate belonging to them - A. A great deal; there was also a good deal of my plate in the pantry, such as silver spoons and forks, which were in use. I had a large silver cup or urn, which was presented to my father by the Company - it had an inscription on it; my father left it to me. It was kept in a red leather case in my dressing-room, up one pair of stairs, next to the pantry - it was under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner ever in your service - A. Yes, for six or seven years - he has left me about five or six years. I procured him a place in the Customs, which he left about a year ago. He had a complete knowledge of my premises, and knew where I kept my valuable property.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out of town on the 18th of December - A. I left town about twelve o'clock that morning. I arrived in town next day, and found every thing gone. The drawer, in which I keep my keys, was opened, and all the property mentioned in the indictment gone. I lost above 700 l. worth of property. The lock was wrenched off the urn-case, and the urn gone.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of a message, did you afterwards see the prisoner at Coldbath-fields - A. I did, on Wednesday or Thursday after Christmas day. I neither threatened or promised him. I did not speak a word to him. I had never objected to his visiting my house.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did he stay - A. Till about one o'clock - he left about an hour after. He said we need not let him out, for he could do that himself. He went up stairs and did not return, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time in the night did you think you heard any thing - A. As we went up stairs to bed about ten o'clock, Newberry observed that she heard a noise which she imputed to a strange cat; I did not hear it, and thought nothing of it, as she was timid; I shut up the house in the evening after dark, as usual - several persons came in the evening, but none but what I let out. The last person I let out was at about half-past nine o'clock. I then carefully shut all the doors and double locked and bolted them. I arose about twenty minutes after eight o'clock in the morning, and took a parcel to Gracechurch-street for the stage to take to my master's country-house at Case Orton. When I went out I found the doors on the single lock, but Newberry was up before me, so I thought she might have opened them, and did not notice it. A little after ten o'clock Newberry went into my master's office to clean it, as was usual on a Sunday morning; she called me, and I, observed some gold coin lying on the desk, and a key lying on some papers on the desk. My master's iron chest was open, and some canvas bags lying on the floor, empty. I immediately suspected thieves had been in the house, went up to the pantry where the plate is kept in a drawer, and found the drawer empty - the plate was all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know whether it was there just before - A. I had not seen it that day. I went to my master's dressing room, and found the case which had the urn in it standing in the middle of the floor empty - I knew there was an urn in that case. I went down to a drawer in the kitchen where I had money for the use of the house, and found 4 l. in notes and 25 s. in silver and copper all gone; there was a red mark on one of them, which I had received from

I got up about eight o'clock in the morning, and did not open the street door before Barnes went out - nobody else was in the house. After breakfast I went to clean my master's office, and found the office door wide open, which I had locked at nine o'clock the night before. After Mr. M'Daniel had left the house, I had locked it, and left the key in it. On opening the shutters I found some gold lying on the desk, and papers scattered about, which was not so the overnight. I called Barnes, who came and saw the iron chest open. I have heard her account, and it is correct as she has stated it. There was no appearance of violence on my master's door, or the street door.</p>

            . I am an officer of Middlesex. In consequence of the robbery, I was employed to go to the prisoner's house, No. 10, Nelson's-terrace, Hackney-road, on Monday, the 20th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon. It consists of two rooms; I found an old woman below, he lives next door. The prisoner was in the upper room, on the bed, and appeared to be asleep; he was dressed. I ordered him to get up; the house is his. He got up and asked me what I wanted? I said I had a warrant to search his place, and would search him first. In his right-hand breeches-pocket I found two guineas in gold, 1 ls., and two sixpences. I asked him where he got the guineas? He said they were his own, and he had had them for several years. On searching him downwards, I found a guinea of

             the First on the floor, and asked him if it was his? He said No, it was a plaything which his wife had given the child - Mr. M'Daniel was with me. I called the prisoner's wife up, and asked her if the guinea belonged to her? - he must have heard me. She said No; the prisoner then slipped by the side of me and went down stairs. I followed and secured him immediately, took him back and searched the room, but found nothing else there them. I took him down, searched the room below, and found two new pieces of stuff for gowns, and about eight yards of new flannel. I asked his wife, in his hearing, if they were hers? and where she bought them? She said she bought them on Saturday at a shop in Shoreditch. I told her that she must have bought them on Monday, but she insisted that it was Saturday, and said she would not tell me the shop she bought them at, but I must find it out - Mr. M'Daniel was in a small yard, belonging to the house, at this time; he brought a small canvas bag in, and said, in the prisoner's presence,</p>
               <p>"Here is something, I have found this under the tiles over the privy.". I asked him if he had examined it? He said he had not, and I opened it in the presence of them all; it contained two guineas, two half guineas, three seven shilling-pieces, three gold mourning rings, and an oval ivory scent-box. I asked the prisoner if they belonged to him? He said No, he knew nothing about them. I took him before J. E. Conant, Esq., that night, and after a slight examination he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to his house again - A. Some few days after - his wife was in custody at the time;

            . I am clerk to Mr. Gregg. On Saturday,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120020"/>the 18th of December, I left the office about eight o'clock in the evening; I gave 
               <persName id="t18200112-44-person473">Elizabeth</persName>
             a parcel to take to the stage in the morning, and told her I was going - Newberry opened the door to receive the parcel, and I went away; there is a door between the office and the house. I am certain I closed the door - it has a spring lock, and cannot be opened from the office side without a key - I pushed it to, and tried it; it merely communicates between the house and the office. After that I pulled the office door to which leads into the passage; I shut that, and tried it - it was quite fast. I then came to the hall gate, which has a spring lock, pulled that to, and tried it - it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the outer door of the whole of Skinners' Hall - A. Yes, and after that there is an iron gate, which I pulled to - any one can open that, but you cannot get into the house without opening three strong doors, all of which were secured with spring locks. Any one can get out of the house with ease, but nobody can get in - there is no keyhole outside, so that the lock cannot be picked. Nobody can get in without force.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday did you accompany Salmon to the prisoner's house - A. Yes, he has stated correctly what passed - I went into the yard, and looked under the files of the privy, put my finger into a small hole, and pulled out a bag, which I took in immediately, and did not open it, till Salmon did in the prisoner's and his wife's presence. It contained three mourning rings, a scent-box, some guineas, and some smaller gold.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Nelson's-terrace, next door to where the prisoner lived. On Sunday, the the 19th of December, the prisoner's wife called me in and paid me 1 s. for sprats, which she had bought of me in the course of the week. The prisoner gave me a guinea to fetch some liquor; I brought a pint of gin, and gave the change to his wife. On that Monday, before I got the gin, she gave me four half guineas to go to a pawnbroker's, in the Minories, to redeem some bombasin. The pawnbroker refused them as being light, and said he would take them at 9 s. each - the prisoner was taken up while I was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Next day, did the prisoner's wife give you any money - A. On Tuesday I went to wash for her; she gave me half a guinea to fetch liquor, which I did, and gave her the change. On the day she was taken into custody, which was on the Monday after Christmas-day, she gave me a guinea to go to Mitchell's, in Hackney-road, to redeem two table-cloths and a sheet, which were pledged for 12 s. I redeemed them, and gave her the change. I never pledged for her. After she was taken I was left in care of the house and child, by Mr. M'Daniel. While I was in the house, no one ever came into it but my mother, who came to sleep with me.</p>

I know the prisoner's wife; I saw her once - she bought eight yards of flannel, eight yards of stuff, which, I believe, was purple, and four yards and three-quarters of plaid, on Monday, the 20th of December; they came to 37 s. 9 d., she gave me a 1 l. note and a guinea, which I gave to Mr. Cater. He afterwards gave the same note to Salmon; I have seen it since in his possession, it is the note I took of her - (looks at one produced by Salmon) - it is the same, I am positive, by the name on the back, which I wrote with pencil at the time it was paid. There is a sufficient trace for me to know it - I put my initials on it.</p>

            . I am Governor of the House of Correction, Coldbath-fields, the prisoner was in my custody. On the 30th of December the turnkey brought me a message, in consequence of which I sent for Mr. Gregg, who came - he and I saw him in my house. No promise, threat, or inducement whatever was held out to him. I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is Mr. Gregg." The prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"I wish to make a full confession respecting the robbery" - he was in my custody for this robbery. He said, that on the Saturday of the robbery he went to the prosecutor's house in the morning, and came away at one o'clock in the day. He said the robbery was committed by him, and a man named 
               <persName id="t18200112-44-person479">

            ; that he had known Kemp sometime, and that Kemp had frequently asked him to rob his master, but he never could make up his mind to do it until that time. He said he went on Saturday night to Mr. Gregg's between seven and eight o'clock, got over the iron gate, and went through the yard down to the passage door, which was shut - he lifted up the latch, went in, and concealed himself in the house until after the servants were gone to bed, he then let in Kemp, who proceeded to break open the drawers. I asked him what he broke them open with? he said with a piece of iron, rather bent at one end, but he did not recollect what he called it. I said,</p>
               <p>"Did he call it a jemmy?" he said Yes. He said Kemp opened a drawer, and took some keys which belonged to the iron chest; that they proceeded to another room, where there was an urn, and after he had got the urn Kemp went away with it and some other things to Kemp's house, No. 7, Gibraltar-row, St. George's-fields. I asked him how long Kemp was away before he returned? he said about an hour; that he came back, he let him in again, and they proceeded to take away the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120021"/>plate and other things; that they left the house a little after twelve o'clock, and took a coach in Cheapside to go to Kemp's house. They stopped in Blackfriars-road to get some rum, and then went to Kemp's house with the property - he had more rum there, and came home. He said he brought away from Kemp's, I think, nine or ten guineas, and that the gold which was found on him, the gold he had parted with, and the gold and the rings that were found, were part of the property stolen from Mr. Gregg's. He was asked about the notes, he said that was all he had - that the rest was left at Kemp's. I think he said he never saw any notes. Kemp was apprehended that day, and discharged.</p>
               <p>MR. GREGG re-examined. I have heard this account; it is perfectly correct.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'DANIEL re-examined. On the 30th of December I was in the yard of the House of Correction, Mr. Gregg was in the Governor's house, the prisoner was coming out of the house, and met me in the yard. He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. M'Daniel, I have told the whole truth, I have confessed to all." I said I was glad to hear it; he immediately replied,</p>
               <p>"I hope Mr. Gregg will grant me a free pardon - do you think he will?" I said it was impossible for me to say. I then asked him what had become of all the property?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise him any thing - A. No; he said he had mentioned the name of the party who had it. I asked him if he had remained in the house from the time he was there in the afternoon of the Saturday? he said, No, he came in the evening, about seven o'clock; that he came into the passage leading to the office, and got over the iron gate, and tore his coat in getting over; that he then crossed the yard, went to the area steps, found the kitchen door shut, and opened it, but did not shut it again; he went up stairs, and secreted himself in the house until the servants were gone to bed; he then let in Kemp, and they effected the robbery.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. I thought you said it was impossible for any one to get in after you left - A. The time he spoke of was full an hour before I left, and before the house was fastened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I do not pretend to deny the charge, but beg leave to state the inducing cause to commit so base an act. About nine years ago I became acquainted with a person of the name of Kemp, whom I understood to have some property, and also acted as an attorney at law, and during that time I have occasionally spent the evening with him at some public-house. Many times, during that period, he has very urgently solicited me to rob my master's house, and by repeated persuasion I at last unfortunately complied, for which I feel the greatest remorse and contrition. After we had committed the robbery we went to Kemp's house, sent for liquor, and we drank together until I was made quite insensible. Kemp kept all the property, except that found on my person and premises. The robbery was done on the 18th of December, on Saturday night. I was to have met Kemp on the following Thursday, but I was taken up on the Monday previous, consequently I cannot assist my prosecutor in the recovery of his property, which I am very sorry for. I sincerely beg the forgiveness of my prosecutor, and for the mercy of this Court.</p>

The Court asked Mr. Reynolds if he objected to the Jury being discharged of the prisoner, and for him to plead Guilty? Mr. Reynolds replied, that he did not object, but at the same time he wished it to be understood that it was without any communication with the prosecutors. The Learned Recorder reminded him that if he pleaded Guilty it would be his duty to report him from the deposition made against him before the Magistrate, without any circumstance in extenuation or mitigation of his offence. The Learned Judge enquired if this application had been suggested to the prisoner by any one, and he replied that it had not. The Jury were accordingly discharged of the prisoner, who pleaded,</p>

On the 18th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a piece of pork, which came to 2 s. 4 d. He tendered me a 1 l. note. I took it up, looked at it, and said,</p>
               <p>"Pray, Sir, where did you get this note?" He immediately said,</p>
               <p>"If you don't like it here is another." I said,</p>
               <p>"I like this note perfectly well, and you as well - I shall take both you and the note." The moment I spoke he bolted out, through fourteen or fifteen people, who were in the shop; there was an immediate cry of stop thief! and four or five people pursued him out of the shop. Welch, my man, was among them.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. He had a great coat and a close coat, and an umbrella in his hand; when he was brought back to the shop he had only his close coat on, and his great coat was across his shoulder or under his arm - he had no umbrella then. I gave him in charge, and the watchman said he would take him into the parlour to search him, but he said he would not be searched without a warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave you the note, what did you do with it - A. I put it between my lips, kept it there until he was brought back, and then wrote my own name and address on it - (looks at one) - this is it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. By what means did you ascertain it to be forged - A. Because I have been a great sufferer. I have taken 45 l. in forged notes. I suspected this by the paper - it was like some I had taken.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 18th of December, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was passing along Windmill-street, Tottenham-court-road, and heard the cry of Stop thief! in John-street, which leads into Windmill-street, and is about two minutes walk from Goodge-street. I arrived at the corner of John-street, and saw the prisoner run out from St. John-street towards Charlotte-street - he had no coat on at all, but was in his shirt-sleeves. I ran after him, collared him, and to the best of my recollection he asked me what I collared him for? I said he would presently see. In a few minutes Mr. Best's man and some others arrived. I took him down John-street, and we met some people with two coats, which the prisoner claimed as his, and insisted on putting one of them on - he took the other under his arm. I took him back to the shop; he asked for his umbrella, but none was produced - the watchman was called in, and attempted to search him, but he refused to be searched without a warrant; we took him to Pancras watch-house, Cleveland-mews. The constable of the night asked him what his name was? He said,</p>
               <p>"That is nothing to you, I'll tell your master" - he gave no account of himself in my hearing. I and Howard, the constable, went to the spot where I took him, and found two half crowns and 1 s. lying on the curb there - it was good money. I suppose twenty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120023"/>minutes had elapsed after I had seized him, before we got there.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes, and have been so twenty-six years. The note is forged in every respect; it is not the impression of the Bank, nor the hand-writing of E. Staple, whose signature it purports to bear. The Bank water-mark is made in the paper, but this is done after.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How do you ascertain that - A. By experience. The Bank paper has a different feel, and is different altogether.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went there to buy pork, pulled two notes out and gave his wife one; she gave it to Best to look at, and said she believed it to be good - I had another. He said he should detain that and me. I ran out, as I could not bear the thoughts of a watch-house, and a man caught me. They wanted to search me; I said the watchman might, but he did not offer. I had no coat on when I was taken to the watch-house, I said I would tell my name when Best came, which I did. I gave my right name and address, I did not know the note was forged, and had no silver about me.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Hoskins, in High-street, Shadwell. On the 21st of December, about three o'clock, or a little after, the prisoners came to the shop, and asked to look at some Irish linen? They both looked at it and spoke about it; they bought three yards of that, and three yards of print, which came to 6 s. 6 d. together. Wicks laid down a 1 l. note to pay for them. I asked her name and address? and she gave me,</p>
               <p>"Powell, 2, Church-street, St. George's, Shadwell," which I immediately wrote on the note with a pencil, and gave it to

            , our boy, to get change. He went out, returned, and went into the parlour to Mr. Hoskins - he brought no change - (looks at the note) - this is it. It has the pencil writing on the face. I afterwards wrote it in ink at the office on the examination. It is the note Wicks paid me that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PITCHER. Q. Did I stand close to her when she gave her address? Did I not stand close to the door - She stood close by her and both spoke and acted together - they both acted in the purchase. When the note was put on the counter she was gone to the door, but she returned directly, before I had finished taking the address.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was she from Wicks - A. About three or four yards - the note laid on the counter, and I was writing on it. I do not think she was present when Wicks paid me the note, but when she gave me the address she was, She was not a moment at the door - the note was paid while she went to the door. She must have seen it when I was writing on it, as she stood where she did before, and saw me give it to the boy to get change. When the boy returned Mr. Hoskins came out of the parlour, asked her whether she could pay for the things? and asked them where they got the note? - it was said that it was suspected to be a bad one; I did not hear what else passed. Wicks asked for the goods when they came into the shop.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor, and remember the prisoners coming to the shop - they made a purchase. Scaife gave me a 1 l. note to get change. I took it out to a person, named Butler, but did not get it changed there. I took it to two other places, and at last to Mr. Dorvell's young man - they did not change it because it was forged. I took it to Mr. Dorvell, himself, who gave his opinion that it was forged, and accompanied me to my master's. I went into the parlour to Mr. Hoskins, and gave him the note; he went into the shop to Mr. Dorvell, where the prisoners were. I did not lose sight of the note until I brought it back.</p>

             brought a note into the parlour to me, I immediately went into the shop, and asked the prisoners where they got it? Wicks said she got it last night from a gentleman. I asked her the gentleman's name? She said she did not know. I then asked them both where they came from? They both said they lived in Black Lion-court, Tooley-street, or No. 29, Morgan's-lane, which I wrote on the note - this is it - (looking at it) - Pitcher said the place was called by both names. I wrote it on the note, and said it was a pity Wicks had given a false address, as I saw my young man's writing on the back,</p>
               <p>"Powell, Church-street, St. George's." Pitcher then said it was a pity she had given a false address. I asked them if they had any more of these notes about them? and if they were willing to be searched? Pitcher said,</p>
               <p>"I don't care who searches me," and turned out her pockets - there was nothing in them but a key, that I saw. I said I would detain the note, and if it proved to be a good one in the morning, I would give them the change, but if it was bad they would hear further from me. Pitcher went away and never returned. Wicks remained a little, then sidled out of the shop, and went away, leaving the note with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PITCHER. Q. You asked me if I could send for some one to pay for the goods. I went out to pledge for them - A. I cannot say I recollect it - it might be.</p>

            . I live at No. 215, High-street, Shadwell, and am a linen-draper. Curtis brought me a note. In consequence of suspicions I had of it I went to the prosecutor's, and found the prisoners in the shop; the prosecutor came from the parlour, and I told him, in their presence and hearing, that the note was forged. He said it was a pitty she had given a wrong address, and wished them to leave the note. I said I had no doubt but they were common utterers. The prosecutor took the address from Pitcher, and detained the note. Pitcher said she would go out and pledge her ring, and pay for the goods; she went out, and in a little while after Wicks followed her; I followed Wicks out. When she got to the door she did not not know which way to turn, but looked one way and then the other, as if for the other prisoner. I directed her towards my own house, being determined to apprehend her. As we were going along Pitcher came out of a pawnbroker's within one door of my own, and they joined company together immediately. I asked them to step into my shop, as I wished to have some conversation with them. I then sent for an officer, and had them apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you have any conversation with them - A. I had - Wicks said she got it from a man with whom she had been in the habit of cohabiting - they did not know I had sent for an officer. I wrote on a piece of paper,</p>
               <p>"Go for Hewitt," gave it to my boy, and said,</p>

            . My husband lives in Ratcliff-highway, and is a haberdasher; our shop is about ten minutes walk from the prosecutor's. On the 21st of December, before three o'clock, the prisoners came to my shop - it was nearer three than two. Wicks asked for womens' stockings; Pitcher stood by her. They both looked at them, and bought two pair at 18 d. each.</p>
               <p>Q. Who purchased - A. Both looked at them, and talked about them, respecting whether they were large enough. Wicks produced a 1 l. bank note - Pitcher stood by her at the time. I asked Wicks for the address? and she gave me</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Smart, No. 2, Fort-place, Bermondsey" I should imagine it was in Pitcher's hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. On Wicks giving you the address did Pitcher make any remark - A. No. I wrote on the note before them - this is it - (looking at it) - Pitcher was persuading Wicks to buy a stuff dress, but she said she could not afford it that day, and she would call again. I gave 17 s. in change - I believe Wicks took it; one of them took the stockings away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner PITCHER. Q. Did I not stand at the door the while - A. Not the whole of the time. They came in together, and talked about the stockings; Pitcher afterwards went to the door, and returned; the door is a very few yards from where Wicks stood. She was scarcely a moment at the door, she only looked at some stuffs, came back before the address was given, and was present when it was given.</p>

Both looked at it and both agreed to purchase; to the best of my recollection I delivered the stuff to Pitcher - the person to whom I gave the stuff, paid me for it with a 1 l. note; it came to 6 s., and I gave the change to the same person - I believe it was Pitcher; I did not ask for a name or address, as I had not the least suspicion of its being forged.

I said it was a bad one, and asked him where he got it? he said he had it from his master, in Chancery-lane, and wanted it back again. I said I should detain him and the note, but if he had taken it of his master he would be in no danger; he refused to tell what part of Chancery-lane his master lived in. Dallas, the street-keeper, came in and detained him till Edwards came. He borrowed sixpence of one of the men, to pay for the gin he had had. He wanted at first to go away, but Dallas prevented him.</p>

            . I am the street-keeper. I went into Poor's house, and saw the prisoner and two more with three glasses of gin at the bar; the prisoner handed a 1 l. note to the bar-maid, she gave it to Poor, who asked his name and address - he said,</p>
               <p>"Wilson, Haughton-street, Clare-market;" which Poor wrote on the note, and said it was bad; he said he had it from his master, in Chancery-lane. He wanted to go away, saying, he must see about it. I said he must not go, and asked Poor if he had sent for anybody - he said he had. The prisoner then seemed very impatient, said the person was not coming, and he should go; and asked what right I had to stop him. I collared him, said I was an officer, and if he offered to stir I would knock him down. Edwards came in, and we took him to Bow-street. The prisoner asked one of the men to pay for the gin, which he did, with sixpence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he drunk - A. He appeared perfectly sober. He said at Bow-street, that he had sixpence in his pocket.</p>

            . I am clerk to the magistrates of Bow-street. I remember the prisoner being examined there, and took down what he said - he said it voluntarily; it was read over to him, and he said it was correct - (reads). The prisoner says,</p>
               <p>"This afternoon I picked up a woman's pocket in Drury-lane - it contained a 1 l. note and a 5 s. piece. I changed the 5 s. piece at the Sun, public-house, in Clare-market, and spent 4 s. 6 d. Two women were there, and Smith, a master-butcher, went with me to the prosecutor's - he was going to treat me; I thought I would treat him, as he had treated me several times. There was a thimble and a needle in the pocket, which I threw away."</p>

On Saturday morning, the 25th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I and my wife and son left the house to go out with milk. I locked the door, and put the key in my pocket - I left nobody in the house. I do not know what parish it is in. I returned about a quarter after nine o'clock, and found the back door broken open - it was bolted inside when I left. I missed the property stated in the indictment. There was 7 l. or 8 l. in copper and silver, and 5 s. or 6 s. in old halfpence, which I had put by in an old stocking - I had not seen them for a week or two - they were in a chest of drawers, which I always kept locked, and kept the key. I saw the drawer safe that morning. I also lost a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. When had you seen the knife and copper - A. Not for several weeks. My son got home before me, and was crying out that we were robbed.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor's house is in the parish of Stepney. I apprehended the prisoner on Christmas Day about eleven o'clock in the morning, and found a silk handkerchief in his hat, and an old stocking in his pocket, containing 104 old halfpence; he had thirty penny pieces and 7 d. in new halfpence, loose in his pocket, also a knife, which the prosecutor claimed. I received information, and apprehended the prisoner at his father's, in Hare-street-fields, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's. The handkerchief was in his hat, which was on the table. He was asleep by the fire. He said the hat was his.</p>

On the 28th of December, a few minutes before five o'clock in the evening, I received the articles stated in the indictment from Messrs. Judkins, Faber, and Barlow - the lamps were just being lit. I was at the corner of Skinner-street and Bishopsgate-streets, alone, and had all this linen wrapped in a damask table-cloth. All in a moment I saw three men; one of them came, knocked me down, and made an attempt to take my bundle. I thought I had better lose my life than that, and kept hold of it. In a moment one of the others came, dragged me some little way along, and got it from me - the third stood by my side, while I was screaming out as hard as I was able. He said,</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, mistress, can I assist you?" I saw a woman standing by my side, I thought she would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120027"/>assist me, but all three went off, and she went with them. I saw the man who had the bundle turn the corner with it.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were taking you bundle did you observe the features of any of them - A. The one who dragged me - I had my eye on him until he got it, which was sometime - it was that prisoner at the bar I am positively certain; I looked at him very attentively. It was very light, the snow was on the ground, and they were lighting the lamps. I could see him plainly. They all got away.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. Next day, at the Mansion-house. I knew a person was taken, but I did not know which. When I saw him at the Mansion-house he was mixed with other people - I pointed him out, and have not the least doubt of his being the man who dragged me and got my bundle from me.</p>
               <p>Q. After he got your bundle had you much view of him - A. I saw him running in the middle of the road with it, and saw him turn down the top of Skinner-street. I have found none of my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. After you made an alarm, did no one come to your assistance -

            ; she did not ask me if I could identify any of them. I went to where they said he lodged, and being told there was a very low set there, I said I did not think I could swear to any of them, as I was afraid to speak there. Nobody was produced to me there as the person.</p>

             is one of the others - he is a tall man, and has been out of the way ever since. There was another, a short man, whom I do not not know - they ran past me. I heard somebody calling, as I thought, Stop thief! I went up, and saw the prosecutrix in the middle of the road, crying out that she was robbed. I told her I had seen three young chaps with a bundle, I saw no woman near them. I directed her to Lomer's lodgings, and went with her there - he was not at home; I did not go in with her. I gave information to Gregory. Next morning, I was sweeping my room, the prisoner came up, and knocked at the door, I opened it, and asked him what he wanted? He said,</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Langley, what do you say I robbed a woman?" I told him to go about his business, or I would kick him down stairs. He said he would not go, but would deliver himself up to my husband, who is a watchman. I told my husband to take him then if he would not go, and he took him. I was present when the prosecutrix saw him at the Mansion-house, standing among twenty or thirty others - she said,</p>
               <p>"You villain, you are the person who took my bundle!" I had not pointed him out, nor given her any intimation of his being the man.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bishopsgate. On the 28th of December, about half-past five o'clock, I was informed that Cox had been robbed. I saw her with Langley. Next morning, her husband brought the prisoner to me. I told him I must take him to the Mansion-house, he said he was very willing to go. I was present when Cox first saw him at the Mansion-house, mixed with other people. She spoke to him immediately, without his being pointed out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was she not in the Justice-room when you brought me in - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went home I was told I was charged with robbing a woman, and that Langley had given information of it; Next morning I went and asked her why she charged me with it? she used bad language, and said she knew nothing of me. I told her husband I would go to any office, and gave myself up to him. When I got to the Mansion-house I had my liberty in and out until the prosecutrix came. I am innocent. I saw Langley in the evening - she interfered with company I was with. She said I was a thief, and she would seek some way to take my life. It is through family affairs.</p>
               <p>JURY to LANGLEY. Q. How long have you known the prisoner - A. He lived near me about two years; we were not acquainted. I never threatened him. He has told me he would murder me, and has knocked me down. I have told him if he did not let me alone I would serve him out some day. I have interfered with him when I have seen him do that which was not right.</p>
               <p>JURY to GREGORY. Q. Was the prisoner permitted to go in and out at the Mansion-house - A. I left him in charge of Dayer, the officer, and when I returned I found he had the liberty of the outer room. I think he might have got out if he had tried.</p>

Hoffman's, the pastry-cooks, which obstructed the passage. I felt something going out of my pocket. I immediately put my hand to my side, and found my handkerchief gone; I turned round, and saw the prisoner alone, he pushed through the crowd, from me - he caught my eye, and began to run, which excited my suspicion. I ran after him; he kept turning his head round, and increased his pace - we were both in the middle of the road. He ran into Leadenhall-street, and into the market where the stages stand. I there saw him throw the handkerchief down, and caught it as it fell - he was secured without my losing sight of him.</p>

            . I live in Haughton-street, Clare-market with Mr, Chivers, and am thirteen years of age. I was about four yards from the prosecutor; the prisoner was first, and two others behind him. The prisoner put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket, pulled the handkerchief out, and put it behind him. One of the boys took it from him, and ran by the pastry-cook's, then whistled and the other followed him down the Temple; the prosecutor caught hold of the prisoner. The people interupted me, and said I had better not say I saw it, as he would be put in prison, and so I did not like to tell at first.

On the 20th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, Satchell fetched me to the house, and said he suspected some one was robbing it. I went with him and some others, and found the prisoner walking backwards and forwards before the house. I sent some men up, and they found Pig, (who was convicted the following Session) in the building. The instant he was secured I called out for them to detain the prisoner - we took them to the watch-house. We found a piece of lead thrown down, and another piece rolled up ready to be thrown down. The prisoner said at the watch-house that they had both been there on Monday previous, and taken lead, which they had sold and shared the money between them. He said he borrowed an apron at a public-house in Gray's Inn-lane to conceal it in. He was too ill to be tried last Session.</p>

            . On the 20th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was standing at my door, and saw the prisoner lurking about the building - I watched him for about an hour; he remarked to several persons who passed that it was a dirty place. I went to the back of my house, heard a noise on the roof, and heard something fall through the building. I ran forward, and passed the prisoner, who made the same observation to me about the place. I saw Pig on the roof, and ran and informed Wilson. As we were walking towards the buildings the prisoner walked quickly towards us, and I said,</p>
               <p>"There is the man who was lurking about." I left him in Wilson's custody, and went on the roof - Pig was secured in the chimney. The prisoner said at the watch-house that they had both been there on the Monday, took lead off, and sold it to a man in Portpool-lane for 8 1/2 d. An apron was found in his pocket, and a piece of paper with these words on it,</p>
               <p>"It is time to be off." He said he gave it that night to Pig, meaning it was time to go and rob the building.</p>

               <p>"Stop the old man below, he brought me here." The lead was fixed on the building. I matched it next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A person on the premises engaged me to go with him; he said he had been assisting a plumber and wanted to fetch some cuttings. I lent him my apron, and he desired me to come into the building. I said,</p>
               <p>"Why should I come in? I think you are after no good - it is an untimely hour." The gentlemen stopped me, and they brought Pig down, who had been stealing lead as I suspected.</p>

I left about ten o'clock, and when I came up to the turnpike, the prisoner came up to me, struck me, and took my shawl - three men and two women were with him. I cannot say the prisoner was one, but one of the men came up struck me, and ran away. The woman struck me several times, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you say that man took your shawl, I will have your life." A short man came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"I took your shawl." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, the man is gone over there." I cried out Stop thief! and a watchman came up, who took me to the toll-house. I afterwards saw the prisoner standing with the others, and the patrol took him - it was the prisoner. There was a strong light from the lamps.</p>

Between six and seven o'clock in the evening, after dark, a knock came at the door, my sister-in-law went to the door, I heard a cry of thieves, went into the parlour in a minutes, and missed these things - the looking-glass was only taken from its place, and put on a chair by the window, which was up, and the blinds open. I had seen them in the parlour an an hour or two before. The tea-caddy was worth 10 s. The parlour-window was shut, and the shutters shut outside, but not fastened. I did not see the shutters shut, but about half-past five o'clock I saw the window close down - I do not think that it was fastened, it was then dark; the things were then safe, and the looking-glass hanging up. The officer produced my thimble.</p>

Last Friday evening I left my mare in a field opposite my house - the fences were entire, and the gate to, but not locked; there is a footpath through the field. I saw her safe there between eight and nine at night. I kept my poultry in the piggery, adjoining the stable, in the field - it is boarded round; I had not seen the fowls later than noon. The watchman called me up about half-past five o'clock, and informed me he thought my property was at Stamford-hill. I ran up to the turnpike, which is about a mile from my house, and the turnpike man shewed me my fowls in a sack. I knew them to be mine - they were then dead; one had its head pulled off, the others were wrenched. My mare was also at the gate, with my bridle on, also a horse-cloth, and a whip, which was in the stable when I saw it last. I know the mare to be mine. The stable-door was not locked.</p>

            . I was on duty at Stamford-hill. I am collector of the weighing tolls. On the 15th of January, at half-past four o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to the gate with a horse, wanted to go through, and said he had only a penny - the toll is 3 d. I refused to let him through; he pretended to call after a man, as his master, but nobody answered. I saw a sack across the horse's back, felt something warm in it, and pulled it out - they were five fowls, just killed. I then collared him, and my companion went for a watchman, who took him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say - A. He said his master had gone on, that the mare belonged to Mr. Russell, and that the person who had employed him, and had gone on, told him if they would not let him through, to say Mr. Russell, of Edmonton, would pay in the course of the day. Alddridge came up soon after, he saw the fowls and the mare, and claimed them.</p>

            . I am a midshipman on board his Majesty's ship Liverpool, which is stationed off the Mauritius for the purpose of detecting slave-dealing. On the <rs id="t18200112-66-cd375" type="crimeDate">2d of July</rs>

                        targets="t18200112-66-off373 t18200112-66-cd375"/> we were off Mapoor, which is part of the coast, and extends eight miles. On the morning of the 3d, a little before day-light, I was informed a vessel was in sight. I went to the mount, and observed her with my spy-glass; she was the Jenne Adolphe - I had seen that vessel before, and knew her perfectly well - she was a small ship of about one hundred and fifty tons; she appeared to be going to land off Mauritius. Her mizen topsail was aback. She was as close to the reef as she could safely be. I suspected her, and disguised the boat. After I found her in a favourable position I left my station, and went out to chase her in my boat - I came up to her about twelve o'clock; she was steering W. N. W. off the land. I boarded her, and asked the captain for the logbook; he said it was washed overboard on the 23d of last month. I asked him for his papers, and what cargo he had? he said it had been bullocks. The papers were produced, they were in French. He said the bullocks had been thrown overboard likewise on the 23d, as it blew hard, and he had split his mizen; that he had come from Tamatave (which is in the island of Madagascar) and was going to Bourbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the vessel steering in a direction for Bourbon - A. It was then; but in coming from Tamatave to Bourbon she would not come to the Mauritius. I examined the vessel - she did not appear to me to be a vessel fit for carrying bullocks, from the peculiarity of her build; she was too small between decks. I do not think they could have stood upright. The breed of bullocks at Madagascar appear to be larger than in this country - they are taller, and have a hump. They are the buffalo bullocks. I never saw any others there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of bullocks having been in the ship - A. Not the least. I saw no soil - they make a great dirt on board a ship. There were eleven tubs or kids on board; the vessel had only ten men on board. The tubs and kids were more than sufficient for that complement of men. There were some particles of rice in one or two of them, as if men had been fed out of them. She was brought to anchor, and the following day the same crew were on board. I found twenty-two pair of handcuffs, and three hammers for clenching the irons, under the captain's bed-place, in the lower bed-place. The crew were sent on board our frigate. General 
               <persName id="t18200112-66-person699">Downing</persName>
             is Governor of the Mauritius; it is in our possession. I do not know the prisoner, Carrol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Do you understand French - A. A little - I cannot read French papers fluently. Neither of the prisoners were on board. I had several interpreters on board the vessel. She was ship-rigged, which is unusual for a ship of one hundred and fifty tons. She was only laying to; she might have made more away if she pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say before the Magistrate that the vessel was unmanageable - A. That was two hours after I took possession of her; it was in consequence of their being very little wind. A cargo of bullocks would be very inconvenient on board this vessel.</p>
               <p>Q. If she met with bad weather she would be more likely to throw them overboard - A. My opinion is, that it would be better to let them remain as ballast, for she must have taken her hatches off to throw them overboard. The captain said there were seventy bullocks - they would not roll about much. The vessel was not at all adapted for cattle. It could not have been driven up there by the the wind, there was a trade-wind blowing there; she would have been driven to the Cape of Good Hope. We have hurricanes, but they had passed before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common for a ship to lose her reckoning after a hurricane - A. Certainly. I saw no slaves on board. I do not know that the irons were rusty - they might corrode in half an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. In that district there is a commandant and police - A. I do not know it. There are officers all round the Mauritius, for the purpose of preventing the traffic. The vessel was very near the reef. I gave information to the Governor. No slave was found to my knowledge. It was moderate weather on the 2d and 3d of June - I was always able to go out in the boat. I do not think the vessel could carry bullocks; I will not say it could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the bullocks at Madagascar are all of the buffalo kind - A. I have seen a cargo of three hundred landed, and they were all of the buffalo kind, and imported from Madagascar.</p>
               <p>Q. The vessel did not appear to have contained bullocks - A. No, she had no stalls nor ring-bolts to fasten the bullocks to. It is usual to make cattle fast when they go to sea.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Have you any recollection of there having been a hurricane - A. We experienced a hurricane before, but at that time this ship was in harbour - this was before April; she had not sailed from Port Louis then. The hurricane months are about the equinox. The vessel had not the slightest appearance of having suffered from a hurricane.</p>

             (through an interpreter). I was servant to Mons. Carrol, in the Mauritius, and embarked from there with him to go to Bourbon - I had been his servant about a month before that. We landed at Bourbon, and remained there two months; we were three days on our passage. We then went to Tamatave, in Madagascar, and were six days in our passage; we went ashore, and Mons. Carrol went up the country - I remained at Tamatave; he was absent two months, and then returned to Tamatave with about fifty blacks; they remained at Tamatave two days, and were then embarked on board Le Jeune Adolphe. About one hundred and fifty more were brought down, and were all embarked together. Mons. Carrol came on board next day, and we immediately set sail for the Mauritius. When we got about two leagues from land, at the Mauritius, the boats of Mons. Villemont came out to us in the night; he was in one of them, and came on board the vessel. The blacks were all put into two pinnaces; the prisoners and I went with them - I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120033"/>in the same pinnace with Carrol. We landed at Mapoor, in the Mauritius - Villemont landed the blacks; they were first taken to his house, which is about a quarter of a league from where we landed - I went there afterwards, and saw them there; they remained there about a quarter of an hour, Carrol was there. Villemont took the blacks away afterwards. I remained at Villemont's - Carrol was ill at the time. He was taken up very soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards go to Port Louis - A. Yes; I was interrogated there. Villemont was there; I pointed him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you a freeman or a slave - A. A freeman. I was six months in his service. I was not in prison before I went into his service. I was never in prison, except after this inquiry began. I did not know Villemont before.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men were there on board Le Jeune Adolphe - A. Ten sailors. There were eight white men in all; three were common sailors. The first time I was interrogated, I said Carrol had been to Tamatave to traffic in blacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did they put you in prison there - A. Because the Judge knew I was Carrol's servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Carrol been ill at Madagascar - A. Yes. A sea voyage was advised for the recovery of his health. We were about half an hour landing the negroes. The pinnaces took the whole two hundred at one trip. As soon as the pinnaces came near the ship they began to count the blacks. I put Carrol's trunk in the pinnace.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not your own father put you in prison - A. No. The Judge sent two officers with me. They seized Villemont's pinnace; I shewed them his house. Villemont was at Port Louis, I saw him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Villemont except on that night, and when you saw him at Port Louis - A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. You saw Villemont on board the vessel - A. Yes, and afterwards saw him in the cabin; I also saw him at his own house. I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In what way were the fifty slaves brought to Tamatave - A. Carrol and a free man brought them, they were chained. The hundred and fifty were also brought chained, and kept chained till they were put on board, they were free on board. The hold was secured at night by an iron bar; the men were armed. The men were in the hold, and the women in the cabin; they were allowed to come on deck in the daytime, twelve at a time. There were more children than grown persons; they landed in good health. We had been a month at sea.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, CARROL, put in a very long written defence, giving an account of different voyages in which he had been engaged, and stating that Clandomir had been convicted of robbing the trunk of a passenger in a vessel in 1818, and in order to avoid punishment he told the captain M. Villemont's clerk (Mr. Pilot), had called him a rascal and a rogue, and on the captain saying that he should take him into the presence of Mr. Pilot, that Clandomir came and told Mr. Pilot that the captain was coming to quarrel with them; he then ran away; he was afterwards arrested, and begged forgiveness; that he afterwards took Clandomir into his service at the request of his father. (The only part relating to this charge is as follows:) - At the end of March I re-embarked on board Le Jenne Adolphe, from Bourbon for Tamatave. I fell ill of the Madagascar fever after my arrival, and embarked again on board the same vessel, bound for Bourbon, and laden with bullocks. We had dreadful weather, which caused the loss of our cargo, and were driven in sight of the Mauritius. I was sent to Port Louis for advice, being exceedingly ill. The day after my arrival I was taken before the Commissary General, and was sent to the hospital. Clandomir had the impudence, during our passage to England, to come to me in the night, ask a thousand pardons, and to make excuses for the false depositions he had made, assuring me he would make one quite contrary in London. It is impossible to land two hundred blacks, without being seen by the police, who are exceedingly vigilant. Search was made, but none were found, because none existed.</p>
               <p>VILLEMONT'S Defence (written). At the time stated I was at a considerable distance from my residence. On the 2d of July I dined, supped, and slept at the house of Mons. Le Grand - I left his house next morning, and proceeded towards home, having promised them my pinnace to go to Round Island; my pinnace was not in a fit state, and I borrowed one from them. On the morning of the 7th I went to Port Louis, and next day received a letter from my wife, informing me that eight persons, guided by a Mulatto, had been at my house and had seized my pinnace, and that which I had borrowed. I returned, and went to the police to be informed of the reason; I was then arrested. I appeal to any one whether it was likely that two hundred negroes could have been landed, without any trace being left, in an island so strictly guarded as the Mauritius. I solemnly protest my innocence. I could have escaped when I heard the charge, but I preferred surrendering myself into the hands of justice.</p>

I laid hold of the tail of his coat; he stooped to get under a coach. I kept hold of him, and we both fell together; Salmon and others came to my assistance.

I saw Wright take a handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, who did not perceive it. He gave it to Oulds, who put it into his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far off was you - A. About twenty yards, on the opposite side of the way. I delivered my things in Fetter-lane, and went after them in less than three minutes. The gentleman turned down a street directly, so that I could not tell him. I went after the prisoners, passed them both, and saw them offering a handkerchief for sale up a court in Leather-lane, about five minutes after; it was of a dark colour, and so was this. Wright was standing at the the top of the gateway, while Oulds was holding it to a man in his hat, part in and part out - they were up a turning under a gateway. I said nothing, but ran to Hatton-garden Office, it being near. I met Cadby, who returned with me - they were then gone. We went to Saffron-hill, saw Oulds come down the hill, and go into a cook-shop. I said he was one, and Cadby went in, and took the handkerchief out of his hat - he then said as we had taken him, he would tell us where the other was, and took us to a house at the corner of Caroline-court, where we found Wright in the taproom - I do not know who the gentleman was.</p>

            . I went with Coulton to Leather-lane, but the prisoners were gone; we saw Oulds turn into an eating-house on Saffron-hill, and found a handkerchief in his hat, with two others; he took us to a public-house, where we found Wright. I cannot find the gentleman.</p>
               <p>OULDS'S Defence. Coulton says the gentleman went down a street - at Guildhall he said he went down a court. He said it was the first turning he went down, but it was the second.</p>
               <p>WRIGHT'S Defence. I met Oulds in Nevill's-court, Fetter-lane. A young man gave him a handkerchief. He went up a court, and shewed it to a man.</p>

            , who is a bookseller, and lives in St. Paul's Church-yard. On the 8th of November Smith came to our shop. and enquired the price of Hume and Smollett's History of England? for Captain Cater. I told him 5 l. 17 s. and asked him if I should write it on a piece of paper? He said Yes, and so I did - Captain Cater is well known at our house as a customer. On the 8th of January he came again and delivered me a letter; he wished to take the books with him. I said we had not got them bound, but had them in boards, which I would send by him, but as Captain Cater wished to have them bound, I thought it better to let him know before I sent them in boards. I then wrote a note to Captain Cater, and delivered it to Smith, who said he had been in his employ for three weeks, and he was not sure but that he should be taken as a regular servant. He left with the note, and when Mr. Hunter came home I shewed him the letter that I had received. I never saw Lloyd.</p>
               <p>Letter read,</p>
               <p>Captain Cater's compliments to Mr. Huater, will feel himself obliged if he will send by bearer, Hume and Smollett's History of England, bound, as I want it for a particular friend, to send into the country on Monday morning.</p>

The moment I saw it I was satisfied that it was neither his writing or style. On Monday, the 10th, Lloyd came to my shop, and said he came from Captain Cater to see the books. I asked him what books? He said Hume and Smollett's History of England, and I shewed them to him in boards. He asked the price? I told him 5 l. 4 s.; he said Mrs. Cater had received a note, stating the price at 5 l. 17 s. I asked him from what house she received it? He said,</p>

               <p>"This house, some time back." I examined the catalogue, and found that the preceeding edition had been published at 9 s. a volume, and this at 8 s. He said Captain Cater was his uncle, and that he would let me know farther about it. In the evening Smith came and said he was come for the books for Captain Cater. I asked him what books? He said Hume and Smollett's History of England. I asked him if he had brought a note from the Captain? - it was usual for him to send one for what books he wanted; he said he had not, but that a gentleman had called about them - nobody but Lloyd had called. I then delivered him the books with a bill of parcels, by his desire, and he took them away. I had provided a constable outside to apprehend him.</p>

On the 27th of October, after my husband was gone out, he got up, and went down stairs with his shoes off. I saw him take my husband's hat after he had put his own on, and asked him what he took it for? He made no answer, but ran off with that and the stockings under his arm - I missed the other things. He was apprehended about five weeks after.</p>

I was taking him to the watch-house, and when we got to Wild-street he said,</p>
               <p>"Let the old fool go to hell, he has got his watch. I will give you something handsome to let me go, as it will be a serious job to me - I want to fly and be off." He put 6 s. 6 d. into my hand, but I kept hold of him and the money, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

On the 14th of December, about five o'clock in the evening, the prisoners came and bought three small quantities of muslim, which came to 11 1/2 d. While they were looking at them I saw Hayes drawing a piece of print under her shawl - she dropped it on the floor, then sat on a chair, picked it up, and put it under her whittle. After they went out of the first door of the shop, I said I wanted to speak to them, she then dropped it from under her whittle. I sent for an officer, and detained them. They came in together. Hayes bought one of the articles which Palmer paid for. They bought each article separately, had them wrapped up, and paid for them separately.</p>

I saw him - he hired it. My man was unwilling to let it at that price, and applied to me; I agreed to let it for that. I have not seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go away with it - A. He went away with it, but not on it. My man lead it away. He said he was going to Stanmore, and mentioned the Abercorn Arms. He did not return with it. I went there next day, but could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. I saw him at Reading on the 24th of July. I had some hesitation at first in charging him with it. He said his name was Hanley, that he was not in the habit of hiring horses, and that I must be deceived in supposing him to be the man. I have not the slightest hesitation of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to lay hold of him, as you were convinced he was the person - I enquired of the landlord of the house, who said he was a commercial traveller, and he thought I must be deceived. I still believed him to be the man, and got from him the address of the house in town which he said he travelled for - I have it here - (reads) -</p>
               <p>"Mr. Hanley, at Messrs. Potts, Bora." I saw him write it. In consequence of this, and the landlord's assertion, I pursued him no farther. I went to the house of Messrs. Potts, vinegar-merchants, in the Borough, and could not find him there. It was the only house of that name I could find. He had stated that it was a vinegar house, and every body knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again - A. I met him in Quebec-street, Marylebone, within the last fortnight. I told him I considered him to be a person indebted to me, and that he had given me a false address when I saw him at Reading - he denied ever having been at Reading. I insisted on having his name and address; he said his name was

            , and that he lived at Bloomfield Cottage, Regent's Canal. I walked with him to my house, and questioned my lad, Patrick - he, at the moment, said he was in doubt. He said he had so little view of him that he could not say whether he was or was not the man. I sent my man with him to Bloomfield Cottage, and followed myself. I found he lived at a cottage, at the back of the Junction Canal. I wished for a reference - he took me to Mrs. Botelas, No. 37, King-street, Edgeware-road. I was not satisfied, and gave him in charge. The person who hired the mare gave me the name of Vincent, No. 42, Upper Berkley-street. I went there the following morning, but could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with him at Reading - A. I saw him three times in the course of the morning, and was about five minutes with him. On my oath, I have not the least doubt of his being the person I saw at Reading.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you, in your walks about town, seen a person very like the prisoner - A. I cannot say I have. A man living where the prisoner does would be often in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You never met the prisoner, nor any one like him, except at Reading - A. No. I once saw a man in Oxford-street, whom I supposed to be the man. I looked at him, but then doubted, so I did not like to take him. This was after the affair at Reading. When I met the prisoner he gave me his direction, which I found to be right.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 24th of July you saw a man at Reading, who gave you the address, why not apprehend him - A. It was in consequence of what the landlord said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not his giving of a different address excite your suspicion, if you had no doubt of his being the person - A. I had such an account of him as led me astray. I was not sure of him at Reading.</p>
               <p>Q. Why are you sure now - A. Because circumstances have transpired since his giving the false address. I did not know him absolutely to be the person at Reading, but I have had proof of it now from further intercourse with him. When be hired the mare he had top-boots and spurs on. I do not think he wore powder. He was dressed nearly the same at Reading. It was at the sign of the George.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Richards. On the 4th of June a person came to me, and asked if my master had got a horse to hire? I called the hostler. I did not see him again. The prisoner is the man, I am positive. I was not present when the horse was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him again - A. Not until he was taken up, I then saw him accidentally in the yard. I was not desired to look at him - I was sure he was the man; I did not say so. No conversation passed between us then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You had a momentary view of the man in June, and swear he is the person - A. I did not hear the other hostler say he was not sure of it. He had a pair of very shabby top-boots and spurs on. I do not know whether he had powder or not.</p>

            . I am the head hostler. I was called out to the man - he said he wanted a chesnut mare. To the best of my recollection the prisoner is the man, but I cannot speak with certainty. On his going off with the mare I asked him when he thought of returning? he said about eight or nine o'clock in the evening, and that he was going to Stanmore. On the 4th of January I saw him and Mr. Richards standing in the yard, and was asked if he was the person? I said I could not say with certainty whether he was or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen a man like the prisoner between these times - A. I saw a man in Oxford-street, whom I believe to be the prisoner, and followed him about half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120038"/>mile. I thought he was the person, but did not like to act on my own opinion. I think this was in August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw the man to whom he applied - A. Yes, he called me to him. I went with the man who hired the horse to the farrier's, and was there while the shoe was adjusting. I should think I was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour with him. He had a bright mixture coat, kerseymere breeches, and shabby top-boots and spurs. He had no wig nor powder I am sure - he had his own black hair and rather full whiskers.</p>
               <p>Q. You accompanied the prisoner to his own house - A. Yes; Mr. Richards followed. The prisoner took me to his house himself, and said if we were not satisfied he would take us to a lady with whom he had lodged, and took us to Mrs. Botelas's; he also took us to Mr. Mitchell, his landlord, next door. He went with us voluntarily to Mrs. Botelas - it was his own proposal.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Angel Inn, at Reading: I am positive I have seen the prisoner twice at Reading. He once put up at the Angel, and I saw him in the yard when he did not put up there. On the 24th of July I saw Richards at Reading - that was the day I met the prisoner in the yard. He asked me how I did, and how master and mistress were? We were talking together about five minutes. He slept at our house on Sunday, the 14th of March, preceding; he came about nine o'clock in the evening, and left between two and three next afternoon. He came on a black mare; I sold the mare for him for 10 l., I also sold the saddle and bridle.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had a good view of him - A. Yes. I cannot possibly be mistaken; I am positively sure he is the man. I saw him again at Marlborough-street, and was sure of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You was examined before the Mayor of Reading. Was the time you sold the horse for him the first time you ever saw him - A. I believe I had seen him once before, about a year ago. I sold the mare to one Shelley. Mr. Jenkins claimed it before the Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Mayor that you sold Shelley a black horse two years before - A. Yes; I said I had seen the prisoner twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you had seen him frequently - A. I do not believe I did. When I saw him in March he did not wear powder - he had a brown coat, top-boots, and, I believe, light-coloured kerseymere breeches. He had his own black hair. He was dressed much the same in July.</p>

             re-examined. I saw him at Reading about nine o'clock in the morning, it was on a Saturday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Till now, I have through life maintained an irreproachable character. I was five years in the house of a respectable merchant, who procured me a situation in the Bank, where I was five years more, when my father remitted me a sum of money to go into business; I then left my situation, and joined a gentleman in partnership. About two years proved it did not answer, and by mutual consent it was dissolved. I then lived a retired life on my property, and took lodgings in King-street - I remained there from November, 1818. till August, 1819, and then took a small cottage by the Grand Junction Canal. I was going home when the prosecutor accosted me, saying he had seen me at Reading; I declared I was never there in my life - he was not satisfied. I walked up Oxford-street, he followed, and asked me to walk to his stables, which I did. I gave him my name and address; he wished one of his men to accompany me, to see if it was right, I made no objection, and the man found my statement quite correct. I informed him my landlord lived next door, he went, and appeared satisfied. My dinner was then ready, but I thought it necessary to leave no suspicion, and referred him to King-street. He left. I thought it would be more satisfactory for me to accompany him, and I did so. On our way, we met Richards and the constable, and all went to Mrs. Botelas's - she informed them that I had never slept out of her house while I lodged there. Richards still insisted that he had seen me at Reading, in July, 1819, and gave me in charge. When first I came to town I had my head shaved by the advice of a friend, as my own hair was, in fact, wool. I then wore a powdered wig, and continued to do so till within two months, I have always kept my head shaved, and have only within the last two months gone without my wig. I solemnly protest my innocence. I was never on horsback since I left my native country. It will, doubtless, appear strange, that so many witnesses should identify me. I call my Eternal Judge to witness that I am innocent.</p>

            . I live at No. 37, King-street, West, Bryanstone-square. My husband is a courier under Government; the prisoner and his wife lodged in my house; they came on the 2d of November, 1818, and continued till the 7th of August, 1819.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time did he ever sleep out of your house - A. I am confident he did not, nor was he ever absent long enough to go a journey of eighty miles - he could not have gone to Reading. He was a man of exceedingly regular habits, and lived extremely moderate. I never heard him talk of horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible he could have been at Reading on the 14th of March or the 24th of July - A. I am confident he was not, for I had a daughter unwell at the time, and he came into the room every morning to enquire after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing occur on the 4th of June - A. I have brought to mind that he came that morning to my daughter, she had been talking about going to see the guns fired. I asked him if he was going? he said No, he must go to get Billing, in Clipstone-street, Fitzroy-square, to present a bill that was due.

            . I lodged in the same house with the prisoner, at Mrs. Botelas's, from November, 1818, until August, 1819, and was intimate with him - I used to spend almost every evening with him. I slept out on the 29th or 30th of May. I can positively say that he was never out twelve hours together - I cannot speak to these two nights. He was very frugal. We frequently went to the Gloucester coffee-house of an evening. He generally had nothing but a pint of porter. He has worn a powdered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120039"/>wig ever since I have known him, except within the last two months. His head was bald.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was his wig black - A. No, my Lord, it was brown; it was always powdered till within the last two months.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever know him on horseback - A. Never. He has told me he was never on horseback but once, and that was in Jamaica. I never knew him have top-boots of spurs. There is an old pair of top-boots at the cottage, which he used when digging in his garden; he told me had had them nine years.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you lately had occasion to know a person very much resembling the prisoner - A. Providing the prisoner wore black hair and long whiskers, I never saw so great a resemblance - any person might mistake one for the other. He was sent out of the country in the last China fleet, by my advice - he is an East Indian; I saw him several times last summer. I returned from Paris the latter end of August, and have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see the prisoner - A. Hearing he was a man of colour, I went to the prison yesterday - the features are remarkably strong. People of colour resemble each other a good deal.</p>

            , ESQ. I live in Portland-place. I first knew the prisoner in 1815. I believe him to be a respectable honest man. He was introduced at our banking-house, and I believe he has a small balance in our hands now.</p>
               <p>MR. WEBB. I am a surgeon, and have been intimate with the prisoner seven years. I never saw him without powder and a wig. I know his hand-writing (looks at the direction given at Reading) - it is not a bit like it. He was well educated, and would not spell Borough, Bora.</p>
               <p>- JEGGINS. I am clerk to Rutherford and Co. I remember the prisoner's hand-writing, and am sure the direction is not his writing. When I first knew him he wore his own black wool. I suggested his shaving his head - he wore a wig after that, continually.</p>

            . On the 29th of December I saw the prisoner with another lad coming out of my house in Dorset-street - the prisoner's mother lives in my house. About three weeks before that, I lost a pair of sheets from the passage, since which I always watched him, and on the 29th of December, about eight o'clock, I heard him come. I ran up, and saw him and another boy with each a bundle - they ran out in great haste without shutting the door. I ran up the area steps, followed them, and when they got about fifty yards two girls ran from the other side of the street, and took the bundles from them; they then went on as fast as they could, and the girls crossed over. I overtook the girls, and took the bundles from them, as I suspected he had been robbing his mother who was not a home. I asked the girls what they had got there? They said it was nothing to me, and I had no business with it. The prisoner then came across, and said I had no business with them, for they were his and not mine, and he would go back and shew me that they were his; he said he would follow me home. I took them back, and found that it was wet linen, very much frozen, and with the pins sticking in them - they were torn off the line. Next morning the prosecutrix claimed them. The prisoner said he tied them up in two bundles because one would not hold them all.</p>

            . I am a horse-dealer, and live at Burnwell, near Cambridge. On the 2d of September I was in London, and went to Smithfield the night before the fair, with a Mr. Warberton and Captain O'Conner; we we went into a public-house at the corner of Cow-lane between three and four o'clock on the morning of the 3d of September - O'Connor is gone to France. When we went into the house Dillon was standing up before the counter in the taproom; I saw Eagleton sitting in the same room behind her. I had 203 l. 1 s. in notes in a canvass purse in my left hand breeches-pocket. We staid in the house about ten or fifteen minutes, and all three came out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to your going out had Dillon and you any conversation - A. She asked me for something to drink; I observed by her brogue that she was Irish, and referred her to Captain O'Connor, as her countryman - he has but one arm. He treated her - I was perfectly sober. We all three came out together, left Dillon in the house, and had got about thirty yards down Cow-lane, towards Fleet-market - I was outside of the three, about thirty yards from the door. Dillon came up, put her hand on me, and asked me to go with her? in the manner a woman of the town would.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been walking that thirty yards - As fast as we could, we did not stop; I refused to go, but she windled about me, and I stepped into a court on the right hand side of the lane. I talked to her; she returned with me, and walked down Cow-lane to Holborn Bridge with me. I there met a person whom I knew, and as soon as I stopped to speak to him she left, without<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120043"/>speaking, and I saw no more of her. Before I got to the White Horse, public-house, Fetter-lane, I discovered that all my notes and bag were gone. I did not see her afterwards until she was in the watch-house on the 15th or 16th of the same month; the notes were traced to Messrs. Jones and Loyd's. 200 l. was of Sir

            . I was examined in October on Dillon's trial - I lived at No. 4, Pitt's-place, with her. On the night of the 2d of September I was at the top of Cow-lane with her in a public-house; one door opens into Cow-lane, and the other into Smithfield. We were there a good bit before Mr. Browning came in with Mr. Warberton and a gentleman with one arm. They did not stay many minutes before Dillon asked Browning for something to drink; he refused, and referred her to her countryman, the gentleman with one arm. Browning and his two friends left the house, she went out directly after them, and I followed her directly - she was talking to them; then Mr. Browning and she went down the first turning - she told me to stop there until they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the defendant there - A. No; I never saw him till I saw him at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he had not joined her company at that time - A. He had not. I was with her in her house all day, and remained with her until nine o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time she came out of the turning, down to nine o'clock in the morning, was that man ever near you, or in sight - A. Never, that I am quite sure of. I did not leave her a single moment till nine o'clock in the morning. When Mr. Browning and she came out of the court they went on to the bottom, towards Fleet-market together. A gentleman began to talk to him, and she came back to me, shewed me the purse, said she had picked his pocket of a bag, and told me to run, for we should both be hung if we were caught - the bag had a string to it. We ran through a number of courts and places till past six o'clock, then went into Frith's, and got something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was in the bag - A. She threw the bag away in Shoe-lane, and kept the notes; it was a large roll of notes. She paid Mr. Frith 9 s. or 10 s. which she owed him, with a Cambridge 1 l. note. She shewed me a Newmarket guinea note. I went to another public-house with her, and never quitted her a moment till nine o'clock. The prisoner was never in her company.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do you know a man named Duggan - A. I have seen him drinking with her.</p>

            . I keep a wine-vaults at the corner of Middle-row, Holborn. On the morning of the 3d of September, about seven o'clock, Eagleton and Dillon came in - Dillon paid me 11 s. or 12 s. with a Cambridge 1 l. note, Mortlock and Sons' bank. They had a little gin and milk to drink, and went out. I observed a similar note in her hand, and a roll of notes closely folded up; they appeared to be country notes from their texture. The defendant was not with her - there was a shorter stouter man with them; it was a very different man altogether from him.</p>

             re-examined. That man joined us about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant - he stated that he could not ask a verdict of acquittal at their hands, but the best thing he could do would be to apply to the mercy of the Court, as he was informed the defendant had been made the dupe of a man named Duggan, whom Eagleton had said, on her cross-examination, she had seen with Dillon. He would deliver in a statement, written by the defendant himself, and leave him to the mercy of the Court - (read).</p>
               <p>"My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I beg leave to state that my father has carried on an extensive business in the town of Derby, for upwards of forty years, as malt-ster, miller, and grocer, and in his service I continued till he unfortunately became a bankrupt, by becoming security for a friend, and I was consequently obliged to leave Derby in pursuit of a situation. I came up to London, took lodgings at Mr. Corderoy's, in the Strand, and was there for months, until the little money I had was spent, and I was in debt upwards of 5 l. for my lodgings. My landlord became very importunate for his rent, and told me I must either pay or leave, and detained my clothes for his demand. I had now been in London nine months, without being able to get a situation, having been necessitated to pledge my watch, to draw on my existence at one meal per day, and was in great distress. One morning, as I was taking breakfast at a coffee-shop, I became acquainted with one Alder, and making known my situation to him, he offered me a lodging at his house; but humble indeed, as it was, a bed of straw, even this was preferable to the treatment of my own lodging, and which I thankfully accepted. I had been here but a short time before I became a dupe to my landlord and his friends, two of which, viz. Connell and Connor, came to his house in Castle-court, Strand. One day in September he stated that a woman, a tenant of Duggans's, was accused of a robbery of which she was innocent, and that he was afraid she would be found guilty, owing to a gentleman (Mr.

Connel said if Petlay had been in town he could have proved an alibi very clearly, and that it would be a very grievous thing for the woman to be convicted innocently. In farther conversation, they said this Mr.

Soon after, they invited myself, and Alder my landlord, to drink with them at their friend's house (Mr. Roach) who keeps the Black Horse, public-house, in Wild-street. We met them several times; the conversation always turned on this woman - they said she was innocent, and that there would not be the least harm in any one personating the said Mr. Petlay, which would be the only means of saving her from being transported. They all agreed that I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120044"/>the only person to do it, as I was so very like Mr. Petlay, and that they, Duggan and Connell, were to come forward, and substantiate what I had stated, but they took care not to appear. All the parties were entire strangers to me before the present transaction. Being totally unacquainted with the nature of Courts of Law, and its being a crime of such magnitude, and from what they said, believing the woman to be innocent, I agreed to personate Mr.

I saw Brett take a handkerchief half out of the gentleman's pocket; the gentleman turned round, and they fell back, then followed him as far as Somerset House. I there saw Brett forward, and the other two covering him, and saw him take the handkerchief out, and give it to Woodcock; I was on the opposite side - the gentleman did not perceive it - all three separated. I went and told the gentleman, and he missed his handkerchief; Thompson shewed it to him, and he claimed it. He said he was a solicitor in the country and could not attend - he would not give us his name or direction.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Read, and saw the prisoners and another following the gentleman; I sent Read forward and kept back myself, supposing they would know me. Before they got to Somerset House I saw Brett close on the gentleman, and the other two covering him - I could not see what he did. Immediately after that Woodcock ran towards me in the middle of the road, fell down and dropped it; the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120045"/>came back and claimed it, but would not give his name - they appeared clumsy at the business.</p>

            , Cranford. I returned and told Hicks what had passed; he said nothing then, and we went home; he went into my house, had some refreshment, and then went home.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a relation of your's - A. Yes, I married his sister. He is a labourer, and so is the prisoner, James, who is his father.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You must have known he could not be honestly possessed of the beast - A. I did not know it. On the Tuesday morning I was gathering mushrooms, and met Richard and William just by the turnpike at Smallborough-green. William asked me where I was going? (he is not in custody). I said I was going to get some champignons. William asked me to go back with them, said he had got a letter, and that every thing was right. I said if he had got the letter he could do very well without me, but he said,</p>
               <p>"You may as well return and go back with me," and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he do without you - A. As he had the letter. I went with him to Vorley's office, and Richard waited outside. I and William went in; William gave me the letter, and I gave it to the clerk, who said he could not pay me on that letter unless I brought some person forward who knew me. I said I did not know who I could bring. He said if I would go out perhaps Mr. Vorley would soon be in; we came out, and all three crossed the market together, and met Mr. Vorley. I told him I had brought a note, and that William had come with me to say all was right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did William and Richard speak to Mr. Vorley - A. William did, but I do not know what he said - we returned to the office. William and I went in, and Richard staid without. Vorley looked at the letter, spoke to the clerk, and after some little time told him to pay me the money. He gave me a 20 l., a 5 l., and a 1 l. note, and 8 s. in silver; we came out, and Richard joined us at the door; we went to the Bank, and they waited outside while I went in and changed the 20 l. note; I could not write, and got a gentleman to write</p>

               <p>"What will satisfy you for your trouble?" I said,</p>
               <p>"What you please" - Richard, who was close by, heard it; William said,</p>
               <p>"Will 5 l. satisfy you?" and I said Yes. He told me to take 5 l. from the money, and return them the rest - I had the money up to that time. I kept five of the 1 l. notes, and returned them sixteen 1 l. and a 5 l. note. Richard said,</p>
               <p>"William have you got right?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, 21 l." We spent 4 s. 6 d. out of the 8 s., and I kept the other 3 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. After this did they say any thing respecting the money - A. William said the 21 l. was to be divided into three parts - James was not present then; he did not say between whom it was to be divided. Then Richard told me how it had been done; he said he called William up, and they both went to Mr. Mohon's field, and that their father stood in the road; that they were bringing two heifers, out but the third would follow, and then they all three drove the three heifers till they got to the powder mills at Hounslow, then William and James went back, and Richard brought them forward - he said they only meant to take two, but the third would follow.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How long before Richard called you up had you seen him - A. I met him on Hounslow Heath the Friday before; I live nine miles from him - I made no plan to steal them; they never mentioned it to me.</p>

He went down, I did not hear the persons speak to him; there was something like dirt flung at the window, he got up and went out, and returned about five or six o'clock in the evening. I cannot say who called him up. He went out next day, about six o'clock in the morning, and took his basket to get champignons. He generally went down the Hounslow road for them.

Wragg asked him what profession he was? he gave his name as Taylor, of Cranford, and said he was a labourer.</p>
               <p>"T. Taylor, Cranford," was written on it, and Wragg wrote</p>
               <p>"labourer." I paid him twenty 1 l. notes for it.

            . I apprehended Richard at Staines, on the 17th of December, standing at his own door, near the market-place. I told him there was a 1 l. note paid into the Bank, which had come through his hands to his father, and it was forged. I shewed him a note, but not that I was speaking of. He said he had not seen his father for four or five weeks; that he had given his father a note, but that he received it from the Bank of England, in change for a 5 l. or a 10 l. note, he did not know which. I said if he had so received it, he had better meet me with his father and explain it. I went with him to his father. In going along he said he had some more notes in his pocket, which he had received at the same time. I asked him to shew them to me, to see if the numbers corresponded. I then saw he had six 1 l. notes. Just as we got into Staines, I asked him about the note he got change for, he said it was a 5 l.; that he had been to London as guard to Creswell's waggon on the Monday, returned on Tuesday night, and changed a 5 l. note for Mr. Creswell; that he received 1 l. out of it, which 1 l. he gave to his father. I told him it must have been more than a 5 l. note, for I saw six in his hand. He immediately put his hand into his pocket and said,</p>
               <p>"No, you are mistaken, there are but four" - he shewed me four. I said,</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I am mistaken." I got him into a house, searched him, and took four from him, which I produce. Here are Nos. 76235, October 28; 25462, October 27; 52943 and 52944, November 4, 1819. I did not then find that he had two others.</p>
               <p>Q. After that what happened - A. I left him custody, and in the course of the evening he denied having any more notes about him; I again searched him, and found a 1 l. note loose in his side coat pocket, at the bottom, as a piece of waste paper - it was No. 12284, October 23, 1819. Next morning I saw him, and asked if he was in the same mind? he said, No, he would tell the whole truth. I neither threatened nor promised him. He then said he was coming to London on a Tuesday, to the Board of St. George's, Hanover-square, to receive an allowance which he had from that parish; that he met his brother William, and told him he had no money; that his brother said,</p>
               <p>"I am going into the City to receive some money, and if you will wait till I return I will give you some." That he waited about Hyde Park Corner till his brother returned, and he gave him ten new 1 l. notes. I told him he must have known how they were got, for he knew his brother was receiving alms from the parish. He said he did not know, nor did he ask him. I then asked who was with him? he said nobody was with him for sometime. I said it was of no use to tell me so, for I knew there was another with him. He then said there was; that

He told me to take them to Clements, and he would take them to Smithfield and sell them. I took them to him, and called him up in the morning; he overtook me on the road, and took them into the market. When we came back he told me to tell my brother to come up next day, which I did. He called me up next morning - I had to go to my parish again, and went to town with him, but he never mentioned where he got the cattle from. As we came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120048"/>back he gave me these ten notes. I owed my father some money, which I had of him in the summer, and gave him one of the notes.

            . I am street-keeper of Whitechapel. On the 28th of December, about half-past nine o'clock, I was going down Rosemary-lane, heard a noise at a public-house, and went to see what was the matter; the landlord was disputing with the prisoner about some liquor, because he could not give him change for a 1 l. note - I said I could give him change, which I did, and asked him his name? he said Brown, No. 74, Lambeth-street, next door to the White Bear. I went to the White Bear with him to have a pint of porter - I enquired of the landlord if he knew him? he said he lived next door, and that his name was M'Carthy. I then suspected the note was forged, and took him to the watch-house. While I was there a man came and told me to detain him for robbing the prosecutrix - she came to identify the note.</p>

He had a bed to himself, On the 6th of December I missed a blanket and sheet off his bed; I asked him about them, he said they were there when he came down. Next morning I missed the books; I then took him to Mr. Lees, where I found the books; Lees said he bought them of him, The prisoner then said he pledged the blanket and sheet at Nicholls's, and said I should find the duplicate in his bedroom drawer, which I did.</p>

On the 11th of January, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I was in the parlour behind the shop, and heard a rattling at the window, went out, and observed three persons at the window - one of them had his hands through, removing the things - the glass had been broken an evening or two before - the other two enclosed him to prevent his being seen. I went to the door, the bell rang, and at that instant they all ran away. I pursued them closely, one escaped, but the other two were taken without my losing sight of them; they were the prisoners. Nothing was found on them. On my return I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which were safe just before.</p>

He got intoxicated when he was going out with the beer, and I told him to take the lanthorn, and I would carry the beer, but he said he could carry it. When I came to Mrs. Smith's they put the money into my hand, upon which I was surprised, thinking she owed me above 3 l. The prisoner put the lanthorn down, and started off immediately.

            . I live at Hammersmith; my uncle lodges at Varley's. On the 24th of December I was standing on the second floor stair-case, saw the prisoner come up stairs, and ask for the clergyman who lived on the second floor? he was told he was not at home, and he said he would call again in about a quarter of an hour; Mrs. Varley suspected him, and I watched him from the opposite room. In about twenty minutes he came up stairs gently, and went into Varley's bedroom without knocking at the clergyman's door; he took a pair of shoes, and was disturbed by Miss Varley coming up stairs. As he was coming out of the room, I saw him putting the shoes into his pocket, stopped him immediately, and found one on him - he threw the other under the bed.</p>

Owing to the improvements going on there, he had moved into another house; we were in the habit of resorting there for water. On the 19th of December, about half-past seven o'clock, I went there and observed nothing; I went again about ten o'clock, and observed half the skylight broken away. I got outside the cistern to see what had been done, and found the leaden pipe, which led from the cistern to the water-closet, torn away, and the gutter adjoining also taken away. I found the pipe in the gutter and other sheet lead which covered the framing of the skylight on a shed adjoining the house. I went and informed my father, and we returned with Hurst; I shewed them the lead, and remained there while they went up stairs; in a moment or two they called me, I ran up, and found the prisoner in their custody - the lead appeared to be fresh cut.</p>

On Sunday, the 19th of December, my son fetched me and Hurst to the house, where we found the lead as he has stated - it was quite fresh cut; I had seen it safe the Wednesday before. I went up stairs into the first room where the butler's pantry was, and pushed the door; it was twice pushed against me, but I made a third attempt, pushed it open, and found the prisoner there with a chisel in his hand.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the 21st of December, about four o'clock, I went down stairs to fetch candles, brought them up, and put them on the table to work. I missed an apron, went into the waxing room, and saw Hepworth standing up about a foot from the table - there was nothing on the table then; about an hour before there were six calf butts laying before him - he had a large bulk under his apron. I asked him if my apron was there? He said No, and as I drew nearer, he kept shuffling round to keep his front from me. I returned to my work, was not satisfied, went back to the waxing room again, and saw his apron turned aside - his waistcoat was unbuttoned, and he was buttoning up his breeches - he went out. I recollected the calf butts that I had put there to see if any one would take them, and immediately communicated it to my master - Hepworth was apprehended next morning.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of December, in consequence of information, I went to Sinclair's to search for stolen leather - he is a shoemaker, and lives in Whitecross-street. I said I had a warrant to search his house, and he asked me what for? I said for stolen leather, and asked him if he had bought any the day before of a man? - he said he had. I asked him to produce it? He was cutting up some, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the skin I bought last night about six o'clock;" he said he had a knowledge of the man although he did not know his name, but that he should know it if he heard it. I mentioned no name, for I did not know it. He said the man lived in Leonard-square or Paul-street, about two years ago. Mr. Roberts, Jun. was with me, and claimed the leather. I asked him what he gave for the skin? - he said 14 s. Mr. Roberts looked for some private marks which he said were on it, but he could not find them. Sinclair said he believed there was a mark on it, but he had cut it off for a binding, and had sent it out. He sent out to a journeyman to send him back some work that he had sent out that morning; some was brought, but the mark was not found on it. On searching farther there was part of another skin which Roberts claimed. He took us into the parlour to shew us what skins he had there, and shewed us a number which Roberts could not speak to. He then took some boot legs from the top of a press, which Roberts claimed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He shewed you every thing - A. He did. Perhaps we should not have found them if he had not produced them. He said he bought the boot legs of the same man at 5 s. or 5 s. 6 d. a pair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. He answered every question without the least hesitation - A. He did, and produced the leather.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. My Lord, after this evidence, I will not for one moment longer hold this case over Sinclair's head.</p>

             told me, I went into Du Coin's bedroom, and saw leather soles in his drawer - they had no business there; I immediately employed Plank. He came to my house in the evening, and waited in my dining-room until Du Coin usually went out, which was about half-past eight o'clock; he did not go out as usual, but went up to the dining room to supper. I told him I had long suspected him of robbing me, and was certain he had. Plank asked him about the leather that was found in the drawer? He denied having any, or knowing any thing about it. Plank told him he had been in the next room, knew what he had been about, and asked him what he had done with the leather that was in the drawer? He said he had taken it from the drawer, and put it under his bed; we went to the bedroom, turned up the bed, and pulled it out. The officer asked him what he was going to do with it? he said he was going to take them to Scandret. Plank asked him whether he had taken any to him before? He said on the Tuesday he had taken him four pieces of sole leather, that Scandret sold it, and they divided the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120054"/>money. We went to search Scandret's apartments in Eden-court, Swallow-street, where we found him at home - he denied having a bit of my property in his possession. Plank searched, and when he came to a place where there was some, he said there was some there, and that it was my property. Plank asked him if he had any more? he said he had not a bit more; as soon as Plank came to where there was some more, he said there was some and it was mine. Plank found some in three different places, which Scandret said was all mine, fell on his knees, and asked me to forgive him; we took him to my house where Du Coin was. When he got there he agreed that Du Coin had brought him four pieces of sole leather, which he sold for 6 s. - they must have been good to sell at that. He said he gave Du Coin 3 s., and Du Coin spent 6 d.</p>

            . I am an officer. I have heard the prosecutor's account; it is correct. I found some leather in Du Coin's drawer, and some in several places in Scandret's apartments. He said he had nothing belonging to his master, but when we went into the back room he said we should find two pieces there, and more in a box, that it was the prosecutor's, and it was all he had. I asked him how he came by it? He made no answer, but went into the other room, and threw himself at his master's feet - I took him into custody, and then took him to Mr. Roe's. In our way I told him Du Coin had been robbing Mr. Roe, that he had been receiving the leather which he had stolen, and asked him if Du Coin had ever visited him? he having told me that he used to go to his house to drink tea. He said No, he never did. I took him into the room where I had left Du Coin in custody, and asked Du Coin, in his presence, what he was going to do with the leather he had taken from under his bed? He said it was to be taken up into the shop early in the morning for Scandret to take out. I asked him when he carried any to Scandret before? He said the night before last he carried four pair of soles to his house, that Scandret sold them and gave him 2 s. Scandret interrupted him, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is false, you had 3 s., and I had 3 s. - I sold them for 6 s., and you spent 6 d. out of your 3 s." I asked Du Coin how long they had been in the practice of taking goods away in that manner? he said about six months, and that it was done to supply them with money for gin and beer in the shop, and that he sometimes took a larger quantity and sometimes a smaller. Scandret said that had been the case, but not to the quantity Du Coin had stated, and that a man named Clack first began it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. This was about property found at the prosecutor's house - A. No, they both agreed about the four pieces of sole leather.</p>

On the 9th of December, about half-past two o'clock in the afternoon, I put these things, with the breakfast things, in the housekeeper's room, in front of the house - the area gate was left open. A painter, who works opposite, came down and asked me if I had lost any thing? I then went into the room, and missed the cream jug and spoon. He said the persons went down the mews by the side of the house. I went after them, and found the three prisoners together in the New Road. I said,</p>
               <p>"Young men, you are wanted at No. 19, York-street, where you have just come from." They said they did not know where it was. I said I would shew them. Butler instantly ran away - the other two said they would go back with me. They turned down North-place and ran away. I called Stop thief, and pursued - a gentleman came up, and Bailey was taken. I had him brought back to the house; he at first denied it, but afterwards said he had not got the property, but Bridges had it, and that he lived in Gee's-court, Oxford-street - I gave him in charge. I am sure all the three prisoners were together. About half-past six o'clock that evening Marrebow brought the property home to us.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About twenty minutes past two o'clock Slaughter sprang his rattle, I ran up, the prisoner was gone then. Next morning he came to Slaughter's, and owned the cart - he was detained. The cart was stopped about a quarter of a mile from the field.</p>

The flats were about four yards apart. I followed him into the street, collared him, and told him he must go no further, for he had something in his cart which did not belong to him. He asked me what I collared him for? and asked if he had made any mistake in taking butter, if so, he was sorry for it, and I might take it back. I said he should go no further, and I should not take it out till the officer came. Thompson came, and took him to the watch-house. The flat was directed to High-street, Borough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said if there was a mistake he was sorry for it - A. Yes. He had brought two empty flats back. It was early in the morning. His own flat stood alone, and was shewn to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor employed me to look out of a morning. I advised them to put each person's butter separate, and shew every man his own. I was out in the street, the hostler called me, and gave the prisoner in charge. It was break of day.</p>

            . On the 3d of January, as I was coming from Staines, the prisoner overtook me; he said he was going after a four-horse team that came from Farnham - he had a bundle. I remembered that no team passed, and suspected him. I asked him what he had in his bundle? he said he had a couple of geese. I examined it, and found he had two geese in a smock-frock; they were quite warm. I asked him where he got them from? he said from Farnham. I said that was impossible, he must have stolen them in the neighbourhood. He said a man gave them to him at Egham - he could not tell who the man was; I detained him. I found they belonged to Taylor.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was with Read, and watched the prisoners in company with another - we saw them attempt one or two gentlemen's pockets. They followed a gentleman up Chancery-lane, and after they had got about two hundred yards up, I saw them close upon him - they fell back directly, and ran away. I followed, and as Clark got into Bell-yard, I saw him hold it up to the others, and laugh - Read seized the others, but Clark got away. I followed him to Temple-bar, and there saw him drop the handkerchief. I secured him - he said he had just picked it up.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 16th of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner near Limehouse Hole, about a quarter of a mile from the City Canal, carrying a rug on his shoulder, which drew my suspicion, and I asked him where he got it? he said a man gave it to him at Mill-wall - it contained rope. I asked him where he was going to take it to? he said nowhere particular - the rope was in three strands, and each strand of a length; it had been untwisted. Next morning I found the ship, Providence, had been robbed of her hawser. On the 18th of December I searched a field adjoining the canal where the vessel had been fastened, and there found the bit of a hawser, which tallied with that found on the prisoner. It weighs 121 lbs., and is eight fathoms long.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in New Road, St. George's in the East, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's. Cross and Johnson came to my house about eight o'clock in the morning of the 1st of December; they said they had two pigs to sell; that they were obliged to bring them off the premises the over-night, to prevent their being seized for rent. They took me five or six doors from my house to see the pigs, I there saw Stone and the pigs - he said nothing about them, but after I had agreed for them he said he would lend a hand to drive them to my house. I made the agreement with Cross, he said he was the owner. I gave one of them 2 s. earnest, and said if they would wait two hours I would pay for them. Three or four days after, Jones and his servant saw and claimed them. I was to give 50 s. for them.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell. On the 1st of December I received information that the three prisoners had two pigs in their possession - I found them at Badcock's. I apprehended Stone on the 1st of December - he lived in the house where the pigs were found; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182001120059"/>said he knew nothing about them, but that Cross had left them there. The house is let out in different tenements. Cross came to the office when Stone was examined, and I secured him at the door - he said he knew nothing about them. I found Johnson on the Sunday following - he said he would tell the Magistrate all about it. The prosecutor had the pigs returned.</p>

               <p>JOHNSON'S Defence. I met Cross, and told Badcock he wanted to sell three pigs, as he promised me something for my trouble.</p>
               <p>STONE'S Defence. The man asked me if I knew where they could lodge the pigs? my landlord gave him leave to put them there.</p>
