I am manager of the Kilburn branch of Parr's Bank, Limited—our head office is in Bartholomew Lane—on May 13th the prisoner drove up to our bank in a cab, and was shown into my office—he said, "Your people in the City tell me that you will kindly cash my cheques for me"—he spoke with a strong American accent—I said, "Under what circumstances?"—he said, "I am over here with some friends from New York for the Jubilee, and we are staying at the Hotel Cecil, but for a few days soiue of us are staying in Grove End Road, and it would be convenient to have some money here to save going into the City"—Grove End Road is close by our branch—I asked him under what circumstances he came from our head office—he said he had a letter of credit for 30,000 dollars, which he had lodged with Brown, Shipley, and Co.—they are old American bankers—I explained to him that it would he better to have an account with us—he said he should be very pleased, and he would transfer 2,500 dollars—I said, "Will you give me a cheque to open an account with?"—he said, "My cheque-book is at the Hotel Cecil, but my cab is outside; I can send for it;" that rather took me off my guard, and I said, "You need not do that; you can open an account here; you can sign an order," which I produced to'him, and he signed it "R. G. Hay," addressed to a Paris bank—I said, "Hay, that is the name of the Ambassador of your country;" he said, "Yes, he is my cousin"—he</p>

               <p>he showed me two tablets, representing eight rooms at the Hotel Cecil, which he said he had secured for the entire Jubilee—he said he did not think he could come to the bank again, but he would send his wife—he said, "I know in the United States it is necessary to have somebody as a witness "; I said, "It is not necessary here; I shall have to clear it," and I sent a clerk to the City—the prisoner remained a little while, but before the clerk returned he said he should want a little money, and I gave him a cheque-book containing twenty-five forms, and he drew a cheque for £10, and filled up another for £50, which his lady would want, and would call for—the clerk shortly returned, and said they did not seem to know anything about this matter in the City—he said it must be a mistake, and suggested going to the telegraph office—he seemed annoyed, and I took him immediately to a private office; in my presence he telephoned, complain<lb/>ing of the apparent neglect in not attending to his business—he went through the form of listening for reply, and then said, "This will be put right; "thereupon he went out; as we left the door he walked a little in front of me, and he said, "My cabman tells me there are two ladies of our party waiting across the road; I will go to them"—I watched him across the road, and waited a little while; he never returned, or the ladies either—after that, up to the time of his arrest, fifteen of the cheques that were in the cheque-book I had given him were presented at our bank, signed "R. G. Hay," amounting to £384, which were dishonoured—these are the cheques; one is signed "G. H. Phillips"—they are all from the same book—here is one signed "R. G.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had known him about three weeks, and as he re<lb/>presented a good Brighton firm I thought his credentials were good enough to cash the cheque—I do not make a practice to change cheques for strangers—I had changed two cheques that were honoured—he did not say he was expecting money, and ask me to hold it over—if I had doubted it I should have paid it in at once—I paid the other cheques in the next day.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was from Elenbrass, stating that he had known Hirons two years, and con<lb/>sidered him honest and trustworthy.</hi>) Hirons called again, and I engaged him—he was not to collect money—he said that he had a knowledge of the trade, and could call on all the buyers in London—I told him I could not supply them, as he was an undischarged bankrupt—he said, "Then you can supply them to my wife," and after that two deliveries were made—I received this order for margarine, value £15 11s. 2d, to be consigned to Bishopsgate Station—I also received this order of Novem<lb/>ber 19th. (<hi rend="italic">This stated</hi>: "Kindly hold Hirons' order till you hear from me.")

I am a carman, and have been employed by Hirons—in March this year I went to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, and Hirons gave me this order: "Please deliver twelve boxes of margarine addressed to us at 7, Park Place, Ley ton"—I got the goods, and took them to some stables at Stoke Newington—I do not know who occupied them; no name was up—I had been there once before—I did not see Elenbrass in regard to that delivery—on another date in April I received this letter from Elenbrass, went to Bagley's, hired a van, went to the City, to Elen<lb/>brass's office, and asked him for the order for the margarine; he went with me, and asked for the order, while I waited outside; I fetched the van, got the margarine, and delivered it at another stable in Arthur Road, Stoke Newington—it is signed "J. Smee and Co."; I do not know whose writ<lb/>ing that is, and I went with Elenbrass in a van to Leyton Station, and received twenty-four tubs of margarine; Elenbrass went inside; I saw no order—I delivered some of the margarine to Mr. Jackson, and some at another shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I was captain of the <hi rend="italic">Illovo</hi>, a British ship—we left for South Africa on February 27th this year—before sailing I engaged the prisoner as a pantry-boy—I could not say his age; it is on the articles—Henry Halliday was engaged as third steward—I think he was nineteen or twenty—neither of them had served under me before—I think the prisoner had not been to sea before; he produced no discharges—Halliday did; he had been to sea before—we left South Africa from Port Natal on April 17th last, on our return journey, having taken on board some passengers and cargo—among the cargo were some cases belonging to Captain Lucas, of Durban, which were stowed in the aft between decks to bring home—Halliday and the prisoner were berthed together in a section of the aft between decks, as a temporary cabin; this model accurately represents it, and shows the way in which their hammocks were lashed—this photograph represents the cabin, as taken from the deck, looking for'ard—up to May 2nd I had not heard of any disagreement between Halliday and the prisoner—luncheon was served that day at one o'clock—after luncheon I was off duty, in my cabin—about four it was the practice to have tea; it was brought in, but not by Halliday or the prisoner—after tea I went on deck; that was about two minutes past four—I went and stood just on the corner of the hatch, aft the cabin; Mr. Joy, a passenger, was standing talking with me, and while standing there I heard a shot from the hatch; I had been standing there about three minutes—I was about eight paces from the hatch; the weather was fine at the time—I had not heard anything from the hatch before the shot; no sound or movement of any kind; of course, there is always a little noise on board—immediately on hearing the shot I went to the hatch, and looked down; the hatch was off, so that I could see down—I smelt powder and smoke after I had looked down about a second—I did not see any smoke—the part I looked down was, as nearly as possible, over the head of Halliday's hammock—as I looked down, I saw the pri<lb/>soner getting into his own hammock—I said, "What are you boys doing?"—I got no answer—I did not see Halliday; I could have seen, but I did not look at him—I then jumped down—while I was getting down,. I saw the prisoner fall out of his hammock; I went over toward him, and got hold of him, and pulled off some of his clothing—I found no injury upon him; while searching him I said, "What have you been doing?"—his reply was, "He told me to do it"—at that time he was lying on his back on the floor, throwing his arms about, more or less—I then turned round and looked towards Halliday's hammock—before that I had not seen what had happened to him; I then saw that blood was flowing from his right temple—he was lying, as I first thought, asleep, not on his back, more on his right side, somewhat facing the prisoner's hammock—he was sensible and peaceable, as if asleep—I then went on deck, and called the doctor, Mr. Ross, and he and one of the passengers, and Mr. Co well, the mess-room</p>

               <p>steward, came below to the cabin—I took off another hatch, and then saw this revolver and this box of cartridges lying in the prisoner's hammock; they were not covered up, just lying—Mr. Cowell handed them up to me—one of the officers threw some of the cartridges over—I examined the revolver in my cabin—I found one exploded cartridge, the other chambers were empty—I then came back, and found that Halliday was dead—the prisoner was still down in the hold, sitting on the deck; he was not doing anything, so far as I saw—I ordered him to be brought up on deck at once—I only had just a glance at him; he was quiet—he said nothing to me—brandy was offered to him—he dashed it away, smashing the glass—I ordered him to be put in a cabin by himself, and he was handed over to the British Consul at Las Palmas—Halliday was buried at sea at six in the morning of May 3rd; that was part of my duty under the Merchant Shipping Act—this is the official log-book—it was necessary for me to take a statement from the prisoner, and about ten o'clock on May 3rd I went into the room where the prisoner was, with the chief officer and Mr. Ross, and I told the prisoner I wanted him to give me a statement of what had happened in the cabin the previous day; I told him to tell me the truth, as the statement would be entered in the official log, which would be handed over to the authorities dn our arrival—I don't know whether I said anything about evidence or not; most likely I did—I told him that anything that goes into the official log is taken as evidence—he then made a statement; it was partly in his own words, and partly in answer to questions put to him, some by me, and some by Mr. Ross—Mr. Ross wrote it down—I then went into my cabin, and copied it into the log—I then went back to the prisoner, with Mr. Ross and the chief officer, and read over to him the statement I had written in the log-book, and Tasked him if he had anything further to say—he said, "No." (<hi rend="italic">It was proposed to put in and read the entry in the log.</hi>

(<hi rend="italic">This was said to be found on the deceased.</hi>) About May 4th, in consequence of a report made to me, I went down to the cabin again, and looked at Captain Lucas's box; the lid of it was open; I looked inside, it was in good order; I took nothing out of it; I left it just as it was.</p>

I live at 10, Roslyn Terrace, Aberdeen—I am a master of surgery there—I was surgeon on board the <hi rend="italic">Illovo</hi>, on her voyage from London to the Cape and back, in the spring of the present year—on Sun<lb/>day, May 2nd, between three and four, I was sitting on deck aft, near the stern—I knew Halliday; he had brought the tea to me a few minutes before, and he then went away—shortly after that I heard a shot, and the captain called to me from the front part of the hatch—he spoke to me, and I went and fetched my instruments and case of dressings, and went down to the cabin—I there saw Halliday; he was lying in his hammock on his back, on the starboard side, with his head towards the fore part of the vessel, looking towards his right hand, towards the ham<lb/>mock on the port side—the expression of his features was quite peaceful—he was lying on his back, slightly inclined towards the right side—his right arm was lying by his right side, and his right hand was lying on the lower part of his abdomen, touching this book; his four fingers were resting on the top of the book; his left arm and hand were lying loosely along his left side in the hammock; his right hand was also hanging loosely in the hammock; he was quite unconscious, and breathing very heavily; he had a wound on the right side of his head, about an inch in front and about an inch below the middle of the head, on the right side—there was blood coming from it—there was clotted blood on the hair—he was then dying—I could do absolutely nothing; it was only a matter of a few minutes—his clothes were not disarranged in any way; they were in perfect order until I removed them—he had on a white shirt, a white collar, blue trousers, white canvas shoes, a black bow, which was still tied; his collar was also in position—there was nothing to indicate that any struggle had taken place—he died in about a quarter of an hour after I first got down into the cabin, without having regained consciousness—after his death his hammock was cut down, with the body in it, and laid on the floor of the cabin—the appearance of the body altogether indicated that the effect of the shot must have been instantaneous; consciousness must have gone immediately on receiving the wound—I washed the blood off his hair and face, and made an accurate examination of the wound—there was a good deal of blood in the hair, and a considerable quantity had come from the</p>

               <p>right side of the head on to the hammock—the wound was a round, irregular wound, which admitted the top of the index finger, about a quarter of an inch in diameter—I did not find the bullet—there was no burning round the wound—the cause of death was shock, due to a gunshot wound—the immediate cause of the wound would be unconsciousness—I examined the hammock before it was cut down—I found a hole about an inch and a-half from the top on the right, at the top edge of the canvas, on the right side; there was a slight blackening round it—I saw Halliday lying in his hammock; the rent in the hammock would be just opposite the wound in the head—I picked up this cap on the between deck two days afterwards; I don't know where it was on the Sunday—there were marks of blood upon it—when I went down the pri<lb/>soner was lying on the floor, on his back, between the two hammocks, his arms and legs fully extended—he did not understand any questions put to him—I asked him what was the matter, and told him to wake up; he was quite dazed: he made no answer, and did nothing; he looked startled and stupid when addressed; he was moving his arms and legs—he was brought on deck, and I offered him some brandy in a glass; he dashed it out of my hand forcibly, and it smashed—I then got some ammonia, and made him smell it; I then made him take some brandy, and he quieted down—he was not the worse for liquor, in my opinion—next morning, the 3rd, I went with the captain into the room where the prisoner was—I have heard the captain's evidence as to what he said to the prisoner; that is quite correct—the prisoner made a statement; I took down what he said; he was then perfectly rational; he understood everything that was going on—I have here the notes that I made. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE HAWKINS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">was of opinion that this might, be accepted as legitimate evidence.</hi>) The captain, the chief mate, and myself were there—the captain said, "We have come to find out what you know about yesterday's occurrence," and that anything he said might be used against him afterwards—the prisoner said he quite understood the purport of the caution—the captain began by asking the prisoner where he had been before the acci<lb/>dent occurred—this is my original note; I have no note of the question: "The prisoner said he finished his work in the pantry at three p.m., and went forward to the galley, and sat there with the assistant-cook, Miller, with whom he remained about half an hour. On leaving him he went aft to his quarters, and when he got below he found a revolver and a box of cartridges lying in his hammock. After he had been down a short time the deceased came down to his hammock. The prisoner asked what these were doing in his hammock, referring to a revolver and cartridges in the prisoner's hammock. The deceased replied, 'Never you mind, they are mine; give it to me,' meaning the revolver. The prisoner handed the revolver to the deceased, and told him he would go up and inform the captain. When he was going up the deceased pointed the revolver at him. He told him to lower the revolver, and he would not, so he rushed at him, and got hold of his left hand, in which the revolver was, a book being in his right hand; a scuffle ensued, during which the revolver went off. The prisoner said he did not know who fired the revolver. The revolver fell on the floor on the deceased's left-hand side, when the pantry boy (the prisoner) picked it up and laid it on his own hammock along with the cartridges, which had been there all the time. When he looked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189706280036"/>
               <p>at the deceased he saw blood on his head, but he was not sure of the exact place, and, owing to feeling giddy and dazed, he had tried to get into his hammock, but was unaware whether he got in or not. He remem<lb/>bered nothing afterwards. He described what happened before the accident. He said he had had no lunch, but had a bottle of stout about two p.m., as he did not feel inclined to eat. Soon after drinking the stout he drank about a quartern of whisky with a little water, and after drinking it he poured out about half a quartern of whisky, and the deceased drank it. The whisky was stolen from, and drank in, the chief steward's room. After drinking the whisky he went on with his work till three p.m. The deceased went on deck"—I have not got that down, but I remember Captain Baker asking him as to his remembering having said something—I could not say at what period of the conversation that question was put—the captain asked him if he remembered telling him that he told him to do it—the boy said he remembered nothing that happened from the time that he attempted to get into his hammock—In my opinion, from what I saw, the wound could not have been inflicted by Halliday if he retained the revolver in his left hand; I think it was fired in a line from Halliday's head from the other side of the space where the hammocks were hung (<hi rend="italic">the witness marked the spot on the model</hi>)—the boy's head was lying in the hammock, turned to the right, in that direction—you cannot trace the track of a bullet after it strikes the brain substance, but I think it went straight on, and struck the hammock; the hammocks were slung fore and aft; there was no mark of burning on the cap; the prisoner was under my care all the way home after the accident; his manner was rational; he never said anything about it; he was not asked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner said he had got hold of the deceased's left hand, in which the revolver was, with his own left hand, and with his right hand he grasped the deceased's right shoulder—that does not appear in the original note; I got a note of that about an hour after<lb/>wards, when I transcribed them—I made the notes on the spot, as he came down and wrote that afterwards—when the prisoner was lying under his hammock he was moving his arms and legs about—the mess-room steward and second officer were there when I got down—I examined the deceased before I examined the prisoner—I told the prisoner to wake up, or some such remark—he looked dazed—he continued to move his arms and legs about as he lay not quite under the hammock—I ordered his removal on deck, and remained with him there—he was more violent—he appeared to be recovering from hysterics, which come on by sudden emotion as a rule—the discovery of a calamity would do it—on deck he did not appear to realise what had taken place, or recognise people for perhaps five minutes afterwards—at the Police-court I was asked how I accounted for the curious condition in which the prisoner was directly after the shot was fired—I replied that when he realised what had hap<lb/>pened he went into a hysterical fit—he was dressed in a flannel shirt, pants, and shoes.</p>

                  </hi>. I was chief steward of the <hi rend="italic">Illovo</hi>—on Sunday, May 2nd, as she was making her homeward voyage from Natal to England, we had a third steward, Halliday, and a pantry boy, the prisoner—Halliday was nineteen years old, and the prisoner eighteen—about ten</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189706280037"/>
               <p>a.m. I found some water had been thrown down the pantry sink—knowing these boys had been employed in the pantry, when they were together, I said, "Which of you has thrown this dirty water down the sink?"—Halli<lb/>day said it was Wootton—Wootton said Halliday did it—that went on for a minute or two, when Halliday said, "Go on; I don't want any truck with you; you are only a boy," and made a gesture with his arm—the pri<lb/>soner said, "Well, if he is only a boy he is good enough for you"—I told them to leave off quarrelling, be good friends, and get about their business—they went about their duties—the prisoner would finish his work in the pantry about eleven—he would then have an hour off, and might go to his berth and remain there—he returned to get the luncheon ready at twelve—Halliday also then started work—at two p.m. I gave the prisoner a half-bottle of stout—he had cut some luncheon, and was going to sit down to eat, being in the act of opening the stout as I left—his duties were to wash up the luncheon things, and then he would be free till five p.m.—Halliday was there, and I gave him the same—I opened Holiday's stout—I left them in the pantry, three or four minutes past two—I went forward on deck, sat down, and had a smoke, and returned at three or four minutes past four—the second steward and Halliday had just finished serving the four o'clock tea to the passengers who required it—I went to the pantry; I found everything had been washed up except the tea-things, which had just been used; the pantry was quite clean and tidy—Halli<lb/>day's habit was to go to sleep or lie in his hammock, read a book, or have a smoke, but not smoke between decks—a few minutes after four I heard the report of a shot—I heird the captain call out immediately after that—I went towards the report, and to where the captain called; not to this temporary cabin; I stood on deck—looking down, I saw Halliday lying in a hammock, and the prisoner lying on his back, almost under his own hammock—I saw the prisoner brought up, and the captain asked him something about drink—the doctor said, "Where did you get the drink from?"—the prisoner rested his eyes on me and said, "Steward"—I said, "Did I give you any whisky?"—he said, "No; I took it out of your room"—that was about ten minutes after the prisoner was brought on deck—after that I went down to my own room to see if I had missed any whisky—I missed about a third of a bottle, about two quarterns—they knew where I kept it—Halliday, not the prisoner, had power to sell to the passengers—I had never seen a revolver in their possession—Halliday had his cap off when I left him and the prisoner in the pantry—he generally hung it over the pantry doorway—he would have to come along the deck to go aft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was peaceable and good-tempered—he appeared friendly with the deceased—I never saw the prisoner in that condition before—he was carried on deck; I helped to lift him—he was dazed; I do not think he could talk—the day was hot, about 80 degrees in the shade.</p>

On the morning of June 2nd I went to the station, and there saw the prisoner; I charged him with the murder of the two women—he made no reply; he was searched, and on him was found this blood-stained handkerchief and this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "May 28th, 1897. Dear Sir,—I hope you will find space in your valuable paper to publish my case; one hour are in great trouble. Sir, I was sentenced to death on March 6th by the Home Department for having a 'lothsom head.' The doctor had orders to put me under operation to cure if possible, but this order he disobeyed; twelve days I laid in agony. On Saturday, the 6th,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189706280044"/>
               <p>the order arrived; four men were ordered to kill me that night, but the order said I was not a 'Mandician,' or insane; therefore, I was to be put under operation, by that order kept in suspense till the 11th. when I was liberated from Wandsworth Prison for five weeks, I was shadowed day and night by the man employed by the 'police'; these men are better known as the 'Nose.' Well, driven to drink, I got the D.T's. I fell again for an assault. I was remanded for ten days. The first night, at Holloway Prison, I laid down to sleep, Berry put the cloth over my face. I was not asleep, but five seconds more would have enough for me. Nine nights did I lie without sleep, and in misery; on the tenth day I was sentenced at Greenwich to twenty<lb/>one days; I was sent to Wandsworth Prison. The doctor at Holloway Prison sent a letter to the doctor of Wandsworth Prison to put me under a simple blister operation, which would cure me in three days. He consulted the governor, but he said we must execute the order. This was the old governor; the young governor said, 'Cure him, if possible; but the doctor disobeyed the order, and said, 'I will have nothing but his life.' This he continued to the end; but one night four men were ordered to put me to death. Well, I laid down to wait my death at seven o'clock, but the officers lost heart that night. Well, I was sent in the mill for three and a-half days without a break in between, to make me rebel against work. But all the old governor and doctor tried to make me rebel; I kept on doggedly at work, and never spoke a word for eighteen days to nobody, and when I did had almost lost my speech, being so long without speaking. During this time I had not twenty-one hours' sleep, but praying night and day, but, thank God, there are some kind officers in prison; they petitioned against the treatment I received from the hands of the governor and doctor. Four times have I laid down my life for the prison doctor to take it or care me; each time I have not asked for mercy at their hands, but I ask, in justice sake, for the public and your paper to intercede for me. Since I left prison on the 14th of May I have been shadowed by the policeman's "Nose" day and night; it seems to me they want my life; they may have that if they like, but, thanks be to God, they cannot take my soul.—<hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD CALLAGHAN</hi>, 3, Copperas Place, Church Street, Deptford, S.E.")</p>

                  </hi>. I have lived at 149, Tulse Hill, for forty-nine years—I have known the prisoner some time—he called on me about seven one evening in April, with Tudor Edwards—they asked me to ad<lb/>vance £10 on French bomds—I told them I did not understand them—then they wanted to borrow £10—then it came down to eighteen-pence—then they went out to the cabman, and he came into the front garden, and made a terrible <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, because they did not pay the fare—I lent another man, Mason, who was with them, eighteen-pence—then they had not enough to pay the cab, and the police came—on Monday, May 3rd, I met them at a public-house in Fleet Street—Fraser said, "Well, I have got a £100 cheque on account of the French bonds," and asked me to change the cheque; I said, "Oh, no; it is a big cheque; I could not do it"—he said he had got the cheque from Talbot and Taeker's, the solicitors—I had been with him to their offices, but stopped outside—Edwards said, "We are getting some money for the French bonds; we have got a £100 cheque now, and we are going to get a £15 cheque"—Fraser said, "You I wait here; I will run up to Talbot and Tasker's office, the solicitors, and get a small cheque on account," and then went out of the tap-room—he came back full of joy, and said, "Halloa, Jemmy, I have succeeded; I have got a cheque from Talbot and Tasker's office"—I said, "Let us look at it"—then he brought out this cheque, folded in this letter; I tore off the sheet; there was nothing on it. (<hi rend="italic">The cheque was on the London and Midland Bank for</hi>£15, <hi rend="italic">drawn by George Williamson, in favour of Captain H.
