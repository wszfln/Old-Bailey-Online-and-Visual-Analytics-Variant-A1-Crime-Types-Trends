                  <hi rend="italic">Castalli, in his defence, stated, in French, and on oath, that he had lived two years at 21, Rathbone Place, and was a commissionaire; that he had known Deloupe three or four years, who said that he lived at 56 Margaret Road, Forest Gate, and was a professor of the French language; that Deloupe asked him if he knew anybody who lent money, on bearer shares, as he had 300,000 fr. or 400,000 fr. in bonds, and he (Cas<lb/>talli) said that it would be necessary to consult the Journal des Oppo<lb/>sitions, and Deloupe gave him 9d. for the paper and postage stamps, which he obtained, and took it to Deloupe, who marked the paper, and he gave him back the numbers of the securities, telling him they were opposed or stolen, and refused to have anything to do with them, and he went away angry, saying, "It does not matter; I shall make money all the same," and left the marked journal on the table; that on July 31st Deloupe came again, and asked him if he could take some parcels for him to Victoria Station, because he did not want to go home with them, and introduced Deloupe to him as a friend, and said, "Mr. Deloupe wants a little business done, and if you do it he will pay you something"; and that he agreed and took the parcel, which was closed and gummed, and as soon as Renaud came up they were given into custody.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 2, Willowbrook Road, Peckham—I was formerly a client of Smith and Gofton, solicitors—the prisoner was a member of that firm—in March last I was under an agree<lb/>ment to buy some houses in Canning Town for £575—I instructed the prisoner to act for me—I had to sell a £400 bond to get part of the money—I told the prisoner, and he said I was to take the scrip to him to see how much it would fetch—I did so, and we went to the stockbrokers' office, Messrs. Browning, Tod &amp; Co., where I saw a Mr. Gordon—we left the office with Mr. Gordon, and went to the bank—we left the bank—the prisoner and the broker walked in front—something passed between them which I thought was a cheque—the broker left, and the prisoner and I walked along Lothbury—he wished me good-morning—I said, "You will keep that for me in safe custody till the purchase is completed"—then he was to send to me for the rest of the money with his fees—he said, "All right, Mrs. Greening, that shall be all right"—no one was there except the prisoner, my son, and myself—the letters which passed between the prisoner and myself were written for me by my son, who also read the letters from the prisoner to me—I remember this letter coming from the prisoner, dated March 26th, 1900—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had asked the prosecu<lb/>trix to call that day to execute the transfer of the stock, but as she was unable to do so, would she call next day for that purpose.</hi>)—a day or two after I had been to the stockbrokers' office I got another letter from the prisoner, dated March 28th—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the amount she would receive for the sale of the Victorian Stock would be £429 19s., exclusive of the dividend due on April 1st; that he found that Mr. Hurst had only purchased the freehold of the property last summer for £470, and that lie would make a profit of at east £600 on the transaction, and that if she had not signed the agreement she could decline going on with the matter.</hi>)

I have laid the papers before Counsel for his opinion, and shall hope to hear from him in the course of a few days, when I will write you again."—on April 18th I received this letter from the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had sent to Counsel, but he was out of town, and he had not been able to get his opinion.</hi>)—I received a letter from the vendor, Mr. Hurst, which I sent on to the prisoner—on April 28th I received this letter from the prisoner's clerk—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that her letter of the 27th had been received, and would be laid before the prisoner on his return to business on Monday morning.</hi>)—on April 30th I got another letter from the clerk, saying that the prisoner could not return to the office till Tuesday—I got my son to write to the prisoner, saying that if Mr. Hurst carried out what he said, there would be more trouble and expense—Mr. Hurst had threatened to go to law if I did not complete the pur<lb/>chase—I got this letter, dated June 22nd, from the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he enclosed particulars of a leasehold house which he had received, and which was for sale, that he should be glad if she would look over them, and that it could be bought for £420.</hi>)—I had not asked him to find me another purchase—-during this time I had been calling at the prisoner's office to try and see him, and my son too—on June 27th I got this letter: "Mr. Gofton has wired me to make an appointment for Friday next, and I shall be glad if you will call here between 5 and 6 on that day.—Yours faithfully, <hi rend="smallCaps">LINTON S. THORPE</hi>, for Mr. Gofton"—after that I got a telegram putting me off—I then instructed Mr.C. J. Smith, who had been the prisoner's partner, to write to the prisoner—he wrote this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that Mr. Smith had been informed by the prosecutrix that she had left with the prisoner for safe custody £429 19s. for a purchase which had not been carried out; that she had made repeated applications for the money; that he, the prisoner, had deposited the money at his bankers at 4 per cent.; and that the money was to be sent to Mr. Smith at once.</hi>)—this letter came in reply from Mr. Thorpe—(<hi rend="italic">Stating that he had spoken to the prisoner, who was much surprised at the position taken by the prosecutrix, especially as she had instructed him to retain the proceeds of the sale of the shares until the injudicious contract for the purchase of the property had been determined, and that he would make out his bill of costs and remit the balance at an early date.</hi>)—I cannot read—I have never got a farthing back from the prisoner.</p>

Smith and Hudson that I had made repeated applications for the repayment of the money, and that the prisoner had made repeated promises to pay—I had not seen the prisoner, but his clerk, Charles King, had said he would pay—I remember my mother asking the prisoner what the scrip would fetch—he replied that he did not know, but he spoke through the telephone to Messrs. Browning &amp; Co.—my mother asked if she would be entitled to receive the dividend on April 1st—on March 28th or 29th my mother showed me a letter which said that she would receive £429 19s. from the sale—until then we were not sure what she would get.</p>

I am the wife of Jonathan Willott, carman, of Sidney Street, Bethnal Green—the deceased was my daughter—she was 19 years of age at the time of her death—I had known the prisoner as keeping company with her for just over 12 months—she kept company with him till about 11 weeks ago from now, after which he did not come so regular, and my daughter ceased going out with him—about three weeks after that I saw him coming to the door—I only spoke a few words with him—on August 31st I received this letter by post from the prisoner—(<hi rend="italic">Read: dated August 30th, from Holloway Prison, asking how the witness was, and saying that what had happened was a great blow, but was not his fault, but the deceaseds; that nothing would have happened if she had said one word, when all would have been well, but that her temper would not allow her; that he should be at the inquest next day, and hoped to see her; and asking her to btar up for the sake of the little ones, whose names he forgot.</hi>)—he had known the names of the little ones—one was Edward, and the other Alice—I had never known him to forget their names before—he appeared to be very fond of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I last saw him he said he was going to Australia that same night—he said he should be away five or six months, but that he should be home just before Christmas—he did not say why he was going, but was going to a relation there—I do not know if he has a relation in Australia—he said he had paid for his passage—he proposed that we should have some drink, as he was going away, which we did—I have noticed him strange in his manner at times—he seemed to be dazed and worried, as if he had something on his mind—on the Sunday when he said he was going to Australia he had a sort of a fit—he came in and said he wanted to see my son George—they went over to the Angel to have some refreshment—they came back, and the prisoner sat down—he sent for some ale and whisky—he drank a drop of whisky, and then gradually fell on the floor—it was about 10 minutes before they brought him to—when he was better we all went, over to the Angel and had a few drinks—he was quite sober—I hever heard that he had a severe injury to his head seven or eight years ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a general practitioner, and was the Senior Medical Officer at the Western General Dispensary, Marylebone Road, in June last—on June 6th, about 6.30 p.m., I dined with Dr. Thompson and Dr. Unwin at the Western Dispensary—we always dine there as a rule—Dr. Thompson was a visitor—some time after dinner we went to the Metropolitan Music Hall, Edgware Road—we stayed there about an hour and a-half—as Dr. Thompson was not feeling well, we went back to the Dispensary, from there we took a '<hi rend="italic">bus</hi> and went down Piccadilly to the Criterion bar—we were sober—Dr. Unwin and I had a bitter each—Dr. Thompson had a plain soda—I think it was about 11 p.m.—from there we went to Challis's opposite, and we all had the same there—we stayed a few minutes—then we went to Brewer Street, to the Glass-house Stores—that was before 12—I asked for a soda split between the three—whilst it was being served the barman said, "Won't you have brandy in it?" in a nasty way—I said that I only wanted what I had asked for, and "I do not want any of your impudence"—he said he did not want any of my impudence, and that he would not have any—the land<lb/>lord pulled my nose across the counter, and I was struck in the face—I saw he looked dangerous, and tried to get out of the bar, when both Laws and the barman jumped over the counter, rushed to the door before I did, and tried to prevent my egress—I had said I would go and fetch a con<lb/>stable, and that, in my opinion, irritated him—I squeezed by and got out into the street—the first thing I saw was the prisoner strike Dr. Unwin in the face in the passage—then he rushed out of the house with this long shutter-pole (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—he had not it in his hand when he was striking Dr. Unwin—he struck at me—I held my stick up and saved the blow, but he broke my stick—I slipped back—he rushed to the side of the street where Dr. Thompson was, who had followed us—we were then in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190009110028"/>
               <p>street, and quite off the premises—I saw him strike Dr. Thompson with that pole, and he fell—he managed to get on to his feet again, and was immediately struck down by Laws with the pole—I called out "Police!" and "Murder!"—Dr. Thompson, after being struck down the second time, crawled practically on all fours across the road, but did not get to the opposite kerb, and then he rolled over on his back—within a few seconds two policemen came—Dr. Thompson had not said a word inside the place to the prisoner, and I saw no one strike him—it is untrue that either of us vomited in the house, or misbehaved ourselves at the Metropolitan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am now staying at 12, Brentford Square, Bays<lb/>water—I left the Dispensary six or seven weeks ago—I have not asked for a testimonial—Dr. Unwin is a qualified man—he had resigned before this accident—we lunched about 1 o'clock, and dined at 6.30—our con duct to the barmaids at the music hall was not offensive—we were not requested to leave; we left because Dr. Thompson was unwell—he made something up for himself at the Dispensary—he intended to go to the Seamen's Hospital—we had no discussion at the George, nor challenge a young butcher to fight, nor get ejected from any house—I had not seen Roberts before—I did not try to go into any club—we were sober—I believe we sat on stools, but I did not notice—the landlord was present the whole time—none of us touched the prisoner—the barman, in serving, did not say, "Give me a chance," nor, "I cannot sweep up the filthy mess"—no foul language was used—we were not requested to leave; they seemed to want to keep us in—Laws was not assaulted outside.</p>

I was house surgeon at the Sea<lb/>man's Hospital on June 6th, when I dined with Dr. Harris and Dr. Unwin at the Western General Dispensary, and afterwards went to the Metropolitan Music Hall with them—we went back to the Dispensary, and afterwards to the Criterion Restaurant, I think in a cab—I had soda water, the others had beer, at the Criterion and at Challis's—from there we went to the Glasshouse Stores in Brewer Street—I only saw the barman at first—Harris asked for soda water—the barman said, "I suppose you mean brandy" or "three brandies"—Unwin said that we did not want any of his impertinence—then the prisoner came up and asked what was the <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> noise or dispute; something of the sort—the prisoner then reached over the bar and pulled Harris's nose and hit him on the face with his fist—I have been qualified to practise six years—Harris said he was assaulted, or would get a constable—I was perfectly sober—I had not been ordered to leave the Metropolitan Music Hall—we had not been offensive to females there—I have no recollection of having been to more than three places—the landlord jumped over the bar—all I recollected after that till I got out was being hustled into the street—then I felt a blow on my head, then a second, and I do not remember any more—I was taken to the hospital, and remained five weeks all but a day—I now suffer from trouble with my speech, loss of memory and general upset.</p>

I was medical officer at the London Temperance Hospital on July 21st—Lloyd was brought there at 5 a.m.—I casually examined him, but did not find any wound—he complained of great pains in his side and abdomen, and was so collapsed that I had to admit him up to one of the beds—later on, on a thorough examination, I found a fine punctured wound in his left side, in the ante auxiliary line just below the sixth rib—I should characterise it as serious—a bradawl would cause the wound—the silver probe went in 1 1/2 in.—when I left the hospital he was not in danger—he was in danger when he came in—the left side of his chest was filled with blood up to where the wound was causing a depres<lb/>sion on the lung, and I fancy the lung was slightly wounded as well.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Worthing, and know the prisoner as a solicitor—I had lent £500 to my son-in-law, Mr. Tait—in August, 1898, I took a paper referring to this money to the prisoner, and asked him if it was correct—his office was then in the Euston Road, and he wrote to Mr. Tait about the matter—on September 9th, 1898, I went up to his office and saw Mr. Tait, who produced £500 in bank notes to repay me, also £4 4s. for interest—this money was all put on the table—I said I would pay costs, because I did not wish my son-in-law to suffer by my mistake—I paid £4 14s. 4d. for costs—this is the receipt now handed to me—Mr. Tait then went away, but the notes remained where he had put them—I told the prisoner that I wanted the money—he said it was too late for me to put the money in the bank that day—I replied, "I have no money to keep myself"—he said, "How much do you want?"—I said, "I want £100 certainly now, but even if the hour is too late to put away the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190009110038"/>
               <p>money I can take it with me, because I have had larger amounts in my care"—ultimately I took £100 in notes away, and the other £400 was left with him, because he insisted that it was not right that I should go away with such a large amount—I wanted to put it in the Post Office Savings Bank, which I understand—he said, "You must come up and get the £400"—as far as I know, the letter now handed me, dated October 14th, is the one I wrote to the prisoner—it is true the letter stated I wanted to settle about the £400 before I went to my work, and points out that he promised to do his best for me—after writing that letter, I came up to London and called at his office a great many times, sometimes twice a day—the first time I called after writing that I was told he had gone to Russia—that made me feel very ill, because I felt I had been done—on November 9th I got this letter from him: "If you will kindly call on Monday next, the 14th inst., I shall be prepared to settle matters with you"—I next got this letter from him (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>), stating that it was impossible for him to keep the appoint<lb/>ment at 3 o'clock, and stating that he must therefore postpone it until the Thursday—I went on the Thursday also, and many more times, but could get nothing satisfactory from him, because he kept running in and out of his office—I have never had any more of my money from him—I then informed Mr. Tait of what had happened, and put the matter in the hands of Mr. Verrall, a solicitor, of Worthing—after this, Mr. Tait from time to time handed me various sums of money he had received from the prisoner—I do not know how much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Once before 1898 I went to the prisoner to do writing for me to secure some goods I had—Mr. Tait is my son-in-law—I lent him £500—I got an acknowledgment from him, but when the money was repaid the prisoner destroyed this—prisoner said he must get a proper security for my money or the title deeds—my daughter and son-in-law were angry at my going to a solicitor at all, and they said rather than give the security now asked for, they would repay the money; so in the afternoon of September 9th Mr. Tait repaid the money—no date was fixed to see the prisoner, and I did not see him again for about a month—no arrangement was made as to what he was to do with the remainder of the money—I said before the Magistrate that I had interest from the prisoner, but I say now that I had interest from Mr. Tait, not from the prisoner, from whom I could get nothing straightforward—I believe it is true that the prisoner and his man, Mr. Burder, said something about my getting my money from a large amount of costs of a lawsuit in Russia, but I did not understand properly, and I said, "It is nothing to do with me; I want the money to put away myself."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner said something about a gentleman dying in Russia, and that he had been there, but he did not say that he had used my money, nor did I authorise him to do so, because I wanted to pat it in the savings bank.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a monumental mason, and live at North Street, Worthing—in August, 1898, I held £500, borrowed from Mrs. Judd—I received the letter of August 22nd from the prisoner, pointing out that on behalf of Mrs. Judd he must ask for a proper security, and that £10 penalty would have to be paid because the document was not properly</p>

               <p>stamped, and further stating that if it were inconvenient for me to repay the £500, and with the view of avoiding the payment of penalty, I should give a promissory note and deposit the title deeds; but I wished to pay off the money, so on August 29th I drew out £400 from the London County Bank, Worthing, in ten £10 notes and six £50 notes, and one £100 from my own bank, the Capital and Counties—viz., 20 £5 notes—on September 2nd I came to London with this £500 in notes—I called and saw the prisoner at his office—Mrs. Judd was not there because I had wrongly addressed a letter to her—the prisoner suggested my leaving the money, although she was not there, but I would not—I therefore, on his suggestion, went there again on September 9th—Mrs. Judd was there so I laid the notes on the table, and obtained this receipt from the prisoner: "Received from Mr. Tait £400 and£100. Signed, H.M. <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi>, Solicitor, 164, Euston Road"—some time after, in consequence of what I heard, I wrote a letter, of which I have not kept a copy, but I got a reply on November 26th, 1898—(<hi rend="italic">This stated that the prisoner did not like Mrs. Judd placing the money with an unknown boarding-house keeper, not knowing the liabilities attaching to the establishment, and that now he knew she was in good hands, he would gladly pay over the money, and that all he required was a letter signed by Mrs. Judd authorising him to hand over the money to him and asking her to write, when the witness would call</hi>)—in consequence of that letter I went to the prisoner's office, but he was not there—I saw his clerk—I called two or three times, but I did not see the prisoner—I also wrote several times—I kept no copy of these letters, but I had one or two answers from him—I remember Mr. Burder, his clerk, coming to me with £40—I cannot say whether this was before or after the letter of January 6th, 1899—Mr. Burder brought me, I believe, four £10 notes—on another occasion he paid me £17—he would not leave the £17 unless I gave him two receipts—he said something about the £10 being for principal and £7 for interest, which I did not understand, but I accepted it, as I was anxious to get as much money as I could for the old lady—I got a letter from the prisoner on January 6th, stating that, with a view of showing his desire of carrying out the arrangement proposed by me, the prisoner should send by Mr. Burder £25, and would discuss as to security being found for the remainder—I saw Mr. Verrall on the matter—I think the arrangement the prisoner had made was to pay me the money back on Mrs. Judd's behalf—Mrs. Judd gave me a letter authorising me to receive the money—I received from Mr. Verrall after this sums amounting to £75, which I handed to Mrs. Judd—at various times I received a total of £132—I did not understand that any of it was for interest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Rather than give a legal security, it was my wish to repay the amount—at the time I repaid the money the prisoner tore up the original security I had given, and with which he was dissatisfied, because, as he said, it gave Mrs. Judd no security—from September 9th, when I repaid the loan, I did not see the prisoner again until I saw him at the Police-court—I have no doubt that the first letter I wrote was on November 25th, which was answered by the prisoner on November 26th—the letter from Mrs. Judd authorising me to get the money from prisoner is as follows: "Dear Sir,—I, Mary Judd, beg you will hand, the money which you hold belonging to me, amounting to £400, to Francis Tait, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190009110040"/>
               <p>I authorise the said Francis Tait to receive the £400 for me.—<hi rend="smallCaps">MARY JUDD</hi>. To Mr. Smith"—I never could see Mr. Smith after getting this letter—I had authority to give receipts on behalf of Mrs. Judd, and I gave receipts accordingly—I still say that I did not receive any money from the prisoner for interest—with reference to the £17, I said to Mr. Burder, "I will give you a receipt for £17"—he said, "No, I have strict orders from Mr. Smith to ask for two receipts, one for £10 principal, and one for £7 interest; he does not wish to do the old lady out of her money; he wishes to pay her interest for it"—I said, "I do not want any interest, I simply want the money"—I regarded it as a trick—I got all I could—I could not have got the £7 if I had not given the receipt—Mr. Burder told me unless I did he would take the money back—I cannot say that the two receipts (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are the receipts I gave a but I know I gave them about three months after I had paid the money—I see they are written on my own paper: "Received of Mr. H.M. Smith a further sum of £10 on account of principal, £400, on behalf of Mrs. Judd, leaving a balance due to her of £350; this balance af £350 to be paid within a month from this date"—the other is: "Received from Mr. H.M. Smith the sum of £7 due from him to Mrs. Judd for interest at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum"—Mr. Burder promised that I should be paid within the month—on one occasion I refused to accept the sum of £25—on that occasion, which was about a month later, I took Mr. Burder to Mr. Verrall because he had brought only £25 instead of £350 as promised—I was anxious to get the money, and by instal<lb/>ments if I could not get it in any other way, and I made no arrangement as to interest.</p>

I am house-surgeon of Poplar Hospi<lb/>tal—on August 24th I saw Captain Leideman when he was admitted there—he had what appeared to be a bullet wound in the middle of the breast-bone; this sketch shows the position of it—it was about a quarter of an inch in diameter, and there was very little haemorrhage from it when I saw it—I was able to pass in a probe for about 2 1/2 in. downwards and slightly to the right hand; I could have passed the probe further, but I did not—we took him to the ward—no serious symptoms developed, but when he came in he had very much collapsed; that soon passed away, and he made a very good recovery—he was made a day-patient on September 6th—while he was in the hospital the X-Rays were used upon him about 14 times, but the bullet could not be localised—I believe it is still in him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said it was usual to know who people were—I ac<lb/>companied you to the Lord Henniker—I did not hear the proprietor address you as Victor Harrison—I heard you pressing for orders—you signed your name "V.H. Harrison"—you told me you were a wholesale tobacconist, and what a lot of money you had lost through bad debts, representing that you were the proprietor of that business—I may not have said that at the Police-court—you left a bag, and asked me to look after it—I took it upstairs—I said, "Come and have a drink"—it was a good chance to see if you did know Mr. Taylor—he said he did not want to give any orders, and I naturally took it as genuine.</p>

I was in Bridge Street, Hammersmith, about 11.15 p.m. on July 29th—I saw a large crowd, and asked what was the matter—the prosecutor said the prisoner had been using bad language to his daughter—I thought the case was a simple one, and dispersed the crowd—the prisoner went away into a yard opposite—the prosecutor showed me his hand, which was bleeding—he pulled up his waistcoat, and I saw some blood on his shirt—I examined him, and found he had a nasty wound on his left side—he said he would not charge the prisoner at first; he said, "Yes" afterwards—I at once went into the yard, where I saw him, and told him I should take him into custody for stabbing the prose<lb/>cutor—he replied, "Not me; not me"—he was taken to the station and charged—I did not find any knife on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prosecutor did not seem to have any doubt as to who had stabbed him—I searched for the knife, but I could not find it till 3.30 a.m., when we found it in the gutter—this is it (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—there was blood half way up the handle—it was open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Divisional Surgeon of Police at Hammersmith—I was called to the Police-station about midnight on July 29th—I examined the prosecutor—he was suffering from three incised wounds nearly an inch long and 1/2 in. deep; one in the middle of his left breast, one on his back, and one between the fourth and fifth fingers of his right hand—they all bled freely—I had to stitch some of them up—I also saw Mancey—he was wounded on his left hand; he was not in danger—considerable force must have been used on the prosecutor—this knife would produce exactly the kind of wounds I saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This knife could be used with great force; it would not slide easily along the hand.</p>

Evans &amp; Co., of 383, New Cross Road; that they were reliable people; that Mr. Evans was a friend of his whom he had known for a long time, and that the firm never took more credit than a fortnight; also that he had made the acquaintance of B. Powell, who had just started in business at 9, Rye Lane, Peckham, and he said, "You can send him in a cask as well"—I asked if he was really a good man, and if I could rely upon his paying his account promptly—he said there was no fear, because that man was backed up by Evans, and Evans was a substantial man who had several shops—I told him I had a parcel of margarine if he could do with that as well—he said I could send in a cask to each—on February 5th I sent in two casks of margarine to Evans and to Powell—I called on Evans on February 12th, and saw Mrs. Evans—I sent another cask of butter on February 16th; Evans ordered it, and on February 23rd two casks of margarine, and on the same day one cask to Powell—the value of the goods sent was £22 13s.—I have not received payment—I called on Evans six or seven times—I saw him two or three times—he admitted having the eggs—he said business was very bad—I called on Powell at least a dozen times—I saw two different managers in charge of the shop—I was annoyed, and told Reeves I would not book more orders—he said he was very sorry, but they were all right, and that he was disappointed, as he had been supplying goods, and would be a loser himself.</p>

                  </hi>.—I live at 25, Pemberton Road, Harrin<lb/>gay—I am agent for the Danish Butter Company—I was appointed last January 7th—on February 2nd Reeves came to me, having known me some years, and asked me whether I was willing to serve two or three good little wholesale men—I said, "Yes, certainly, if they are good wholesale men "—he then gave me the names of J. Evans, 383, New Cross Road, J. M. Jones, 175, Lewisham High Road, and B. Powell, 9, Peckham Rye, and asked me to send two casks of butter to each—he afterwards said, "Send three to Jones; he is a very good man"—I said, "Jones and Evans, I see, are Welshmen, I do not like serving Welshmen"—he replied, "Oh, but these are very good Welshmen"—I said, "Well, what do you know of them?"—he said he had personally done business with all of them for years, and they were thoroughly safe and reliable men who paid in seven to ten days, which is what we call cash in our trade"—I telegraphed to Denmark, and ordered the butter on the same night—at the same time I wrote to each of the customers that our terms were cash 14 day from invoice date—the goods were invoiced on February 6th—the value was: Evans, £11 10s. 11d.; Jones, £17 4s. 5d.; and Powell, £11 9s.—I called on Evans—he admitted delivery—I called on Jones, and saw a man who said he was not Jones—at the Police-court Jones interrupted me and said he was there—he admitted that the goods had been delivered—I saw the goods at 9, Peckham Rye—I called about six times, but never saw Powell—on February 27th I found Jones's shop was shut up—I said to Reeves when I saw him the following Monday, "I have been to Jones's shop, and find he has disappeared, and the Sheriff has seized his goods, you told me he was a very good man, that you had known and done business with him for years, and that he was a man who always paid you cash in from seven to ten days"—Reeves appeared much aston<lb/>ished that Jones had gone, and repeated that he was a good man, and said he would pee about it—on Monday, March 12th, I saw Reeves again,</p>

Ward," whose signature is on the letter from me, threatening proceedings, "By cash £11 10s. 1d., 3/15"—that is 3rd month, 15th day—Evans said a man brought one of my cards with the amount pencilled on the back, and on that he paid the money and obtained the receipt produced—his Honour taxed the man with having written it himself, told him he was in a very dangerous position swearing that, and gave immediate judgment with costs, and impounded the receipt—I asked permission to look at it nine months after, when the ink was black—I went the same day to Evans's shop and roughly valued the stock at £20 to £30—the next morning the Sheriff went in about 12 o'clock, and the stock then was not worth more than a sovereign to 30s.—the Sheriff remained in possession five days—I watched the shop, and in about three weeks there was a very fair stock again—on the Saturday we re-entered and seized the stock, which was sold and realised about £16—I received out of Court, for debt and costs, £13 16s.—I sued Powell—he was served by substituted service on the shop door—a shorthand writer appeared for Powell, who hangs about Southwark Police-court and public-houses—he said owing to bad trade and Powell being ill in bed, he could not pay—I got no fruit of my judgment—an agreement was produced, showing that the shop was sold.</p>

I am a traveller for the Middleburg Mar<lb/>ga✗rine Co.—I was appointed three or four months ago—I have known Reeves several years—about July 10th I saw him in the City—he said he had heard that I was engaged by the Margarine Company of Middle<lb/>burg, and he thought he could introduce me to one or two old customers of his to help me—the names, addresses, and orders he gave me were: Thomas Jones, 84, Blythe Road, West Kensington, 5 boxes of 2lb. rolls, value £3 10s.; John Bowen, Cedar Grove, Charlton, 5 boxes; and Thomas Thomas, Latimer Road, Notting Hill, 5 boxes, 5 boxes of cools, and 10 packages—my firm made inquiries of Kempe, a trade inquiry agent like Stubbs—when I saw Reeves I told him Jones's and Bowen's orders had not been executed, as the answers to inquiries were not satisfactory through Kempe—Reeves said Kempe would know very little about such people, and it was known that Kempes damaged people they were not patronised by—I did not execute the orders.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a master plasterer, of 4, Morland Road—I have worked for Mr. Holland since 1899 on this World Park Estate—in May and June, 1899, I was plastering the houses in Preston Road—at that time the building was supplied from the road, but that was stopped in March, and then the only supply was from 32, Preston Road—I asked Owen Debeney if the water had been cut off, and asked for a main supply, and got it—on June 22nd I found the pipe on—water was drawn from this pipe into a tub—I had about 11 assistants at that time, and we used the water from the tub till we got to No. 34—the men were obstructed from getting the stuff—the supply at No. 32 was not sufficient to supply us, and the bricklayers at the other end—the men covered the pipe over to save further loss, and there it remained—after a certain time I did not see men drawing water from the pipe for drinking purposes, I was told that it was jammed up—I heard no more about it till April 25th—I was on the works when Shearman came—he came from Preston Road and walked to the small hole which I described as a puddle in the street—from the hour he came no man went to the small hole and took water from it with a bucket—my brother was with me—before that, we got water for the building works from the well—there is no indentation whatever leading to the channel—when the well was not full of water I did not see water running from the puddle, only when it rained—there was nowhere for water to run, only on the ground—I know Barr and his men, but never</p>

I am a navvy, of 10, Beulah Road, Leytonstone, and have been in Mr. Holland's employ since last summer—about the second week in February I was digging out the ground at the back of the houses in Dyson Road, and found some lead pipe—I did not dig up the end of it, and do not know whether there was any water in it, but later on I was digging and found a tap, and told Mr. Holland—he knew that we had found the pipe before we found the tap, and when</p>

               <p>we found the tap we told him so—I do not know who turned the tap, but when we wanted water we got it from there for about three weeks—before that, when we wanted drinking water, we begged it from the houses—we stopped using the tap because Mr. Hammond told me he had hammered it up; he did not say why—after it was hammered up we found that it leaked, and we filled our cans from it when we had time—there is a small hole, apparently bored, in this pipe (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>)—that was only for drinking purposes—I remember a double load of chalk lime coming on the premises—I was told to run it into putty—that would take an immense quantity of water, which I was to get from the well, and I laid a connection through an iron pipe to the well—it was beyond 2ft. deep—we took a brick out at the end and put a plug in, and connected it with the sewer—I do not know whether that was about 10 days after Mr. Shearman came—I have said, "It was done the first week in May, 1900"—it was about four days before Mr. Mardell came—I bricked the hole up directly, and it was made good according to Mr. Mardell's order.</p>

I am an architect and surveyor, and Associate of the Royal Society of British Architects, of 45, Finsbury Pavement—on July 20th I went to the prisoner's estate, and on July 23rd I was shown a spot about 12ft. from the end of the pipe which had been cut off—there was a very slight depression—it was a rough piece of land—it was firm, and did not appear to have been recently disturbed—the place was not deep enough to dip a bucket into, nor yet a teacup—I saw the ballast hole at the back of 14, Preston Road—it was 5ft. or 6ft. deep—there was water in it—I put a rod down, and calculated that there were 500 to 600 gallons of water—I was also shown, at the back of 40, Preston Road, a well boarded in—the boards were 5ft. or 6ft. above the level of the ground—it was about 6ft. square and 7ft. or 8 ft. deep—I do not know what it would contain when full, but there must have been 200 or 300 gallons in it, because they had been working it all day, and I was there in the evening—300 gallons would be a fair amount for the day, but there would be times of emergency when they would want to draw more—the land is coarse gravel mixed with sand, and in some places clay—there had been some ornamental water—I went again on August 23rd, having suggested that the well should be reopened—it might he 12ft. or 14ft. deep, but the amount of water in it was very slight, not more than 300 gallons—August was very wet, and on the days that I went there had been rain in the morning—if it was a very dry season it would be very much less—if 80 or 90 pails were required for pointing the houses in Preston Road we should have the water up to the first floor—about 15 or 16 pails would be required.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am not an expert in water, but it has a very great interest for me—I went there in the evening in July, and Leach, the fore<lb/>man, told me that they had been working very hard all day—I saw an</p>

I am managing director of William Price &amp; Co., wholesale ironmongers, of 3, Kingsland High Street—two men, whom I believe were the prisoners, called on me last year for a subscription to the Lightermen's Regatta—one man was short, and one tall—I believe Hayter was one, but he was wearing something over one eye—I gave them 10s. for the company, and the secretary signed their book, which was headed "City and St. Mary's River and Docks Swimming and Life-Saving Tournament, 1899"—I said that we were only interested in the Carron Wharf—they said that the Carron Wharf and themselves were one—about January 9th, 1900, two men, I cannot say whether they were the same, brought this list No. 2 with the same heading, and got 10s. out of me—the secretary signed it—about March 1st two men called with list No. 3, which has the same heading—I gave 10s., and signed the</p>

Hayter, manager and collector"—I have totalled up the subscriptions in it; they amount to £83 3s.—No. 3 was also found on him, the subscriptions in which amount to £97 12s. 6d., No. 4 to £66 16s. 6d., and No. 5 to £115 10s.—here are also 18 parchment leaves of 186, 187, 188, and 189, total £157 7s. l0d.; the total of all added together is £667, but it is impos<lb/>sible to say about the 18 loose pages—there are two alterations in No. 2—I also find a balance sheet showing total receipts £7 5s. and expendi<lb/>ture £75, certified by John Stanley, the man who is wanted—I also found a number of invitation cards and two pocket-books</p>

               <p>robbing me—he said, "If you will only give me another chance, governor, I will pay you 7s. 6d. a week back—on Sunday morning he got up in my cart—I could not get him out, and he went round with me, but I did not let him do anything—on the Monday I had another com<lb/>plaint, and he came, and I said, "I am determined you shall not go"—he struck me a violent blow on my eye—we called the police, and I got a warrant for his arrest—he has never paid me 8s. 9d. received from Mrs. Graham, 12s. 1d. from Mrs. Ledbetter, 13s. 9d. from Mrs. Nicholls, 7s. 4d. from Mrs. Barnes, nor two sums of 7s. from Miss Wheeler—I had a conversation with him about Mrs. Graham's account three or four days before the Saturday I discharged him—two or three months pre<lb/>viously he told me she had <hi rend="italic">done a guy</hi>—that was in March—it meant that she had run away—she was then living in Little Ilford Lane—she is now living at 95, Seventh Avenue, the next turning but one—her husband is described as a sergeant instructor—I told the prisoner I should try and find her out—I made inquiries—I afterwards saw Mrs. Graham.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My wife was present at the conversation with the prisoner—I had suspected the prisoner for weeks—he told the policeman I owed him money—he has not over and over again claimed commission from me—commissions are usual with less wages, say 22s., but I gave him 27s. to cover all on his own suggestion—there were about 120 customers—commissions are on new customers; half-a-crown on a quart customer—I was doing 18 barn gallons, and the prisoner only 13—I was nearly always present when the prisoner paid in—I never looked to him for deficiencies, nor deducted his wages for them—having advanced 10s. and 4s., we paid him the balance of 13s. on the Saturday for wages—I did not have a blue foolscap sheeet from him showing a commission due of £3 19s. 6d.—I offered him half a sovereign, and said he should have another later on one Saturday early, when he said he had secured someone for milk in the road—I did not tell him I could not spare the money.</p>

I live at 10, Alexander Street, Plaistow—the house' consists of a ground floor and first floor—in July last the prisoner and the deceased took the upstairs back room furnished, and continued in occupation up to the time of the deceased's injury—the woman was an unfortunate; she brought men to my house, and used the upstairs front room—the prisoner followed no occupation while he was in my house—the deceased paid the rent of the room—the prisoner has been at home on five occasions when the deceased brought home men for the purpose of prostitution—once in my presence, when she was going to bed with a gentleman, she came into the room where her husband was, and said, "Mind this purse, <hi rend="italic">Billy,</hi> till the morn<lb/>ing; I shall be up early"—it had 10s. 6d. in it—at that time the man she had brought home was in the adjoining room—on Saturday night, August 25th, the prisoner came to my parlour door and said, "It is five minutes past 12; I am going to meet her"—he went out and returned about 12.30—he said,; "Ada is coming with a friend"—he then went up to his own room—soon afterwards the deceased came in with a gentleman—I let them in, and took them to the front bedroom upstairs—the door of the prisoner's room was half open then—I left the deceased and the man in the front room, and went to my own room—the deceased came down into my room and left her purse with me, containing some money—the next that I heard was the street-door bang about 7.5 a.m., as somebody went out of the house—about ten minutes afterwards I heard the deceased calling, "Missus, missus, I am dying, I am dying"—I opened the door, and saw the deceased in the passage at my door, saturated in blood—she only had a chemise on—I laid her down on the mat, with her feet towards the street door, and aroused the other people in the house—I went to the station and came back with a constable and Dr. Parker—the deceased was taken away on an ambulance to the hospital—before she was taken away I went upstairs to both the front and back rooms—the deceased's clothes were lying on a chair, and the bed had been used—nothing else was the matter there, but in the prisoner's room I saw the sheets of the bed, stained with blood—the washing basin was full of blood and water and a sponge—there was blood on the floor near the washstand, and marks of blood going down the stairs from the prisoner's room—there was no stain of blood in the front room, or between the front room and the back room—I had heard no noise prior to hearing the front door bang—on August 31st I received this letter, addressed to the deceased at my house—I handed it unopened to the police.</p>

I was house surgeon at the Poplar Hospital on August 26th, when the deceased was brought in at 9 a.m—an operation was performed and the best done for her, but she died on Monday morning, the 27th—I subsequently made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> ex<lb/>amination, and found that the external marks of violence were a scalp wound 1 in. long right down to the bone on the left side of the head, about 2 in. above the top of the ear; one wound in the right breast 1 1/2 in. long and 1 in. deep; a superficial wound on the left breast, simply a graze 5 in. long; it looked as if it had been scratched with some<lb/>thing sharp—on the left side of the chest there was a wound 1 in. long and 1 1/2 in. deep; on the right fore arm a wound 2 in. long and 1 1/2 in, deep in an upward direction; on the left arm two wounds above the left elbow, 1 in. long each and about 1 in. deep—on the outer side of the left forearm there was a wound 1 in. long and about 1 in, deep, that was really under the skin—in front of the left elbow there was a wound 2 in. long and a punctured wound 1/2 in. deep—on the left b✗uttock there were three wounds close together; the deepest was 2 in deep and about 1 in. long—in the middle of the back high up, there was one wound slightly on the. right side 1 in. long, simply a cut through the skin—in the Abdomen, which was the most serious, there was a wound 5 in. long which travelled downwards and inwards, pass<lb/>ing through the thorax into the abdominal cavity; the left lobe of the liver had been sliced—the: stomach had been perforated on its front and back walls, and the intestines behind the stomach had also been perforated—the diaphragm had been cut through; the left pleural cavity and the pericardium had been cut into; left lung was</p>

                  </hi>. I am resident medical officer at St. Mary's Hospital, Plaistow—the child Edith was admitted on July 31st about 3.30 p.m.—it was brought in by a young woman and the witness Spring—I had it stripped; it was very filthy; its body had certainly not been washed for more than a day; it was very wasted and emaciated, and the clothing very filthy; I saw vermin on it—it died on August 4th—it weighed 6 3/4 1b.; the normal weight of a child of its age is 12 lb.—it had two small sores, which would indicate that it had been lying on its back—I made an examination of it on August 5th—there were no signs of injury; the parts of the head were more widely open than was normal, the heart was healthy, the liver was normal, the stomach contained parts of partly digested food—there was nothing to make me believe that it was not capable of assimilating proper food—the dirty state would be likely to cause it suffering and injury to its health—I attribute its 
death to mal-nutrition and not to diarrhoea.</p>

I am an inspector to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and look after the Greenwich district—about 3.30 on July 21 at I went to 10, Amforth Street, Greenwich, where I found the prisoner occupying three rooms—I saw three children, Ethel, aged 3, George, aged 4, and Winifred, aged 2—Ethel was very thin; she was paralysed; her hair was full of lice—she was carrying a heavy pail of water, doing house work—she staggered while carrying it—I took it away from her—she seemed very ill and to be suffering—George was in a shocking condition; he looked like a bag of bones—he was pinched, haggard and thin; his skin was loose, and he was in a state of collapse; his body was very dirty and his hair verminous; he was moan<lb/>ing and sucking at his fingers ravenously—I examined his fingers and found them raw, through continual sucking—his toe nails were growing into his flesh, and his body was excoriated through not being properly cleaned—he was a pitiful object; the glands of his neck were swollen the sue of pigeons' eggs—Winifred was in a filthy state; her scalp was dirty; she was very thin and sitting on a chair, crying—I said to the prisoner, "Why have you allowed these children, especially George, to get into this shocking condi<lb/>tion? why did you not call in a doctor?"—she replied, "I was going to take him to the hospital next week; he was a fine child six weeks ago; I know I</p>

I go out about 9 at night, and do not return till 12 or 1"—she said she did a little charing—I fetched a relieving officer and a doctor; the children were removed to the hospital, where I weighed them—Ethel weighed 62lb.; the normal weight should be about 105lb.—George weighed 16lb.; his normal weight should be about 35lb.—Winifred weighed 11Â½lb.; the normal weight should be about 24lb.—George died on the 31st.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the secretary of Cooper's Stores, 246, Stockwell Road—Campbell worked for me temporarily last year for two or three months—I engaged him again on June 25th this year at 30s. a week—he gave me to understand that he had clerical work to do on Saturday evenings, and it was arranged that he could go earlier on those evenings—that is the only other work I know of that he had to do—his duties were ordinary clerical work, assisting principally in balancing up—we balance on June 30th—when helping to balance up he would only have access to such cheque books of the firm as I gave him—on June 25th I gave him specially for entering the credits this cheque-book which I hold in my hand—when he had done with it he would hand it back to me, and I would lock it up in the safe—the ordinary cheques are now exhausted, but they were not then—the only other person having access to the cheque-book was Mr. Cooper, jun., who kept one set of keys, and I the other; he is the shopwalker of that particular branch—Campbell was in our employ on June 26th and 27th, but he did not come on the 28th and 29th, the Thursday and Friday—on June 28th I received a cheque from the company's bank, the London and South-western Brixton branch—I went to the bank in the ordinary way to ask for the pass-book, and on going through it I discovered this cheque "A" for £19 17s., debited to my account, and purporting to be signed in my name in two places—in one place it says "Pay cash"—it is also signed by Mr. John Cooper, one of the directors; it is in favour of Mr. J.J. Chapman, and endorsed in the name of Chapman; it came from the book that the prisoner had—I have the counterfoil here—three counterfoils were torn out which were not filled in; it is unmistakably a forgery—the counterfoils are not here; the whole page has been abstracted—when I saw this cheque I recognised it as a forgery; its number shows which cheque-book it came from—when I looked at the cheque-book I discovered that a whole page, the last but two, had been abstracted; it was in the condition in which it appears to-day—if the cheque had not come back, and if no one had told us of one being missing, we should not have noticed the fact, because</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190009110095"/>
               <p>the leaves of the book would be quite close, there being other pages used—I was not present the whole time—when Campbell returned to work on the Saturday I taw him about 10 o'clock on that Saturday morning—he was absent on the Thursday and Friday without leave—when I saw him on Saturday he was in the office, and was with the bank manager, Mr. Cooper, jun., and the detective—he did not give any explanation why he had not come on the Thursday and Friday, but I think it was on Thursday night I received a post-card from him stating that he was unwell, and unable to attend, and that he hoped to be able on the following days to make up for his absence, but he failed to put in an appearance—I went to his house, but found him away, and not ill—I think the explanation he gave as to where he had been on the Thursday and Friday was that he had been to the races—when I formed the opinion that the cheque was in Campbell's writing, the configuration of the sevens appealed to me most—it is countersigned by the secretary, but that is a forgery—my name appears on it twice, once to the words "Pay cash," which practically neutralised the crossing, and it is an alteration which banks would pass—Campbell, from being in our service last year, might have noticed this—the document in my hand is in Campbell's hand<lb/>writing, but there are figures on it which are not Campbell's; also certain entries in this book which are not his—I have submitted these documents to Mr. Inglis, the expert in handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave the post-card which I received from the prisoner on Thursday to the detective—the writing on the cheque is disguised; the figures mostly lead me to the opinion that they are Campbell's—although the cheque is crossed and I wrote "Pay cash" thereon, I do not remember doing so before with other cheques—I think Campbell would conclude that his putting my signature would be sufficient for the bank, but he would have no precedent as to that beyond the fact that when it was necessary to make an alteration on the body of cheques I have frequently initialled it—the words "Pay cash" are initialled by my full signature—the cheque-book would be given out to Campbell about 9.30 to 10 o'clock, when he came in the morning—when the clerk had finished with the cheque-book I should put it in the safe—Campbell was at the office until 4 o'clock on the Wednesday—I had this cheque-book given back to me on Monday afternoon—I do not remember whether Campbell had the book on Tuesday or Wednesday—I leave the office about 6 o'clock—such books as cash-book and cheque-book, when given to me, I lock up at once; the other books Mr. Cooper, jun., would lock up—if Campbell had the cheque-book on the Tuesday or Wednesday it would be in his possession until 6 k'clock—on the Monday it would have been in his possession from 9.30 till 4 o'clock—including myself, there were three in the office—the documents Campbell was working upon would be on the desk when he went out to dinner—at this particular time I went to lunch before Camp<lb/>bell did, but the proper course for Campbell to adopt if I was away when he went to lunch would have been for him to give the cheque-book to Mr. Cooper, jun.; but I can conceive the book being left on his desk, however—I know it was given back at 4 o'clock on that day—the approximate hour for going to lunch is 1 o'clock—such a thing has happened as all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190009110096"/>
               <p>three of us being out together—it was between 1 and 2 o'clock on the Tuesday or Wednesday when I went to my mid-day meal, and I do not re<lb/>member whether I left Mr. Cooper, jun., or Campbell there—it is not usual to lock the doors when we go out in this way—there are two doors; one leading to the outer staircase, and one to a reserve office—Campbell and a man named Reed were working together—there was nothing to prevent any of our servants coming into the office—there are between 20 and 30 servants in our employ—the staircase belongs to us, and leads to the ground floor—there are shops on the ground floor, which are sub-let, and people could obtain access to our office through the shops without finding any locked door in their way—the cheque-book was about half unused—I looked at it on the Tuesday or Wednesday, but not to critically examine it, and I also looked at it on the Monday—my attention was called to the fact of the cheque being missing from the book by the cheque being presented—I cannot say of my own knowledge when those cheques were taken out of the book, but on the Monday I gave the book to Campbell, believing it to be perfectly intact—on the Tuesday those cheques were abstracted from it—I had no occasion to critically examine it on the Monday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am the only person who had access to the cheque-book, and two other clerks—the other clerk had been in my employ about a year—it is difficult to remember whether I went out and left the office door unlocked and nobody there on this occasion, but it would be very unusual for me to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of Cooper's Stores—my father is managing director—I remember Campbell being engaged temporarily, and his being absent on the Thursday and Friday; I remember his arriv<lb/>ing on Saturday about 9.30—I did not hear him then give any explanation as to his absence directly I saw him in the second office—I went down the road to find Police-sergeant Hawkins, Mr. Styles, the bank manager, and Mr. Bird, the cashier—I had previously placed the matter in the hands of Sergeant Hawkins—I do not know that Camp<lb/>bell saw me pass through the office, because my business is downstairs—when I returned I sent the sergeant up one staircase and I ran up another—at the corner of Stockwell Road there is really only one proper entrance, but there are two staircases—I found Campbell at the bottom of one of those staircases—to get there he must have passed through a confectioner's shop (Stunley's), and so gone into the street—he ran away, and I ran after and stopped him at the corner of Bellefields Road, about 50 yards off—he was not running rapidly—I had called out to one of my men, who also took up the chase.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When Campbell came on the Saturday I believe he went in the usual way to the office in which he worked—I was probably gone five minutes to fetch the policeman—through the confectioner's shop might have been the shortest way, but the employees had no right to go through the shop, which was only the shortest way from the foot of the staircase—the back staircase leads into the yard, but it would not be necessary to go through the confectioner's shop to get to the yard, where there is a urinal.</p>

I live at 19, High Street, Pontypridd, and am a widow—I was present at Calvary Baptist Chapel, Wood Road, near Pontypridd, on February 16th, 1876, when the prisoner married my sister, Margaret Lane, who is in Court—he then worked in a brick-yard, and lived at Wood Road, Pontypridd—I cannot read the certificate—they lived next door to my mother and father for a few months—after that I believe they went to Cardiff—when I went there to see her I found her husband had left her—that was 10 years afterwards—I last saw the prisoner five years ago at Cardiff—I did not speak to him—he had then left his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were also present at the marriage my father and a lady, who gave them away—both are dead, and the gentleman who married them is dead; that is Mr. Powell, the Registrar—I swear I was present—my sister had one illegitimate child before she was married, and another one, which died—I never heard that the prisoner's parents objected to the marriage—my sister did not frequent public-houses, or I should have known it; that is a lie, whoever said it—she was not friendly with other men—they went to live at Glastonbury—I know nothing of their affairs—she did not live with me; I had enough to do to keep myself—I have nine sisters—my sister, Mrs. Knight, did not keep a brothel; that is a lie—the next time I saw my sister was when I went to fetch her from Cardiff about October, 1888—the prisoner left her with a nice home; he was all right, but very fond of rambling by night, or else he was very good to her.</p>

On August 16th I was called to this yard on the Surrey Canal about 10 p.m.—I found the prosecutor dying on his back on the bank opposite the barge <hi rend="italic">Faith,</hi> bleeding from a wound on his right breast—he was unconscious—I sent for a doctor, who arrived and attended to the wound—I then went on the barge <hi rend="italic">Faith</hi> and went down into the hold and saw the prisoner there—I told her I should take her into custody for stabbing the man that was lying on the bank—she said, "I never had a knife; I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it with my hands; he had no right on my barge"—I took her to the station—she was charged with wounding Shilling—she said, "That man Paris was never there; the only man there was a tall, dark man"—the prosecutor was apparently sober—I saw no broken bottles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She said at once that the tall, dark man tried to cut the rope and cast the barge adrift—on the way to the station she said that she never used a knife—I could not find the prisoner in the cabin, and went through the partition into the hold—I saw several barges, but on the opposite side—I sent for Dr. Bell—I searched the barge, but did not find any knife—the night was very hot—I have been in the neigh<lb/>bourhood four years—it is not rough, only working people.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Medical Superintendent of the Camberwell Infirmary—on August 16th I saw Shilling at the infirmary about 11.30—he was admitted at 10.55—he was suffering from shock, the result of loss of blood and fright at a wound he had received in the chest, about midway between the right nipple and the end of the chest bone, about 1 1/2, in. long, partly over the rib and partly over the intercostal space between the ribs, at one part a little more 1/4 in. deep—it was in a dangerous region, and my assistant, Dr. Garrett Anderson, as directed, put two stitches in—it was a clean cut wound—there was no bruise—my experience led me to the conclusion that it was an incised wound from some sharp instrument—he smelt of beer, but he was not drunk—I Have never beard of nor seen a wound like it caused by a ring, and with that amount of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The man is well—he is a nervous man—he was prac<lb/>tically well on the 23rd, when he took his own discharge—he was an in<lb/>patient—if he had fallen on glass bottles I think there would have been more bruising—there had merely been a pad put on when I saw it—Miss Anderson reported the case as admitted, and requested me to see him—he was conscious—she saw him at 11 p.m.</p>
