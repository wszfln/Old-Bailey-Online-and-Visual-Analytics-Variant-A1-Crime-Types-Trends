            . I have seen the Prisoner at our Shop before she brought this Piece of Goods; I believe she might bring some odd trifling Things of her own before, but I cannot be positive. - I stopped her when she brought this, because I thought it a Thing of too much Consequence for her to be the Owner of. I asked her how she came by it, and she said the Person she had it of was gone into Chancery-Lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Mother. A Fellow-Servant of my Daughter's gave her this Piece of Cloth to pawn, and she unfortunately carried it to pawn. I believe she had no Suspicion that she came dishonestly by it. She lived Fellow-Servant with her. She is a French Woman, her Name is Crushee. My Daughter came to me, and the Person called upon her while I was in the Room. - I think it was on Saturday was three Weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know this Woman brought this Piece of Cloth to your Daughter?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Mother. My Daughter had been out at Service, and had been come Home but three Days. I know that Woman has brought several Things to her.</p>

               <p>- Charlton. I was in my own Shop over-against Mr Carr's, and saw the Prisoner lift up a Blue Cloth, which lay over these Stockings, and take a Parcel of them away, and put them under a ragged Sort of an Apron. I called out, Carr, Carr, There is a Fellow has got some of your Goods away. I did not run after him, because I had no Body with me in the Shop, but he was pursued, and taken in Princes-street.</p>
               <p>- Weldon. I saw the Prisoner run along with a Bundle of Stockings, and just by my Door he dropped them. I called out to some People to stop him, and they did stop him, and the Prosecutor came up and seized him. - I believe this to be the same Bundle that he dropped, for I was just by when he was taken.</p>
               <p>Carr. My Wife picked the Stockings up in the Street, and I ran after him, went up to him, and took him hold by the Collar; by that Time there were some other Persons about him, and he said, Gentlemen, take Care what you do, don't use me ill.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time was this?</p>
               <p>Carr. As high as I can tell it was between two and three o'Clock in the Afternoon.</p>

               <p>A Witness. Mr Read told me, that he believed the Boy would never have told him, only upon the Account of his losing the 10 s. - that the Boy was frightened at his losing the 10 s. or else he had not known any Thing of the Matter.</p>
               <p>Another Witness. I lived about 18 Years next Door to the Prisoner's Parents; they were very honest industrious People, and I never heard any Ill of the Prisoner before.</p>
               <p>Another Witness. I worked for his Father as soon as he was born, and never heard any Ill of him before; he lived at home till he was about 14 Years of Age; he has been out about 5 Years; he was a Turn-over to the Prosecutor. <rs id="t17430413-5-verdict30" type="verdictDescription">

            . The Prisoner came into my Shop the 23d of March, and asked to see some China-Basons, and bid Money for one; and as the Person that served her looked another Way, she took an Opportunity, as it is imagined, to conceal one under her Cloak; she went to the next China-Shop to see some Plates, and while the Person that served her went to take some Things off the Shelf, she took a China-Dish. My Bason was found upon her; my Neighbour came to me, and asked me, If she had bought a China-Bason of me: I said, No: says he, I took this Bason from her. - This is my Bason; here is my own Hand-writing upon it; I am sure I had it in my Shop that Day.</p>

               <p>Mackenzie. I am a Milliner by Trade, and live in Tower-street, facing a Cheese-Monger's. - I have lived there ever since before last Christmas. - There is a Silk-Soowerer lives at next Door. - I do not keep a Shop, I work in my own Apartment; my Sister and I live together.</p>

            . On the 23d of March, the Prisoner at the Bar came into my Shop, and asked for some enamelled China Plates. I turned my Back to her, and took some off the Shelf; I showed them her, and told her the Price; she said they were a great deal too dear; I told her I could not take much less. She said she must have them cheaper, for she had broke three of a Gentlewoman's Plates, and that the Gentlewoman said they cost her 4 s. said I, you had better give the four Shillings to the Person; she stood humming and hawing and would not stir; said I, Good Woman, you had better go away; says she, look a little farther; said I, Prithee go about your Business, and I espied under her Arm something of China; thinks I, she may have been somewhere else and bought some. When she was got two or three Steps from the Counter, said I, Mistress, What have you got there? So I took hold of her, and saw my own Dish. I was almost frightened to Death. Said I, Oh, you Bold Face, you have got my Dish. I called up my Servant, and said, This Bold-Face has stole my Dish. She wanted to put the Dish down; I took the Dish from under her Arm; she had a short Cloak over it. I was glad to get my Dish, and I let her go. Says some Body, have you lost nothing else? Says the Boy, I will run after her and see; so he went over the Bridge as far as the Pastry-Cook's; says he, I am come to see whether you have any Thing else of my Mistress's; and she and the Bason were brought back to my Shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Dish lay upon the Counter; I did take the Dish up in my Hand, but with no Intent to steal it, or of covering it, but my Short-Cloak fell down over it, and the Gentlewoman thought I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174304130007"/> was going to steal it; says she, What are you going to steal my Dish? and took it from me.

               <p>Jury. Had he no Pocket?</p>
               <p>Mascall. No, he had no Pocket at all; the Sugar would have fell through between his Coat and Waistcoat if he had gone far. When I laid hold of him he seemed to be in a Fit, or drunk, or not well, and was very rustical, and I was obliged to get a Cart to carry him. He would not acknowledge any thing till he found he was mastered, and I had got him into the Cart; and then he said he had got the Sugar under Botolph's-Wharf Gateway. - He is a Person that goes about the Keys to pilfer what he can.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that?</p>
               <p>Mascall. I know it very well, he was in the House of Correction two or three Days before that for the same Practices. - He owned he took it out of the Warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he an Opportunity of doing that?</p>
               <p>Mascall. The Cooper's Servants go into the Warehouses to draw the Casks for Samples for Sale; and I do apprehend they might leave the Doors open, and that he might get in that Way, - they are very apt to leave the Doors open. <rs id="t17430413-7-verdict45" type="verdictDescription">

In the Night between the Sixth and the Seventh of December, I lost three Cart-Wheels, they were found upon the Prisoner's Premises, in a Stable belonging to him; - he lives in a Place called Bagnell's-Marsh, by Black-Mary's-Hole: I am sure they are mine; I went into his House; my Man was along with me, and he called for a Pint of Beer; I saw some Wood burning on the Fire, and asked him, where he got that Wood? he said, he would not tell me; I told him, I would make him tell me; I went into the Stable and found two of my Wheels knocked to Pieces, and the third laid down ready to be broke; they were old Wheels - one was my own, and the other two were left in my Custody, so that I was obliged to make them good - I do not know whether they were marked or not.</p>

            . My Master having lost some Wheels, he desired I would go along with him to see if we could track the Wheels; we tracked them to the Prisoner's Yard, and my Master bid me go forward; I went in and called for a Pint of Two-penny; the Prisoner opened the Door, and there was a Couple of the Spokes of the Wheels upon the Fire; my Master asked him where he got the Wood, and threatened to take him up; he would not tell him, and said, he did not value Mr Sims, and that no Body should take him without a Constable. I said, Mr Clarke, as you are one of the Trade, I would not have you be a Scandal to the Trade: I saw the Iron Streakes of the Wheels which were knocked to Pieces, and there were Marks upon the Streakes which my Master could swear to.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know these Streakes belonged to your Master?</p>
               <p>Grub. I am positive they were my Master's Wheels, I will take my Oath of it before your Lordship - one belongs to my Master, and the others belongs to another Person, a Hog-Butcher, (calling him by his Name) you have heard of him my Lord.</p>
               <p>Jury. I should be glad to know where these Wheels were when they were taken away?</p>

               <p>Sims. I saw the Tracks from my very Gate, all the Way, to the Prisoner's Yard. - They stood close to the Gate in my Yard.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mine is an open Yard, I have no Fence, any Body might bring them there.</p>
               <p>Sims. The Stable they were in opens to this open Yard; I do not know whether it was locked or open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Son did put something upon the Fire, but I do not know any Thing how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Why did not you prosecute him sooner?</p>
               <p>Sims. I got a Warrant to take him up, but I could not light of him; here is a Letter which he sent to me desiring me to be favourable; he confessed the taking of the Wheels before the Justice, and said, he hoped I would be merciful to him and have Compassion on his Children. -</p>
               <p>Grub. I was not before the Justice, I did not hear him mention whether he took them or no.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I do not know that I said any such Thing, if I did I was suddled; I had a Friend came to me, and they had given me a little Drink, and that is a Thing I do not accustom myself to.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner's Maid. I am a hired Servant to the Prisoner, I have 50 s. a Year; he was taken ill that Night and went to Bed before it was dark - that very Night the Wheels were brought into the Yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remember it was the Night when the Wheels were brought there?</p>
               <p>The Maid. Because they were taken away the next Day - my Master did not continue in Bed all the next Day, he got up about Nine o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he have got out of Bed and have gone out in the Night without your knowing of it.</p>
               <p>The Maid. One of the Children was sick with him, and I sat up all Night with him and his Child - that very Night before Mr Sims came and found the Wheels in the Yard - I never saw the Wheels; the Prisoner has seven small Children.</p>

            . On the 27th of February, about a Quarter after Seven, I went Home in a Coach, it was dark; and as I was getting out of the Coach, I saw a Boy loitering about, and asked him what he did there; he said he came to get some Water; and when I came to step into the House, I saw one of the Parlour Windows below Stairs was open, and two Cases of Silver-handled Knives and Forks stand in a Chair, ready to be taken away. I called to the Hackney Coachman, but he was gone. They had taken away two Cases of Silver-handled Knives and Forks. - There are two Lamps in the Yard. I saw the Parlour Window open before I got to the Door of the House. - The Prisoner was taken and denied the Fact. - He threatened to beat this Boy because he offered to discover him.</p>

               <p>Josias Taylor. On Tuesday the 16th of November. I had a pretty deal of Business to do; and towards the Evening I ordered one of my Servants to hang the Doors on. I desired him to get what he could ready on Tuesday Night, in order to be sent into the Country the next Morning. - The Doors were shut; there is a Sash-Window on each Side of the Door, and Grates before them, which were fastened to the House. - I had 120 Pound Weight of Chocolate brought from the Office, which had been sent there to be stamped. It was brought in on the Saturday; and the Monday before the Tuesday Night on which this happened, it was put in the Window to dry, because it is damp when it comes from the Office. - It lay about two Foot from the Window. My Man was in the Shop heading two or three Barrels, and I was in the Compting-House; I saw the Chocolate fall down, and did not know but it might be the heading of the Barrels that might have disturbed it. My Man presently went to the Door, then came and called me, and told me that I had been robbed. When I came, I found that there was 26 Pound of Chocolate taken away, and the Grate was likewise taken away, and thrown into the Street, which I did not find till about two Hours afterwards. There was a Coachman going into the Green-Dragon Inn, his Horses would not go along, which was occasioned by the Grate lying in the Street, which the Coachman took up and carried into the Inn-Yard. At last seeing a good many People looking at something, I went to see what it was, and found the Grate lying in the Inn-Yard. The Chocolate was sold to one

            . I saw the Prisoner at Mr Meckwold's Window, on the 24th of February, about Seven o'Clock in the Evening; he met a Woman and immediately turned about, and as soon as she was past, he jumped up to the Rail, took down the Blind of the Window and put his Head and Arms in at the Window; my Husband went down Stairs directly in order to catch him, and just as he was going out at the Door, the Prisoner jumped off the Rail and crossed to our Side of the Way, to our Door. - I am sure he is the Man that put his Head and Arms into Mr Meckwold's House.</p>

               <p>Smart. The Blind is fastened with a little Bolt which shoots into the Frame of the Window.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was bolted at Seven o'Clock?</p>
               <p>Smart. I am sure it was bolted at that Time - I am sure it was bolted all Day; I am very sensible the Prisoner opened it; my Lady and my Master went out, and I am sure neither of them went into the Parlour; I bolted it in the Morning, and I think I can safely say it was bolted all Day, because there was no Body to open it, unless I had unbolted it myself.</p>

               <p>Q. The Question is, Whether, when he pushed the Sash up, the Blind must not fall down.</p>
               <p>Goddard. It cannot fall by the lifting up of the Sash; but it stood safe against the Side of the Window.</p>

Brown said they were his; said I, Mr Constable, I insist upon it, that you take Care of them and the Prisoner; Mr James was not very ready to take Charge of Brown; then I resolved to have him before my Lord-Mayor; I said, I would go and smoak a Pipe till my Lord-Mayor was at Leisure; and we went to the White-Lion-Tavern, in White-Chapel; while we were there, said I to John Brown, you had these Flannels somewhere; if you came honestly by them, you will tell me where you had them; and if you are an honest Man, you will give me an honest Answer.

Then he said, Damn you, Sir, I had these from Dublin. Now I knew where the Flannels chiefly came from, and that there are very few which come from thence. When he was examined before my Lord-Mayor, he said he had them from one Brown, a Correspondent of his in Lancashirt, but my Lord threatening to commit him, he said, My Lord, if you will not commit me to Jail, I will tell you the Truth; then he said he had them at a Court in Threadneedle-street, of the Gentleman's Servant. - He owned he had them of my Servant, the other Prisoner; who, being sensible of his Guilt, confessed the Fact with Tears. He owned he had taken, at different Times, about eleven or twelve Pieces, which he had sold to this Brown; he said he sold them for 15 Shillings a Piece, two of them were worth 12 or 13 d. per Yard; and two of them about Eight-pence half-penny per Yard; the lowest priced Flannel we have is Eight-pence half-penny per Yard.

            . I put the Money into a Box last Saturday in the Afternoon, between four and five o'Clock. There was one 6 l. 15 s. Piece, two 36 s. Pieces, two Queen Anne's Guineas, one King William and Queen Mary's Guinea, and two King George's Guineas, and one Half-Guinea; it was in my Mistress's (Mrs Bates's) House, and was her Money, but I cannot say the Prisoners took it. The Linnen, &amp;c. was taken out of a Trunk, but I do not know any thing of their taking it. - I do not know whether the Trunk was there between four and five that Afternoon. - It is about a Fortnight since I opened it. About three or four of the Clock on Sunday Morning, we had Notice given by the Watch, that the Door of the House was open, and we found that the Prisoners, who lived in the House, were gone, and, upon a Search, the Money and the Linnen were missing -

About Nine o'Clock on Sunday Morning, Mrs Bates sent to let me know, that she was robbed by one of my Servants, (she is a Bed-ridden Woman and cannot stir) and that my Servant lay with her Apprentice, and that they were both gone; I bid her be easy, and said, I did not fear but I should lay hold of them presently, and about Twelve o'Clock on Sunday, I found them drunk and in Bed, at the Bull, at Tottenham-high-Cross; when I charged them with the Fact, they fell into a Flood of Tears, and said, they were sorry for what they had done; like those unhappy People who are detected; I desired them to make Satisfaction to this Woman, upon which they readily gave me a Pocket, in which was one five Moidore Piece, one 36 s. Piece, 2 Guineas, and 41 Shillings in Silver; I asked them, Whether that was all; they said, Yes, there is all: Said I, Mrs Bates says you have taken more; they said, there was no more: Said I, Be ingennous, do do not conceal any Thing, it will be the worse for you if you do: They said, there was no more Money; I asked for the Linnen, and they said it was given to a Woman to wash; I went to the Woman for it, and she delivered it; it was in a miserable nasty Pickle; it is not fit to be seen in Court; said I, You took it away clean, how came it in this Condition? They said, they had the Misfortune to let it fall in a Ditch; I asked them, how they came at the Money; Ellard said, she did not know how Cannon came by it; and that she brought it to her. I have known Ellard a great while, and did not think but that she had been very honest.</p>

Mr Sanders came to me on Sunday, and told me of a Robbery that was committed on a poor old Woman of his Acquaintance, and desired I would go along with him to endeavour to find out the Thieves; I went with him to the Sign of the Black-Bull, at Tottenham-high-Cross; we made what Haste we could for Fear they should be gone; and when we came there, made what Haste we could up Stairs, and found them both in Bed, and desired they would return the Money which they had taken from Mrs Bates, and without any Hesitation at all they returned the Money, as related by the former Witness; I was with them several Times afterwards, and they did not deny it: I asked the little one (Cannon) how it came into her Head; she said, It came into her Head as it did into other People's Heads, and that she had a Design to do it some Time before she committed the Fact.</p>
               <p>Cannon had no Witnesses, and Ellard said, she had none but her Master Sanders, who said, he never knew any Thing amiss of her before. <rs id="t17430413-19-verdict123" type="verdictDescription">

He said he had good Luck, that he found it by Hyde-Park-Corner, and wanted to sell it. I agreed to buy it of him; I did not know where to weigh it, so I went to a Founder's on Snow-Hill, a Mistress of mine, who I knew had Weights to weigh Silver; it was weighed there, and I gave him 10s. 6d. for it. It happened some Time afterwards that I wanted some Money, and I carried it to Mr Price, to borrow something upon it; and he said this Spoon is stole. I told him I bought it publickly; he asked me who I bought it of, I told him of a Man who came sometimes to Mr Fairweather's in Hosier-Lane.

            . About a Week before he sold the Spoon to Mr Gerrard, he pulled a Spoon out of his Pocket, and said he found it at Hyde-Park-Corner. - I verily believe this to be the Spoon.</p>
               <p>Mr Price.

I looked back to the Advertisements, and found an Advertisement of the 30th of March, of a Spoon being lost, with the Crest, a Catherine-Wheel and Cross. Said I, This Spoon is stole, but I would not give you any Trouble, as I believe you to be very honest, and have lived so long in the Parish. The Person to be applied to was one Mr Langton in Lombard-Street; when I carried him the Spoon, he laid me down 10 s. Sir, said I. Do you think I do this for the sake of the Reward? I will not deliver it till I see whether I can find out the Thief.

            . On the 26th of February, being Saturday Night, I had been at a Publick-House and came from thence between nine and ten o'Clock, (as I always keep good Hours) and between eleven and twelve I locked the Door, and went up to Bed; and between that and the Hour of Six in the Morning this was done. - I am a Lodger, and work in the House; I have worked for Mr Reynolds some Years. - The Door that was broke open is an outward Door upon a Public Stair-Case; there are a great many Tenements in the House, but the Street-Door was not locked. - I did not hear any Thing broke open, for I had drank a Pint of Beer more than ordinary, and might be heavy to sleep; but I am sure I locked the Door before I went to Bed. One of these Pickers is mine, this Shuttle and this Picker is Jeffery Rushton's.</p>

            . The Prisoner delivered these two Pair of Pickers into my Hand, he said this large Pair cost him half a Crown, and the other a Shilling, and desired I would give them to Mr Lister, and desire him to lay them up for him, for they were his working Tools.</p>
               <p>Burridge. And please you my Lord, this Man. Rushton, and I, were drinking together till Ten o'Clock on Saturday Night; he said he had no Money, and desired me to lend him a Shilling, and he delivered these Pickers into my Hand.</p>
               <p>Q To Rushton. In what Manner, was the Door broke open?</p>
               <p>Rushton. Either the Staple was pushed back, or the Lock was picked, the Staple was half bent, there was nothing broke; just at duskish, I went to Bed, and then I saw the Door was locked, I was sick that Night. - The Prisoner lodged in the same House.</p>

            . On a Friday Night, the latter End of January - I cannot tell the Day of the Month, I and Cropp and Anderson and Bradshaw, went out with an Intent to rob some Body, and going down Northern Falgate, Cropp saw Beaumont at his Door - he knew him. There's Beaumont, says Cropp, his Father has been dead about a Fortnight, and he has got a Watch, and if we can get that it will be a good Booty. Cropp said, He is drunk; and I believe he was a little in Liquor: Beaumont went out, and we followed him him up Shoreditch, and all the Way to Hoxton, and there we lost him; I suppose he went into some House; we waited some Time but could not see him; two or three Hours afterwards we met him by Chance, in Hog-Lane, and he was singing. D - n you, says Cropp, there's Beaumont again; and he gave me a Stick and bid me knock him down; and accordingly I did knock him down; I did not care to strike him any more for fear of killing him; Cropp took the Stick from me and gave him two or three Blows more, and then snatched off his Hat and Wig and run away with it.</p>

               <p>Warman. I believe it was about twelve o'Clock at Night; Beaumont was very much in Liquor; Cropp confessed the Robbery before Colonel De Veil; I believe the Keeper of New-Prison heard him.</p>

            . My Wife missed the Coral on Wednesday the 6th of April; I had been out, and when I came home, my Wife was crying about it; said I, Do not make yourself uneasy we shall find it presently; but not finding it, I advertised it; and on Thursday I was sent for by a Silversmith, who keeps a Shop by Clare-Market; says he, there is one Morris brought such a Coral to my House to know the Value of it, and I told him I would give no more than six Shillings for the Silver; I went to Col. De Veil to get a Warrant for this Morris, and went with Mr Trent the next Morning, to the House were he lived; his Wife said he was out, but would be at home about 10 o'Clock; Trent called out, Morris, and one said, he was in Bed; said Morris, So I am: He desired Morris to come to him to Clare-Market, which he did: Says he, Mr Parker says you or I have got a Coral of his, and Morris confessed he took it away: I asked him how he could take it away without being seen? said he, There was no Body in the Kitchen where the Coral was, but the Maid belonging to the House, and when she went out of the Kitchen to do something, I happened to knock my Elbow against a Basket, and hearing the Bells ring, I took and put it into my Pocket; he said, he had pulled the blue String out and gave it to his Wife; the Prisoner sent to his Wife to let her know the Coral was in such a Drawer, and sent Orders for her to deliver it, which she did: he desired not to go before Justice De Veil, so I carried him before Justice Frasier. The Prisoner did not deny it, he said, he was a little in Liquor, or he would not have done it - Morris has sometimes been a Bailiff's Follower.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever think that I could be a Thief?</p>
               <p>Parker. I never thought you to be so; you were the last Man I should have suspected - I take this to be my Coral, it is the Coral that was fetched from the Prisoner's House.</p>

The Morning that Mr Parker had Intelligence of his Coral, he got a Warrant, and desired me to go and find Morris; I went to Mr Trent's and told the Story, and Mr Trent said, I will go to his Room, I am sure he will answer me; that he went and called Morris, and his Wife said, he was not at home; said he, I am sure he is in Bed; says Morris, That's true, so I am; and Mr Trent went with him to an Alehouse in Clare-Market; after they had been there a little while, says Trent, There is something I have to say to you about Parker's Coral; they went to another House, and Morris owned that he was sitting in the Kitchen, and the Maid desired him to rock the Cradle while she went for a Pint of Beer, or something, and that his Arm hit against the Basket and shook it, and he heard the Bells ring, and that he took the Coral and put it into his Pocket; says he, Here is the String of the Coral, and took it out of his Pocket and delivered it up, and said, The Coral is in my Drawer, at the further Corner; I went for it, and the Drawer was opened and there it was, it was rolled up just in the same Manner it is now.</p>
               <p>Parker. He said he was in Necessity and wanted a little Money to get into his Place of a Bailiff, and he said, when he had got this Coral he thought he should not be beholden to any Body, and that was the Reason of his taking it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr Trent had sent me to wait for a Man in Craven's-Buildings, and I found the Coral as I was coming out at a Door, and the next Day when I came to Mrs Parker's she talked of losing a Coral, and said, it was worth a Guinea and an half, and I went to this Goldsmith's to enquire the Value of it, that I might know whether it was her Coral or no; (I put the String into my Pocket) and I advised her to advertise it on Wednesday.</p>

On Sunday the 27th of February, between five and six in the Morning, four fellows rushed forcibly into my House after a Woman, who was at my Door and she said, they threatened to knock her Brain out if she would not let them lie with her. They forced into the Room on the Ground-Floor, where our Bed is, (I did not see them do it) but I know that I catched these two Fellows there: They knocked my Wife down twice, as she tells me - There was nothing found upon them.</p>

            . I had been up all Night with a sickly Child; and on the 27th or 28th of February, between five and six in the Morning, a Woman, who did lodge in the House, came to the Door, and called Mrs Lowrie; I opened the Door and saw four Men behind her Back. I thought they did not look like honest People. They pushed the Door against me, and forcibly came in and said, Come Brother, come in; Come Brother, come in, and they fell a d - g their Eyes and Limbs.

             I live in the House with Mr Philpot; I am a single Man, and lie in the Shop for Conveniency; about Two o'Clock in the Morning, on the fourth of last March, as I lay in Bed, I heard somebody knock at the Door, and presently I heard somebody come padding down Stairs, which I took to be a Man, and then I heard a Whispering and a rustling as I apprehended of a Woman's Cloaths, and I heard him go up Stairs again, and I thought, she had gone up too; presently I heard something squeak, which I thought at first to be a Dog, and then I heard the crying of an Infant several Times: I wondered what could be the Reason of it; this was in the Entry, and very soon after, I heard the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174304130030"/> Child cry at a greater Distance; I could not tell whether it was above, or below, at first; but afterwards, I found it was in the Cellar; I wondered what she should do there, thinks I, she may take it into the Cellar to quiet it, because she will not distrub the Family; by and by I smelt a prodigious Stench from the Excrement, and I did not get up, because I thought, if the Child was in the House of Office, I could not fetch it to Life; some time afterwards; I heard a Woman go up Stairs and draw Water, come down Stairs, and go up again: I was afraid to go out, to see what was the Matter, being a naked Man, for I had no Weapon to defend myself, and did not know, who might be there: About Five o'Clock, I could just discern it Light, and then I went to Mr James's, a Cooper, and told him the Affair, and he came with me, and we searched the Necessary-House, with a long Staff with some Nails at the End of it: I advised her Father of it, and he said, he knew nothing of a Child, for he knew nothing of her Lying in; but he was very willing if there was such a Thing, that it should be brought to a clear Light, and told me, he would enquire into it; which accordingly he did, and she absolutely denied it; he acquainted me with what had passed between them, and he went out about some Business; she sent for me up Stairs, and began to be very robust with me, for aspersing her Character, and said, that she wondered what I meant by it, and the like; and was in a violent Passion with me: I said, I would have the Necessary-House searched, and would not go to sleep till it was done. I went for a Night-Man; I think it was on the Friday, the first Step he took, he moved a Plank which I had moved before, and found nothing there at the first View; then he viewed the Seat of the Necessary-House, and put down a long Fork, or Thing with Prongs, and brought up the Body of an Infant; her Father was with me, when the Child was brought up, out of the Necessary-House.</p>
               <p>Q. What Age did the Child appear to be of?</p>
               <p>Gyles. Those who are Judges took it to be about three Months old;

               <p>Gyles. That was the Journeyman, who let her in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever own any Thing to you, of her bringing in a Child?</p>
               <p>Gyles. No, quite the contrary: - The Child was pulled up by its Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the Child appear?</p>
               <p>Gyles. The Surgeon declared, there were Eleven punctured Wounds in the Head; I did not see the Wounds; the old Gentleman being with me, and in an Agony of Tears, I cannot say, but it moved me prodigiously, that I did not look at the Child, when I heard the Nightman say he had got it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You say, Mr Gyles, you did not know I was with Child, when you knew very well I was with Child, and you are the Person that got the Child.</p>
               <p>Gyles. This is an Accusation entirely false; but however, it is impossible that it can do you any Service; I have spoke the Truth, and nothing but the Truth; if you could lay it to me, Why did not you lay it to me?</p>
               <p>[Mr Alderman Marshall said that he knew Mr Gyles, that he had an opportunity of knowing his Character; that he was an honest, sober Fellow, and always behaved well.]</p>
               <p>Gyles. The Accusation is entirely false; she always denied she was with Child, and People have laughed at her for denying it; when she has gone to Market, the Butchers have said, she should have Things cheaper than another, because she was with Child, and she always said it was Fat.</p>

            . (Nightman) I was sent for by Mr Gyles, to search the Vault for a Child; and when I came there, I found a Board had been taken up, and I could see nothing there; I called for a Piece of Candle and a Bit of Clay and put it down the Seat of the Vault, and saw something lie three or four Inches above the Soil, like a Bundle, and I took a Drag, with three Tynes, (it was about three Foot from the Top of the Seat) I took hold of it with my Drag and put my Right-Hand down and brought it up with my Hand: Says I, Here is the Child; says I, I will see whether it be a Boy or a Girl; I took out a Pin and undid the Clout and found it to be a Girl, and the Child's Feet or Legs were not at all wet; I saw some Blood just by the Side of the Temple, notwithstanding the Soil that was upon it - the Blood appeared thro' the Soil.</p>

               <p>Mr Springate I am an Apothecary.

               <p>About seven o'Clock in the Evening, the third of March, I went to fetch my Child from that Woman's, ( Mrs Belfour ) who had it to nurse, and I believe I staid till about eleven o'Clock, and I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174304130032"/> not to come Home till twelve, because Mr Gyles said by that Time every Body would be in Bed, and he would let me in as he has several Times; I used to give a Knock with my Knuckles under the Window, and that was to give him Notice that it was me, and he has let me in many a Time; this is true, and I could assert it if it was the last Word I had to speak. I went into a House to get a Pint of Drink, in order to pass away the Time, and I had not been in the House above two or three Minutes, before a Man came with a Constable, and used me as if they had a Suspicion, that I had a Design to drop the Child; and there were some People dogged me, but I did not know that then; and they said I must go to the Watch-house, I did not make many Words, but went to the Watch-house, which I believe was between one and two o'Clock, and then the Child began to be uneasy. I said I had no Money (for I knew I had paid the Nurse one Week's Money that Night, and had but three half-pence in my Pocket) says I, if any of these Men will be so kind as to see me Home, I will satisfy them for their Trouble; but they abused me, and made use of a great many bad Expressions, and said I had a Mind to make away with the Child; I said I had no Thoughts of making away with the Child, for all the World knew me to be a tender Mother; and one of the Watchmen gave me such a shove, that I fell down with the Child in my Arms. Said I, Pray do not go to kill me nor the Child neither, for you shall see I will satisfy you; and he took hold of my Arm, and shoved me down again; at the End of Mincing-Lane, and the Marks of the Fall were seen when I was in the Compter; and the Child fell out of my Lap; the Child cried, and the Watchman d - d me for a B - h; and he knocked at the Door twice, before any Body came to open the Door, then Edward Sherrard came down and let me in; I turned my Back towards him, because he should not see the Child; for I was not willing he should see it, and

            . In the Morning about six o'Clock, I heard the Shops opening, and his Shop was opening, and he did not use to open so very early. - This was before six in the Morning; I enquired after Mr Gyles, and the Man told me he was gone to the Keys to take a Walk. I did not know but he might be gone to get a Nurse for the Child, for he was to have provided a Nurse for it, and that was the Reason of my taking it from that Woman, and the Child was to go down into Wales; Pray did not I tell you so, Mrs Belfour?</p>
               <p>Mrs Belfour. Yes, you did say so to be sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I used to get the Money of him for the Child, and always paid her for the Child, for it was always a Pleasure to me to take Care of what was born of my Body.</p>
               <p>Mrs Belfour. Indeed you always paid me very justly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took the Child away from the other Nurse, because it was almost starved.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of the Child's going down to a Person in Wales; What was the Reason of that?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr Gyles bid me say so. I got the Money form Mr Gyles, and I used to make and mend, and wash his Linnen; I had nothing else to provide for, being in a good Father's House. - After I had given Gyles the Child, I went up Stairs and fell asleep; but I was to have been in his Room all Night, and to have gone out with the Child the next Morning. In the Morning about eleven o'Clock, my Father told me there was a fine Story raised of me; that I had made away with my Child. Said he, I did not know you had a Child; says he, Mr Gyles tells me you had a Child which you brought in last Night, and that you put it down the House of Office. I said to my Father, he cannot say that to my Face surely; says my Father, If you know yourself to be innocent, you must clear up the Point. I said I will very readily do that. I believe my Father did not know I had a Child, nor none of the Family, except my Mother, and to be sure she did. Says my Father to Mr Gyles, Sure this Thing cannot be true, you will not be so base as to say so? Yes, says he, I will, and I will take my Oath of it upon twenty Bibles. My Father said, if such a Thing was done, it would be better for me to go out of the Way; and if I had done it, if I had not known myself innocent, I would have gone.

I asked her what she must have for it, she said I should allow her what I thought proper, and I allowed her three Half-Crowns for it I did buy something else of her, but nothing belonging to the Owners of these Things.

               <p>To this it was answered, That by the Act, 6 Anne c. 17. they were to assume that Title on the 29th of September 1708, which was the Day preceeding the Date of the Bond in Question; provided the Lord Godolphin should by that Time settle his Award between the two Companies.</p>

The Council would then have gone on to prove the Fraud, in relation to the other three Bonds; but the Jury not having found the several Sums due, or paid, for the Principal and Interest on each Bond, but one general Sum upon the whole, the Defendants were <rs id="t17430413-45-verdict275" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am near thirteen Years of Age; last Thursday I saw the Prisoner go by our House, between one and two o'Clock, to a Vault belonging to Mr. Burkit at Chelsea, with something under her Petticoat; about a Quarter of an Hour afterwards, I saw her come back with something in her Lap, but it was not quite so big as it was before; she had a Stick in her Hand, which was clean when she went, and when she came back it was soiled. I went to the Vault soon after, and saw some Drops of Blood upon the Seat, and I heard something blubber in the Vault. I came Home directly, and told my Mother; my Mother said some Child had been there and cut their Fingers.</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Wootton (the Girl's Mother, repeated what the Child had told her). I went to the Vault myself, and there was a little Blood upon the Seat, and the Soil looked as if it had been disturbed. At Night I told an old Gentlewoman of it, that lives in the House, and the next Morning we searched the Vault, and found something that seemed to be hard and heavy; I went for a Pair of Tongs, and happened to take hold of a Child's Arm; when I saw the Child, I squalled out, and let the Child drop down again into the Vault. The Child was taken out stark naked. I did not perceive any Marks of Violence. - I live next Door but one to the Prisoner, and observed before, that she seemed to be big. I have heard she has a Husband.</p>

            . On Friday last, I was sent for to the Coach and Horses in Chelsea, opposite to the College-Wall; Mrs Wotton brought a Child to me, which she said she had taken out of a Vault, and desired I would search it; there were no Marks of Violence; it had the Navel String three Times round its Neck, so that it was impossible the Child could be born alive.</p>
               <p>Mr. King, the Coroner. I would ask her whether she had any Discourse with the Prisoner about disposing of the Child, and what her Confession was.</p>
               <p>Andrews. Last Sunday, the Overseers sent for me to come to the Workhouse, to meet another Midwife, to search the Prisoner. I asked her how she did, and said, I hope you have no Milk in your Breast; she cried: Said I, it does not signify any Thing to cry, tell me how it was. She owned the having the Child, but said she did not kill it, indeed I did not lay violent Hands on it. She said she was in Bed, and had the Belly-ach, and after two Pains, the Child was born; and her Husband being away from her several Years, she was ashamed of its being discovered, and she laid the Child under the Bed; and on Thursday Morning, before it was light, she put it into the Vault - She said she did not observe any Body see her do it, and that she went that Thursday with a Stick, because she had seen part of it, and took the Stick to push is down with. That the Friday before she was delivered,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174304130039"/> she was helping a Man down with a Bushel and they fell upon her Belly, and she nev hold stir afterwards; that she thought Weeks to go - She said she some Things for the Child, and that such a Room; I went with her and so. there. - These are the Things. - Though to dress a Child. - I think she was her full Time.</p>

            , with a Draught of 117 l. 13 s. on Messieurs Honeywood and Fuller, which he received, and set down the Particulars; just as he put it into the Shovel, and held it in his Hand upon the Counter, the Prisoner came into the Shop, with two Spanish Doubloons, as I apprehended, to sell; I weighed them, and thought the most ready Way, as he did not understand English, was to shew him what I would give him for them, which was six Guineas and six Shillings; and I laid the Money upon the Counter; he did not take this Money which I offered him, but went to the other End of the Counter, where the Shovel full of Money was, and took up a handful and separated them; there were 36 Shilling Pieces, and some Moidores; I thought he understood that Money better, so I ordered Arnold to give him the Money out of the Shovel; he said he could not pay him out of that Money, but he gave him three 36 s. and I gave him a Guinea and three Shillings; still I could not keep his Hand out of the Shovel, he had it in several Times: He pointed to his Knees, as much as to say he wanted a Pair of Knee-Buckles, he had no Buckles to his Knees: I pulled out the Drawer, he took out a Pair, I weighed them, and asked him eight Shillings for them, he said he would give me six Shillings. - He spoke a little broken, but he said six Shillings as plain as I do now; I said I would take no less than eight Shillings. A neighbouring Goldsmith came by, and gave me a Caution, for he said he had been in his Shop just before, and he suspected him. Just as he was going out of the Shop, he said he would give me seven Shillings, and went away. I took three Thirty-six Shillings, and gave them to Arnold to put into the Shovel. Now, says I, your Money is right, or should be right. I bid him tell it, and asked him if he had not taken any; he said there were four missing; he told it twice before I offered to go after him I thought I should light of him about Exchange Alley, but I did not: About an Hour afterwards I lighted of him, in Beavers-Marks, in Dukes-Place, in a Room with five or six more Jews. I took hold of him, and charged him with it; he seemed frightened, and said, as they told me, if I would be quiet, and make no Disturbance, he would return me the Money. I sent Home for my Master, he brought a Constable, and we had him before my Lord-Mayor.</p>

             confirmed every Circumstance of the former Evidence; and said he received at Mr. Honeywood's and Comp. 117 l. 13 s. viz. seventy-five Moidores, nine Thirty-six Shillings, and four Shillings, that he told the Money twice immediately after the Prisoner was gone, and missed four Moidores; that no Body else had been in the Shop; that the Money was never from him, nor the Shovel out of his Hand.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner (by his Interpreter) said, that he did not care to take Guineas, and only pointed to the Shovel; that he never touched the Shovel, nor any more Money than they gave him; that he did not know what they came to him about, till they came before my Lord Mayor; that he supposed it was a Fraud among the Servants, and so they laid t upon him.</p>
